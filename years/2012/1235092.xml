<AbstractNarration>The research objective of this grant is to fundamentally understand the thermodynamic driving forces and kinetic mechanisms leading to the formation of lithium metal dendrites in Li-batteries.  One of the most significant challenges for Li-ion battery design is the prevention of Li-dendrite growth, which would allow faster charging for current Li-ion battery technology and the use of Li metal anodes for future "beyond Li-ion batteries."  A computational model based on the phase-field method will be developed to predict the conditions for dendrite growth and morphological changes with input thermodynamic, mechanical and kinetic parameters from atomistic/first principles calculations and experimental measurements.  The proposed model will be based on a nonlinear kinetics in which the dependence of the rate of changes of a phase-field parameter is nonlinear with respect to the thermodynamic driving force, and hence it is applicable to modeling the microstructure evolution under large overpotentials or high charging rates.  One of the key parameters is the Li metal/electrolyte interface energy, which will be directly computed by connecting DFT calculations and liquid thermodynamic data.  This three-year grant will lead to (1) fundamental understanding of the transport and chemical kinetics of dendrite formation and growth and their relationships to their solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) film properties and (2) the development of a physics-based microstructure evolution model that does not rely on non-transferable fitting parameters to predict the conditions for dendrite formation and growth morphology.  The ultimate goal for this work is to eliminate the formation-- or at least to limit the growth-- of dendrites on Li metal electrodes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dendrite formation is the primary degradation and failure mechanism and a safety concern in Li batteries, either because dendrite pieces lose electrical contact with the rest of the Li electrode or because growing dendrites penetrate the separator and lead to short circuits.  The fundamental understanding achieved from this research program is expected to contribute to the Li ion battery safety improvement, a critical need for the near-term development of hybrid and electric vehicles.  The planned research, both the methodology and the actual results, are designed to make significant contributions to new battery technology by providing important fundamental information about electrode materials behavior under various electrochemical conditions.  The direct involvement of GM scientists provides an important avenue for disseminating the knowledge generated from this project.  The primary research results will be shared with the public on-line to the public at http://lithiumbatteryresearch.com/ in addition to peer-reviewed publication and conference proceedings.  The graduate student and postdoc supported by this project will spend extended periods of time in an industrial environment, which will provide an important added dimension to their education.  Both of these individuals will thus be very well positioned for future work in battery-related fields.  In addition, undergraduate students will be integral to the program via Penn State's MURE (Minority Undergraduate Research Experience) programs and senior thesis projects in the Department of Materials Science and Engineering at Penn State.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><ol> <li>A phase field model for the morphological evolution of an electrode/electrolyte interface during electrochemical reactions with non-linear Butler-Volmer kinetics was developed, which is capable of modeling the microstructure evolution under large overpotential or high charging rates [Liang et al, Phys.

This is a giant leap since all existing phase-field models are based on linear kinetics and thus not adequate for modeling morphological evolution under highly non-equilibrium conditions. Based on this as-constructed framework, we formulated a non-linear phase field model to predict Li dendrite formation at the Li metal anode/electrolyte interface. The dendritic patterns were examined as a function of applied voltage and initial interfacial morphology. And a guideline was proposed to tailor the interfacial morphology and applied voltage for the desired dendritic patterns and battery design [Chen et al, J. Power Sources (300)376 (2015)].</li> <li>The electrochemical and mechanical properties of Li-battery separator, electrodes, solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) and the electrode/SEI/electrolyte interfaces, associated with Li plating mechanism and battery performance, were investigated systematically by atomic-scale calculation. (1) The mechanical responses of porous polypropylene (PP), the commonly used Li-battery separator material, were studied by relaxing and stretching in vacuum, water, and dimethyl carbonate (DMC) using molecular dynamics (MD). The simulation results suggested that the DMC induced separator softening is attributed to the strong attraction of the non-polar DMC solvent with amorphous fibrous PP nanofiber [Yan et al, Polymer 55 (24) (2014)]. (2) Based on the first principle density functional theory (DFT) calculation of LiCoO2, LiMn2O4, LixAl alloys and data from the extant literature on other common electrode materials, we derived a comprehensive understanding of the elastic properties dependence on Li concentration [Qi et al, J. Electrochem. Soc. 161(11) (2014)]. (3) A DFT-based Li metal/SEI interfacial study on the mechanical and electrochemical properties of the two major SEI inorganic components (Li2CO3 and LiF) showed that Li2CO3 is more mechanically stable vs Li metal than LiF as SEI component. On the other hand, LiF is more effective in blocking electrons against leakage from Li anode to SEI, and thus more like to guarantee normal Li electrodeposition at Li/SEI interface rather than form isolated Li metal nuclei inside SEI layer. [Liu et al, J. Electrochem. Soc. 163(3) (2016)]. (4) A complete charge transfer reaction energy landscape at Li metal/SEI/electrolyte interface was obtained via density functional tight binding (DFTB) calculation. [Li et al, Acc. Chem.

The electron passivation ability was ranked from high to low as LiF&gt;Li3PO4&gt;Li2CO3.

Although Li ion transport faster in Li2CO3 than LiF, the Li ion transport rate in Li2CO3 can be enhanced by the introduction of LiF.
