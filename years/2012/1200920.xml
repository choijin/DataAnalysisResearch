<AbstractNarration>The award provides support to defray the expenses of participants in the 28th Southeastern Analysis Meeting (SEAM), which will be held March 9 and 10, 2012, at the University of Alabama in Tuscaloosa.  SEAM, which started in 1985, is well-known for disseminating and exchanging the latest ideas and developments in classical analysis, complex analysis, and operator theory.  Topics of the main lectures generally reflect the major current developments and interests in analysis and operator theory.   SEAM encourages participation of junior faculty, post-docs, and graduate students, and all are invited to present talks.  The meeting's intimate format fosters collaboration between younger and more senior mathematicians; this exchange of ideas has continued to inspire significant scientific advances in the area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SEAM has served as the first significant research experience for many beginning researchers and advanced graduate students, providing them the opportunity to interact with established colleagues.  The organizers of the conference are committed to providing support to encourage the participation of women, minorities, and other young mathematicians to facilitate their development as researchers and educators.</AbstractNarration>
