<AbstractNarration>1236040/1236104&lt;br/&gt;Kinney/King &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A wide variety of microorganisms have been detected in household tap water and the potential exists for these microbes to be released into the air during showering activities.  While bacterial levels in drinking water systems are routinely monitored, the fungi present in these systems are not.  Nevertheless, a wide range of fungi are present in the tap water reaching homeowners.  Aerosolization of fungi from contaminated water during showering has been implicated as one source of fungal infections in immune-compromised individuals.  More broadly, mold exposure in homes is associated with asthma exacerbation and allergies yet our daily exposure to fungal aerosols during showering remains unstudied.  The overall objective of the project is to identify the fungi present in residential shower units to investigate the hypothesis that showering releases fungal bioaerosols and to identify the presence of potential human allergens and pathogens.  The study will utilize state-of-the-art wetted wall cyclone (WWC) bioaerosol sampling and sequencing methods to identify the fungi released from residential shower units on two different municipal water supplies over two seasons (summer and winter).  Potential sources of the fungi detected in the shower air will be investigated by collecting additional samples from the showerhead as well as the shower water.  Finally, several factors potentially affecting fungal release into the air (e.g., water temperature and flow rate, shower head design, cleaning) will be investigated systematically in an experimental shower unit to allow manipulation of the key variables and to conduct longer term sampling. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The potential risk associated with human exposure to fungi during showering is not well understood even though it is known that fungi are present in tap water reaching households in the United States and elsewhere.  Exposure to fungi has the potential to cause infections for immune-compromised individuals and to exacerbate asthma and allergy symptoms in sensitive individuals.  This study will characterize and quantify the fungi released into the air during showering and lay the foundation for assessing the associated human health risks.  The project will include a number of outreach activities to increase societal awareness of bioaerosols and their environmental impacts.  These activities will include hosting seminars and open lab access to high school students, teachers and the general public as well as water system and medical representatives. The results of the research will be disseminated to the immune-compromised community since they are the segment of the population at greatest risk.  In addition, the multidisciplinary nature of this work will be leveraged to provide new research experiences that expose both graduate and undergraduate students to the field of bioaerosols via the Graduates Linked to Undergraduate Engineers (GLUE) mentoring program at UT and the BIOTECH 685 graduate course at TAMU.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Despite rigorous treatment at water treatment plants, the tap water delivered to homes and other buildings contains a rich diversity of bacteria and fungi.  While many of these microorganisms are natural inhabitants of water and pose no risk, some potentially pathogenic or allergenic microorganisms may also be present.  During showering, the microorganisms present in the water or in the biofilms growing within a shower stall may become airborne and pose an inhalation risk if undesirable microorganisms are present. The purpose of this study was to investigate what bacteria and fungi are present in residential showers and to figure out what fraction of these microorganisms become airborne when a shower is turned on.  We first investigated showers in homes to characterize the microbiome found in existing shower units. We discovered that showers in cities with different water supplies contain different microorganisms, and some showers contain potential pathogens such as nontuberculous mycobacteria or allergens such as Alternaria spp. Some of the microorganisms that become aerosolized are present in the biofilms within the showers (e.g., growing along the ceiling above the shower) while others are present in the shower water.  To better understand the factors that affect what microorganisms are released during showering, two full-scale residential showers were constructed.

With respect to bacteria, the water in the showerhead, the water in the pipe connected to the shower as well as the biofilms that developed on the shower walls and on the showerheads contributed to some degree to the airborne microbial communities.  For the fungal aerosols, the fungi present in the shower air even before the shower was turned on was an important contributor to the fungi found in the air during shower operation.  Fungi present in the showerhead and wall biofilms also contributed to microorganisms found in the air.    This study has provided valuable insights regarding not only the types of microorganisms aerosolized during showering but also the factors and sources that contribute to this aerosolized community.  There is an increasing awareness of the potential health effects of bioaerosols in indoor environments and the data collected in this study contributes greatly to our understanding of the contribution of residential showers to the release of airborne microorganisms.  In addition this NSF-funded study has provided cross-disciplinary training for undergraduate and graduate students in aerosol science, microbial ecology and civil engineering.  In addition, a new program was initiated to provide real-world, environmental sampling opportunities to undergraduate and graduate students.
