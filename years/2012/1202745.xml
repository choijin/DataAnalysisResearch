<AbstractNarration>DIG TEXAS (Diversity and Innovation for Geosciences in Texas) is an alliance comprising earth scientists, educators and other stakeholders with a shared vision to elevate the stature of the geosciences in Texas. With funding from NSF's Geoscience Education program, DIG TEXAS is using cybertechnology to promote collaboration among alliance members and support activities designed to strengthen earth science education in Texas. The project is creating five on-line course road maps, or blueprints, for use in high school earth science classes. Each blueprint consists of an original scope and sequence, packaged with links to pre-existing, exemplary learning activities and resources. Regional teams are working to tailor the blueprints so that they address the specific needs of the diverse student population and educators who work with them throughout the state.  The Science Education Resource Center (SERC) at Carleton College serves as the repository for the blueprint web pages, which also is accessible from the DIG TEXAS website. CYBER-ShARE, a Center of Excellence at the University of Texas at El Paso, is collaborating with SERC to create structural frameworks for organizing information in the collections. Coherent blueprints for implementation of a 21st century earth science course are lacking, not only in Texas, but also throughout the nation in general. Therefore the blueprints are also expected to serve as examples of earth science instruction in other states by demonstrating the integration of stellar teaching resources into earth science courses.</AbstractNarration>
