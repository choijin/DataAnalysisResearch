<AbstractNarration>Collaborative Research: Climate controls on the formation of tropical glacier moraines in the Rwenzori Mountains, Uganda-Congo&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Glaciers on the world's high tropical mountains are among the most sensitive components of the Earth's climate system. The current melting of these glaciers is a spectacular example of anthropogenic climate change.  However, tropical glaciers are strongly sensitive to precipitation, humidity, and various other climate processes, not just air temperature. A major objective of glaciology and climate research is thus to understand the responses of tropical glaciers to climate change, and to evaluate which aspects of past climate change control glacier advance and retreat.  This project seeks to test whether changes in temperature control the behavior of tropical mountain glaciers by reconstructing past temperature changes and glacier movement in the Rwenzori Mountains, Uganda-Congo.  Specifically we will generate new records of glacier advance by dating glacier moraine deposits using cosmogenic radinulides, generate a new temperature record based from lake sediment cores, and compare the timing of periods of cooling with the timing of glacier advances.  The Rwenzori Mountains host the most extensive glacier and moraine systems in Africa, but there are virtually no direct dates to constrain the age of past glaciations. Moreover, there are virtually no quantitative temperature reconstructions from tropical African mountains derived independently of glacial mass balance estimates.  Our work will provide new insight into the timing of major glaciations, glacier sensitivity, and temperature changes in tropical Africa, where few such chronologies exist, and will elucidate the climate processes that control tropical glacier dynamics.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The worldÆs high tropical mountains are among the most climatically sensitive regions on the planet.  Future warming is predicted to affect these mountains more strongly than any region on Earth except the Arctic.  Many of the worldÆs highest tropical mountains contain glaciers, virtually all of which are currently in retreat. The melting of these glaciers is a spectacular example of anthropogenic climate change; however, tropical glaciers are strongly sensitive to precipitation, humidity, and various other climate processes, not just air temperature. This lack of understanding also influences our interpretation of geological records of past glaciation in the tropics &ndash; if we observe evidence of larger glaciers in the past, does that necessarily imply the climate cooled? A major objective of climate and glaciological research is thus to understand the past climate change in tropical mountains, and responses of tropical glaciers to climate change.   This project developed new records of past temperature change and glacier status in the Rwenzori Mountains, situated on the border of Uganda and the D. R. Congo.  We used geochemical analyses of lake sediment cores to reconstruct past changes in the air temperature at high elevations in these mountains, and use isotopic methods to determine the ages of ancient glacier deposits.  We found that over the past 21,000 years, air temperature in these mountains rose by nearly 6 &ordm;C, compared with only ~3 &ordm;C in the surrounding low elevations.  This is in keeping with climate predictions that high elevations are more sensitive than low elevations.  Interestingly, we found that the rate of change of temperature with elevation &ndash; the lapse rate &ndash; was steeper 21,000 years ago, when the climate was coldest and driest, and that the lapse rate we observe was steeper than the lapse rate predicted by climate models at that time.  This suggests that the climate models used to predict the future may underestimate the temperature changes that high tropical mountains will experience in the coming century.  We also found that the largest glacier advance in these mountains, when glaciers advanced nearly 1800 meters lower than their present elevation into areas now inhabited by tropical rainforest, occurred at 21,000 years before the present, when our lake data tells us the climate was coldest.  As this was also a dry time period in tropical Africa, these data support the hypothesis that the primary cause of tropical glacier advance and retreat is climate cooling and warming.  Our work provided international and interdisciplinary research training in the Earth and Climate sciences to a graduate student at Brown University, who completed her Ph.D. based largely upon results from this award.  The award also created research training opportunities for one Brown undergraduate student.  The research was conducted as part of a collaboration between scientists at Brown University, Dartmouth College, and Makerere University in Uganda, and strengthened collaborations among these institutions in ways that will facilitate research projects in the future.
