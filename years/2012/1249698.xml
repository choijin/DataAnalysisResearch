<AbstractNarration>Abstract for Proposal number: 1249698&lt;br/&gt;This award supports a workshop with title: ?Exploring Frontiers in Plant Systems Biology?, to be held in Raleigh, North Carolina, on the campus of North Carolina State University (NCSU) at the University Club, in the Fall of 2012.  The workshop will bring together US and international researchers with interests in plant systems biology to discuss, highlight limitations, and focus on critical questions associated with feasibility and necessary technological and experimental advances for large-scale design of plant systems. The main purpose for the workshop is to: 1) Explore and identify areas of complementary interests, needs, and opportunities associated with the growing discipline of Plant Systems Biology, 2) Identify the primary research grand challenges and explore potential limits of the field from both the biological, computational, and engineering perspectives and, 3)  Formulate funding strategies for future collaborations.  A workshop report will be written and all data and related information generated from the workshop will be made available to the research community through an NCSU hosted website that will be created specifically for the workshop.  The amount of support for this proposal is: $48,516.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Garie A.

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Plant Systems Biology and Engineering (PSBE) is an area of collaborative research at the intersection of biology and engineering, where practitioners integrate multi-scale systems engineering approaches with biological data.  Systems biology itself has seen tremendous growth in the past several decades where mathematical concepts have been developed to describe, understand, and control combinatorial biological interactions across physiological, structural, and biomolecular processes.  Research in this area has culminated into novel approaches and findings and terabytes of information.  Directed focus on systems biology and engineering methodologies specific to plants will facilitate the exploration and the elucidation of the governing mechanisms behind complex biological processes, giving insight into the strategies needed to design and engineer whole plant systems.  This will enable the identification of specific control factors that impact higher level characteristics like plant metabolism, development, and adaptation.  Such initiatives offer outstanding prospects to not only advance basic science/engineering knowledge but also has the potential to solve urgent worldwide societal needs related to pharmaceuticals, food, and energy.  Many of the current systems biology methodologies that have been developed for bacterial and animal systems may be limited in their ability to model plant metabolism, development, and adaptation due to the significant differences in these systems.  Thus, plants provide a unique model system that may require new paradigms for the development of the algorithms, computational architectures, and nanobiotechnology needed to create macroscale and microscale models of cellular network and protein structure and docking, which in turn will facilitate synthetic biology and the design of whole plant systems.  The success of plant systems biology and engineering depends on the integration of established concepts for modeling biological systems, general principles of plant biology, and high throughput experimental approaches for genomics, proteomics and related technologies. The expectation is that this integrated systems approach will allow the prediction, design, and control of emergent biological principles and properties culminating in the ability to engineer whole plant systems.  Hand in hand with these systems approaches must come efforts for education and training.  Our mission as the educators of next generation researchers must be to provide students with the background needed to embrace this vision, enabling them to further develop the fundamental concepts to solidify the future of the field.   This education should include reciprocal interactions with the local, national, and international research communities that represent the fledgling science of plant systems biology and engineering.  As is typical of transformational scientific developments, progress in plant systems biology and engineering depends on the establishment of small committed intellectual communities willing to share ideas, pool resources, and take calculated risks by crossing disciplines and intellectual comfort zones.  Success in this fledgling research area will depend on the ability of members of these communities to help define the major questions and hurdles associated with achieving the ultimate goal of engineering whole plant systems.  To address the unanswered questions associated with the engineering of whole plant systems, NSF provided funding to bring together a small group of interdisciplinary scientists from a range of backgrounds to consider several fundamental questions.  First, what are the areas of complementary interests and opportunities associated with plant systems biology and engineering?  Second, what are the primary research grand challenges and technical and experimental bottlenecks from the biological, computational, and engineering perspectives?  Finally, what are specific research and education strategi...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
