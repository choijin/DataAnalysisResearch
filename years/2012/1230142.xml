<AbstractNarration>Program Director's Recommendation &lt;br/&gt;Center for Membrane Applied Science and Technology (MAST) &lt;br/&gt;Proposal # 1230142 &lt;br/&gt;Zhang &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal seeks funding for the Center for Membrane Applied Science and Technology (MAST) at the University of Colorado site. Funding Requests for Fundamental Research are authorized by an NSF approved solicitation, NSF 11-570. The solicitation invites I/UCRCs to submit proposals for support of industry-defined fundamental research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Membrane technology represents one of the most effective, energy-saving approaches for several separation processes, including ultra-filtration (UF), reverse osmosis (RO), pervaporation (PV), and gas separation. Membrane materials play a pivotal role in determining process effectiveness. Therefore, development of new membrane materials with outstanding separation characteristics is vital to sustain and expand the growth of membrane separation technology. In response to this research opportunity, preparation of a novel class of polymeric membranes integrated with structure-tunable, three dimensional (3-D) well-defined, shape-persistent molecular cages is proposed. These cage-integrated porous membranes are expected to not only significantly enhance the permeability of certain target molecules, but also enable efficiently encoding both dimensional (pore size/distribution) and functional information (guest recognition, sensing, catalysis, etc.) into the final membranes in a modular fashion. The performance of these membranes in separation of CO2/N2, water/alcohol, and olefin/paraffin will be investigated. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed cage-integrated membranes will open completely new directions for fabricating novel defect-free, composite polymeric membranes that can be used for a number of industrially and environmentally important separations, such as CO2/N2, water/ethanol or paraffin/olefin. The proposed work will be a platform for providing new opportunities for outreach, education, and minority involvement on multiple levels. This interdisciplinary research will provide all students, both graduate and undergraduate, exposure to both fields. More than five undergraduate students will be involved in the research plan while special attention will be given to recruit students from minorities and underrepresented groups. The results from the proposed work will be disseminated in professional conferences and journals, via an interactive website, and also integrated into both undergraduate and graduate courses.</AbstractNarration>
