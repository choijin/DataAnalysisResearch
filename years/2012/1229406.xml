<AbstractNarration>With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation Program, Professor George Heard from University of North Carolina Asheville and colleagues Bert Holmes and Sally Wasileski will acquire a 480-core computer cluster with a set of terminals. The proposal is aimed at enhancing research training and education at all levels, especially in areas such as (a) substituent effects for the 1,2-FCl interchange reaction; (b) computational investigation of the 1,2-interchange reaction of halogens and pseudo-halogens; (c) computational investigation of the Wagner-Meerwein rearrangement mechanism; (d) computational investigation of catalytic reaction mechanisms for hydrogen generation from alcohols; (e) 1,1-HX elimination reactions of halogenated ethanes; and (f) studies of the rearrangement and elimination processes using the Quantum Theory of Atoms In Molecules (QTAIM).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Computer systems and clusters of computers are used by chemists and biochemists to investigate reactions and the properties of chemicals and materials using theoretical models and programs. The computer calculations are used, often along with experimental data, to model and better understand many types of complex chemical and biological phenomena. They are also used to predict results and guide experiments. This resource will be used in research and in course work by undergraduate students and faculty at the University of North Carolina Asheville.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ A high-performance computer cluster and computational chemistry lab was established at UNC Asheville to support the undergraduate research groups of Professors Heard, Wasileski, and Holmes, as well as to provide instruction on computational chemistry to students at UNC Asheville.  Over the course of the projecy, 38 students used the computer to generate results for their undergraduate research projects.  27 of these students successfully gradauted with an undergradaute degree in Chemistry from UNC Asheville, and most are in professional schools, graduate schools, or working in the wider chemical industry.  This research has resulted in 12 papers in peer-reviewed journals, off of which have undergraduate co-authors, as well as 28 presentations at regional and national professional meetings.  Two presentations were awarded the ACS COMP award for outstanding undergraduate research poster at ACS National Meetings.  The computer has been used in teaching 62 undergradute students in five courses.  Research done on this computer by the Holmes research group has identified the complex reaction scheme of upper-atmosphere compounds under high-energy situations, particularly reactions of CFC replacement compounds. A weakly-bound complex of a small molecule of HF or HCl to a carbene was identified. The Wasileski research group has investigated the steps involved in extracting hydrogen for use in fuel cells from renewable biomass compounds over a stepped rhodium surface.  The Heard reserach group has identified energy barriers in transfer hydrogenation using an iridium catalyst, with potential to optimizing a greener approach to fine chemical synthesis.
