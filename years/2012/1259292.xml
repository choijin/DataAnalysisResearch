<AbstractNarration>This proposal seeks funds for the continued operation of the Marine Geology Repository (MGR) at Oregon State University. The repository distributed more than 27,000 samples over the past three years, over 70% went to non-OSU investigators. Institutional support includes support for the senior curators-in-charge and recent upgrades to the cyber-infrastructure and to refrigerated storage. The collection was recently expanded with the accessioning of 10,000 samples from the Geosciences Department. Proposed new work includes implementation of a state-of-the art bar coding system. In addition to service to the scientific community, the MGR also participates in K-12 and informal science education projects.</AbstractNarration>

Since 2013, the collection has grown by 253 cores (643 m), 44 dredges (1,411 samples) and 24,185 samples were distributed from 141 unique requests from 44 institutions in 15 countries, including 27 students/post-docs and 64 researchers.
