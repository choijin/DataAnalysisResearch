<AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Southwest Center for Microsystems Education (SCME) creates and promulgates microsystems educational materials for students and professional development opportunities for educators.  The goal is to improve the educational capacity of the nation to produce technicians skilled in supporting microsystems research, design and commercialization, while increasing awareness of microsystems career opportunities by diverse student populations.  The Center generates educational materials and produces and disseminates hands-on kits that bring elements of the clean-room fabrication experience into the classroom.  The Center provides clean-room-based professional development workshops for high school, community college and four-year college faculty and assists transfer of SCME MEMS-based short courses to other venues.  SCME is a strong consortium of institutions catering to the needs of their local area with partner satellites or hubs at ND State College of Science, University of South Florida, Ivy Tech Northeast, Washington Engineering Institute, Albuquerque Public Schools, Central New Mexico CC and Southwest Indian Polytechnic Institute.  SCME also collaborates with other ATE centers focused on nanotechnology, microsystems, semiconductor technology and biotechnology.   More emphasis is placed on expanding SCME's reach by determining localities that have companies that require MEMS technicians and working with nearby community colleges to develop educational programs to support them.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The value of the Center is evaluated using a five cycle process: evaluation of the activities and interactions themselves; evaluation of the outcomes of the activities in terms of development of human and social capital and resources; evaluation of the changes in faculty practice and impacts on students; evaluation of the impact on the technician workforce in microsystems design, manufacturing and commercialization; and evaluation of the changes in the Center's ability to achieve what matters to it and other stakeholders.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The change in strategy moves the Center from a University of New Mexico-centered delivery strategy for faculty development to a distributed delivery system with the development of "hubs" at other educational institutions to deliver workshops and support the education of technicians for the MEMS industry in their geographic region.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Southwest Center for Microsystems Education (SCME) is a NSF Advanced Technological Education Center which was funded from summer of 2012 through end of August 2018.  Microsystems, or MEMS (micro-electromechanical systems) are found in a wide range of biotechnology, transportation, homeland  security, and consumer product applications.  Common examples include crash bag sensor systems, inkjet print heads, DLP televisions and projection systems, and microphones and motion sensors found in smart phones, remote controls, biometrics, micro implants, and game controllers.   These micro devices allow smart systems to sense pressure, light, sound, motion, bio agents, chemical hazards, and electrical and magnetic fields.  MEMS can also be designed to be actuators such as small switches, speakers, and micro fluidic pumps as found in drug delivery systems.  MEMS technology also enables millions of MEMS mirrors to be fabricated on a single chip to be used for digital movie displays which are used in most movie theaters today.   Over the time period of this grant, the revenue of all MEMS devices has grown from $10B in 2012 to $25B in 2017, a compound annual growth rate of 17%.   As a result of the ever-increasing growth in MEMS sensors and actuators, there is an increasing need for an educated workforce.  The challenge was to engage and support the development of an agile, well-educated workforce to support this   business growth and range of needed skills. SCME has developed 11 hands on kits, 6 online short courses, and over 40 learning modules available on SCME's website for viewing or download.  Each module consists of several student activities, presentations, reading materials, and assessments.  The number of downloads per month increased from 2000 in 2012 to 5500 in 2018, also a 20% annual growth rate with a total of over 400,000 downloads by approximately 40,000 individuals.  The SCME YouTube site received approximately 18,000 views per month in 2018 and currently there are over 2500 SCME YouTube Channel subscribers from across the world. SCME provided professional development to secondary and post-secondary educators through face-to-face workshops, online webinars, annual Micro Nano Technology conferences and individual mentorships.  These activities were carried out in collaboration with the SCME partner institutions and other NSF funded ATE centers and projects.  Throughout the grant, over 500 individuals attended SCME professional development workshops and over 1200 attended multi-day clean room workshops and online short courses.  Those educators that responded to surveys reported over 15,000 secondary and post-secondary students were impacted.  Projected impact may be as high as 100,000 or more students. SCME also has worked closely with industry to validate the educational materials and develop industry maps to allow interested parties to find and access over 3000 Micro, Nano, and related high tech companies organized by state.  Each map includes links to the individual industry website.  Students and educators alike use these maps to determine which companies are in their region and what sort of jobs are being offered. The educational materials, websites, YouTube channel all live on and are available for continued use.  The written materials have been copied to the NanoHub.org website as well.  The reader is encouraged to access the SCME materials which can be found at:  www.scme-nm.org www.scme-nm.org/moodle www.nanohub.org  The SCME continues its work through funding of its Support Center for Microsystems Education. The Support Center  continues to scale and distribute existing and updated microsystems educational material and also helps to grow the Micro Nano Tech Education Special Interest Group (MNTeSIG).  These resources can be found at the Support Center website, MNTeSIG website, and the on-line short course website:  www.scme-support.org www.mntesig.net https://scme.online/login/index.php  See accompanying images:  Snap shot taken from one of the many multi-day cleanroom workshops Flyer highlighting what SCME has to offer Heat map showing the distribution of download across the globe SCME Ad Snapshot of the SCME-nm.org website           Last Modified: 11/27/2018       Submitted by: Matthias W Pleil]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
