<AbstractNarration>The PI's request partial support for the Integrated Ocean Observing System (IOOS) Summit "A New Decade for an Integrated and Sustained Ocean Observing System". The 2002 Ocean.US Workshop "Building Consensus: Toward an Integrated and Sustained Ocean Observing System",  in Warrenton, Virginia March 10-15, 2002 set the stage for the Integrated Ocean Observing System (IOOS). Ten years later, IOOS has evolved significantly to meet the nation?s ocean observing needs. Looking ahead at the next ten years, with the foundation of an integrated system now in place, the ocean observing community can begin planning how to optimize technical, scientific, and management components. The Interagency Ocean Observation Committee (IOOC) is planning this IOOS Summit, the week of November 12, 2012, to help give voice to the work of various ocean observers, researchers, scientists, and policy expert-led subgroups charged with identifying practical solutions to enhancing IOOS capabilities through the next decade.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:     &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Summit is all about bringing together a diverse group of stakeholders to discuss the future of ocean observing systems. The Summit will set the stage for planning the next ten years, including how to optimize technical, scientific, management, and policy components.</AbstractNarration>

This award provided program management and meeting support services for the IOOC. In FY13 the Interagency Ocean Observation Committee (IOOC) convened the U.S. IOOS Summit on November 13-16, 2012, roughly ten years after an initial workshop defining U.S. Integrated Ocean Observing System (IOOS&reg;) requirements. The participants at the Summit reviewed progress in the design and implementation of IOOS. The specific objectives for the U.S. IOOS Summit included:  Seeking expert guidance on future implementation for sustained observations Re-establishing the priority observations needed to monitor the ocean Prioritizing key applications for future ocean observing development Exploring underused ocean observing products and services Celebrating and expanding on recent achievements of the IOOS community Determining how IOOS can better serve the scientific community Leveraging resources and materials with regional, national, and international partners Analyzing new and existing policy and management strategies and Ensuring that IOOS is meeting the critical needs of the wide variety of stakeholders who have come to depend on it   The Summit confirmed that the U.S. IOOS enterprise is strengthened by its ability to integrate across observations, data management, modeling and analysis, research and development, and education and outreach.  Current data management efforts are on the right path and serve as a critical foundation for further integration of data and information.    The final IOOS Summit Report and 100+ Community White Papers solicited prior to the meeting were released and are available online at www.iooc.us/summit.  The report distills recommendations from the ocean observing community leading up to and during the Summit, and set the path to 2022.  Recommendations included enhancing focus on regional, national, and global integration; new research and operational models; building public-private partnerships; enhancing outreach and communications strategies; incorporation of additional (e.g. biological) information; and capitalizing on and integrating across existing infrastructure and activities.  The U.S. IOOS Summit Report shows that now, more than ever, the United States requires a sustained and integrated ocean observing system, says regional, national, and global ocean experts with the launch of a new report on how a strengthened U.S. Integrated Ocean Observing System (IOOS&reg;) can better protect life and property, sustain a growing economic vitality, safeguard ecosystems, and advance quality of life for all people. The report shows how improved ocean observing can become an increasingly valuable commodity worldwide with the increasing role of maritime commerce and new ocean-related investments, vulnerability to ocean-related natural disasters, the need to provide security for coastal populations, and the challenges of providing food and water for more people.    The NSF award also contributed to the IOOS Systems Integration Test and Data Analysis Testing &amp; ...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
