<AbstractNarration>The California State University Fresno group participates in the ATLAS experiment at the CERN Large Hadron Collider.   The research program focuses on jet physics, electroweak physics, Event Data Models and the development of Physics Analysis Tools.  The group is also active in the R&amp;D program for the upgrade of ATLAS, including muon detectors, and provides leadership for US Collaborators on ATLAS in the domain of Tier 3 computing.  The Cal State Fresno program also provides an unusual opportunity for broadening participation through a consortium of thirteen CSU campuses.   Through this structure, the CSU Fresno group offers masters-level graduate students and undergraduate students the opportunity to work at CERN with CSU and international ATLAS researchers in a broad spectrum of research projects at the energy frontier of physics.</AbstractNarration>
