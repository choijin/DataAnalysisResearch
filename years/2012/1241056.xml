<AbstractNarration>Amazonia is Earth's most iconic center of biological diversity and endemism and is among the most important terrestrial biomes due to its contributions to global systems ecology. This project seeks to answer an overarching question in biodiversity science: How was the modern Amazonian biota and its environment assembled across space and time?  The research is designed to understand the evolutionary and environmental-ecological history of late Neogene-Recent Amazonia through a comparative approach that integrates across the disciplines of systematics, population biology, ecosystem structure and function, geology, Earth systems modeling and remote sensing, and environmental history. The project also investigates how biotic and environmental change over this time-period influenced Amazonian functional diversity in biogeochemical flows, and how these, in turn, shaped the dimensions of biodiversity seen today as well as the history of global-scale changes in biogeochemical cycling. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project, which is a collaboration with Brazilian scientists and funding agencies, represents the most integrative examination of Amazonian biodiversity and its history to date.  The approaches taken describe a methodological template for analyzing information about the history of biotic and environmental change across large, ecologically complex landscapes that can be generalized to other systems.  The project creates a large framework for formal and informal education including the training of students, development of a major museum exhibit on Amazonia, workshops for K-12 STEM teachers, publications in professional educational journals, and a web portal, The Evolutionary Encyclopedia of Amazonian Biodiversity, that will make all results available to the public, as well as serve as an informational platform about Amazonian biodiversity and its global importance. This award is being co-funded by NSF's Office of International Science and Engineering.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Our component of this large collaborative grant was to examine patterns of Neotropical butterfly evolution in space and time, with a particular focus on the past 6 million years (Pliocene and Pleistocene epochs).  We were able to show that most current species of butterflies in the Neotropics diverged within the Pleistocene (Last 2.6 million years), and this suggests that speciation mechanisms responsible for these divergences cannot be major rearrangements of the geology of South America, which were mostly over by this time period.  Instead, a likely driver of diversification is the climate oscillations associated with periods of warming and cooling (ice ages, in the temperate realm).  It is hypothesized that these climate events could have resulted in changes of the tropical forest that could impact the distributions and population sizes of butterflies and other forest species, resulting in opportunities for differentiation and speciation.  Our results are temporally consistent with this hypothesis.  A synthesis of our results with those from our collaborators is still in progress, but we anticipate that these patterns will be consistent across taxa.  Spatial patterns were not as clear-cut in the data from butterflies, perhaps because museum records do not provide sufficient evidence to recover patterns of endemism in the sparsely-collected Amazon Basin.  However, once again, we hope that our results, combined with those from other taxa studies by our collaborators, may lead to some interesting spatial patterns, as well.  In total, our group has published (or in press) 21 articles that acknowledge this grant, and we anticipate that there will be more forthcoming, particularly from the Helliconius tristero genome we have sequenced, which is an as-yet untapped resource.
