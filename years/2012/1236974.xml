<AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merits&lt;br/&gt;Synthetic biology is a relatively new field that sits at the intersection of biology and engineering, where practitioners use engineering tools and systems approaches to design novel biological systems, including genetic circuits and whole cells, with which to explore governing principles behind complex biological processes or to develop new functionality that can be exploited.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The specific objectives of the workshop are to bring together leading researchers in the field of synthetic biology to:&lt;br/&gt;1. Explore and identify areas of joint interests, needs, and opportunities associated with the rapidly emerging discipline of Synthetic Biology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2. Identify grand challenges and explore potential limits of the field from both biology and engineering perspectives.&lt;br/&gt;In addition, recognizing the future of science research will be increasingly transnational, this workshop seeks to establish new ties and collaborations between researchers in the United States and Germany.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;The workshop will contribute to the enhancement and improvement of scientific, engineering and/or educational activities by bringing together a leading group of international researchers to define the frontiers in synthetic biology. In addition, this meeting will provide the foundation for international collaborations between researchers in the US and Germany. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The meeting sponsors will produce a report of the meeting that will be distributed to the participants and sponsoring organizations (NSF and DFG) and will also be posted for the public on sys-bio.org. We will also explore publishing a meeting report in peer-reviewed journal such as ACS Synthetic Biology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop's organizers will ensure that workshop includes attendees from underrepresent groups in Science and Technology and also attendees who are at early stages of their career.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   The DFG-NSF Synthetic Biology  Workshop was held May 15-16 at the BioQuant Center, Heidelberg  University, Heidelberg, Germany.  The organizing committee included:     Roland Eils, University of Heidelberg  Christopher Rao, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign  Herbert Sauro, University of Washington, Seattle  Kai Sundmacher, Max Planck Institute, Magdeburg  Christopher Voigt, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge  Wilfried Weber, University of Freiburg     The workshop was initiated to join the best of US and German talent  in synthetic biology in grand challenges related to human health and the  emerging bioeconomy.  Program officers from NSF and DFG recruited the  above conference organizers because of a growing recognition that some  problems in synthetic biology such as standards and repositories will  require multinational cooperation if efforts are going to be successful.     The attendees from the US were deliberately chosen by the committee  to promote up-and-coming, junior investigators in synthetic biology.   Assistant professors made up the majority of attendees.  Only 4/11 of  the professors held a tenured faculty appointment.  A variety of  institutions, small and large, public and private, were represented.   Reshma Shetty (Gingko Bioworks) was the sole representative from  American industry.  Of the American researchers, 3/12 were female which  is comparable to the 24% average employment rate for females in STEM  fields [1].      Keynote speakers were Ralf Wagner (University of Regensburg), Chris  Voigt (Massachusetts Institute of Technology), Alfred P&uuml;hler (University  of Bielefeld), selected for their leadership in industry and academia.   Voigt, a young yet influential researcher, was an important leader for  the Americans, giving a total of three talks and suggesting research  goals of common interest to the US and Germany.  Representing the  Germans, Roland Eils (German Cancer Research Center), a distinguished  academic leader, was very proactive in discussions and made a  charismatic impression on the Americans.   Two grand challenges for synthetic biology emphasized in many  discussions throughout the workshop were engineering microbes for  industrial-scale chemical synthesis and, more generally, scaling the  complexity of synthetic gene networks.      Workshop participants suggested a variety of metabolic engineering  approaches to enhance chemical biosynthesis in microbes, including  minimal cell chasses, cell-free catalytic systems, and synthetic enzymes  and enzyme-scaffolds with enhanced catalytic efficiency compared to  natural enzymes.   American and German researchers alike expressed  enthusiasm about using microbial consortia or minimal cell-free systems  for innovative bioprocess applications.  These shared interests may  serve as a basis for future collaborations.     Synthetic biologists have had some encouraging success in creating  modular toolkits of biological parts that can be assembled into  increasingly complicated systems.  Some of these orthogonal parts and  logic circuits have since been transferred to mammalian cells, opening  the door to exciting biomedical applications such as sensing and  distinguishing tumor cells from healthy cells.  Nevertheless, the cost  and effort needed to develop these toolkits is daunting, arguing for  broad collaboration to develop and share these toolkits in DNA  repositories.     The heuristic nature of synthetic biology also provides compelling  motivation for international researchers to share their experience and  resources.  While theory and rational approaches can guide the design  process in synthetic biology, directed evolution and screening is widely  used to refine designs.  Synthetic biology will continue to be a  heuristic science into the foreseeable future, even while it strives to  be a rigorous engineering discipline.       Collaboration between experimentalists and computationalists in  developing standards will...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
