<AbstractNarration>CBET 1236760&lt;br/&gt;PI: Bischof&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thermal transport measurement and modeling in tissues is of increasing importance in cardiovascular biomedicine such as focal therapy or biopreservation where the controlled and reproducible use of a thermal process can either preserve or destroy tissues with characteristic dimensions at the millimeter scale. Unfortunately, precise knowledge of the thermal properties that govern heat transfer within thin (mm scale and below) and anisotropic (i.e. multi-layered and directionally oriented) cardiovascular tissues is currently lacking in the literature. Fundamentally this is because the current standard techniques for measuring thermal properties of biological tissues involve mm-scale probes and cm-scale tissue samples.  This project will address this limitation through adaptation of the 3 omega technique for these measurements. It will yield a number of important new intellectual contributions including:  (1) A modified 3 omega test configuration which accommodates biological soft tissue for measurement with precise temperature and optical access; (2) A new set of property measurements in tissues with characteristic sizes from 1 mm to 10s of microns; (3) An assessment of the importance of anisotropy in cardiovascular tissue thermal properties (i.e. impact of layers and directionality in the tissue structure); and (4) A quantification of interfacial effects including contact resistance during thermal treatments in target and adjacent tissues (i.e. esophagus, lung and nerve impact of heart thermal treatments). In addition, although the initial focus will be on cardiovascular applications, this study will lay the groundwork for thermal property characterization necessary for other important preservation or therapy treatments in as yet uncharacterized biological tissues including fascia, neural, gastro-intestinal and other thin multi-layered tissues.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will measure the thermal properties of biological tissue with small-scale dimensions. It will utilize a measurement method used to determine properties of thin inorganic materials with suitable modifications to be applied for biological tissue. The measured data from this research will greatly contribute to the formalization of a thermal property database for many types of biological tissue not currently known, and to the development of more reliable thermal prediction models. This project will influence the development of future enhancements to biomedical devices utilizing thermal energy for disease treatment, and it could help identify new strategies for more effective preservation of pharmaceutical and food products.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The outcomes of this work were both intellectual and with broader impact. The intellectual outcomes will be described in terms of the research products below.  The broader impact included the training of several PhD students and a Post Doctoral Fellow and the building of an enduring collaboration between the University of Minnesota and University of California at Berkeley. The content of this technology has also been submitted for a patent and is the topic of a further collaboration underway with the University of Urbana Champaign.  The research outcomes of this work include: (1) the creation and characterization of a re-usable di-directional 3&omega; thermal property measurement device for thin biological tissues; and (2) the application of this device for focal therapy use in thin tissues such as the pulmonary vein of the heart.  We have disseminated these outcomes at various meetings by oral and poster communication.  We have also published or submitted for publication as noted below.    The first outcome has been published as Lubner et al.  Review of Scientific Instrumentation, 2015.  This work shows our ability  to adapt the 3&omega; method&mdash;widely used for rigid, inorganic solids&mdash;as a  reusable sensor to measure k of soft biological samples.  The liver  results are independent of sample thicknesses from 3 mm down to 100 &mu;m,  and agree with available literature for non-mouse liver.  Importantly,  this newly-proven capability at 100 &mu;m represents tissues two orders of  magnitude thinner than conventional methods of tissue thermal  characterization.  This will allow a much greater range of relevant  tissue types to be characterized for the first time, thereby  facilitating rational understanding and planning of thermal therapies.  The second outcome is under review as Natesan et al. Scientific Reports 2015.  This work shows our to use a thermal sensor based on 3&omega; to inform treatment planning and monitoring in thin tissues for focal therapy. Specifically, an in vitro "3&omega;" sensor was microfabricated onto flat glass as an idealization of a probe surface, and used to make the first measurements of thermal conductivity (W/m.K) of porcine pulmonary vein (PV), esoohagus and phrenic nerve tissues for PV cryoabalation planning. Further, in a completely new dynamic use of "3&omega;", the sensor also demonstrated the ability to measure contact with tissue vs. water, water flow conditions, tissue thickness, and freeze initiation and completion.
