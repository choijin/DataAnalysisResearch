<AbstractNarration>The Raleigh Future Scholars program offers a comprehensive package of financial, mentoring, and career support to undergraduate students pursuing degrees in engineering and statistics disciplines. Students are recruited from the Raleigh Promise: a cross-sector community partnership program designed to increase educational outcomes for academically talented and economically disadvantaged youth in Raleigh, NC. Prior to the start of the academic year, the program begins with a summer transition program, offering incoming students guidance and mastering of necessary skills to shift into the rigorous undergraduate schedule. This support continues through graduation offering mentoring, career counseling, internships and personal guidance. Students self-document these activities through an e-portfolio that helps them see their progress, to communicate effectively about science and engineering, to acquire high ethical standards and professionalism, and to prepare for careers that fulfill their goals in life. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The assessment of this project is designed to provide a model of recruitment, retention, and academic advising, transferable to STEM programs at other institutions. The broader impacts of the proposed scholarship program are to improve North Carolina State University's capacities to increase the representation of students in areas of need and to highlight elements of undergraduate student support services (e.g. financial, academic, social, and career-related) that need to be addressed in order to promote long-term sustainable change.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit: The goal was to provide a support system for the academically talented and economically disadvantaged student population with a Raleigh permanent address, increasing their opportunities for graduating with STEM degrees. The program created a pathway to success by issuing financial, academic, social, and career-related supports to undergraduate students already admitted to NC State with majors in engineering and/or statistics. Over the course of this scholarship program, each individual, depending upon FAFSA data and academic eligibility, received the equivalent of 75% in-state tuition per year. Scholars had participation priority in mock job interviews, professional development workshops, industry visits with companies, paid research and industry internships, as well as opportunities to network with industry professionals and faculty on campus.  Broader Impacts:  Throughout five years, the program awarded 83 need-based academic scholarships to students, who came as freshmen directly from local high schools or were transferred from community colleges (about 20% of them). There were five cohorts composed of 22 men and 14 women, totaling 36 talented individuals. At the time the grant ended, 29 of the scholars had already left the program: 24 graduated with a bachelor degree, 5 left the program without graduating, and the remaining 7 are on track to graduate as scheduled.  Those 24 students graduated in 5 years or less with a STEM degree, in addition to having a 50% participation in co-op and/or industry internships, and 6 have or are still enrolled to earn advanced graduate degrees. Related to employment, 19 scholars are currently employed with 16 companies in STEM related fields.   The results indicate that a scholarship program with defined financial, academic, social, and career-related efforts can considerably improve the graduation rate and benefit the career development of academically talented and economically disadvantaged students.
