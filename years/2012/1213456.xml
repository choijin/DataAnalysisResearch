<AbstractNarration>This award funds the research activities of Professor Noah Graham at Middlebury College.  The work is organized around two distinct, though related, lines of inquiry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first research direction focuses on Casimir forces, which arise from quantum-mechanical fluctuations of charges and fields.  While Casimir forces are negligible in our everyday experience, at small distances -- in particular, at distance scales relevant to the next generation of microelectromechanical devices -- they can become important.  Recent progress has established a systematic framework for calculating these forces in a wide range of situations relevant to nanotechnology.  In this approach, one calculates the Casimir force by relating it to fundamental quantities associated with the reflection and scattering of light.  This work will create new techniques for computing the necessary reflection and scattering data, and then will apply the results to a wide range of Casimir force calculations.  The methods to be used to analyze light reflection and scattering are very general, and thus potentially applicable to a wide range of problems in physics and engineering.  The second research direction focuses on the role played by oscillons -- extremely long-lived, localized, oscillatory solutions to the nonlinear equations of motion that arise in field theory models -- during the "reheating" epoch of the early universe, following cosmic inflation and the Big Bang.  Here large-scale numerical simulation will play a key role in understanding the self-organizing behavior through which oscillons emerge from a chaotic thermal background.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Both of these lines of research will have significant broader impacts in other fields of science and engineering, and in education and training of students.  The Casimir project will develop new computational techniques with a wide range of potential applications, while the oscillon project will push the current boundaries of high-performance parallel computing.  Through both summer research projects and integration of aspects of this research into the undergraduate curriculum at Middlebury College, both projects will also offer significant new opportunities for students to learn both fundamental physics and broadly applicable analytic and computational skills.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The research supported by this award has produced important progress on fundamental scientific questions in cosmology and the dynamics of the early universe, and in quantum field theory and its applications to nanotechnology.  In cosmology, this research showed how coherent clumps of matter can form at the end of cosmic inflation, the rapid expansion of the early universe following the Big Bang.  These objects can be held together either by the nonlinear self-interactions of oscillating classical fields, or by quantum-mechanical binding effects due to interactions with charged particles.  High-performance parallel computing has played an important role in these investigations.  In quantum field theory, this research has calculated Casimir forces, which arise from quantum-mechanical fluctuations of electromagnetic charges and fields.  While it is negligible at everyday length scales, at short distances the Casimir force can play an important role in the design and function of the next generation of microelectromechanical devices, such as the accelerometers that deploy car airbags and detect the motion of video game controllers.  This research program has established general techniques applicable to a wide range of geometries and materials, and has carried out detailed calculations focusing on Casimir forces for objects with sharp edges, a particularly relevant case for technological devices.  In both cases, these calculations proceed by expressing the Casimir force between two objects in terms of the reflection of light from each object individually.  Because this information -- encoded mathematically in the scattering T-matrix -- is of fundamental importance in many areas of physics, the tools that have been created for these calculations are applicable to other problems in physics and engineering as well.  Five undergraduate students have made significant contributions to this work as summer research assistants, with four appearing as co-authors of peer-reviewed publications.  Two implemented new calculations to compute scattering data using the variable phase method, while the other three wrote a general-purpose software package for computing Mathieu functions, which arise in a variety of applications in science and engineering.  These software packages are now publicly available for use by other researchers.  Through this work, these students have had the opportunity both to develop and apply fundamental skills in mathematics and physics, and to gain experience writing reliable and efficient software for public distribution.
