<AbstractNarration>Pfefferle/Frey&lt;br/&gt;1264698 / 1264698&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PIs propose a novel approach to the scalable, chiral separation of SWNT in which chirality-determined surface charge is introduced onto the SWNT; subsequently, liquid chromatography techniques are employed to resolve individual SWNT subtypes. The chemical processing procedures which prepare the SWNT for subsequent separation involve the application of functional groups to the nanotubes in a way that exploits differential chiral reactivity. This in turn leads to differential surface acidity/basicity for the functionalized nanotube subtypes as reflected in their different point of zero charge (PZC) values. Professor Pfefferle is an expert in SWNT synthesis and in producing narrow distributions of SWNT identities and functionalizing and characterizing them. She is also developing the concept of using SWNT surface charge as a chirality marker. Functionalized SWNT will be separated on the basis of their surface charge using high-resolution, high-throughput methods involving chromatofocusing that exploit electrostatic interactions. Methods of this type have been under development over the last several years by Dr. Frey at the UMBC for biotechnology applications and will be further adapted here so that they apply specifically to the case of SWNT separations. To accomplish this, the PIs will investigate the use of column packing materials that are likely to enhance the adsorption capacity for SWNT, such as tentacle-type column packings, where the ion-exchange functional groups are located on linear polymer chains extending outward from the particle surface. The PIs will also investigate the use of innovative elution strategies involving chromatofocusing focusing in combination with mobile phase modifiers that optimize the balance between electrostatic and hydrophobic forces during elution. Another line of investigation will be to evaluate novel methods to affect the behavior of SWNT during chromatography, such as the use of microwave radiation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Broader Impacts: The expected result of the proposed research will be a flexible method that can produce subtypes of purified SWNT from the laboratory scale to the industrial scale. The ability to take a mixed batch of SWNT and, in a scalable manner, obtain a highly selective separation of each component is an important goal in the carbon nanotube field. The current unavailability of inexpensive high purity SWNT is the major reason why SWNT-based electronics have not been practical to-date. By solving this key technical challenge, this project has the potential to be truly transformative. Despite their far-reaching potential, the methods to be investigated here are simple in concept and lend themselves well to projects involving both undergraduate and high school students. Many such students have participated in the past in the PIs? research both at Yale and UMBC.  The PIs will expand this effort and include interactions between our groups, and thereby present an exceptional opportunity for students at all levels to participate in an interdisciplinary research program that exploits the complementary capabilities of the PIs.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Professor Lisa Pfefferle and graduate student Stacy Kanaan worked with collaborators led by Professor Frey to prepare single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNT) for chromatographic separation. SWNT come in many identities with different properties so a key technological barrier has been obtaining uniform property SWNT.  SWNT from synthesis can contain many different structures with widely varying properties.  Current separation processes are cumbersome and low yield.  SWNT tend to strongly bundle together making separation difficult.  This has inhibited the development of commercial applications.  We have optimized our sample preparation methods so that highly stable dispersions are being produced. We have extended our work into the areas of electrophoresis and two-phase aqueous extraction in order to exploit the synergies that exist between these methods and chromatography. Pre-separating metallic versus semiconducting tubes allows better optimization of the chromatographic separation.     A key finding of this work is the importance of SWNT dispersion as individual SWNT in solution on the separation efficiency and the effect of pH on the dispersion properties of different surfactants. Prior to the chromatographic separation the SWNT must be well dispersed in water.  This was a significant effort and we have developed several methods for SWNT dispersion focusing on techniques that are "green".  By a urea functionalization technique we were able to obtain SWNT that were highly individually dispersed in fact better than the usual surfactants (our 2015 Carbon paper).  A broader impact of this work is that these urea functionalized SWNT can be used in biomedical applications where water dispersions are necessary and surfactants can be toxic.      To optimize the column conditions for chromatographic separation, the surface charge on different SWNT batches was determined. We also optimized electrochemical separation of tubes into predominantly semiconducting and predominantly metallic fractions.  This technique can handle a large amount of SWNT quickly without significant losses and makes the chromatographic separation easier to optimize.  Our work on this technique used 100 mg of SWNT in water 2-3mg per ml. The nanotubes are first ozonated or nitric acid treated to provide surface oxygen groups and then sonicated in water with urea.

The technique is important because should be scalable. We found that the technique is not so straightforward and have been investigating why.  First although in FaganÆs papers unfunctionalized SWNT were used we showed that it can apply to functionalized SWNT as well. Two polymers polyethylene glycol (PEG) and dextran are used to create a two-phase system in water. The PEG phase is slightly more hydrophobic than the dextran phase and the SWNT can distribute differently in the phases. One observati...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
