<AbstractNarration>This project contributes to the further development of the Arctic Observing Network (AON) by providing a suit of variational methods for optimization of observational arrays with special emphasis on the computational efficiency and portability of the optimization procedures. The team will analyze a scientific rationale for several ongoing and proposed observational programs to provide recommendations for designing an effective AO observing system. By accomplishing the proposed research they intend to approach the major goal of the proposal: to provide observational Arctic community with an objective procedure for optimization of the observational strategy that can be routinely used and will deliver robust and efficient estimates of the optimal configuration of an observational array based on the information available from community AO Ocean General Circulation Models.  The study will provide a helpful tool for quality control of the decisions based on ?common sense? and the information which cannot be formalized in the framework of a rigorous mathematical approach. The results may suggest recommendations for deployment of the monitoring equipment in support of the Study of Environmental ARctic CHange (SEARCH) and AON programs.  The results of the proposed study will be available through a web site that will include links to other relevant observational projects. The web site will be designed to be useful for a variety of audiences including the scientific community, students, and the general public. Additionally, the investigators will set up a web server to simplify access of the interested researchers to the developed algorithms. Results from project data interpretation will be published in scientific and popular journals.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ With the decreasing of sea-ice cover in the Arctic in past decades, we observe significant changes of the hydro-physical conditions in the Arctic Ocean.  An incomplete list of observed changes includes: intensification of warm Pacific Water inflow through the Bering Strait (Woodgate et al., 2012), changes in the freshwater balance in the in the Eurasian Basin of Arctic, enhanced Arctic oscillation index "due to cyclonic shift in the ocean pathways of Eurasian runoff forced by strengthening of the west-to-east Northern Hemisphere atmospheric circulation" (Morison et al., 2012),  amplification of regional significant wave height by 35% (Francis et al., 2010), and development of a new role for sea waves to further diminish  Arctic sea-ice (Simmonds and Rudeva, 2012) and enhance vertical mixing (Qiao  et al., 2004). These changes affect all kinds of human activity in the Arctic region including fishery, trans-Arctic transportation and shipping, mineral extraction, and oil/gas exploration on the Arctic shelf.
