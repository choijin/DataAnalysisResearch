<AbstractNarration>Collaborative Research: Graptolite Biogeography, Paleo-GIS, and Evolutionary Dynamics of Early Paleozoic Zooplankton&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Daniel Goldman, Dayton University, EAR-0958372&lt;br/&gt;Charles Mitchell, SUNY, Buffalo, EAR-0958308&lt;br/&gt;H. David Sheets, Canisius College, EAR-0957672&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;Deep-time perspectives on climatic and oceanographic change are critical for understanding the long-term controls on environmental processes. This is particularly the case for the 'tipping points' that lead to episodes of climatic extremes, events that are often associated with episodes of profound biodiversity change. The spatial and temporal distribution of planktic organisms has proven to be critical to the reconstruction of climatic and oceanographic conditions during the Mesozoic and Cenozoic. The oldest geological period for which there is a diverse and abundant record of zooplankton is the Ordovician, and that record is provided by graptolites. PIs objectives are to analyze the changing biogeographic distribution patterns in graptolites from the mid-Ordovician into the lower Silurian using newly developing global databases, ecological modeling, and paleo-GIS techniques. Graptolite spatial distribution patterns should help understand the relationship between ancient ocean structure, climate, and zooplankton biogeography. Strong parallels have recently been drawn between the glacial-interglacial cycles of the Late Ordovician-Early Silurian and those of the late Cenozoic. Therefore, understanding the biogeographic and biodiversity changes associated with these climatic cycles will provide insights relevant to our understanding of biotic response to recent and modern climate change. Although this study will focus on the Ordovician and Early Silurian biosphere and its interconnections, the questions PIs propose to pursue - how range area and spatial patterning of faunas affect or respond to changing environmental history and species evolutionary dynamics - are fundamental questions that biologists and paleobiologists are pursuing across our traditional disciplinary boundaries of taxon, age, and conceptual approach.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project has focussed on understanding the evolutionary dynamics of the graptolites, who were a widespread macroplankton common in the Ordovician era.  The Ordovician era was a hothouse phase of the earth's climate history, and ended with cooling and transition to an icehouse phase, in which the deep water circulation patterns of the earth's oceans changed substantially.  Our current climate conditions are cold, with widespred concerns that we face a transition to a warm phase of the earth.  Understanding how plankton have historically responded to large scale climate changes may provide a window on the ocean changes that may soon occur.  Graptolites have long been used in biostratigraphy, the formation of geological time scales, so that graptolites are a subject of intense study in paleontology as biological indicators of the age of sediments.  Many paleontological publications over the last century have reported on the presence of graptolites across the globe.   However, there is only limited understanding of the large scale patterns of their evoultionary history.    Our work has focussed on creating a large scale database of all the known fossil collections of graptolites during the Ordovician era, with the aiming of understanding how these organisms spread throughout the Earth during the warm phase of the Ordovician era, and then how these same organisms responded to the cooling of the earth that lead into the Ordovician mass extinction.  Results so far have shown changes in graptolite communities well prior to the mass extinction,  shifts in relative abundance of these plankton were evident well prior to the mass extinction.  The database at the heart of this project is now complete, and contains detailed digital information from over 1100 graptolite collections,  which can be positioned in both time and paleolocation.   This database will continue to be used by researchers and students to further our understanding of the diversification of plankton, and their response to major climate change.  Work on the analytic methods needed for this project has also resulted in a set of statistical tools for quantifying the uncertainty in geological time scales.  These will be important in understanding the quality of the analyses of the conclusions we can state about the diversification of graptolites, but may also be helpful in  the selection of Global Boundary Stratotype Section and Point collections used in forming geological time scales.  The analytic tools and database constructed during this project will continue to be used to develop both future geological time scales and further understanding of the respones of plankton to the changing climate.
