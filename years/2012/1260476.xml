<AbstractNarration>In the mid-1940s, public opinion surveys began to gather trend data on racial attitudes in America. There, however, is no survey data or other reliable evidence to answer questions about attitudes prior to the mid-1940s. This study will address this by completing a systematic content analysis of newspapers and periodicals from 1930 until 1946 - the latter date the first year when even minimal national trend survey data became available on white racial attitudes. The investigator has developed an extensive set of categories and has used these to analyze a random sample of newspaper articles newspapers over some 35 years in order to determine what, if any, changes occurred that reflected or influenced white racial attitudes. A second research goal is to study attitudes in the years from 1946 to the mid 1960s. For these years, unlike the earlier 1930 to 1946 period, there are repeated national surveys to which the results of the content analysis can be compared. This enables the investigator to indirectly isolate the extent to which analyzing newspaper texts can contribute to understanding changes in attitudes between the earlier 1930 to 1946 period. Initial findings provide promising evidence of considerable change: for example, the context analysis of newspaper articles yielded a statistically reliable increase in the stories about black accomplishments as against reports of alleged black crimes. This study will examine critically other areas in which change has occurred, including shifts in attitudes about gender equality, and continue to develop the methodology that allows one to determine the association of findings from content analyses of newspaper articles and those based on available national surveys over the same period. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research has the potential to increase understanding of attitudes toward minorities during the Depression and World War II years. The research will also help to assess the value of content analysis of mass media in identifying attitudinal trends among the general public, thus complementing and supplementing the evidence obtained from sample surveys. The attempt to compare systematically two very different types of social science data should yield insights into the advantages and limitations of each, and contribute to an understanding of whether and how content analysis can shed light on attitudes when trustworthy survey data are not available or are suspect because of limitations (for example, low response rates). The results of the research will be disseminated through presentations and articles that cross disciplinary boundaries, reaching historians, sociologists, communications researchers, and others, and therefore adding to cross-disciplinary communication and awareness. In addition, the systematic comparison of findings from content analysis and survey data has the potential to be of value to graduate and undergraduate students of social science research methods, and to be of interest  both to those studying social change generally and attitudes about different types of human rights, specifically.</AbstractNarration>

Our interest lay in when the shifts documented by the surveys occurred and what led to them. With no survey trend data before the mid-1940s, we sought an alternative source of evidence on change in attitudes prior to that date. Both theory and empirical findings suggest that the attitudes of individuals within a given society correspond to the norms that prevail within that society.

Newspaper content provides some support for early change. In the Times, we found evidence of a decline in stereotyped portrayals of blacks during the first half of the 1930s. We also noted that newspapers frequently identified the race of African American individuals, even when race was neither relevant to the story nor needed to identify the individuals. This practice appeared to decrease somewhat during the early 1930s in the Times.  However, we found greater evidence of change in the late 1930s and early 1940s. Both stereotyped portrayals and identification of individuals by race declined further.  In addition, the proportion of Times articles reporting on positive actions by whites toward blacks increased during these years, as did the proportion of articles that referred to blacksÆ professional accomplishments. Other newspapers showed similar change but at somewhat later dates.  Most films during the 1930s drew on racial stereotypes to evoke laughter or fear. The former was exemplified by Stepin Fetchit in Judge Priest (1934), the latter by King Kong in 1933, which also hinted at miscegenation. Other films in the later 1930s dealt sympathetically with southern plantation and slave owners, as in Gone With the Wind (1939). But just two years later, In This Our Life (1941) &ndash; planned and begun before Pearl Harbor -- provided an important indicator of change in the treatment of race. A spoiled white women (played by Bette Davis) attempts to blame a young black man for a fatal car accident that she herself caused.  By the end of the film, he is shown not only to be innocent, but also to be an upstanding, serious student. Thus the film provides a favorable portrayal of the black youth, and a highly unfavorable one of the white woman. Other films from 1939-1941 also offered a positive view of black Americans.  During World War II, films portrayed quite favorably the inclusion of blacks in U.S. military units, thus showing their patriotic contribution. After the war ended, most films support racial integration, initially at the level of friendship, later in terms of intermarriage.  Advertisements showed a different picture. From the 1930s through the mid-1960s, blacks are almost invisible in advertisements, even in scenes where they would ordinarily be present as a minority within the general public. Only during the late 1960s do blacks begin to appear with greater consistency in ads. Understandably, commercial ads lagged behind as norms changed...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
