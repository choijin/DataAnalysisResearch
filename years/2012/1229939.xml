<AbstractNarration>In many natural topological and geometric problems, one is led to study spaces that are very badly behaved from a classical point of view, such as the space of unitary representations of an infinite, non-abelian discrete group.  Such spaces are quite often described well by noncommutative operator algebras: in particular, the Baum-Connes and coarse Baum-Connes conjectures predict that a good connection between the classical and noncommutative worlds is provided by higher index theory.  These conjectures have many applications to geometry and topology, such as to the Novikov conjecture, and to the existence of positive scalar curvature metrics.  It has recently become apparent, however, that coarse geometric properties associated to certain quotients of discrete groups and expanding graphs are obstructions to these conjectures: the investigator intends a systematic investigation of the geometric, analytic, and algebraic properties associated to these obstructions, and the phenomena thus allowed to exist.   He also intends to apply realted ideas of coarse geometry and noncommuative geometry to prove classical index theorems associated to elliptic operators on symmetric spaces (with suitable boundary conditions).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many natural spaces occurring in geometry have very bad properties from the point of view of classical mathematics.  Inspired by quantum mechanics, one tries to describe these spaces using noncommutative mathematical structures - here 'noncommutative' means that the order in which one performs operations matters.   If such a 'noncommutative description' is accurate in some precise sense, then a great deal of information about geometric spaces becomes available.  It is known, however, that aspects of these descriptions fail for spaces called expanding graphs - for essentially the same reasons that make expanding graphs useful in computer science and the theory of networks.  The investigator plans both to study, and to use, 'noncommutative descriptions' in borderline cases, particularly for spaces related to expanding graphs and the discrete groups that can be used to construct them.  A better understanding of exotic properties of discrete groups, and thus of their connections to other areas of mathematics and computer science, is also a central goal.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The project was on research in fundmaental mathematics.  The PI is an Assistant Professor of Mathematics at the University of Hawaii at Manoa.  The research funded by the project mainly fits into three broad themes: expansion in metric spaces; exactness and K-theory; and geometry of band operators.  The first of these themes focuses on geometry and the so-called `expander' graphs that are important models of highly connected networks; it connects to parts of network theory, study of symmetry, and general forms of geometry.   The second focuses on applications of these to ideas to important K-theoretic conjectures centered around the study of symmetry and high-dimensional geometry; it also connects to differential equations via index theory.   The third theme focuses on issues more closely related to classical analysis, touching on operator theory and particularly the `band' operators that are important in engineering and mathematical physics.   As a result of his research in these fields, the PI completed about a dozen research papers, many co-authored with US and international collaborators.  All are either published in, or currently submitted for publication in, high quality peer-reviewed international journals.  During the project, the PI organized three international conferences (two in Hawaii, and one in Tennessee) involving participants from the US and over ten other countries in the Americas, Asia and Europe.  He gave several mini-courses at international conferences aimed at bringing graduate students and other young researchers up to date on current research. In addition to this, he gave dozens of research talks at international conferences to disseminate his work, and invited top researchers to Hawaii to interact with the department here.  The PI is particularly interested in using Hawaii's location to foster links with researchers in east Asia.  As well as the commitments to undergraduate and graduate education that form part of his core activities as a mathematics professor at the University of Hawaii, the PI led seminars and reading courses aimed at the development of graduate students.  He mentored two graduate students who intend to work in mathematics education in the state of Hawaii.  He also co-mentored one postdoctoral worker who is at the start of a research career in mathematics.       Last Modified: 10/29/2014       Submitted by: Rufus Willett]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
