<AbstractNarration>The project entitled - Computational Thinking as an Approach to Refining the Critical Thinking and Analytical Reasoning Skills of Undergraduates at an HBCU - has the goal to expand on a new course in Computational Thinking to ensure that students who complete this course have enhanced critical thinking and analytical reasoning skills. The objectives of this project are: to identify and develop exact measures of Computational Thinking competencies; to develop a curriculum that successfully integrates critical thinking and analytical reasoning skills with Computational Thinking skills; and to determine whether Computational Thinking competencies enhance critical thinking and analytical reasoning skills for students at Jackson State University.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will contribute to the newly evolving area of Computational Thinking. Advocates of computational thinking believe that it will transform not only Computer Science education, but K-16 education in general.  Ninety-Two percent of the students enrolled at Jackson State University are African-American. As part of the institution's core curriculum all students must take a computing course. Therefore, this project has the potential to impart Computational Thinking, critical thinking and analytical reasoning skills to a large number of underrepresented students. This project will ensure that HBCUs and other minority serving institutions are a part of the evolving Computational Thinking community. Course modules and a theoretical framework resulting from this project will be disseminated through traditional means such as publications and presentations as well as various computing related pathways.</AbstractNarration>
