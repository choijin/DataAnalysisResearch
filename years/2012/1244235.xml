<AbstractNarration>Chemotaxis is a remarkable process -- a small amount of a chemical cue in the environment can direct a cell or organism movement towards the source, like the smell of freshly baked bread draws us into the kitchen. The goal of our work is to understand the basic mechanism of chemotaxis using a simple model system for our studies, the social amoeba Dictyostelium. The chemotaxis pathway is highly conserved from amoebae to humans so what we learn from the amoebae can teach us about chemotaxis is a wide variety of organisms. A new player in the chemotaxis pathway named MyoG has been identified in Dictyostelium. MyoG is a member of a family of proteins called myosins that work as molecular motors, generating movements within cells. Our objective is to determine the role of MyoG in transmitting signals from outside of the cell to the machinery inside that is responsible for directing cell movement. Determining how and where MyoG acts in the chemotaxis pathway and identifying what other proteins it works in concert with will provide new information about the chemotaxis pathway. We will also search for similar proteins in mammalian cells as a first step towards understanding the fundamental mechanism of chemotaxis and how it has been so highly conserved through millions of years of evolution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The proposed project will be used to introduce students at all levels (from high school through graduate school) to basic research methods and practice. Young students will work one-on-one with the PI on several subprojects specifically tailored to each student's talents. Each student will be taught scientific methods, encouraged to think through and answer their own questions, formulate new questions, and summarize results as the project proceeds. The PI actively participates in the development of lectures and laboratory modules for International Training Courses in Cell Biology &amp; Biochemistry in Latin America based on the chemotaxis project. The goal of these courses is to foster interactions and relationships between US and South American students and investigators. Finally, a central web resource for information about the myosin superfamily, the Myosin Home Page, will be adopted, updated and maintained. It will serve as a comprehensive resource for students and non-myosin researchers to gain basic information about the function of individual members of the large myosin superfamily of molecular motors.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[        The focus of the project over the final year was to continue the ongoing, productive studies on the role of the Dicty MF myosin DdMyo7, the second MF myosin found in Dictyostelium, in filopodia formation.  Filopodia are slender actin-filled projections that a wide variety of cells employ to explore and interact with their environment.  For example, neurons extend numerous filopodia from the advancing growth cone, using them for gradient sensing and efficient directional migration to build the connections of a developing brain.  DdMyo7 is of particular interest because it is a functional homolog of Metazoan Myo10 - both myosins are essential for filopod formation. The goal of the ongoing work has been to determine if the two evolutionarily distant DdMyo7 and Myo10 myosins have a common role in in filopodia formation.  The immediate objective was to identify the core conserved operating principles of these filopodial myosins, and continue the ongoing studies on the high-resolution structure of the DdMyo7 MF domains.         Metazoa and Amoeba both require the activity of a MyTH-FERM (MF) myosin, Myo10 in mammalian cells, DdMyo7 in amoebae, for filopodia formation.  This observation suggests that they employ common mechanisms for building these structures.  An objective of this project has been to identify the evolutionarily conserved properties of these myosins that are required for their filopodia-forming activity.  A detailed structure-function analysis of DdMyo7 has revealed that targeting of the MF motor region (consisting of the motor, the neck, the post lever arm consisting of a stable alpha-helix, putative dimerization domain and a proline-rich domain, Pro1) to the cortex of cells via either the N-terminal (MF1) or C-terminal (MF2) MF domain is sufficient for filopod forming activity.  Remarkably, a chimera consisting of the DdMyo7 motor/lever arm/post lever arm domain and the human Myo10 MF domain was also capable of rescuing the filopod formation defect in the Dd myo7 null mutant (Fig 1).  These results established that that the core features of the filopodial MF myosins have been conserved over 600 million years of independent evolution.         The signature MF domains of DdMyo7 and Myo10 play critical roles in their function.  A structural analysis of the DdMyo7 MF domains was undertaken to compare their structures with that of the mammalian Myo10 MF domain.  High resolution structures of the two DdMyo7 signature MF domains have been determined in collaboration with Dr Anne Houdusse (Institut Curie, Paris). Comparison with mammalian MF structures reveals that characteristic features of MF domains are conserved (Fig 2).  However, across millions of years of evolution conserved class-specific insertions are seen to alter the surfaces and the orientation of subdomains with respect to each other, likely resulting in new sites for binding partners.  The MyTH4 domains of Myo10 and DdMyo7 bind to microtubules (MT) with uM affinity but, surprisingly, their MT binding sites are on opposite surfaces of the MyTH4 domain and the sequences are not conserved.  The structural analysis in combination with comparison of diverse MF myosin sequences provides evidence that myosin tail domain features can be maintained without strict conservation of motifs.  The work highlighted both the functional conservation of this domain but also showed how molecular tinkering can give rise to differences in the surface of the domain that provides new or distinct sites for binding partner interaction.       A collaborative project with Dr. Hanna Brzeska of the Korn lab (NIH) to study the differential localization of class I myosins in Dicty was completed.  These are among the most ancient and widely expressed myosins that have conserved roles in micropinocytosis and pseudopod formation - they are critical for cell migration and uptake of fluids.  This work revealed that the individual class I myosins, either short- or long-tailed, use different mechanisms of targeting to membranes, consistent with these myosins having both shared and divergent cellular functions.
