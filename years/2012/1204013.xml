<AbstractNarration>The overall objective of the proposed research is to investigate changes in the dynamics of the active layer and the top layers of ice-rich permafrost on the North Slope of Alaska using InSAR (Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar). We will use both C-band and L-band data, acquired during the last two decades (1991-2011). More specifically, (i) we will implement the InSAR Frozen Ground Algorithm (InSAR FGA) to detect changes in ALT and near-surface permafrost, (ii) we will investigate spatial variations of ALT and ground ice content of the near-surface permafrost through drilling, mechanical probing, and ground penetration radar (GPR).  Data and information obtained from this fieldwork will also be used for InSAR FGA validation and calibration, (iii) combining InSAR FGA outputs, field data, and available climate data, we will investigate spatial and temporal changes and variations of the active layer and near-surface permafrost and their response to climate change from 1991 through 2011 on the North Slope of Alaska. The expected results of the proposed research will provide (i) a validated InSAR FGA useful for regional-scale active layer and permafrost studies; (ii) time series of ALT and their changes over the study period, (iii) long-term (1991-2011) mean of ALT across the North Slope of Alaska, and (iv) potential ground-ice melting in the top layers of ice-rich permafrost across the North Slope of Alaska with a resolution of from tens of meters to hundreds of meters.  The results from this study will be ideal for model inputs and validation and can be used to assess risk to human infrastructure in the Arctic.  The postdoc Liu will gain educational experience by mentoring an undergraduate student in the Summer Research in Geoscience and Engineering program, and results will be disseminated to the public through the NSIDC All about Frozen Ground website and via lectures at the Fiske Planetarium and Boulder Public Library.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Permafrost defines much of the landscape of northern environments, such as the north slope of Alaska, much of Canada, and Siberia.  The active layer is the topmost part that freezes and thaws each year, so that it reflects changes in climate.  It also contributes a large amount of methane to the  atmosphere, itself adding to the greenhouse effect. We investigated changes in the dynamics of the active layer and the top layers of ice-rich permafrost on the North Slope of Alaska using Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) to measure surface deformation related to freezing and thawing of the active layer.  This remote sensing technology allows us to study this very large area without requiring logistically difficult and expensive ground campaigns.  We addressed three areas: 1) data processing, 2) algorithm/model development, and 3) field investigations.  We also compared the results of the field data to the remotely-sensed InSAR measurements of deformation, drawing upon the predictions of the models from step 2.   We used InSAR data from the ALOS-PALSAR instrument to investigate active layer thickness (ALT) in the region near the Toolik Lake Field Station and also the YK peninsula in Alaska. We derived ALT thickness maps for the two areas, and validated these InSAR-derived ALT measurements by taking in-situ measurements during field investigations each summer. We observed several items of note, each is summarized below.  (1) A consistent deformation pattern is observed in all interferograms:  a) The subsidence due to active layer thawing is the largest in late July. This implies that the active layer is likely totally thawed by then.  b) The total uplift between July-October is typically smaller than the subsidence between June-July. This means the active layer is not totally frozen by October and there is additional uplift post October.  c) The uplift between July and September is small compared to the uplift between September and October.  Thus we can treat July-September as the maximum ALT period. This agrees with air temperature dropping significantly in September. The boundary line between the frozen soil and thawed soil is moving upwards toward the ground. But the temperature remains above the freezing point, so the process of uplift between July and September is slow.  Our assumed seasonal subsidence model based on the square root of mean NADDT predicted a maximum subsidence in September, and predicts a non-negligible subsidence between day of year 210 (late July) and day 250 (early September). This is not consistent with what we observe as deformation in InSAR. Rather the active layer appears fully thawed and in thermal equilibrium much earlier than our current model predicts in the Toolik lake area.  We developed an improved seasonal deformation model, and find that this model fits the InSAR observations much more closely. The final average seasonal coefficients are around 3 cm, and going forward this will be used to estimate ALT from subsidence for the Toolik lake area.  (2) Long-term trend of permafrost degradation: We solved for any long-term trend using all interferograms that span exactly N years (N=1,2,3), using individual interferograms such as the 20061019-20091027 pair. We would expect that the seasonal component of subsidence would be small in these interferograms.  This analysis showed that in this region, there is no significant long-term change in the ALT between 2006-2010.  This added analysis also removed the artifactual east-west slope in we obtained in previous results.  We do observe that the uplift in October 2008 is larger than in October of the other years in our study, while the maximum subsidence in 2008 is similar to other years. Examination of the NADDT curve, in 2008, shows that NADDT reaches its maximum earlier than in other years. This means there are more days between time of the maximum subsidence and October. As a result, we see more uplift that year.  We also participated in several field experiments aimed at validating the subsidence-derived estimatres of ALT.  Two trips were to the north slope area, while the most recent trip was to the YK delta in southwest Alaska.  In each of these, we collected both mechanical probe and ground penetrating radar (GPR) estimates of the depth on frozen ground.  These data were used to calibrate and validate the radar-derived estimates.  Future work remains to correct the radar data for variations in soil moisture profiles and in organic layer thickness, both of which can confuse the ALT estimate.  This project has supported graduate student PhD research for two Stanford students, Albert Chen and Roger Michaelides.  It also supported in part postdoctoral training for three students, Lin Liu (now at the Chinese University of Hong Kong), Albert Chen (now at NASA JPL), and Ann Chen (leaving for U. Texas.  Two of the three postdocs on this study (Liu and A. Chen) have been appointed to academic faculty positions, a fantastic success rate.
