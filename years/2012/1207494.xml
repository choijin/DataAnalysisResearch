<AbstractNarration>TECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Shape memory alloys (SMAs) are materials with remarkable properties that stem from a martensitic transformation.  The crystallographic aspects of the martensitic transformation have been calculated and verified in a number of systems; however, there are fundamental aspects of shape memory and pseudoelastic behavior that are not understood.  Principal among these is how the matrix accommodates the large strain associated with the transformation.  Theoretically, accommodation may be achieved either by matrix plasticity or by inducing additional transformation variants.  With plentiful evidence for plasticity in the literature, understanding the mechanism of defect generation has become a critical component for mitigating functional fatigue in thermomechanical cycling applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By combining micromechanical testing, in situ and post mortem scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), and multi-scale computational modeling efforts, the current study aims to develop a more detailed picture of the microstructural evolution as a function of cycling.  The fundamental study of defect generation and multiplication is being facilitated by the observation of plastic deformation associated with individual martensite transformation modes in small volumes of material (micropillars).  By characterizing the defects generated during these isolated transformation events, the nature of the coupling between plasticity and the transformation is being illuminated.  The results from micromechanical testing are also compared to the substructure development observed in pure thermal and combined thermomechanical cycling via in situ STEM experiments.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This experimental work is being supplemented by microstructure-sensitive modeling at various length scales, including an Eshelby-type, variant-level prediction of the local stresses developed by specific martensite modes.  In previously published work, this model's output has shown remarkable agreement with the active slip systems observed experimentally.  This combination of a variety of novel experimental and computation techniques allows for an unprecedented insight into the fundamental mechanisms driving functional fatigue in NiTi-based SMAs and will eventually lead to more fatigue-resistant alloy design for future applications.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Shape memory alloys (SMAs), such as NiTi, are unique materials that are able to retain a "memory" of their original shape after cyclic heating or loading.  This makes these materials extremely attractive for applications in the medical industry such as stents and surgical devices, in the automotive industry as solid-state actuators, and in the technological world for use in micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS).  Unfortunately, these remarkable properties rapidly degrade with repeated cycling, making them unsuitable for many potential applications.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The current work is focused on studying the mechanisms of functional fatigue in NiTi-based shape memory alloys through the use of a variety of novel experimental techniques. By employing micromechanical testing, in situ and post mortem scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), and computational modeling, the study aims to develop a more detailed understanding of how the microstructure evolves with both mechanical and thermal cycling.  Specifically, this includes observation and analysis of the material?s behavior and resultant defect accumulation for pure mechanical cycling, pure thermal cycling, and combined thermomechanical conditions at different length scales.  In addition, this program facilitates industrial and international collaborations with General Motors Research and Development, the Ruhr University in Bochum, Germany, and others.  The results of this work will eventually aid in the development of fatigue-resistant alloys that can out-perform current state-of-the-art materials in demanding applications.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The three year GOALI project has enabled several significant advances in the shape memory alloy research being performed at the Ohio State University.  The primary goal has been to gain a mechanistic understanding of the microstructural evolution and resultant functional fatigue behavior of NiTi-based shape memory alloys.  These materials are currently limited in their potential applications due to the rapid cyclic degradation of their useful properties.  Experimental capabilities for micron-scale pillar compression testing have been developed and optimized, expanding the reach of the initial goals of this work.  In situ and ex situ, ambient and high temperature testing are now possible via the addition of a state-of-the-art nanoindentation system as well as a custom-built in situ scanning electron microscope (SEM) actuation assembly.  These novel mechanical tests are paired with scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) analysis of the post-compression microcrystals.  Preliminary results demonstrated the ability to isolate fundamental stress-induced martensite transformation events in FIB-machined micropillars with a 5 micron diameter.   Micromechanics-based modeling methodology based on the Eshelby inclusion method has been developed to utilize the phenomenological theory of martensite transformation for capturing the essential features of martensitic transformation. Using these techniques, the most favorable martensite plate to form under compressive loading of 5 micropillars can be determined. A new phase field-finite element method has been developed to capture the large sstrain mechanics of the autenite-martensite phase transformation and associated crystal plasticity driven by the phase transformation. The figure shows a key finding of the simulations: alternating sign plasticity is driven at the austenite-martensite interface. The publication HM Parajape, S Manchiraju, PM Anderson, Int. J. Plasticity 80: 1-18 (2016) details how the evolution of plasticity during thermal cycling can spatially refine martensite and shift the austenite-to-martensite transformation temperature. These key features of the simulations are in qualitative agreement with experimental observations of the effect of thermal cycling.  These experimental results and modeling efforts were the first of their kind to show a direct link between the martensite transformation behavior of shape memory alloys and the accumulation of crystal defects.  Further testing verified both the experimental and computational efforts for a variety of single crystal orientations.   In addition to the micropillar work, STEM observations of a variety of different thermomechanical test conditions have been made, including an in situ STEM heating study which revealed austenite defect substructure in material compositions that are fully martensitic at room temperature.    Modeling efforts at the bulk polycrystal scale include a systematic study of the grain to grain variation in axial transformation strain induced during pseudoelastic loading. Crystallographic orientation of the grains, grain neighborhood, polycrystalline texture and deformation history of the sample are identified as the principal factors affecting grain level axial transformation strain. Work is in progress to model the effects of compatibility across grain interfaces in samples with bimodal texture. This effort utilizes a micromechanics based finite element (FE) model to simulate the performance of polycrystalline shape memory alloys.  Finally,a remarkable evolution of grain structure has been confirmed to occur during load-biased thermal cycling in NiTi.   The fundamental source of this microstructure evolution is presently being investigated and may have important implications for understanding of open-loop strain (i.e. "walking") as well as the interpretation of x-ray synchrotron and neutron diffraction experiments on this phenomenon.  Industrial and international collaborative efforts including those with NASA Glenn Research Center, General Motors Research and Development and Ruhr University in Bochum, Germany have also been facilitated by this funding opportunity and will continue to grow with future work.
