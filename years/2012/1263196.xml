<AbstractNarration>This three year REU Site program is a collaborative effort between Texas A&amp;M University (TAMU) and the University of Texas at Brownsville (UTB).  The undergraduate students will engage in hands-on research projects related to energy and propulsion. Specific topics include alternative fuels combustion, materials for energy conversion and storage, biodiesel fuels, advanced energy conversion using supercritical CO2, wind energy research, and hypersonic propulsion, among others. In addition to the scientific research that will be performed, the approach utilized in this site will provide valuable data toward the effect of longer-term research experiences on the tendency of the participants to ultimately pursue advanced degrees.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This REU site will impact society in two major ways: 1) through the involvement of undergraduate students in scientific research, encouraging them to pursue advanced degrees in science and engineering; and 2) the energy-related research will potentially benefit thousands of people through alternative sources and improved, less-polluting combustion devices. With regard to the first major impact, the proposed site will provide experiences for thirty to forty undergraduate students. Special emphasis will be given to the recruitment of underrepresented ethnic minorities and women from universities in Texas that are not major research institutions, thus providing research opportunities to students who might not otherwise have them. In addition, first- and second-year students will be encouraged to participate.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;"The site is co-funded by the Department of Defense in partnership with the NSF REU program."</AbstractNarration>

In large part, the reasoning behind this overall philosophy stems from the accumulated experiences of the PI and others.     As mentioned above, the theme of the REU site was energy and propulsion research. The nature of the research involved and the team that was assembled provided a variety of projects that were topical, multidisciplinary, and ideal for giving the UG participants experiences that will encourage them to enter graduate school. The projects all have a firm footing in energy and propulsion science and engineering, but spanned a range of disciplines including mechanical engineering, chemistry, materials science, aerospace engineering, and chemical engineering.   Intellectual Merit: Several established research groups at Texas A&amp;M University were involved in new and novel research related to energy and propulsion science. Specific topics included plasmas for alternative hydrocarbon fuel production, lithium ion batteries, biomass combustion, engine exhaust particulate filtration, hypersonic propulsion, solid oxide fuel cells, nanomaterials for energy applications, building AC efficiency, laser diagnostics for reacting flows, and advanced rocket propellants, among others. At least 30 journal and conferences publications have resulted from the site to date (over 2 consecutive REU grants). A total of 54 students participated in the main 10-week summer sites, and 15 students participated in the year-round research on campus (at TAMU and UT Brownsville); the projects involved 16 different faculty mentors and their graduate students.  Broader Impact: This REU site impacted society in two major ways: 1) through the involvement of undergraduate students in scientific research, encouraging them to pursue advanced degrees in science and engineering; and 2) the energy-related research will potentially benefit thousands of people through alternative sources and improved, less-polluting combustion devices. Special emphasis was given to the recruitment of ethnic minorities and women from universities in Texas that are not major research institutions, thus providing research opportunities to students who might not otherwise have them. Overall, a total of 54 undergraduate students participated in the five main summer sites. The main recruit&shy;ing objective of favoring students from non-research universities was attained, with 87% of the participants orig&shy;in&shy;ating from non-research&shy;-oriented schools. In fact, this relatively high num&shy;ber is despite the fact that about 1-2 students each year were by default from the PIÆs home institution TAMU, where some of the year-round parti&shy;c&shy;i&shy;pants were also involv&shy;ed in the summer REU (see below).       Another successful out&shy;come of the previous REU grants was the fact that 50% of the partici&shy;pants were in the minority student cate&shy;gory. The largest percentage included Hispanic students (24 out of the 27 minority students). When compared to the fact that nationally there is an average Hispanic enrollment of 11% in UG engineering, the 44% level herein is 4&times; the national average.
