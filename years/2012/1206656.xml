<AbstractNarration>NON-TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION: Hydrogen is an attractive fuel for energy production because it has a high energy density and its combustion generates only water vapor, leaving no carbon bearing or radioactive by-products.  However, unlike fossil or nuclear fuels, it cannot be mined from the earth; hydrogen must be synthesized. Photolysis, or light-driven water-splitting, is a promising renewable method to synthesize hydrogen.  However, the best currently available processes are inefficient and, because of this, they are not competitive with conventional fuel sources.  One of the fundamental problems is that no single material possesses the combination of properties needed to efficiently split water.  This project is based on the idea that a composite, that combines materials with synergistic properties, will be able to catalyze water photolysis more efficiently and currently available materials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TECHNICAL DETAILS: This project aims to test the hypothesis that by controlling charges at interfaces in oxide heterostructures, it is possible to build in mechanisms to separate photogenerated electron-hole pairs and thereby increase the efficiency of photolysis (water-splitting).  The project builds upon recent discoveries of the composite catalyst effect for enhanced photochemical reactivity and has the ultimate goal of developing a sustainable fuel source.  The hypothesis is being tested by studying a combination of planar oxide heterostructures, ideal for controlled measurements, and heterostructured oxide powders that would be required for any practical implementation.   Fe2O3 and TiO2 films will be supported on a variety of ABO3-type substrates (for example, LaAlO3, SrTiO3, BaTiO3, PbTiO3, BiFeO3, and FeTiO3); by choosing the appropriate phase and orientation, it is possible to control the spectral range of absorption, the carrier type, and whether or not there is a potential difference at the interface deriving from ferroelectricity, polar terminations.  The effects of band offsets will also be explored in compounds in the pseudo-binary Cu2O-Fe2O3 system.  Cross sectional scanning potential (Kelvin probe) microscopy is being used to map potential differences at the buried interfaces and these measurements are being compared to photoelectrochemical measures of reactivity and efficiency.  Experiments are also being conducted to examine the effects of length scale on the properties of the heterostructures.  The research will be an integral part of the education of graduate and undergraduate Materials Science and Engineering students.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Hydrogen is an attractive fuel for energy production because it has a high energy density and its combustion generates only water vapor, leaving no carbon bearing or radioactive by-products.  However, unlike fossil or nuclear fuels, it cannot be mined from the earth; hydrogen must be synthesized. Light-driven water-splitting is a promising renewable method to synthesize hydrogen.  However, the best currently available processes are inefficient and, because of this, they are not competitive with conventional fuel sources.  One of the fundamental problems is that no single material possesses the combination of properties needed to efficiently split water.  Therefore, this project aimed at developing composite water-splitting catalysts.  The intellectual merit of the project is embodied in the results of the experiments and simulations that were carried out.  For example, a variety of metal-oxide composites (combinations of multiple ceramic materials) were synthesized and their photochemical reactivities were measured.  A computational model was created to better understand the relationship between materials properties, reaction conditions, and the efficiency of water-splitting.  One outcome is that the results made it possible to define the structural parameters necessary to create efficient composite catalysts.  Another outcome is the discovery that ferroelastic materials have polar surface properties that can increase the efficiency of photochemical reactions.  A third outcome is the development of microscopic methods that make it possible to relate measured surface potentials to photochemical reactivity.  Finally, the computation model developed as part of this project was used to predict that more efficient composite photocatalysts can be created by appropriate choice of the co-catalyst and control of the reaction conditions.  The project had broader impact through the education and training of students in materials science and engineering.  The project supported the doctoral dissertations of three students.  The project also supported the involvement of six undergraduate students and three masters student.  The findings of the project have been disseminated through a number of archival publications, doctoral dissertations, and presentations at international scientific conferences.
