<AbstractNarration>This Cyber-Physical Systems project designs and evaluates a foundational information substrate for efficient, agile, model-driven, human-centered building systems. The approach is to develop software-defined buildings, to shatter existing stovepipe architectures, dramatically reduce the effort to add new functions and applications without ?forklift upgrades,? and expand communications and control capabilities beyond a single stand-alone building to enable groups of buildings to behave cooperatively and in cooperation with the energy grid.  We investigate how such Software-Defined Buildings can be founded on a flexible, multi-service and open Building Integrated Operating System (BIOS) that allows applications to run reliably in safe, sandboxed environments. It supports sensor and actuator access, access management, metadata, archiving, and discovery, as well as multiple simultaneously executing programs. Building operators retain supervisory management, controlling application separation physically (access different controls), temporally (change controls at different times), informationally (what information leaves the building), and logically (what actions or sequences thereof are allowable). We construct, deploy, and demonstrate the capabilities of a prototype BIOS in the context of university, residential buildings and closely related industrial processes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Making buildings more efficient, while keeping occupants comfortable, productive, and healthy, is critical to our economy and health. Transforming buildings into agile, human centered cyber-physical systems eliminates waste, while allowing them to be a proactive resource on the electric grid with zero emission renewable supplies. And by providing greater value from the same physical plant, the SDB approach can move beyond cost-to-build and cost-to-operate metrics to broader return-on-investment for new extendable ?future-proof? technologies.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The project designed and implemented a foundational information substrate for cyberphysical systems in a concrete, canonical form - creation of efficient, agile, model-driven, human-centered building systems. Modern commercial buildings provide increasingly integrated Building Management Systems, but are typically closed or based on proprietary interfaces, are difficult to extend, and it is expensive to add new capabilities. Software Defined Buildings address the research challenge of how to extend the building "machine," to harness emerging technological trends, making buildings better, more capable, more efficient, and better citizens of a smart grid and smart city.    Our approach was to develop an Extensible Building Operating System and Services - xBOSS - through multiple design iterations.  It allows 3rd party applications to run reliably in a safe, sandboxed environment, supports sensor and actuator access, access management, metadata, archiving, and discovery, as well as multiple simultaneously executing programs.  We constructed, deploy, and demonstrate the capabilities of our prototypes in the context of university, residential, and industrial buildings.  The principled design of such a design addresses six primary dimensions: (1) Hardware Presentation Layer, (2) Canonical Metadata Definition, Storage, and Usage, (3) Control Process Management, (4) Building Evolution Management, (5) Security: Authorization and Authentication, and (6) Scalable UX and API.  We found that automated metadata acquisition and the lack of established standards for representing suitably complete, expressive, and flexible metadata descriptions was a fundamental barrier.  We overcame this with active learning under guidance of a building expert and a new semantic representation, BRICK, and in the process developed new query processing technology.  We developed foundational technology, including scalable time-series query processing, fully distributed authentication across multiple administrative domains, denial of service protection, metadata query processing, heterogeneous distributed driver management, and advanced model-driven and predicitve control.  We developed an intuitive system for users to control services and appliances in a smart building by pointing a smartphone and the entity to control, automatically receiving means of interaction, and click.  We developed well-connected thermal microzone devices that report real-time telemetry and respond to programmatic actuation requests and showed how these can be synergistically combined with occupant-aware building applications to enable new methods of comfort and energy efficiency.  We developed new set of primitives encompassing syndication, security, and service execution that unifies the management of applications and services across the built environment, while enabling participants to individually delegate privilege across multiple administrative domains with no loss of security or manageability. We further sought to leverage a decentralized authorization syndication platform to extend the design of building operating systems beyond the single administrative domain of a building.  We developed a synergistic integration of systems for smart buildings and the emerging Internet of Things, recognizing that these devices are specialized in ways reflecting the ?thing? they are a part of, that distinctive ensembles of connected things will provide rich functionality as natural-to-use applications and services, that space and proximity matter, as they dictate context and delineate boundaries of applicability, trust, and authority, and that all of this will leverage the deep storage and processing resources of the cloud, as well as its potentially global visibility.    We sought to bring awareness of the ways that Information technology can increase energy efficiency by improving the control of energy-using devices and systems to communities far from IT, in the field and in policy positions, such as the California Energy Commission.
