<AbstractNarration>This California State University San Marcos (CSUSM) Noyce Teacher Scholars: Building Upon a Learning Assistant Model project  encourages highly qualified mathematics and science students to pursue teaching careers through the collaborative efforts of CSUSM School of Education and College of Science and Mathematics.  The program focuses on recruiting 38 CSUSM mathematics and science undergraduates to the CSUSM credential program and building on efforts to promote careers in teaching via an existing Learning Assistants Program (LAP). The project includes three specific activities: a scholarship program, early teaching experiences, and a STEM Summer Credential Program. There are existing partnerships and funded activities, including efforts to expand the LAP to nearby Palomar Community College, all of which support the recruiting efforts. Local K-12 school districts and professional development organizations support internships and induction for credential candidates and new teachers.  The project employs proven approaches and leverages existing activities and partnerships, while building on model programs implemented at CSUSM by the PIs.  Understanding the ways the LAP model can serve as a fulcrum for enhanced STEM teacher recruitment and how students come to decide whether to pursue a career in teaching are valuable outcomes for the STEM teacher preparation knowledge base.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The shortage of math and science teachers nationally has been long identified. California is not an exception. A 2016 survey of 211 California school districts showed that 58% of the districts had a math-teacher shortage, and 57% a science-teacher shortage. The teacher workforce demand continues to grow, but the science and math teacher supply has not kept up. K-12 students deserve not any teachers but high-quality teachers who know their subject areas, are passionate about teaching, and care about students.</p> <p>To help address the need for recruiting high-quality math and science teachers, California State University San Marcos (CSUSM) received a grant from the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program of the National Science Foundation. The primary goal of the project was to encourage talented science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) undergraduate students and STEM professionals to become high school and middle school math and science teachers. The project provided scholarships, early teaching experience, teacher credential training, mentorships, and a supportive network. Since 2013, the project has successfully recruited 49 math and science teachers for high-need school districts (25 female; 24 male). Specifically, 20 are in math, 13 biology, 8 chemistry, 5 physics, and 3 other sciences. Of the 44 reporting race/ethnicity, 31 are White (70%), 9 Hispanic/Latino (20%), 3 Asian (7%), and 1 American Indian (2%).</p> <p>The project has broader impacts. It has produced the above-mentioned high-quality STEM teachers who can work with English learners and diverse students. They help alleviate a teacher shortage. Among them, the 10 teachers from Hispanic/Latino and American Indian cultures are a part of a growing pool of underrepresented racial minorities in the STEM teaching workforce. They become role models for California?s diverse K-12 students. Many teachers in the project have reported instances of inspiring students to learn science and math and consider a career in STEM areas.</p> <p>In addition, the project has created a model for STEM teacher recruitment and support at a higher education institution. This model has a few key components. First, early teaching experience (such as leading discussion groups, tutoring peers, and working with middle school students in afterschool programs) encourages some STEM undergraduates to consider education and eventually enter the teaching profession. Second, it takes a village to recruit and nurture STEM teachers. The project has developed a strong relationship among STEM undergraduates, STEM faculty, and education faculty to guide young STEM majors through a challenging course of study and help them persevere in their pursuit of knowledge and skills for teaching. The models for faculty teamwork, collaboration with school districts, and Noyce teachers support can provide insights for other institutions</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 03/29/2019<br>      Modified by: Rong-Ji&nbsp;Chen</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1240124/1240124_10200072_1553909616743_IMG_3342adj--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1240124/1240124_10200072_1553909616743_IMG_3342adj--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Noyce teacher scholars at a conference"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1240124/1240124_10200072_1553909616743_IMG_3342adj--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Noyce teacher scholars at a conference"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Noyce teacher scholars attended the 2019 Western Region Noyce Conference at University of Arizona.
