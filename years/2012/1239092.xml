<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;#1239092&lt;br/&gt;Maynard&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal is to provide participant travel support for a workshop to initiate the development and implementation of minimum nanomaterial characterization reporting requirements within regulatory and development communities. The workshop is part of a project (NanoCharacter)developed and led by the Center for Risk Science Innovation and Application (RSIA) at the&lt;br/&gt;International Life sciences Institute (ILSI) Research Foundation.  Despite increasing research on the environmental and health impacts of engineered nanomaterials, progress in ensuring the safety of emerging materials and products remains limited by poor&lt;br/&gt;material characterization in published studies and minimal adoption of characterization standards and guidelines within the research community. The NanoCharacter project is developing a framework and roadmap detailing what needs to be done to improve the quality and utility of nanomaterial impact research through encouraging the adoption of characterization consistency within particular&lt;br/&gt;study domains; building consensus on the roadmap internationally, across stovepipes, and across stakeholders, and establishing a multi-stakeholder panel to monitor and report out the implementation of the roadmap and to adapt the roadmap as necessary to facilitate adoption of consistent characterization and reporting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The planned workshop will be held between August and October 2012 at the National Institute for Environmental Health Sciences in Research Triangle Park, NC (the precise dates are dependent on facility and participant availability). It will provide the NanoCharacter project?s Steering Committee and Expert Panel with a forum to engage with leaders from academia, government and regulatory agencies, standard setting bodies and editors of the key publishing houses in order to solicit and consider input from those who are most likely to affect the successful implementation of any such framework.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Outputs of the workshop will include a framework and roadmap for developing and implementing minimum nanomaterial characterization reporting requirements. This will be a standalone document for publication and will be developed by project teams over the subsequent months.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit of the proposed activity: Rigorous, reproducible research into nanomaterial-biological&lt;br/&gt;interactions is critically dependent on relevant and consistent materials physicochemical characterization. Likewise, the value of a growing body of research in this area depends on accepted characterization approaches and procedures. The proposed activity will strengthen significantly the quality and value of research undertaken in this domain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts resulting from the proposed activity: Sustainable and responsible commercialization of products that utilize engineered nanomaterials depends on sound risk evaluation. This activity will further strengthen the basis for such evaluations, nationally and internationally.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ While engineered nanomaterials hold tremendous promise for helping address challenges ranging from energy security to disease treatment and prevention, their effective use continues to be held back through a lack of understanding of the potential risks to health and the environment - and how to reduce or avoid them.  A major factor limiting safe development and use is poor characterization of materials in risk studies.  Without knowing the precise nature of the material being studied, it is difficult - and sometimes impossible - to replicate results or to interpret them.  And this in turn makes characterizing and managing potential impacts associated with a specific nanomaterial or nanomaterial-containing product equally difficult.  Organized by the International Life Sciences Research Foundation under the NanoCharacter initiative and co-organized by the University of Michigan Risk Science Center, this workshop brought together a group of international experts to develop a roadmap that would help ensure effective nanomaterial characterization - and in the process support the safe, sustainable and economically viable commercialization of nanomaterial-based products.  The workshop participants identified fourteen "elements" that are key to effective nanomaterial characterization.  These  covered the purpose of characterization and reporting; the infrastructure necessary to ensure effective characterization and reporting; the economics of implementing characetrization and reporting requirements; and fostering a culture of appropriate characterization and reporting.  A key conclusion of the workshop was that working within areas of influence between these elements may provide the greatest traction in moving toward a culture of characetrization that supports effective, safe and sustainable commercialization.  Next steps leading on from the workshop include publishing the findings of the workshop, and further developing and implementing the roadmap.
