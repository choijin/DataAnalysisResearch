<AbstractNarration>One of the most elusive questions in the study of fault mechanics is how much shear&lt;br/&gt;stress faults sustain, which is a necessary parameter for a full description of the rupture&lt;br/&gt;process. Because frictional slip generates heat, measuring the temperature increase of&lt;br/&gt;fault zones above background temperatures can elucidates the strength of the fault. Here&lt;br/&gt;we describe a new paleothermometer that can establish time-temperature histories for&lt;br/&gt;faults hosted in sedimentary rocks by examining the thermal maturity of organic&lt;br/&gt;molecules within the fault. This technique is widely applied in petroleum geochemistry&lt;br/&gt;to determine burial heating. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigators will establish a new paleothermometer for fault zones by&lt;br/&gt;repurposing an existing paleothermometer used to establish long duration heating&lt;br/&gt;associated with burial. Quantifying the frictional heating in a fault zone will allow them to&lt;br/&gt;constrain fault and earthquake parameters like shear stress along a fault during failure and&lt;br/&gt;slip of the largest event. In order to extend the time-temperature range of this&lt;br/&gt;paleothermometer and establish thermal maturity indices at the short time scales and high temperatures that fault rocks experience during earthquakes, the investigators will design and conduct rapid heating experiments on organic-rich sedimentary rocks at various combinations of time and temperature relevant to seismic heating and determine the kinetic parameters of these reactions at short time scales.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Measurement of the coseismic friction is critical for determining the conditions under which an earthquake can expand into a major, societally significant event. This work will devise a new way to directly measure friction from slip on faults.&lt;br/&gt;Furthermore, two early career scientists will be funded.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ One of the most elusive questions in the study of fault mechanics is how much shear stress faults sustain, which is a necessary parameter for a full description of the rupture process.  Because frictional slip generates heat, measuring the temperature increase of fault zones above background temperatures can elucidate the strength of the fault.  Here we describe a new paleothermometer that can establish time-temperature histories for faults hosted in sedimentary rocks by examining the thermal maturity of organic molecules within the fault.  This technique is widely applied in petroleum geochemistry to determine burial heating and the generation of petroleum.  In this project we conducted laboratory experiments to evaluate the utility of molecular thermal maturity measurements at the timescales and temperatures relevant to frictional heating along faults.  We extended the time-temperature range of experimental thermal maturity investigations to the minutes to hours and high temperatures that fault rocks experience during earthquakes.     Specifically we:   1)    Designed and build a laboratory apparatus for the rapid and controlled heating of rocks in a confined vessel under fully water-saturated conditions  (hydrous pyrolysis) likely experienced along faults during earthquakes.   2)    Conducted rapid heating experiments on organic-rich sedimentary rocks at various combinations of time and temperature relevant to seismic heating.  3)    Determined the kinetic parameters of these reactions at short time scales.  Intellectual merit: We established a new paleothermometer for fault zones by repurposing an existing technique used to measure slow heating and petroleum generation associated with burial in sedimentary basins.  Quantifying the frictional heating in a fault zone will allow us to constrain fault and earthquake parameters like shear stress along a fault during failure and slip of the largest event.  Ultimately such constraints will provide a better understanding of how faults fail and slip during earthquakes.   Broader impacts: Measurement of the coseismic friction is critical for determining the conditions under which an earthquake can expand into a major, societally significant event.  This work devised a new way to directly measure friction from slip on faults.  Furthermore, two early career scientists were funded. An externally funded undergraduate was exposed to an active research environment and learned geochemical techniques. This kind of experience is important for entraining students into the academic pipeline, especially at a large university.
