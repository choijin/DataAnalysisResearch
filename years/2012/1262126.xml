<AbstractNarration>This funding establishes a new CISE Research Experiences for Undergraduates&lt;br/&gt;(REU) site at Utah State University.  The project, called&lt;br/&gt;Bug Wars, exposes students to research on software testing and AI&lt;br/&gt;planning through both competition and collaboration.  This project will&lt;br/&gt;create new knowledge about user-session-based testing, model-based&lt;br/&gt;testing with AI planning, and the combination of these two techniques&lt;br/&gt;as applied to web applications.   A novel feature of this REU is that&lt;br/&gt;it encourages both competition and collaboration. The students initially&lt;br/&gt;split into two teams that strive to find the most faults in web application&lt;br/&gt;systems under test. One team collects, reduces, and prioritizes&lt;br/&gt;user-session-based test suites. A second team uses machine learning to&lt;br/&gt;build models of the software and AI planning to generate test suites.&lt;br/&gt;Students compete to show the merits of their approach on the same systems&lt;br/&gt;by considering the sizes and fault detection effectiveness of their&lt;br/&gt;test suites.  The students then critically discuss their work and propose&lt;br/&gt;combining the different approaches to further improve effectiveness.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this research are that twenty-four students over a&lt;br/&gt;three-year period have the opportunity to participate in a supportive&lt;br/&gt;environment that encourages them to pursue graduate studies in Computer&lt;br/&gt;Science. The students are better prepared for graduate school as they gain&lt;br/&gt;basic research skills, including the formulation of research questions,&lt;br/&gt;design of experiments, critical evaluation, and written and oral&lt;br/&gt;communication.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This REU Site provided 30 undergraduate Computer Science students with an undergraduate research experience in the area of Software Testing. Each cohort of students worked together in a collaborative and competitive environment that exposed them to research and encouraged them to pursue graduate studies as our country needs more expertise in the area of Computer Science.     The research contributions include three areas. First, some students made contributions in the area of test suite prioritization for user-session-based testing of web applications. Specifically, we found techniques to increase the rate of fault finding effectiveness for different subject web applications. Second, some students made contributions in the area of test suite generation for web applications, employing novel AI-based strategies for the purpose of increasing fault detection.  Indeed, software defects cost billions of dollars to our economy, so novel Software Testing techniques are sorely needed and this research has the potential to have a high impact. In addition to the two major research projects and contributions, some students also contributed to the "Bug Catcher" system for Software Testing Competitions and ran competitions with high school students.  The last project allowed the students to not only reach out to younger students to help engage them in our field, but also provided the REU students with leadership opportunities and a small feel for the reward of being in a leadership role within academia.     Students in this program became better prepared for graduate school as they gained basic research skills, including the ability to formulate research questions, set up experimental designs, critically evaluate research, and practice with written and oral communication.
