<AbstractNarration>The Tech Topology Conference is an annual conference held at the Georgia Institute of Technology and the second edition of the conference will run form December 7 to 9, 2012. This new conference in geometry and topology has an emphasis on highlighting and enhancing research being done in the Southeast US. We will have seven speakers, in the areas of contact topology, Heegaard-Floer theory, 4 manifold topology, and knot theory; and we will have participants from across the southeast as well as the rest of the country. Over the past few years, there has been an incredible amount of cross-fertilization between the fields of surface topology, contact topology, knot theory, and 4 manifold theory. At this conference, we will have specialists in each of these areas, whose work lies at the interface of two more more of these areas. As such, the conference will be a fertile ground for new ideas in geometry and topology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main goals of the conference are (1) To provide a high-profile geometry-topology conference to the Southeast that brings leaders of the field to the area as well as showcases the high quality mathematics being done in the Southeast, and (2) To provide a convenient meeting place for Southeastern researchers and students to gather, discuss, research, and interact with leading mathematicians from across the country. This conference will be a valuable learning environment for graduate students and junior faculty in the Southeast, and will help raise the profile of the region. We will provide ample time for the participants to meet, formally and informally, for example during long breaks between talks and organized discussion sessions. We plan to post notes from all the talks on the conference web site. More information can be found on the conference web site: http://ttc.gatech.edu.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This grant funded the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th annual Tech Topology Conference, a new annual conference whose primary aim is to promote the Geometry/Topology community in the Southeast. This is accomplished by bringing in leading mathematicians from around the country to give lectures and interact with the local participants, and also by providing a highly visible platform for local participants to present their results.  Intellectual Merit: These three instances of the conference have help establish it as high profile annual conference. The speakers for these conferences were: 2012 - Inanc Baykur (Max Planck Institute), Joan Birman (Columbia University), Jeff Brock (Brown University), Matt Hedden (Michigan State University), Sarah Koch (Harvard University), Jeremy Van Horn-Morris (University of Arkansas), Rebecca Winarski (Georgia Tech); 2013 - John Baldwin (Boston College), Tim Cochran (Rice University), Alan Diaz (Georgia Tech), Robert Gompf (University of Texas, Austin), Robert Lipshitz (University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill),  Thomas Mark (University of Virginia), Susan Williams (University of South Alabama); 2014 - Danny Calegari (University of Chicago), James Conway (Georgia Institute of Technology), Laura DeMarco (Northwestern University), Nathan Dunfield (University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign), Chris Leininger (University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign), Kathryn Mann (University of California, Berkeley), Laura Starkston (University of Texas at Austin).  The topics of the lectures ranged from geometric group theory to dynamics and fractals to knot theory and contact topology.  Broader Impacts: Of the 21 total speakers we have had 7 women, 9 Southeasterners, 4 graduate students, and 2 postdocs. Each conference had around 50 or more participants and the majority of the non-speark funded participants were graduate students and postdocs. The schedule allowed for ample interaction among the participants. In addition many of the graduate students managed to talk with senior mathematicians about their thesis projects. All of these interactions contributed to the intellectual merit and broader impacts of the conference. To enable a wider and more long term benefit we posted notes from most of the talks on the conference website making them widely accessible.
