<AbstractNarration>The project is developing a multidisciplinary, multi-campus program minor in 'energy science, technology, and policy', through a unique regional partnership consisting of public and private four-year and two-year colleges. Project objectives include: 1) successful design and implementation of a multi-institution energy education program that is leveraging institutional academic strengths and access to student populations at the different campuses; 2) design of a program valuable for students in both technical (i.e. architecture, engineering, and science) and non-technical (i.e. business, accounting, and general studies) majors, at both two-year and four-year colleges; 3) enhancement of STEM learning through multidisciplinary curricula, experiential learning through&lt;br/&gt;internships and research, and incorporation of stakeholder input in course and program development; and 4) recruitment and retention of students from underrepresented and underserved populations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is enhancing collaboration with STEM education community and  is helping to promote the two- to four-year college transition and beyond. By coordinating the program across multiple campuses, the project is facilitating articulation among institutions. Several of the schools involved have large populations of students traditionally underrepresented in STEM fields, and all have significant programs aimed at recruitment and retention. The project is working to increase participation from those groups significantly.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Collaborative Research: A Novel Multidisciplinary, Multi-campus  Undergraduate Minor to Enhance STEM Learning in Energy Science,  Technology and Policy  The project involved the interaction of six public and private campuses (four four-year institutions and two community colleges) to develop curricula and programs in energy science, technology and policy. The programs developed under this project leveraged resources at all the campuses to provide students with coursework intended to enhance their understanding of basic scientific concepts related to energy production, distribution and use, and introduce them to basic engineering fundamentals in sustainable energy.  Today, the multi-disciplinary program trains the students in a systems-based approach to energy technology, and enhanced understanding of how to analyze energy policy decisions (including the impact of technical, economic and regulatory factors). Several online and hybrid courses have been developed as part of this project to allow for enhanced cross-registration between campuses. Overall, courses developed or selected for the program introduce students to emergent energy technologies (including the smart grid and infrastructure systems of the future), probabilistic risk assessment, and the dynamics of various energy markets, including understanding changing energy needs on a local to a global scale.  Data from surveys, combined with evidence from student portfolios and feedback from stakeholders, show how students in the programs gain in their understanding of key concepts and how associated experiential activities, including internships, research experiences and exposure to real-world case studies, enhance authenticity in energy education and prepare students to meet the challenges of creating and using emerging technological solutions to energy needs.  The project has achieved its key objectives:  The successful design and implementation of a multi-institution energy education program, leveraging institutional academic strengths and access to student populations at the different campuses. Design of a program valuable for students in both technical (i.e. architecture, engineering, and science) and non-technical (i.e. business, accounting, and general studies) majors, at both community and four year colleges. Enhancement of STEM learning through multidisciplinary curricula, experiential learning through internships and research, and incorporation of stakeholder (academic, industrial, legislative) input in course and program development. Recruitment and retention, as well as learning gains in STEM skills and knowledge, of students from underrepresented and underserved populations, as well as non-traditional students who follow non- linear (e.g. multi-institution) academic paths.
