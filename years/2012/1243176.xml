<AbstractNarration>The investigators will quantify the impact on the ionosphere by thunderstorm activity through coupling from below in the form of lightning, acoustic waves, and gravity waves. Thunderstorms, lightning, and gravity waves are the primary known sources of coupling from the troposphere to the ionosphere and thermosphere, but their impacts are not well quantified. This program aims to quantify the effects of thunderstorms on the D-, E-, and F-regions of the ionosphere through electromagnetic, gravity, and acoustic waves. In particular, this program aims to address the effects of thunderstorm activity on sporadic-E layers, which are a dominant source of satellite-to-ground communication disruption. This program will utilize Very Low Frequency (VLF) narrowband and broadband data, together will optical measurements, to assess the impact of these sources on the D-region ionosphere and provide estimates of lightning-driven electric field magnitudes in the D- and E- regions. Simultaneously, GPS, ionosonde, radar, and optical observations will be used to assess the impacts of thunderstorm activity on the E- and F-regions. The Arecibo incoherent scatter radar and St. Croix coherent scatter radar will be used to assess thunderstorm effects on these ionospheric regions. Existing finite-difference and full-wave propagation models will be used to compare observations to theory. The Ph.D thesis of one graduate student will be supported by the program, and the data collected will be used by several other graduate students in the group. Data collected in this program will also be made available to the scientific community. Results of the program will benefit society through enhanced understanding of the interaction between tropospheric weather and space weather. The program will also enhance the scientific infrastructure at Arecibo and St. Croix through an advnaced photometer and VLF/LF receivers.</AbstractNarration>
