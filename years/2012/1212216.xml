<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Our overarching goals in our project are to improve remote-sensing wind-measurement methods, and to examine the time-dependent atmospheric dynamics of Jupiter and Saturn.  Jupiter and Saturn both have extremely active atmospheres that harbor many jetstreams that blow in east-west directions, and vortices that drift between the jets. The dynamics of these atmospheric jets and vortices can be measured using space-based remote sensing instruments through analysis of the temporal evolution of the clouds. The horizontal motions of the clouds yield information about the horizontal wind vectors. New clouds appear where there is vertical upwelling, while clouds tend to disappear where there is a downwelling.

Specific goals of our project are to develop and improve a new cloud-tracking analysis code using modern image-processing methods, and to make atmospheric dynamics measurements on Jupiter and Saturn.  The goal to improve cloud-tracking wind measurement tools have been achieved through an effort to improve the quantification of the measurement uncertainties.
