<AbstractNarration>The goal of this project is to extend the theoretical and methodological construct of noticing to develop the concept of reciprocal noticing, a process by which teacher and student noticing are shared.  The researcher argues that through reciprocal noticing the classroom can become the space for more equitable mathematics learning, particularly for language learners. Thus, the focus of the project is on developing the concept of reciprocal noticing as a way to support better interactions between teachers and Latino/a students in elementary mathematics classrooms. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project uses a transformative teaching experiment methodology and is guided by the initial conjectures that to make mathematics classrooms intellectually attractive places, Latino/a students and teachers need to learn to develop common resources for teaching and learning mathematics, and that reciprocal noticing as a process supports teachers and students in developing these common resources for teaching and learning mathematics. The project design centers around two research questions:How do teachers and Latino/a students tune to each other's mathematical ideas and explicitly indicate to one another how their ideas are important for discourse that promotes mathematical reasoning in classrooms characterized by reciprocal noticing? What patterns emerge across four classrooms when teachers and Latino/a students engage in reciprocal noticing?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The concept of reciprocal noticing can significantly enhance emerging research in mathematics education about the importance of teacher noticing.  Further, this revised concept of noticing can transform mathematics classroom to better support English Language Learners.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI will incorporate project findings and videos into methods courses for preservice elementary teachers.</AbstractNarration>
