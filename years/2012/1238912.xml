<AbstractNarration>The Targeted Infusion Project entitled - Engaging Minority Students in Software Engineering Through Active Learning - seeks to adapt and implement industry practices in a software engineering course. The project will construct, teach, and assess a course that immerses students in realworld software engineering practices through active learning. Students will work in an interactive environment in which they are instructed on new techniques and then mentored in the use of those techniques through a series of hands-on exercises. The faculty at Alabama State University will work in collaboration with the software engineering faculty at Auburn University to develop a software process that fits the educational environment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objectives of the project are to adapt software development industry best practices to classroom use; incorporate software development tools into a student-friendly software development environment; develop innovative learning materials and teaching strategies for integrating and effectively using software industry best practices in software engineering courses through active learning; Beta-test instructional material; analyze achievement of outcomes through student and industry feedback; and develop a web portal to provide communication and dissemination for the project community as well for other HBCU's and computing educators.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is expected that this project to have a significant impact on how software engineering courses are taught and how students learn these concepts. The development of learning materials and teaching strategies will be guided through the participation of faculty from diverse institutions, including high schools, two-year and four-year colleges, and of industrial practitioners.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Background  Universities teach undergraduate students how to write computer software; but that is only a small part of what is required of graduates when they enter the workforce. Industry demands a much broader perspective: that of being equipped with technical skills in identifying requirements, designing a suitable solution, implementing the solution in software, validating that the software satisfies requirements; as well as being equipped with business skills such as estimating cost, monitoring progress, measuring effectiveness, etc. Students who are inculcated with such software engineering skills are more attractive to employers that just have software-coding abilities.  Objectives  1) to adapt software development industry best practices for classroom use; 2) to incorporate software development tools into a student-friendly software development environment; 3) to develop innovative learning materials and teaching strategies for integrating and effectively using software industry best practices in software engineering courses through active learning; 4) to beta-test instructional material; 5) to analyze achievement of outcomes, student feedback, industry feedback; and 6) to develop a web portal to provide communication and dissemination for the project community as well other HBCU?s and computing educators.  Major Activities  The primary goal of our project is to advance the state of education for software developers by adapting and implementing software industry best practices in the classroom. In this project, we constructed, taught, and assessed a course that immerses students in real world software engineering practices through active learning. Our course walked students through producing a working solution by having them use a one-person process, known as practitioner-centered software engineering (PCSE), developed specifically to apply cutting-edge industry techniques at each point in the software lifecycle. The process was taught incrementally throughout the course, starting with techniques that enhance writing code, and having an engineering activity, which addresses another lifecycle activity added each week. Students worked in an interactive environment in which they were instructed on new techniques and then mentored in the use of those techniques through a series of hands-on exercises.  Intellectual Merit  The investigators? prior teaching as well as industrial experiences has demanded that the need for a creative and original teaching technique is needed to teach software engineering courses in the undergraduate level. This project translated the results from the investigators? present and other research efforts into a framework of pedagogy and materials for the software engineering courses. Traditional software processes focus on activities at team level, whereas, PCSE emphasizes common high-leverage practices, concentrates on individual performance so as to foster team integration, and cultivates discipline, agility, quality.  Broader Impact  This project significantly impacted on how software engineering courses were taught and how students learn these concepts. The development of learning materials and teaching strategies were guided through the participation of faculty from diverse institutions, including high schools, two-year and four-year colleges and from industrial practitioners. This project significantly enhanced the capacity of Alabama State University, a HBCU institution, to perform nationally recognized research in computing education. Education accomplishments were disseminated through some other channels: 1) Journal and conference publications; 2) Presentation in student symposiums; 3) Outreach activities of open house, lab tour, and seminar. In addition to that 150 students were directly benefited during four year period, majorly the under-represented minorities, and female undergraduate students.  Major Outcomes Our project has produced a new one person software development methodology called PCSE (practitioner-centered software engineering). Students experienced in real-world software engineering practices through active learning using the PCSE Model and associated tools developed in this project. Using the PCSE model and associated tools, students experience a software development effort from inception to final delivery. It also means that standards and guidelines are small and manageable, and can be distilled for classroom use with little loss of industry intent. This is in sharp contrast to software development using heavy weight software processes in which standards and guidelines are so comprehensive as to be difficult to adapt to student use. The student feedback/survey results indicates that the sequence of topics that would allow students to experience the benefit of working in a disciplined fashion. In particular, students seeing the fruits of their studies in terms of software quality, amount of help required, and accuracy of schedule projections. We have developed a new software engineering course (CSC 437 Software Engineering II) designed specifically to integrate concepts taught throughout the curriculum and industrial skills. Over 150 students from computing majors mainly underrepresented minorities and women at Alabama State University have been exposed to training in software engineering through PCSE concept adopted in this project.  We offered to the educational community two workshops (Summer 2014 and 2015) titled "Engaging minority students in software engineering through active learning."  We had 30 invited participants (Junior faculty from HBCUs, Potential future software instructors, High school STEM teachers, and community college STEM Faculties) from 15 academic institutions across USA.
