<AbstractNarration>In complex applications such as design and feedback control of energy efficient buildings, and  wave or wind energy arrays, existing codes are often available for simulation but these codes are  not always suitable for purposes such as model reduction or feedback control design. The  outcome of this research is a suite of computationally efficient and provably convergent algorithms  for grand challenge problems in PDE model reduction and feedback control.  The proposed work  focuses on two fundamental problem classes: (1) computing approximate solutions of infinite  dimensional Lyapunov and Riccati equations used in feedback control design, and (2) algorithms  for PDE balanced model reduction. This work utilizes specific solution data from PDE systems to  produce provably convergent approximations for PDE model reduction and feedback control  problems. Since the algorithms are data-based, the methods may use existing simulation codes  with specialized discretization schemes and tools such as adaptive solvers, parallel algorithms, and  multigrid methods to increase computational efficiency and accuracy. Since the algorithms can  exploit such advanced simulation techniques, the algorithms can scale to treat highly complex  grand challenge problems.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The accurate solution of model reduction problems for partial differential equation systems is  important for many applications including fast simulations, tractable optimization, feedback control  design, and real time control implementation. Feedback control of PDEs has potential applications  in many areas.  For example, feedback control of air flow in commercial buildings could lead to  dramatic reduction in energy consumption. In another area, feedback control of fluid-structure  interactions in wave energy converters could lead to effective ocean wave energy extraction. The  proposed work primarily considers the development and analysis of model reduction and  feedback control algorithms for linear PDE systems, as extensions of these reduced models and  feedback laws can be used to treat problems involving nonlinear PDEs. The algorithms can exploit  advanced existing simulation codes, and therefore the completion of the proposed work will open  the door for large advances in computational feedback control to challenging nonlinear PDE  systems.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In complex applications such as design and feedback control of energy efficient buildings, and wave or wind energy arrays, existing complex simulation codes are often available but these codes are not always suitable for purposes such as model reduction or feedback control design.  The primary objective of this research was the development of simulation-based, computationally efficient, and provably accurate algorithms for challenge problems in model reduction and feedback control of partial differential equations (PDEs).  Model reduction problems for PDEs are important for many applications including fast simulations, tractable optimization, feedback control design, and real time control implementation.  Feedback control of PDEs has potential applications in many areas.  For example, feedback control of air and heat flow in commercial buildings could lead to a reduction in the extremely large energy consumption of such buildings.  Also, feedback control of fluid-structure interactions in wave energy converters could lead to extracting large amounts of currently untapped ocean wave energy.   Intellectual Merit Outcomes:  The research in this project focused on two fundamental problem classes: (1) Riccati equations used in feedback control design for PDEs, and (2) balanced model reduction of PDEs.  For the first problem class, a new accurate simulation-based algorithm to compute approximate solutions of large-scale matrix Riccati equations was developed and analyzed.  For the second problem class, fundamental model reduction studies were performed and new simulation-based algorithms were also developed and analyzed for model reduction of challenging PDE problem classes.  Furthermore, a new, efficient, low-storage data approximation algorithm was also developed and analyzed near the end of the project.  This algorithm can be easily used with the other algorithms developed during this project and increases their effectiveness; moreover, the algorithm can be applied to a wide variety of model reduction applications in many disciplines.  One of the three original major goals for the project was to apply these algorithms to the field of wave energy. The models typically used for modeling the interaction of wave energy converters (WECs) with ocean waves were more complex than suitable for direct application of the algorithms developed within this project. Therefore, the team developed a partial differential equation model that captured some of the features of WEC-wave interactions in a wave tank and used that as a proxy for the more complicated models used within wave energy research. In addition, preliminary work in applying the algorithms developed under this funding to a thermal convection loop was initiated. While the thermal convection loop model is still not what is used in the wave energy sector, is has features that are useful for extending the scope of problems to which the kinds of algorithms developed under this funding are applicable.  Broader Impact Outcomes:  The Department of Mathematics and Statistics at Missouri University of Science and Technology is in the process of building a research emphasis in applied and computational mathematics.  Funding for this project promoted this initiative; specifically, the PI used project funding to recruit, support, and help train a graduate student.  The funding enabled the graduate student to make great progress in research.  Furthermore, the project funding was also used by the co-PI to help attract, support, and train graduate students at Oregon State University.
