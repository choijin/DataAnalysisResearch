<AbstractNarration>The goal of this proposal is to provide a millennial context for current warming and to better constrain the nature of abrupt climate changes over the past 5000 years in the North Atlantic sector of the Arctic. This goal will be addressed with the powerful datasets derived from radiocarbon-dated vegetation preserved beneath ice caps for centuries to millennia, but now being exposed annually by current ice-margin retreat across northeastern Canada and West Greenland. These chronologies define the pattern and timing of abrupt summer coolings in the recent past and place current warming in a millennial context. 14C dating of vegetation will be complemented by measuring in situ 14C inventories in recently exposed rock surfaces, providing essential temporal constraints on the duration of ice-covered and ice-free conditions throughout the Holocene. Combined, these two datasets will provide the most secure evidence for the character of current summer warming by explicitly dating when the region was last as warm as present. Comparing our climate reconstructions with on-going studies in NW Europe will help to separate the roles of unforced variability from hemispherically symmetric forcing as causes for abrupt climate change.  Research activities under this award will be made accessible to indigenous peoples by translating the goals and eventual results into Inuktitut, through posters that describe the research, and by offering public lectures in Iqaluit, the capital of Nunavut, and at Qikiqtarjuaq, where INSTAAR has long had a presence. This research program will train a PhD and MSc student, and provides opportunities for undergraduate students to become involved with research, building on successful traditions from previous years.</AbstractNarration>

Using reconstructions of past glacier change, investigators from the University at Buffalo assessed the pattern of Arctic climate change over the past few millennia, and the forcing mechanisms driving past climate change. They studied small glaciers and ice caps on Greenland independent of the Greenland Ice Sheet. The investigators used geological field methods, isotopic dating tools, lake sediment analysis and satellite data to determine the history of glacier and climate change in western Greenland.  The investigators discovered that glaciers are on their way to vanishing completely. Many glaciers have already surpassed minimum sizes last experienced thousands of years ago during warmer times in the middle Holocene Epoch.  In addition, during the pre-industrial interval of natural climate cooling, starting before at least 5000 years ago, glaciers expanded in spurts, suggesting climate forcing mechanisms in addition to the steady decline of incoming solar radiation.  Finally, the pattern of inferred summer temperature changes obtained from the record of glacier expansion closely mimics other records of maritime climate change on land, and ocean records of climate change. Thus, the investigators speculate that the Greenland sector of the Arctic is closely modulated by the North Atlantic Ocean via ocean circulation.  The overall findings of the study provide targets for glacier and climate models in their attempt to use the Earth?s history to validate model performance. These same models are used to project future scenarios of climate and glacier change.  Three graduate students, two undergraduate students and an 8th grade Earth science teacher participated in this research. The students wrote their graduate theses based on different components of the study; much of the thesis work was presented at conferences and at present, two journal articles have been published. The principle investigator gave public talks on the findings, and worked with the K-12 teacher to develop lesson plans based on the research carried out as part of this project.
