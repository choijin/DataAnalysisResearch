<AbstractNarration>Program Director's Recommendation &lt;br/&gt;Center for Integration of Composites into Infrastructures (CICI) &lt;br/&gt;Proposal # 1230351 &amp; 1230284 &lt;br/&gt;GangaRao &amp; Rizkalla &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal seeks funding for the Center for Integration of Composites into Infrastructures at West Virginia University and North Carolina State University sites. Funding Requests for Fundamental Research are authorized by an NSF approved solicitation, NSF 11-570. The solicitation invites I/UCRCs to submit proposals for support of industry-defined fundamental research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Applications of Fiber Reinforced Polymer (FRP) composites made of thermosets and thermoplastics have been growing steadily. Even though FRP composites can provide longer-service life because of more beneficial thermo-mechanical performance over conventional materials, lack of understanding of durability and life-cycle performance is a major technical obstacle for their high volume application. The durability response is identified typically in terms of chemical, physical and mechanical aging and their combinations. Therefore, the objectives of the proposed research are to: i) evaluate the mechanisms that lead to the degradation of pultruded and infused composite material properties at micro- and macro-levels, ii) minimize manufacturing (pultrusion vs. infusion) and durability related defects, delaminations, and de-bonding, and to iii) develop a unified model(s) to predict life-cycle performance of FRP composites so that master curves can be developed as a function(s) of time, temperature and pressure. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project will help the center to be in forefront (leader) of conducting fundamental durability research and offer solutions to the issues that are critical for composite industry/end-users. Results will create better industry/university/end-user interaction leading to higher volume use of FRPs, and to spur economic growth, in addition to attracting and help attract talented students to our research program. Results of this work will be widely disseminated through conference presentations, technical journals, short-courses and other means, and will be further Integrated into the design, codes of practice, and academic curricula as desired by the industry/ end-users.</AbstractNarration>

Fiber reinforced composites offer structural engineers a high-strength, lightweight, and corrosion-resistant alternative to more conventional structural materials, such as steel. The use of FRP materials in civil infrastructure is becoming increasingly more prevalent. This is especially true in certain corrosive environments where steel members may be severely affected. Currently, glass FRP composites are the most common FRP materials due to their lower cost compared to other FRP materials, such as carbon FRP.  During their service life, FRP materials are subjected to a combination of mechanical and environmental loadings that may degrade their mechanical properties. The issue of durability of FRP materials remains a major concern in the design and application of the composites. Due to the lack of research data and knowledge about the long-term durability performance of FRP materials, a high degree of conservatism is being applied in the design process. Understanding the synergistic effect of mechanical loading and exposure to solutions at elevated temperature can help in predicting the service life of FRP materials and structures, as well as, designing test methods that more realistically simulate the natural aging of the materials.  In this research the impacts of the load level, the accelerated aging temperature, the type of solution that the materials were exposed to, the conditioning duration, and the matrix type were on the degradation of mechanical properties and microstructure of FRPs were experimentally studied.  Intellectual Merit:  The results of this research provided (i) an understanding of the synergistic effect of mechanical and environmental loading on their rate of degradation of FRP composites, (ii) an understanding of the effect of load level on the degradation rate of FRP composites, (iii) an understanding of the mechanisms involved in accelerated aging of FRP composites, and (iv) feasibility of acoustic emission to quantify the degradation rate of FRP composites.    Test results suggest that (i) the introduction of a sustained loading, up to 30 percent of the ultimate strength, during accelerated aging may have a minimal impact on both residual strength and stiffness of FRP composites since this level of loading results in minimal cracking and does not alter the degradation resistance of the materials. Therefore, the degradation of FRPs can be evaluated using a static conditioning setup that is both more time efficient and less expensive experimentally, (ii) there are two competing mechanisms occurring when the FRP materials are subjected to environmental conditioning: post-curing increasing the tensile strength and degradation decreasing the strength, (iii) while acoustic emission can be used to differentiate between different modes of failures that occur in FRP composite, acoustic emission may not be a feasible method to quantify the degradation rate of FRP composites.  Broader Impacts:  The outcomes of the research can be used by manufactures of composites to design more durable FRPs with a lower cost. This will reduce the overall cost of new and repair of existing infrastructure, will result in a more durable infrastructure increasing their service life and reducing their downtime, will decrease the number of repairs and result in conservation of natural resources. The outcomes of this project can be used toward development of more durable and therefore more sustainable infrastructure. This will in turn contribute to social wellbeing.  This research project facilitated a close collaboration between the educational institutions, industry partners, and owner and operators of infrastructure. Through this collaboration, educational institutions could better address the needs of industrial sector and infrastructure owners and operators.
