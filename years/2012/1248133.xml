<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop a proprietary technology to enhance the crushing strength of industrial diamonds by 30-40%.  If successful, the project will result in a new process which will allow the treatment of large numbers of industrial diamonds at once.  The intellectual merit includes a better understanding of diamond crystal lattice structure, formation of diamond residual stresses, and crystal imperfection caused by extrinsic, intrinsic, and crystal symmetry defects inside diamonds.  This project will also enhance our understanding of material embrittlement caused by nanoscale structural change.  Last but not least, this research could develop more knowledge on diamond crushing strength and technologies for improving diamond strength.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will be significant in the diamond production industry.  In 2011, the world production of industrial diamonds exceeded five billion carats.  This technology will allow the enhancement of properties of low- and medium-strength diamonds, with a potential added value of over $5 billion.  The proposed technology will also have a strong impact on cutting and grinding tools, which are critical to the semiconductor, automotive, aerospace, surgical instrument, machinery, oil and gas, and construction industries. Within these sectors, stone cutting and highway building/repair account for the largest sources of demand for industrial diamond.  Additionally, every automobile manufactured in the United States contains an average of 1.5 carats of diamond.</AbstractNarration>
