<AbstractNarration>The main goals of the project are to: (1) enhance the delivery of the introductory level computer science programming course through a set of well-structured laboratory online lab experiences that are engaging, applied, and meaningful, (2) facilitate the adoption of the developed materials by other instructors, and (3) make the results and materials of this project available both in Spanish and English and accessible online as a turnkey solution. This will make the laboratory resources attractive and easy to adopt by other Hispanic serving institutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project provides a turnkey solution that significantly eases an instructor's change in classroom techniques toward more hands-on, active and engaging courses. In essence, the turnkey solution consists of a set of well-structured online laboratory experiences that are applied, meaningful, easily accessible and transferable, all packaged into a virtual appliance preconfigured with all the necessary software (compilers, libraries, and data files).  The laboratory experiences contain a strong continuous assessment component to establish students' skills, concept mastery and attitudes towards the concepts and theme of the lab experiences. The experiences are designed following Merrill's five principles of instruction, i.e. be task-centered, and have processes of activation, demonstration, application and integration. Product development follows the ADDIE model (analysis, design, development, implementation, evaluation). Student learning assessment is done before, during and after each laboratory experience. Promotion and dissemination of the project is achieved through exhibitions and publications in major CS Education conferences, as well as supported by a dedicated website.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   For this project we developed a set of 27 laboratory experiences for the Introduction to Programming course in C++.  The laboratory experiences are based on real world problems to engage students with different backgrounds and interest.  Examples include problems in image processing, games, cybersecurity, computer networks, sound processing, among others.  The materials of the laboratory experiences are available in a Git repository[1] and on Turnkey Virtual Machines (VM)[2].  The instructions for each experience are available in Spanish and English.  They were developed using Markdown and are embedded in the Bitbucket repositories of each laboratory experience, in Moodle, and in a digital book[3].  Our assesment results suggest that the laboratory experiences are indeed engaging to Computer Science students with different backgrounds.   We developed two databases of questions (one in English and one in Spanish) for the labs. The questions can used in the pre-lab quizzes or as diagnostic questions to verify reading comprehension/concept mastery. All the laboratory experiences were evaluated in class. The results of the pre and post tests of each laboratory experience showed that, in general, most of the students had learning gains and that the average grades improved considerably. This suggests that the lab experiences helped the students to improve their understanding of the concepts. We presented the products of this project at the 2016 SIDIM conference, the 2016 Caribbean Celebration of Women in Computing, and in the SIGCSE 2017, Seattle WA. Dr. Ortiz presented the paper: J. Ortiz-Ubarri, R. Arce-Nazario, I. Rubio, C.
