<AbstractNarration>The Magnolia grandiFLORA project, named in honor of the official state tree and flower of Mississippi, will develop digital databases of images, labels, and georeferenced locality data for more than 250,000 vascular plant specimens from herbaria at Mississippi State University, University of Mississippi, Delta State University, University of Southern Mississippi, Gulf Coast Research Laboratory, Mississippi Museum of Natural Science, and Institute for Botanical Exploration. A web interface that allows for integrated database searches will be established through the High Performance Computing Collaboratory at Mississippi State University. Specimen imaging and label digitization will provide worldwide access to the collections, biological and geographical metadata for broad-scale studies based on plants, and a permanent back-up of specimen data in the event of natural or other disasters. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The resulting high quality data set will provide tools for plant identification and information on plant distributions in Mississippi to government agencies, researchers, and the general public. These data have applications in tracking rare and invasive species, developing environmental policy, increasing citizen knowledge of the natural history of Mississippi, and enhancing K-12 science education with interactive tools. The data will contribute to the development of a comprehensive list of plants in Mississippi and national efforts to catalog and map plant diversity. Numerous undergraduate and graduate students will be involved in the project.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The NSF grant, &ldquo;Magnolia grandiFLORA, digitally linking herbaria to support botanical research and education in Mississippi&rdquo;, provided important exposure to Delta State University and greatly improved its science programs. Primary goals of the project were to digitize the major plant collections in Mississippi that are contained in state herbaria and to integrate these collections into a virtual framework, complete with specimen images, label information, and locality data; develop a plant atlas of the flora of Mississippi; produce fact sheets, posters, id cards; as well as conduct educational programs. Faculty and students associated with this grant contributed to all three goals. Despite difficulties with building renovations that occurred for three-plus years throughout the project, a lot of progress occurred regarding the Delta State University (DSC) collection. More than 15,500 digital images were photographed using Canon Image Capture and SilverImage cataloging software. These images are on the SERNEC (SouthEast Regional Network of Expertise and Collection) website. Additionally, more than 11,550 individual specimen records (not including duplicates), representing 278 families and 1154 genera, can be found in the DSC digital database and SERNEC.&nbsp; More specimen records continue to be added and other grants are being written that further enhance this resource.</p> <p>Preliminary results indicate that the DSC herbarium contains plant specimens from forty-three states and eight countries. Many specimens are native to the Mississippi Delta and do not occur in any other herbarium. Statistically, 65.8% of the specimen records are from Mississippi; 8.9% are from North Carolina; 7.0% are from Alabama, and 90.1% are from the southeastern United States. Approximately 10% of the records are from other areas. Notable southeastern U.S. plant taxonomists collected many specimens: Delzie Demaree, Harry Ahles, Clyde Ritchie Bell, James A. Duke, and Albert Radford. Other major contributors include Drs. Charles Bryson, Samuel Faulkner, Ken Gordon, Henry J. Jacobs, Sid McDaniel, John MacDonald, M. Wayne Morris, Robert A. Stewart, and Ronald G. Wieland.</p> <p>NSF support has provided a great deal of public exposure and significance to the DSC herbarium collection. Administrators at DSU recognize the importance of this resource. Graduate students and faculty from around the country also have asked about various specimens that are contained in SERNEC and have utilized the DSC herbarium to answer research questions. Many specimens are cited in publications, including peer-reviewed papers, dissertations, and news notes. Additionally, more than twelve poster presentations and two manuscripts composed by DSU faculty and students incorporated specimens associated with the DSC herbarium.</p> <p>This NSF grant has led to more collaboration and networking with other universities, museums, and government organizations. For example, Mac Alford at the University of Southern Mississippi, Wayne Morris at Troy University, Heather Sullivan at the Mississippi Museum of Natural Science (MMNS), and Charles Bryson, retired weed scientists at the USDA in Stoneville, MS, have assisted Dr. Baghai-Riding in identifying several hundred plant specimens. Dr. Baghai-Riding is collaborating with these scientists and others in creating the Plant Atlas as well as seeking other funding opportunities that will further enhance the DSC herbarium. Specimen donations from scientists, students, and other professionals also have improved the collection. For example, MMNS contributed more than 1,000 unmounted specimens and Dr. Robert Stewart donated more than 200 specimens.</p> <p>Improvement to classroom teaching was another positive impact. New equipment and supplies purchased with funds from this grant enhanced student scientific projects and laboratories, including a stereomicroscope, dissecting microscopes, software, projection equipment, and copy stand. Eight classes taught at DSU have incorporated the DSC herbarium: Dendrology (BIO 312), Problems in Biology (BIO 348), Materials and Methods in Environmental Science (BIO 415), Plant Anatomy (BIO 410), Elements of Plant Systematics (BIO 411), and Conservation Biology (BIO 459/559). Many students learned how to mount, identify, catalog, photograph, digitize, and file plant specimens. One course project in BIO 415 (Spring 2015-2018), involved making leaf cuticle peals of woody angiosperm species that were attached to herbarium sheets; students determined whether differences in leaf stomatal density was evident in woody angiosperm plants that live in the Mississippi Delta.</p> <p>Another positive outcome was that local community organizations would request to use the DSC herbarium. This resource was incorporated into several educational workshops: Mississippi Master Gardening workshop (May 2017), a Natural Resource Conservation Service workshop (July 2016), a two-week aquatic food web workshop sponsored by EPA (June 2013), and Botanical workshop (July 2017). Several short articles that feature the herbarium were periodically submitted to DSU Communications and Marketing and published in newspapers; these articles generated public awareness to DSU&rsquo;s science programs.</p> <p>Some funds provided by this NSF grant allowed Dr. Baghai-Riding to attend the annual Botanical Society of America convention. She attended workshops/presentations that were pertinent to herbarium managers. She learned useful databases and how to georeference specimens from these experiences. In the future, she hopes to trace GUID records that are associated with DSC herbarium specimens.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 09/12/2018<br>      Modified by: Nina&nbsp;Baghai-Riding</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1203573/1203573_10181544_1535674369652_Ridingfinal--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1203573/1203573_10181544_1535674369652_Ridingfinal--rgov-800width.jpg" title="An overview of the Delta State University herbarium"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1203573/1203573_10181544_1535674369652_Ridingfinal--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="An overview of the Delta State University herbarium"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">This poster was presented back in  2013 when digitizing of the Delta State University collection had just started.
