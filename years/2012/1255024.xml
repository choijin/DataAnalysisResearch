<AbstractNarration>With this five-year CAREER project, the PI aims to create a long-lasting integrated research and education program in solar physics at the New Mexico State University (NMSU), which is an accredited Hispanic minority serving institution.  Proposed is a creative effort based on the concept of modular, interdisciplinary, components of science.  On the education side, this project will provide the general public, local schools, and NMSU students (4-6 graduate and 10 undergraduate, with an emphasis on underrepresented minorities) with opportunities, methods, and tools for learning about the Sun.  It therefore helps increase diversity in STEM education, public awareness, and research.  On the science side, this project will identify the key components of complexity and dynamics of coronal heating and solar flares through student research projects.  The integration of education and research lies in identifying, creating, and using modular, interdisciplinary tools.   The proposed research and EPO agenda supports the Strategic Goals of the AGS Division in discovery, learning, diversity, and interdisciplinary research.</AbstractNarration>

In education, this project provided the general public, local schools, and NMSU students (with an emphasis on underrepresented minorities) with opportunities, methods, and tools for learning about the Sun. In research this project identified the key components of complexity and dynamics of coronal heating and solar flares through student research projects. The integration of education and research lies in identifying, creating, and using modular, interdisciplinary tools.  The Sun is an intriguing, wondrous, seething mixture of structures. Maxwell’s equations of electromagnetism dictate that the conditions in these structures are governed by their magnetic field. Both the existence of complex loop structures and the dynamics of their evolution are due to the coronal magnetic field. The two concepts of complexity and dynamics are closely intertwined - structures at any instant in time reflect the prior history of their dynamics, and the future evolution of these structures are governed by the complexity of the structures. This project addressed two fundamental questions about the Sun - ‘How is the corona structured?’, ‘How and why does the corona vary?’ - applied to the research areas of coronal heating and solar flares.  Team-based active-learning projects, based on recognizing key elements in scientific discoveries, are being incorporated and assessed for effectiveness. These elements of modular and interdisciplinary research are used to attract and retain the students in research, with an emphasis on Hispanic students, from across all STEM fields.
