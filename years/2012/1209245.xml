<AbstractNarration>This action funds Gregory Philip Reeves of New Mexico State University to conduct a research project, entitled "Locating a New Disease Resistance Gene in Chile Peppers," during the summer of 2012 at Seoul National University (SNU) in Seoul, South Korea.  The host scientist is Dr. Doil Choi.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit is found in the identification of disease resistance genes in chile peppers, which is required for breeding elite disease resistant chile pepper varieties in the future and increasing crop yield by reducing the losses due to plant pathogens. Also, discovery of new disease resistance genes yields new insights into plant/pathogen interactions. Discoveries made in chile peppers can be applied to other crops - for the development of disease resistance in them as well, with significant economic impact on East Asian and U.S. agriculture.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.</AbstractNarration>
