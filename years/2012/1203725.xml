<AbstractNarration>This project will combine observations of ionospheric ions throughout the magnetosphere-ionosphere system with the  Generalized Polar Wind (GPW) model of ionospheric outflows and a magnetohydrodynamic code for simulating the magnetosphere.  The GPW is a macroscopic Particle-In-Cell (mac-PIC) code. It will be coupled to the Block Adaptive Tree Solar wind Roe-type Upwind Scheme (BATS-R-US) MHD model using a system called the Space Weather Modeling Framework. The codes will be used to perform a set of simulations,  representing a combination of terrestrial season, level of solar flux, and level of magnetospheric activity. The results from the coupled models will be compared to uncoupled results to illuminate the role of the ionospheric plasma in magnetospheric dynamics.  To validate and refine the simulation results, a climatological observation set of outflowing plasma both in the ionosphere and within the magnetosphere will be constructed from historical data sets. The climatological model will be binned by season, magnetic activity, and location. Event simulations will be performed and compared with the climatological data to investigate transient dynamics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will advance our understanding of the role of the Earth's ionospheric environment in filling its magnetospheric space environment with plasma. The data-model comparisons, both on a climatological and event-study level, will advance the accuracy of ionospheric outflow models and Geospace General Circulation Models. The coupling of an ionospheric outflow model to an MHD model of the magnetosphere will add a fundamentally important element to our ability to forecast the dynamics of the magnetosphere.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The ability to understand and predict future changes to the Earth's environment is an essentially important capability.  The Earth's environment extends from our local surroundings out into space where the Sun's changing dynamics and the Earth's changing upper atmospheric regions combine to create a continuously variable space environment, the magnetosphere.  This dynamic region, made up of both particles and magnetic/electric fields, affects technological systems such as satellites continuously and can damage the spacecraft as well as create conditions in the Earth's upper atmosphere which can affect systems on the Earth's surface such as communications and the electrical power grid.  Hence, it is important to be able to observe the Sun and model the effects that its changes will cause in the Earth's space environment.  This NSF-Sponsored work is directly related to these forecasting goals.  The work has been directed toward combining computer models of the Earth's upper atmosphere, the ionosphere, and the Earth's magnetosphere in order to understand and predict the processes that will cause changes and affect important technological systems in this environment.  Significant progress has been made in this grant in merging these models and comparing them with spacecraft measurements of the ionosphere and magnetosphere.  About 100 scientists have been involved in the activity which has led to presentations, papers published in refereed journals and a new scientific monograph that will be published this year about the processes that couple the ionosphere and magnetosphere.  These research products will enable the more accurate prediction of how the space environment will be changed as a result of changes in our Sun.
