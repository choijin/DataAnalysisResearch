<AbstractNarration>Intellectual merit.  Biological systems use memory of previous experiences to anticipate future environmental changes.  In the literature this is called "anticipatory behavior".  These experiments will be performed in Halobacterium salinarum, a tractable model organism that has adapted to a complex and dynamically changing natural environment. Individual environmental factors such as oxygen, temperature, pH do not occur in isolation but rather, in a temporally coupled and non-random manner.  This project seeks to understand the rate at which microorganisms evolve novel anticipatory behavior as they encounter a new environment.  This understanding will have significant implications on wide-ranging issues including predicting the consequences of climate change on microbial communities in the oceans, as well as strategies to prevent pathogens from evading the immune system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts.  The objective is to significantly expand the already highly successful  "Networks in Biology"  high school educational module by incorporating statistical modeling and model inference lessons. It will be reinforced that models are as good as the data they are based upon, and model predictions must be  assessed with rigorous statistics in order to avoid misinterpretation. These educational activities will be designed and implemented through collaborations between senior scientists, postdoctoral fellows, high school student interns from disadvantaged backgrounds, and educators, such as high school teachers and curriculum developers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   In our project we addressed two fundamental questions in biology: (1) how rapidly adaptive learning occurs in biological systems and (2) which network mechanisms underly such behavior. We performed proof-of-concept studies that were necessary to address these two fundamental points. Based on the concepts required to resolve such essential questions, we also disseminated completed curriculum and developed a new draft curriculum for high school students, framed in active learning and a cross-disciplinary approach, with broad implications in systems understanding and decision making.  Therefore, in our first experiment, we demonstrated that novel anticipatory behavior can arise rapidly in a biological population.

While most of the thousands of students who complete our curriculum in high school classes across the nation will not become scientists or engineers, all need to be responsible citizens and able thinkers, with an understanding of their world. Our curriculum incorporates scientific and systems thinking and problem solving that transcends content. Students work on seeing networks and systems, whether they be societal systems or ecological systems, as complex networks of interrelated parts that exist over space and time. This understanding fosters better decision-making, social skills, problem-solving and behavioral changes. This award allowed us to reach more people thereby positively impa...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
