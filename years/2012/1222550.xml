<AbstractNarration>The objective of this project is to investigate the fundamental mathematics and biophysics that underlie the equilibrium shape and dynamics of a lipid bilayer interacting with surfactants and proteins. The lipid bilayer is the main structural component of the elastic biological membranes that consist of different lipid species, and contain many kinds of proteins, and many other molecules such as cholesterols and surfactants. In addition, the biomembranes are asymmetric double leaflets coupled to a cytoskeleton that is crucial for cellular adaptation of different shapes and motility.  It is now known that lipid composition may set limits to the possible shapes and deformations, while the actual shape of the cellular membrane depends on both the force (from the cytoskeleton, for example) and membrane-deforming proteins. Much progress has been made to uncover and decipher the mechanisms by which proteins can sense and/or induce membrane curvature. However, recent experiments have shown that interaction between lipid membranes and amphipathic molecules, such as surfactant and amphipathic peptides, also leads to changes in total membrane area, curvature and rigidity. No mathematical modeling of these effects have yet been obtained to help elucidate the asymmetry in the lipid bilayer due to surfactants and proteins, or how cells may utilize these mechanisms to perform diverse biological functions. This project aims to establish mathematical understanding of the roles of surfactants and proteins in causing the asymmetries in lipid double leaflets and their subsequent shape and dynamics. The particular focuses are on (1) surfactant-induced membrane area regulation and shape change, and (2) effects of transport, assembly, and organization of trans-membrane proteins on membrane shape and dynamics. In addition, the experiments (by Stone) will validate and refine the modeling approach (by Young), which will in turn facilitate the numerical simulation (by Veerapaneni) of the elastic lipid bilayer interacting with surfactant and protein. Results will help uncover the complex organization and interplay between proteins and lipid domains in cellular membranes.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The theme of this project is the development and analysis of mathematical models of the interaction between lipid membranes and surfactant or protein over large spatial (microns) and long time (seconds to minutes) scales, which is difficult to achieve using state-of-the-art coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations. Quantitative comparison between experiments, mathematical modeling, and numerical simulations will be conducted. Broader impacts of the research include the development of new mathematical models, numerical methods and complementary analysis and experiments that will be of benefit to scientists and engineers studying rafts dynamics as well as emerging applications in drug delivery, cellular adhesion, motility and mechanosensing. The concepts and methods described here go beyond the context of moving boundary dynamics mediated by an active species, and extend to other problems featuring reaction-diffusion of chemicals.  The approach has the potential to be adapted to more complicated biological membranes that are similar from a mathematical point of view. The students involved in this project will receive valuable interdisciplinary training in a wide range of mathematics, biophysics and computer science.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The focus of this collaborative project is on the coupling between the dynamics of a lipid bilayer membrane and its constituent proteins (such as the transmembrane mechanosensitive channels that reside in the lipid bilayer). The lipid bilayer membrane is the main component of a cellular membrane, and its mechanical coupling with transmembrane proteins is essential to how a live cell picks up mechanical cues from its fluid environment. This important process is very complicated as it involves both electrical and mechanical properties of the lipid bilayer membrane. The following mathematical modeling and numerical investigations have been undertaken to understand several funamental aspects of this process.</p> <p>(1) We constructed a mathemtical model and conducted numerical simulations to describe how a transmembrane protein may deform due to fluid shear stress around a lipid bilayer membrane. These results show that under physiological flow conditions, the force from the lipid may be sufficient to deform a mechanosensitive channel for transport across the membrane. In particular we are able to quantify the density of proteins that would be stretched open when the lipid bilayer membrane deforms under a fluid flow. Later we also investigate the role of cytoskeleton on the membrane tension distribution as a membrane deforms under a fluid flow. These results are summarized in journal articles&nbsp; (a) "Gating of a mechanosensitive channel by cellular flow", Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci., 2015, and (b) "On the gating of mechanosensitive channels by fluid shear stress", Acta Mechanica Sinica, 2016.</p> <p>(2) One of the numerical challenges to investigate the lipid-protein interactions is the wide range of spatial scales (from nano meters to tens of microns) and time scales (from nano seconds to mini seconds). With PhD student Szu-Pei Fu and collaborators, we designed a fast and accurate stochastic integrator for the coarse-grained numerical simulations of the lipid-protein interactions in the fluid environment. We managed to implement the fast-multipole method (FMM) to compute the non-local hydrodynamic interactions in a stochastic integrator. These results are summared in journal articles (c) "Efficient Brownian dynamics simulations of a single DNA with hydrodynamic interactions in linear flows", Phys. Rev. E, 2015, and (d) "Lennard-Jones types pair-potential method for coarse-grain lipid bilayer membrane simulations in LAMMPS", Computer Physics Communications, 2016.</p> <p>(3) The electrohydrodynamics of a lipid bilayer membrane is essential to how macrromolecules would transport through the transmembrane proteins once stretch open by the force from the lipid. Thus the electrical properties of a lipid bilayer membrane is essential. With collaborators, both linear and strongly nonlinear electrohydrodynamics of a lipid bilayer membrane are investigated and results are published in (e) "Equilibrium electro-deformation of a spheroidal vesicle in an AC electric field", Phys.
