<AbstractNarration>The investigator will try to answer questions about algebras of bounded operators on Hilbert space; in particular, these questions involve finite von Neumann algebras, which are algebras of operators on Hilbert space that are closed under taking adjoints and strong--operator limits, and on which there exist tracial linear functionals. The main question the investigator proposes to work on is known as Connes' embedding problem, which asks (in one of many equivalent formulations):  can all operators in a von Neumann algebra that has a bounded trace be approximated by matrices over the complex numbers? This question is fundamental and its resolution would have profound ramifications on our understanding of operator algebras and operator spaces. One important goal is to seek a group lacking certain analogous approximation properties (i.e., a non-sofic group), both as it's own goal and as a guide for particular von Neumann algebras to investigate vis-a-vis Connes' embedding problem. In other directions, the investigator proposes to use the "practical Schubert calculus" to learn more about finite von Neumann algebras, and to study certain natural questions in finite von Neumann algebras, such as the single commutator question and the Schur-Horn question, using diverse methods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Group theory is the study of fundamental symmetries that are found in nearly all branches of mathematics and natural sciences. On the other hand, von Neumann algebras were invented in the 1930's and 1940's by Murray and von Neumann; they consist of operators on infinite dimensional space and are related to the formalism of quantum mechanics, which motivated their invention. In modern mathematics, the study of these von Neumann algebras has important connections to several other areas of mathematics, such as group theory and dynamical systems. The investigator will try to answer related, fundamental problems in group theory and von Neumann algebras, namely, "can certain infinite objects always be approximated by finite ones?" Answers to these questions would have broad impact;  they are related to many other open problems about groups and, respectively, operators on infinite dimensional space. The investigator will also study certain other natural questions about von Neumann algebras. The research effort will furthermore support the educational efforts of the principal investigator: most directly in teaching graduate students the prerequisites to understanding current research problems and then to guide them to vital and important research problems and but also in educating undergraduate students in a way that shows the utility and beauty of mathematics and teaches them essential mathematical skills and methods of mathematical (and logical) reasoning.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The theory of operators on infinite dimenaional spaces and of sets of such operators in relation to one another is fundamental to much of modern science and technology, including, for example, quantum mechanics and communications technology.  The project grappled with deep questions about such operators.  Many resuls were obtained.  These include results about (1) upper triangular forms for operators, (2) quantum symmetric states, (3) correlation matrices in quantum information theory and (4) random matrices.  To explain more about topic (1) above, for matrices over the complex numbers, one has the famous Schurr upper triangular form, whereby any matrix is unitarily equivalent to an upper triangular matrix.  The spectral distribution of the matrix is gotten by looking at the diagonal in such an upper triangular form.  Moreover, invariant subspaces are used in a fundamental way to obtain the upper triangular form.  Some relatively recent results of Uffe Haagerup and Hanne Schultz (2009) about invariant subspaces of certain sorts of operators ion infinite dimensional spaces, has opened the door to a vast generalization of Schur's result on upper triangular forms.  Exploring these topics is likely to be important for obtaining a far better understanding of such operators.  Significant progress in this effort was one of the outcomes of this project.
