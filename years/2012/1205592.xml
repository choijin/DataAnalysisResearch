<AbstractNarration>Computing increasingly permeates daily lives, yet few appreciate the growing presence of Parallel and Distributed Computing (PDC) in common computing activities; e.g., modern laptops' processors contain multiple cores and special-purpose devices such as graphics processors (GPUs).  With increasing availability of powerful PDC technology, familiarity with single-processor computers and sequential computing no longer constitutes computer literacy.  Technological developments point to the need for a broad-based skill set in PDC at all levels of higher education in disciplines such as Computer Science, Computer Engineering, and the related computational disciplines.  The rapid changes in technology challenge educators to decide what to teach and how to teach it.  Students and employers face similar challenges in characterizing "basic" expertise in computing.  The PIs are addressing these challenges via a project devoted to creating and sustaining curricular and educational infrastructure to facilitate the teaching of PDC topics in undergraduate computer-related curricula.  The goal is for every graduating student to become skilled in PDC technology, hence be prepared to enter tomorrow's workforce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project embodies multiple synergistic activities that develop:  flexible PDC curricula for a spectrum of academic programs and institutions; mechanisms that help individuals maintain currency; instructional materials for PDC-related topics; experience-based guidelines for injecting PDC into curricula.  A signature activity is competitions for early adopters of PDC curricula (winners receive seed funds, equipment donations from industry) and workshops and training sessions to foster awareness and adoption of PDC curricula.  Feedback from early adopters and coordination with the ACM/IEEE 2013 CS Curriculum Taskforce steers future development of both the PDC curricular guidelines and of strategies for deploying PDC material within computing curricula at a larger scale.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is supported by CISE, OCI, and EHR/DUE.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Parallel and Distributed Computing (PDC) now permeates most computing activities. However, the rapid change in computing hardware platforms and devices, languages, and supporting programming environments, and many research advances, more than ever challenge educators in deciding what to teach in any given class in any given semester. Students and their employers face similar challenges on what constitutes basic expertise. A curriculum working group from the IEEE Technical Committee on Parallel Processing (TCPP), the National Science Foundation (NSF), and sister communities such as the ACM, took up the task of proposing and refining a curriculum for computer science (CS) and computer engineering (CE) undergraduates on PDC. The goal of the committee was to propose a core curriculum for CS/CE undergraduates, with the premise that every such undergraduate should achieve a specified skill level regarding PDC-related topics as a result of required coursework.  Our project has made good on the promise of that working group via the creation of the Center for Parallel and Distributed Computing Curriculum Development and Educational Resources (CDER).  In the project, we have carried out four synergistic areas of activity.  We have developed core curricula for PDC that is flexible enough to be used by a broad range of computer science and computer engineering programs and institutions.  We have developed the curriculum elements in collaboration with stakeholders that include educators, students, researchers, authors, industry, governments, funding agencies, professional societies and task forces to maintain currency and facilitate adoption.  We have organized and administered competitions for early adopters of PDC curricula, with over 100 winners receiving stipends and equipment to enable them to implement the curriculum within their courses.  We have organized workshops, special sessions, tutorials, and training sessions at multiple conferences to foster awareness and adoption of the PDC curricula, and have funded many of the early adopters to attend those events.  We have developed, collected, and synthesized pedagogical and instructional materials for teaching PDC curriculum topics, including slides, modules, tutorials, lectures, books, testing and evaluation tools, and made them available on a public web site. In addition, we have published the first in a series of textbooks targeting how to integrate PDC topics into lower-level undergraduate courses, with sections both for instructors and for students.  Work on a second book with additional pedagogical materials is ongoing.  Finally, we have facilitated access to state-of-the-art hardware and software resources for PDC instruction and training by instructors and students worldwide, as part of our early adopter program.
