<AbstractNarration>The investigators will use data from a multi-instrument observational campaign centered on Poker Flat Research Range near Fairbanks, AK to study the phenomenon of sustained upward vertical winds (SUVW) in the thermosphere that are associated with the soft particle precipitation of auroral activity. These winds have speeds in excess of 15 meters per second and appear continuously upward over several hours. They are generally preceded by a period of downward winds with speeds of 20 to 30 m/s. Far from being an intriguing curiosity, vertical winds are important to understanding the complex dynamic behavior of the upper atmosphere. Vertical winds in the thermosphere are responsible for vertical mass transport, disrupting stratification and changing the local composition, which can lead to changes in the overall thermal budget. Understanding the underlying source of these sustained vertical upward winds will enable a prediction of the global distribution of their occurrence and their impact on thermospheric dynamics. The study will take advantage of a critical mass of key instruments in the auroral zone in central Alaska that will produce comprehensive data sets to characterize the auroral input and large scale thermospheric conditions leading to the sustained upward vertical wind events. The primary instruments for observing vertical winds will be a set of three imaging Fabry-Perot interferometers (FPI), located at Poker Flat, Fort Yukon and Eagle, AK and dedicated to high-cadence zenith measurements. The contextual instruments include the Poker Flat Incoherent Scatter Radar (PFISR), a set of four scanning Doppler imagers (SDI) at Poker Flat, Gakona, Toolik Field Station, and Kaktovik, AK, all-sky cameras and meridian spectrographs at Poker Flat and remote observing sites. The broader impacts of this work will be the training and educational opportunities for undergraduates in technical research by participating in the analysis of the data obtained by the zenith FPI instruments.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Most of Earth?s atmosphere is in dynamic equilibrium, meaning that the layers at different altitudes are unlikely to mix. This can change in response to external energy inputs and the atmospheric layers can transport vertically &ndash; an obvious example is solar heating lifting moist air in the troposphere to create thunderstorms. Similar phenomena have been detected in the Earth?s highest atmospheric layer, called the thermosphere. Spanning everything above 120 km (~ 70 miles), the dynamics in this layer are controlled not only pressure and temperature, but also by the motion of the charged particles within the ionosphere. Recent observations of vertical motion at auroral latitudes have shown that the thermosphere shows a net upward motion when subject to bombardment from low energy electrons associated with the aurora. In this project we conducted observation from three sites in central Alaska (Poker Flat Research Range, Eagle, and Fort Yukon), to examine the timing and correlation of this upward flow with the spatial distribution of auroral activity.  The wind speeds are small (~ 20 meters per second, or 50 mph) compared to the horizontal winds at this altitude (~150 meters per second, ~330 mph), and even with very sensitive instruments the upward wind is difficult to measure. Our first tasks were to improve the analysis to do a better job of confirming that the shift is not just an instrumental effect. We examined several possible sources that could make it look like we were seeing upward winds when they might not exist, and could reject all of them.    Our analysis of multiple events led to the following results:  The upward winds are seen at all three sites. Upward winds start soon after the initiation of low energy auroral electrons at local zenith, and persist as long as the low-energy precipitation persists &ndash; up to several hours. There is no clear relation between the intensity of the auroral emissions (indicating increased particle flux), and the speed of the upward wind. When the average energy of the auroral electrons becomes more energetic the upward winds are diminished, indicating that the upward wind is energized in the F-region (150 km and higher), and not in the E-region (100 to 150 km) thermopshere.   This upward wind is of interest because it is likely to cause an increase in the density of the thermosphere locally and perhaps regionally. This increase could affect the speed and timing of the orbits of low-earth orbit spacecraft. Work to more clearly determine the causes of the upward wind will continue with funding from a NASA research project.
