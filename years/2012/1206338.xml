<AbstractNarration>NON-TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION: This experimental project addresses discovery of new materials through synthesis, and development of the materials for innovative uses through characterization of their structural and physical properties.  The class of materials investigated is zeolite-like mixed electrical conductors, a largely unexplored yet transformative subject.  Zeolites and zeolite-like materials are characterized by nanoscale pores that give rise to their well-known technologically important properties: separation, ion-exchange, and catalysis.  Mixed electrical conductors, supporting both ionic and electronic conduction, have impacted technological advances in many electrochemical systems - electrode materials, sensors, energy conversion and storage.  The combination of the functionalities of zeolites with mixed electrical conduction yields multifunctional materials and presents new directions in electrical energy storage, separation sciences, and in energy conversion sciences, a timely scientific and technological activity.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TECHNICAL DETAILS: The project advances the fundamental understanding of charge transport and charge transfer in nanoporous zeolite-like mixed ionic-electronic conductors.  In particular, the interrelated roles of ionic mobility, pore size, framework electronic conductivity, and chemical composition are studied.  Thus, this research impacts the understanding of the solid-state chemistry and physics of materials, of solid-state electrochemical processes, and of the solid-state physics of conduction mechanisms in novel materials.  Yet, as these multifunctional zeolite-like mixed electrical conductors are enabling materials, they impact other areas, e.g. catalysis and separation.  The materials synthesis approach of this project lends itself to scale-up capabilities, and would allow the research results to be translated to industrial efforts.  The project combines synthesis, structural characterization and electrical characterization, resulting in a cohesive cycle that allows for the focused synthesis of materials guided by their relevant properties, resonating with the goals of the Materials Genome Initiative - accelerating the pace of materials discovery and their applications.  The students involved in the project obtain interdisciplinary training in a timely topic, with scientific, societal and economic ramifications.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Mixed conductors, supporting both electronic and ionic conduction, have impacted technological advances in many electrochemical systems - electrode materials, sensors, energy conversion and storage.  Nanostructured and porous materials contribute to various important technological processes from catalysis and separation to electrical energy storage.  Under this grant, new materials systems that show both electronic and ionic conduction were synthesized and characterized, and their electrochemical energy storage capabilities pursued.   Intellectual merit arises from the study of structure-function relationships, coupled to electrical processes, in multifunctional transition metal oxides for different approaches in electrical energy storage applications. The correlation of these properties led to the construction of phase diagrams interrelating composition, structure and electrical characteristics.  The correlations obtained may be ported over to other materials systems, adding fundamentally to the solid-state physics and chemistry of materials, and even to mineralogy.  The insights can also guide new efforts towards important results in technological applications in various fields. The synthesis aspect of the effort, coupled with characterization of novel materials, contributes and enhances various scientific disciplines and accelerates the pace of materials discovery and ensuing applications.  Broader impacts lie in the exploration of materials with timely applications and of which a deeper understanding will have ramifications for other materials systems, both natural and laboratory-synthesized.  The synthesis component adds to our knowledge of synthesizing new metal oxides, and synthesizing materials inspired by mineral structure types in a laboratory at less extreme temperature and pressure regimes than in nature.  The one-step one-pot synthesis route, and the very varied characterization applied to the materials both contribute synthetic know-how in ceramics, inorganic chemistry, and metal oxide chemistry.  The approach is scalable and may be translated to industrial efforts.  The undergraduate and graduate students involved in the project have obtained skills that advanced their scientific careers, with several pursuing higher degrees and others employed by various technology firms.  The project thereby increased the pool of STEM professionals and highly skilled professionals.   Outcomes under this grant include the synthesis of new vanadium oxide materials and their potential use as electrode materials for energy storage applications, a study of the use of the ammonium cation in aqueous electrolyte solutions for electrochemical energy storage, and investigations into the variable temperature and pressure electrical conductivity of mixed conductors.  A key outcome was the synthesis, structural characterization and experimental evaluation of the electrochemical energy storage capabilities of a vanadium oxide nanostructured material, with potential applications for electrical energy storage.  Notably, the material is stable in an aqueous electrolyte solutions of alkali metal chlorides as well as ammonium chloride, with specific charge of 180 mAh g-1 and specific energy of 52 Wh/kg.  The vanadium oxide electrode material in aqueous ammonium chloride electrolyte is stable at ambient conditions over many months, and may be cycled multiple times.  In addition, the availability and cost of ammonium salts provides a new approach to materials and electrolytes for electrical energy storage.  Additional outcomes relate to the capabilities developed in the PIs laboratory to enable electrical measurements of single crystals of semiconducting mineral-inspired materials under hydrostatic pressure, to correlate structure-function relationships.  Two publications, nine conference presentations, and a PhD thesis dissertation resulted from this grant.        Last Modified: 08/29/2018       Submitted by: Victoria Soghomonian]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
