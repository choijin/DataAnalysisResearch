<AbstractNarration>Advances in data storage technology have been crucial to the evolution of the modern information age, enabling and accelerating the invention of new information-related applications in consumer entertainment, personal and business computing, enterprise data management, and scientific research. Recently, high capacity solid-state drives (SSDs) based upon NAND flash memory technology have begun attracting significant attention and finding broader use in many of these applications.  SSDs have a number of advantages compared to conventional disk and tape drives, including better shock resistance, reduced power consumption, no moving parts, and faster data access. Although they remain less competitive in some storage applications with respect to cost per bit, overwrite constraints, and product lifetime limitations, it is becoming increasingly clear that continuing advances in the technology of SSDs and other non-volatile memories (NVMs) are setting the stage for a revolution in how computer systems and applications access and manipulate persistent data. Improved flash memories ? along with emerging technologies such as phase-change memories (PCM), spin-torque transfer memories (STTM), and the memristor ? are driving designers to rethink how they integrate these and other storage devices into future computing systems, how operating systems manage data, and how applications create and process information electronically. Realizing the full potential of these technologies is an exciting and important challenge with enormous societal consequences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed workshop is a sequel to the Non-volatile Memories Workshops that were held on the campus of the University of California, San Diego in April 2010 and March 2011, respectively. Archival websites from these workshops may be found at http://nvmw.ucsd.edu/. The primary objective has been to further the development of a ?vertical? vision for research on the role of NVM technologies in data intensive computing systems. It is essential that researchers at each level of the system ?stack? be aware of the needs, challenges, and opportunities associated with the other levels. The workshop will give researchers in relevant fields the opportunity to gain a broader understanding of what is needed to move NVM-based storage technology forward, to learn from each other, and to establish relationships and collaborations that will provide the basis for further scientific and engineering advances.  This will be accomplished through a wide-ranging program containing a half-day tutorial sesssion, two keynote addresses, and contributed technical presentations covering important topics related to: NVM device technologies, data recording and recovery techniques, system architectures and software design, and future NVM applications in personalized health, green computing, and enterprise-scale information management.  Open registration for the entire workshop is intended to encourage broader participation by interested individuals from academia, industry, and government. The technical program is structured to provide a unique educational opportunity, particularly for students and researchers who are new to the area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: This workshop will address fundamental problems in the science, engineering, and application of high-performance data storage systems based upon non-volatile memories. This includes the study of nano-scale physical phenomena that permit storage of information; the development of coding algorithms for reliable, persistent, and secure data storage; the analysis of system architectures for data intensive computing; and the conception of new paradigms for non-volatile storage of data in a variety of applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: The exchange of knowledge and the generation of novel ideas that result from the workshop will have significant impact on the computing and data storage industries, both vitally important to the national economy. The educational component of the workshop will benefit students and postdoctoral researchers, as well as more senior participants. An archival website will provide a lasting record of the workshop proceedings and a resource for the scientific community and general public.</AbstractNarration>
