<AbstractNarration>The research objectives are to advance the state of the art in methods of wireless health. Projects span the range of end-to-end systems including robust inference using body networks of sensors, real-time and energy efficient analysis of sensor data using smartphones, development of effective interfaces and other feedback mechanisms, and construction of readily searchable large-scale databases of time series data. Collectively, the projects enable quantitative determination of patient state and compliance with therapy, and thus facilitate large-scale clinical studies that evaluate the effectiveness of particular therapies. Projects related to inference of human motion and provision of appropriate feedback also have application to sports training and the learning of other physical skills.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts include training of undergraduate researchers by graduate mentors and their inspiration to pursue graduate studies. The summer research is designed to develop materials that refresh capstone design courses and produce hands-on activities that are added to lecture courses. The research of the graduate mentors, the summer research, and the capstone design activities are all closely related in a cycle that advances research and training in each phase.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additional information is provided at the project web site (http://www.wirelesshealth.ucla.edu/).</AbstractNarration>
