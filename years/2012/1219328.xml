<AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;30 April 2012&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number:  1219328&lt;br/&gt;Institution:  Scripps Institution of Oceanography (SIO)&lt;br/&gt;PI:   B. Appelgate&lt;br/&gt;Co-PI:  Z. Kelety&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal requests CY 2012 operational funding support for the West Coast Winch Pool which is managed by Scripps Institution of Oceanography. The West Coast Winch Pool is located at SIO's Marine Facility in San Diego, CA.  The West Coast Winch Pool supports federally-funded oceanographic research by providing properly outfitted and maintained portable winches of all types (light-duty to full ocean depth) to the Academic Research Vessel Fleet.  Pooling of portable capital equipment such as this (1) provides "Centers of Expertise" with logistical support for science and ship operators; (2) provides equipment that is "Free at the Point of Use" to NSF-funded users which relieves burden on science and ship operations grants; (3) provides a mechanism for non-NSF funded users to share maintenance costs by paying established daily rates; (4) reduces the need for duplication of equipment at multiple institutions which results in a long-term cost savings to the federal agencies; (5) generates improved budget transparency on actual costs to operate and properly maintain capital, shared-use equipment; (6) allows NSF to make proper equipment purchase decisions based on science needs and provide the appropriate, dedicated, long-term support budgets; and (7) improves the quality and reliability of equipment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:  The research projects supported by the equipment pools have been individually peer-reviewed for scientific merit with all equipment deployments coordinated with University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS) ship time requests.  SIO also operates the MELVILLE, REVELLE, NEW HORIZON and SPROUL.   These vessels support federally-funded scientific research throughout the world's oceans and routinely expose graduate and undergraduate students to seagoing oceanography.  SIO participates in a large number of outreach programs including open house events, student tours, and hosting of government officials, dignitaries, and science communities while in foreign ports.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Scripps Institution of Oceanography maintains the National Science Foundation?s (NSF) West Coast Winch Pool for the benefit of U.S. ocean scientists.  The winch pool is a shared-use facility that procures, maintains, upgrades, and makes available a variety of portable oceanographic winches that are used by scientists aboard a broad range of research vessels.  The pool currently includes a deep sea traction winch, three light-duty winches, four general purpose mooring spoolers, one large mooring spooler, a double-barrel capstan, and a tensioning wire spooling system.  Winches are shared following community-based scheduling methods fostered by the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS).  Oceanographic winches must adequately support the scientific needs of users as well as comply with strict safety standards.  Winches are expensive and require skilled technical support for proper maintenance, testing, and upgrading as scientific requirements and safety standards evolve.  A relatively small and diverse pool of winches, maintained by a skilled technical staff, can be efficiently shared across the academic research fleet to meet the needs of scientists while maintaining the highest levels of safety and operational ability.  Winches are critical tools that enable the observation, measurement, and collection of samples and data used by ocean scientists aboard research vessels.  The winch pool is an integral element of the academic research fleet as it carries out its mission to advance our understanding of the oceans, climate, and Earth. The west coast winch pool enables the most appropriate technology for over-the-side handling equipment to be provided uniformly to members of the UNOLS community.   Our management of the winch pool is guided by our policy of continual improvement in safety, efficiency and quality of service to users, with a focus on protection of the environment, as stated in our ISM Code-compliant Safety Management System.  During the period of performance for this award, the Scripps Institution of Oceanography supported the maintenance, shipping, mobilization, logistics, scheduling, acquisition of additional assets, compliance with UNOLS safety standards, and other activities related to the management of this winch pool.
