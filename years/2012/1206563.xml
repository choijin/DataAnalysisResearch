<AbstractNarration>NON TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION:  Transition metal oxides represent a family of materials that is enabling new devices in applications ranging from solar cells to post CMOS electronics to communications systems to chemical catalysis.  Ferroelectric compounds exhibit extreme properties related to electron spin, charge and polarization that suggest innovative pathways to some of these solutions.  This project uses atomic resolution tools to determine the interactions of ferroelectric surfaces with molecules and metal clusters. Specifically, interactions of water and platinum with barium titanate are quantified.  This research represents the first atomic level visualization of molecular interactions in this class of materials.  A high school summer academy class in nanotechnology is offered  to inspire interest in careers in science based fields and a leadership program for graduate students imparts the non-technical skills required in future leaders.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TECHNICAL DETAILS:  Ferroelectric compounds exhibit extreme properties related to electron spin, charge and polarization that have the potential to enable next generation devices in energy, nanoelectronics, and catalysis.  This project uses scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy in conjunction with other characterization tools to determine the mechanisms of molecular absorption on barium titanate (100) surfaces with and without metal clusters.  The effect of Ti atomic coordination on water absorption is determined by comparing reactions on a series of surface reconstructions that vary in Ti concentration.  The effect of polarization on reactions of water with Pt metal clusters is examined by comparing tunneling spectra over domains with different orientations with those of the clusters.  Charge carriers that effect surface reactions are generated with optical illumination and the effect on water reactivity quantified.  The results are compared to theoretical calculations in order to relate the local electronic structures to chemical interactions.  The results inform advances in thin film growth, surface chemical reactivity and the physics of electronic polarization.  A high school summer academy class in nanotechnology is class is offered  to inspire interest in careers in science based fields and a leadership program for graduate students imparts the non technical skills required in future leaders.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Atomic Interactions on Ferroelectric Surfaces Determine Behavior     The mushrooming internet of things, innovative approaches to manufacturing and new solutions for energy generation and storage depend upon the development of functional materials&hellip; materials with active properties.  Ferroelectric compounds are a class of functional materials in which atoms interact in a manner that results in intriguing responses to electric fields and to exposure to chemicals.  Although the studies of such atomic interactions in other compounds had been done for decades, the properties that result in ferroelectric behavior make these compounds difficult to examine.  Yet understanding the behavior of atoms in these materials is prerequisite to the ability to design applications.  Recently we developed the experimental approaches to probe ferroelectric compounds at the atomic level and explore the interactions of the surfaces with temperature variation, electric fields, and exposure to chemical environments.  In this project barium titanate (BaTiO3) was used as the prototypical ferroelectric material.  Scanning tunneling microscopy and other analytical tools were used to image the atomic structures of surfaces of this material under a variety of conditions.  In some cases the surface structure reflects the structure within the material; in others the surface adopts a different structure.  One of the first results of this project was to determine the atomic arrangement in one of the surface structures we previously observed.   Understanding the positions of the atoms is key to understanding properties. A critical part of the experimental measurement is the spatially resolved electronic structure which provides information about atomic bonding.  Achieving this understanding requires the comparison of experimental results with quantum mechanical calculations.  Two new surface structures were discovered in this research and the mechanism by which these   structures formed was determined. This is important because understanding the mechanism allows conditions such as time and temperature to be manipulated to control the structure and, consequently, the properties.  For example, a structure with more Ti on the surface would be a better catalyst for chemical reactions in some manufacturing processes and could optimize water splitting reactions for gas generation.   The defining property of a ferroelectric compound is that the atomic structure contains inherent electric dipoles.  These dipoles can be manipulated by imposing an external electric field, which induces the dipoles to align with the field.  Indeed, the traditional capacitor electronics industry is based on this interaction.  The potential application in next generation energy devices, sensors, etc requires an understanding of these dipole interactions at small scales.  Using a nanometer sized electrode to produce a local electric field that ?switched? the domains of dipoles, the effect of local electronic structure on dipole orientation was measured for the first time.  The effect of the dipole orientation on the interaction of the surface with molecules was also determined.  The Intellectual merit of this research project resides in the fundamental atomic insight that was developed regarding the structure and behavior of complex oxides.  The determination of the atomic structure of several surfaces, the mapping of the stability of the structures, and the discovery of new structures will inform, not only the future developments in ferroelectric materials, but those in functional oxides more generally.   This project had broad impacts on two fronts.  This first relates to the potential application of these compounds in devices enabled by the understanding of the structure/property relations. The second pertains to increasing the diversity of the workforce through the education and professional development of several cohorts of scientists and engineers from under represented groups.  A structured professional development program for post doctoral associates was developed and implemented, along with facilitated mentoring.  The outcome during the course of this grant is that 94% of program graduates are working in their professions, 25% in industrial settings, 68% in academic institutions.  In addition to the publications listed by NSF, there are several others in development.       Last Modified: 10/07/2016       Submitted by: Dawn A Bonnell]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
