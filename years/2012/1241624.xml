<AbstractNarration>This project is a collaborative effort involving Whatcom Community College, Western Washington University, and the University of Washington. The investigators are taking a comprehensive approach to growing an educated and skilled workforce in a field critical to the U.S. economy and national security. The approach includes the development of new information assurance/cybersecurity degree pathways that are replicable statewide, coupled with outreach to recruit students (including underserved populations) into the pathways. Forty faculty are participating in the project over a three-year period, and the project is likely to reach over 500 students during that time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Project goals and activities include:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* increasing the capacity for educating information technology professionals in cybersecurity-related disciplines by creating new two-year and four-year degrees in information assurance/cybersecurity at the three partnering institutions of higher education;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* increasing the number of professionals in cybersecurity-related jobs by offering opportunities for students (traditional students, nontraditional students, veterans, and career-changers) to complete new, streamlined educational pathways;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* increasing interest in information assurance/cybersecurity careers and education among K-12 and college students by hosting information sessions and workshops for secondary students, and industry tours and guest speakers for college students and college mentors;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* strengthening partnerships between institutions of higher education through collaboration on curriculum development and articulation agreements;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* strengthening partnerships with local industry and employers by convening advisory committees, arranging student tours and internships at industry sites, and inviting industry speakers into the classroom;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* developing new teaching expertise in information assurance/cybersecurity, especially in high schools; and&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* increasing the diversity of the cybersecurity workforce by recruiting women, veterans, Native American students, and economically disadvantaged students.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Whatcom Community College (WCC) is building the cybersecurity workforce in the Northwest through the successful completion of the NSF-funded Capacity Building in Cybersecurity grant. This project?s primary goal was to develop and implement two new degrees in cybersecurity &ndash; one at Whatcom Community College and one at Western Washington University (WWU) &ndash; with a seamless transfer pathway between the two. The project addressed a critical local and national issue: the tremendous demand for trained cybersecurity professionals. The implementation of the two degrees is helping to meet that need. In addition, the pathway to the WWU degree includes the transfer of applied credits into the major, which has not been available to Washington community college students prior to this project.  Along with these two new degrees, Whatcom also established articulation agreements with Bellingham Technical College to assure transferability of credits and developed courses for a state-approved Bachelors of Applied Science in IT Networking.  This project also included work with the University of Washington (UW) to develop an agreement that would enable students to transfer cybersecurity courses between UW?s three campuses. Work was also done to establish a pathway for Whatcom cybersecurity students into the University of Washington (still under development).  Students who wish to pursue cybersecurity careers and remain in the Northwest now have many educational options, and the area as a whole has been strengthened economically now that employers have a well-prepared workforce upon which to draw.
