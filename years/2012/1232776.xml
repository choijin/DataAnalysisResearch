<AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;30 April 2012&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number:  1232776&lt;br/&gt;Institution:  Oregon State University&lt;br/&gt;PI:   D. Bailey&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal requests CY 2012 operational funding support for the West Coast Van Pool which is managed by Oregon State University. The West Coast Van Pool is located at the OSU's marine facility in Newport, Oregon.  The West Coast Van Pool supports federally-funded oceanographic research by providing properly outfitted and maintained portable laboratory vans of all types to the Academic Research Vessel Fleet.  Pooling of portable capital equipment such as this (1) provides "Centers of Expertise" with logistical support for science and ship operators; (2) provides equipment that is "Free at the Point of Use" to NSF-funded users which relieves burden on science and ship operations grants; (3) provides a mechanism for non-NSF funded users to share maintenance costs by paying established daily rates; (4) reduces the need for duplication of equipment at multiple institutions which results in a long-term cost savings to the federal agencies; (5) generates improved budget transparency on actual costs to operate and properly maintain capital, shared-use equipment; (6) allows NSF to make proper equipment purchase decisions based on science needs and provide the appropriate, dedicated, long-term support budgets; and (7) improves the quality and reliability of equipment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:  The research projects supported by the equipment pools have been individually peer-reviewed for scientific merit with all equipment deployments coordinated with University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS) ship time requests.  During operations, vessels in the Academic Research Vessel Fleet routinely expose graduate and undergraduate students to seagoing oceanography.  Oregon State University participates in a large number of public outreach programs and open house events.  OSU also operates the NSF-owned R/V OCEANUS as part of the Academic Fleet now that the R/V WECOMA has been retired from service.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Project Summary     The 2012-2020 Shipboard Scientific Support Equipment grant was in support of the operation of the West Coast Van Pool.  The NSF/UNOLS Van Pools were established to provide safe and functional scientific support vans with common design features and standards. Institutions are not deterred from having vans built to support specific needs but the "UNOLS Portable Scientific Van Manual" does provide guidance and standards intended for such vans as well as those in the Van Pools. The Van Pools, through standardization, group purchasing, and the exchange of information and effort between the East and West Coast pools result in cost savings to the oceanographic science community as well as consistent safety standards and vans well suited to meet the general scientific needs of UNOLS vessel users. These benefits have resulted in the effectiveness and efficiency of oceanographic research, funded by the NSF and other agencies, on UNOLS as well as NOAA and USCG research vessels.  The West Coast Van Pool currently consists of 9 modular laboratory vans that are all owned by the National Science Foundation or Oregon State University. A new Cold Van, replacing the one damaged at Scripps Institute of Oceanography, was constructed by Silhouette Steel on contract with the University of Delaware. The delay in the construction of the new Cold Van resulted in the extension of the life of this award with two No-Cost Extensions through June 30, 2020.     The West Coast Van Pool portable laboratories are maintained by Oregon State University and shipped to various US and foreign ports in support of sea-going science.         Project Accomplishments  The West Coast Van Pool supported approximately 3,772 days of service throughout the operational lifetime of Award 1232776 which occurred from about August of 2012 through March of 2018.  The lifetime of the award was extended through June of 2020 in order to provide time for the construction of a new Cold Van for the pool.  Funding for the new cold van was provided from outside insurance revenue collected by OSU and applied to the award when one of the WCVP cold vans was damaged in a foreign port.  Funds received by the West Coast Van Pool supported a variety of projects and equipment needs, including normal maintenance and repairs. Routine maintenance for the West Coast Van Pool include normal service and repair for each of the vans. Such repair items may include restocking consumables, servicing electrical, HVAC, and equipment systems, as well as preparing and painting the interior and exterior portions of the vans. Routine maintenance also encompasses the preparation of vans before departing the facility, including cleaning, inventory and equipment system checks.  Awarded funds also supported the purchase of a new Tri-Carb Scintillation Counter to replace an aging unit, a mobile crane for maneuvering vans onto vessels in home port, upgrading the electrical receptacles for all vans including the East Coast Van Pool, upgrading the emergency eyewash stations for all vans including the East Coast Van Pool for regulatory compliance, and the construction of a new Cold Van to replace the previous unit that was damaged at Scripps Institute of Oceanography’s Marine Facility.  Currently, the West Coast Van Pool collects rental fees only from non-NSF users.  Rental fees are not charged as direct costs to NSF.  Rather, the maintenance and repair costs are charged directly to NSF and non-NSF rental income is credited to NSF in the form of program income.  Two no-cost extensions to complete the construction of the Cold Van were submitted and approved by the NSF Program manager. Silhouette Steel completed the construction of the Cold Van and delivered it to the OSU Ship Operations facility in May of 2020. The Cold Van is currently undergoing manufacturer warranty repairs as a result of preliminary OSU inspection.     Throughout the lifetime of the award, a total of $921,765 in NSF awarded funds under Award# 1232776, and $70,300 in NSF program income supported the operations of the West Coast Van Pool while $193,022 in van insurance funds supported the construction of the new Cold Van.
