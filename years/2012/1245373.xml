<AbstractNarration>The reintroduction of large apex predators is an increasingly popular but controversial conservation practice worldwide. This project continues a 17-year study following wolves since their reintroduction to Yellowstone National Park. Long-term goals of the project are to identify the impacts that wolves have on their main prey, elk; document evolutionary responses of wolves and elk following wolf reintroduction; and quantify the effects of wolves on community-level interactions in the park. In the final five years of a planned ten-year study, the investigators will follow individually marked wolves and elk to determine how and why wolf-elk interactions fluctuate over time, the effects of these fluctuations on wolf traits and vital rates, and how wolves, grizzly bears, and cougars interact either synergistically or antagonistically to influence elk mortality rates. By examining changes in predator-prey dynamics continuously since wolf reintroduction, the project is assembling data that are unique in the history of large predator restoration. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this ongoing project have been, and will continue to be, extraordinary in large part because apex predators readily capture the public's attention. Results of the project are routinely covered by international media. Films, books for popular audiences, professional art exhibits, and museum exhibits have all been developed on the Yellowstone wolves and their impacts. Results of the project will continue to be critical to effective management of large predators as well as of endangered or threatened species. Results have also been incorporated into the Yellowstone National Park's interpretive programs, which annually reach over 250,000 park visitors. Finally, the project serves as the basis for graduate dissertation projects, has engaged over 70 aspiring scientists in field research, and supports undergraduate training through direct involvement in an exciting, high-profile project.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Calls for restoring or removing large carnivores like wolves often stem from impressions about the ecological effects of these animals. Different interest groups often frame the ability of carnivores to frighten and kill herbivores like elk as either a service that improves biodiversity and ecosystem function or as a crisis that threatens recreational and subsistence hunting by humans. The reintroduction of wolves to Yellowstone National Park during the mid-1990s gave our project a unique opportunity to confront these impressions with data.&nbsp;</p> <p>Beginning with the first wolves released, we tracked the behavior, reproduction, and survival of hundreds of radio-collared wolves in dozens of packs. Each of these wolves was a known individual. We knew the age, gender, weight, coat color, genotype, and disease status of each animal. We produced a unique 22-year dataset that described what is to be a wolf in a wild protected landscape like Yellowstone. Despite little human persecution, this was a dangerous world for wolves and their family-structured packs. The number one threat was attack from rival packs seeking more food and more enemy-free space for their own packs. Our project produced a series of publications that revealed the competitive burden that encumbers the lives of individual wolves and the dynamics of wolf populations. A key product from our project is evidence that wolf populations are potentially self-limiting regardless of food supply.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>For much of the time that we tracked wolves, we also tracked the lives of their preferred prey, elk. We radio-collared nearly 300 adult female elk in northern Yellowstone and measured how wolves influenced their movements, reproduction, and survival. Ours is one of the few large animal studies that has produced a long-term dataset of simultaneously-tracked, individually-known predator and prey animals. We learned that elk timed their use of habitats where they were likely to be killed by wolves to hours of the day when wolves were least active (late at night and afternoon). This permitted daily access to important feeding areas, which allowed elk to maintain fat reserves and high rates of pregnancy despite the presence of wolves. This also allowed elk to continue eating deciduous woody plants such as aspen and willow, contrary to the idea that wolf predation risk shielded these plants from elk.&nbsp;</p> <p>We developed a database describing the characteristics of more than 3000 adult elk that died due to wolves and other causes. These and other data revealed that wolves concentrated their predation on the oldest fraction of the adult female population. The typical age of a radio-collared adult female elk killed by wolves was 15 years-old. Had wolves never been reintroduced, these older elk would have survived for a few more years before succumbing to old age. But because they tended to have low pregnancy rates, these elk would have contributed relatively little to population growth. High survival and pregnancy rates of younger female elk blunted the impact of wolf predation on elk population size. However, wolves were major predators of elk calves, especially during winter, and this was likely the main way that wolves contributed to the decline of the northern Yellowstone elk herd. Cougars, grizzly bears, and hunting by humans outside the park also contributed to the decline. Bears often stole kills from wolves and, surprisingly, this slowed rather than accelerated wolf kill rate because wolves opted to wait for bears to leave. Wolves also switched from hunting elk to scavenging bison carcasses as the bison population increased, and this too may have reduced wolf predation pressure on elk. Together, these results help explain how the northern elk herd has started growing again.&nbsp;</p> <p>Yellowstone wolf reintroduction is a classic case study of the forces that structure food webs. Despite the wolf&rsquo;s reputation as a strong ecological force, our study highlights an array of counterforces ranging from wolf territorial behavior to prey invulnerability that check the ability of wolves to affect ecological change. Certainly other wolves in other populations may have less (or more) exposure to these various checks. What matters is that these checks can occur, and if they do, expectations about the ecological costs and benefits of wolves may be unrealistic.
