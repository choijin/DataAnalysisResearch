<AbstractNarration>Proposed is an exploratory multichannel seismic reflection survey of Lake Towuti, South Sulawesi, the largest lake in Indonesia. Existing seismic reflection datasets from Lake Towuti indicate the presence of up to 150 of lacustrine sediment in Lake Towuti overlying a deeper package of fluvial and lacustrine sediment.  These deeper sediments potentially record the middle to late Pleistocene hydrologic history of central Indonesia, but are poorly resolved in current datasets.  The overarching goal is to generate a seismic-stratigraphic framework for this basin through multichannel seismic reflection surveys to provide new insight into the climatic and geological evolution of central Sulawesi since the mid-Pleistocene.  These data will also provide the fundamental, seismic-stratigraphic architecture upon which to will build a large, interdisciplinary project to obtain long drill cores from Lake Towuti to investigate climatic, environmental, and biological evolution in central Indonesia during the Pleistocene.  &lt;br/&gt;The Indo-Pacific region contains the largest pool of warm water on Earth, and variations in rainfall over the Indo-Pacific impact global climate through changes in the Earth?s atmospheric circulation.  Despite this region?s importance, we know very little about its long-term climatic and environmental evolution.  Indonesia sits at the heart of the Indo-Pacific and hosts numerous lakes, the sediments in which record the region?s environmental and climate history.  This proposal aims to geophysically characterize the sediments of Lake Towuti, the largest lake in Indonesia. Specifically, the project will characterize the nature and history of sedimentation in this lake since the mid-Pleistocene, or the last 1.5 million years.  This work will provide new insight into this region?s climatic, biological, and geological history.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Indonesia lies at the heart of the Indo-Pacific Warm Pool the largest pool of warm water on Earth. Evaporation and rainfall over Indonesia control the amount of water vapor in the EarthÆs atmosphere, and interact with globally important climate processes such as the El Ni&ntilde;o-Southern Oscillation. Despite the importance of this region, we lack long records of Indonesian hydrology to understand how global climate changes interact with this important region.  Lake Towuti is a large tectonic lake in central Indonesia that contains the longest known terrestrial sedimentary record of Indonesian hydrology, and can provide a critical new record long-term climate variability in this region.  The Lake Towuti Drilling Project seeks to provide such a record through scientific drilling, and this EAGER award allowed us to conduct geophysical and geochemical surveys of Lake Towuti to develop the drilling project and interpret sediment drill cores.  Continental drilling in Towuti also has the potential to catalyze novel, transformative research in biogeochemistry, geomicrobiology, and evolutionary biology. Lake Towuti is part of a chain of ancient lakes, the Malili Lakes, that harbor endemic fishes, snails, shrimp, and other organisms known nowhere else on earth.  These organisms are now threatened by human activities, and drilling in Lake Towuti will document the environmental and climatic context that shaped the evolution of MaliliÆs unique lacustrine and terrestrial ecosystems, and their resilience to longterm environmental change.  Moreover, Towuti is surrounded by metal-rich rocks that release high levels of iron, nickel, chromium, and other metals through weathering. These metals catalyze novel coupled carbon and metal biogeochemical cycling within a diverse, exotic lacustrine microbial community in the Malili Lakes. Drill core will provide insight into long-term changes in the geomicrobiology of this system.  Seismic reflection datasets recovered from this EAGER determined the spatial pattern of sedimentation across the lake and allowed us to select the best possible drilling targets for the Towuti Drilling Project.  Geochemical analyses of river and lake sediments provided new information on the geological stability of rivers that link that Malili Lakes and that provide conduits for biological exchange between the lakes, as well as information on the degree of lake mixing- critical for lacustrine organisms and habitats.  These analyses provide tools that will be applied to sediment drill cores.          Last Modified: 10/17/2014       Submitted by: James M Russell]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
