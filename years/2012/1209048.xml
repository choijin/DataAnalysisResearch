<AbstractNarration>This action funds Angelina Altshuler of University of California, San Diego (UCSD) to conduct a research project, entitled "Investigating the response of the blood vessel surface to reduced blood flow," during the summer of 2012 at National Health Research Institutes in Zhunan, Miaoli County, Taiwan.  The host scientist is Dr. Jeng-Jiann Chiu.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Intellectual Merit of the research project is to understand the response of the endothelial glycocalyx to blood flow reduction in the rat aorta and consequent endothelial dysfunction. The research uses basic principles in fluid mechanics and investigates how these principles apply to blood vessels. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.  These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[             In the human body, blood vessels are the highways for blood to deliver oxygen, nutrients, and other essential components to tissues.  The cells that line the blood vessels are called endothelial cells, and they are sensitive to the amount of blood flow.  These cells have a unique surface coating composed of sugars and proteins entitled the glycocalyx.  The glycocalyx is a mesh that allows components from the blood to reach the surface of the cell.  In addition to its barrier function, the glycocalyx can sense the amount of blood flow passing over its surface, denoted the shear stress.  Although there has been a great effort to identify the density of the glycocalyx on the surface of endothelial cells, there have been few studies that have investigated the density of the glycocalyx in regions of different flow patterns or to an artificial change in blood flow caused by a clip insertion.              To study the endothelial glycocalyx, we studied natural regions of high and low shear stress as well as the density in response to an artificial clip insertion in large blood vessels in the rat.  From our experiments, we observed that the glycocalyx is thicker in low shear stress regions than the corresponding high regions.  We also documented that the glycocalyx density decreases where an artificial clip is placed.  Future studies may investigate the ability of components from the blood to pass across the vessel wall when the glycocalyx is reduced which can lead to better understanding of cardiovascular conditions.
