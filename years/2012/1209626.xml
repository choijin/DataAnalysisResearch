<AbstractNarration>This action funds Amy Jordan of University of Washington to conduct a research project, entitled  "Identifying starch residues on pots from early Colonial plantation sites in the Banda Islands, Maluku Province, Indonesia" during the summer of 2012 at University of New South Wales in Syndey, Australia.  The host scientist is Judith Field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Intellectual Merit  of the research includes using an underutilized research technique on artifacts from a little-studied area and time period. The Banda Islands were the location of early experiments in colonialism by European powers and research into various aspects of European occupation can provide information for cross cultural studies of the different responses to colonialism. A starch grain analysis of food residue on ceramic sherds from colonial plantations in the Banda Islands gives direct evidence of dietary choices in this time period, a period of intense social change. This evidence is then used in conjunction with historical records to determine if ethnic background may have influenced food choice during the colonial period. Using this underutilized analytical technique to investigate colonial era archaeological remains will add to the growing body of Neolithic and pre-colonial archaeology conducted in the Banda Islands. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.   These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.</AbstractNarration>
