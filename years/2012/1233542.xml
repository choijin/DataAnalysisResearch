<AbstractNarration>This project considers El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) which occur in the Central Equatorial Pacific (CP).  CP ENSO events are distinct from the canonical ENSO events which occur in the Eastern Equatorial Pacific (EP) and appear as a narrow tongue of sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies extending along the equatorial cold tongue from the South American coast.  In contrast, SST anomalies for CP ENSO events extend poleward and eastward from the CP to the subtropical coasts of North and South America, with stronger extension in the Northern Hemisphere.  Furthermore, the evolution of EP ENSO events is associated with propagation or basin-wide fluctuation of subsurface ocean temperature anomalies at thermocline depth, while CP ENSO events have subsurface temperature anomalies which develop in situ, without propagation.  The PIs note that CP ENSO events have become more common since the 1990s, and recent studies suggest that global warming may lead to further enhancement in CP over EP ENSO activity.  They also note that the CP ENSO has received less attention in the literature than the EP ENSO, and studies of ENSO and its connections to the extratropics, including both extratropical precursors and extratropical impacts, have not considered the two ENSO types separately.  The project addresses three scientific issues related to CP ENSO events.  First, research addresses the underlying dynamics of CP events, and the relationship between CP and EP ENSO dynamics, through the use of idealized models and models of intermediate complexity.  Second, the project addresses the role of extratropical forcing in generating CP ENSO events, based on earlier research which identified precursor patterns in sea surface temperatures in the Northern Hemisphere subtropics.  Third, the research considers differences in the global impacts of CP and EP ENSO events, based in part on prevous work suggesting that EP events produce a north-south pattern of winter temperature anomalies over the US, while CP events produce an east-west oriented pattern.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Beyond its scientific merit, the project has broader impacts due to the societal impacts of ENSO events.  ENSO is the leading mode of short-term climate variability over the globe, and research to understand the dynamics and consequences of ENSO events could be instrumental in improving ENSO predictions.  In addition, the work will support and train graduate and undergraduate students, as well as a postdoctoral researcher, thereby developing the scientific workforce in this area.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ 1. Project Goals   The El Ni&ntilde;o&ndash;Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is a prominent climate phenomenon in the tropical Pacific that can disrupt global atmospheric and oceanic circulation patterns and exert profound impacts on global climate and socio-economic activities. Recently, it has become obvious that the central location of the sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies associated with ENSO has moved from the tropical eastern Pacific to tropical central Pacific. The conventional type of ENSO is now referred to as the Eastern Pacific (EP) ENSO, whereas the emerging type is referred to as the Central Pacific (CP) ENSO. The goals of this project are (1) to better understand the generation dynamics of the CP ENSO, (2) to determine the cause of its recent emergence, and (3) to identify its impacts on global climate. Research tasks have been successfully conducted during the past four years (2012-2016) to achieve all the project goals.   2. Outcomes in understanding CP ENSO's Dynamics and its recent emergence  By conducting theoretical, diagnostic, and modeling research tasks, this project finds the CP ENSO to be driven by subtropical atmospheric forcing. The CP ENSO dynamics is different from the traditional EP ENSO dynamics that relies on thermocline variations along the tropical Pacific. This project successfully develops a dynamic framework to explain how the subtropical atmospheric forcing can be transmitted into the tropical Pacific by subtropical Pacific ocean-atmosphere coupling to give rise to CP ENSO events.   This project further discovers that the subtropical Pacific coupling intensified after the early 1990s, as a result of which the subtropical atmospheric forcing becomes very efficient in inducing CP ENSO events. The Atlantic Multi-decadal Oscillation (AMO), which switched from a negative to a positive phase in the early 1990s, is found to be responsible for the intensification of the subtropical Pacific coupling. A series of inter-basin interaction processes are identified to explain how the AMO can influence the Pacific mean states (particularly the subtropical high) to modulate the strength of the subtropical Pacific coupling. The identified processes involve the Walker circulations in both the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, the barotropic wave response to tropical Pacific heating anomalies, and the subsidence induced by the Rossby wave train. The warmer Atlantic (due to the positive phase of the AMO) also provides a capacitor effect resulting in a CP ENSO that is dominated by a quasi-biennial (i.e., 2-3 years) periodicity.  This project finds that the increased importance of the CP ENSO dynamics in recent decades also impacted the 2015&shy;-16 extreme El Ni&ntilde;o, causing it to evolve differently from the 1997&shy;-98 extreme El Ni&ntilde;o. Observational analyses and numerical model experiments are conducted to show that the subtle differences in evolution caused their impacts on California rainfall to be dissimilar.  3. Outcomes in understanding CP ENSO's impacts on US climate and beyond  It is well recognized that North American climate is significantly impacted by ENSO. However, the existence of two types of ENSO was not taken into account in most past studies. This project conducts observational analyses and climate model experiments to extensively examine the impacts of the CP ENSO on US and global climate and to contrast the impacts to those produced by the EP ENSO.  The emerging CP ENSO is found to produce impacts on US climate that are distinct from those of the traditional EP ENSO. Differing impacts are identified for US winter precipitation and surface temperature patterns, spring stream flow variations in the Mississippi River basin, and summer Great Plains low level jet (GPLJ) strength. The changing impacts make the specific US regions that are most vulnerable to the El Ni&ntilde;o influences different in recent decades after the El Ni&ntilde;o changes type. The emerging CP El Ni&ntilde;o events are found to result in the US  receiving less winter rainfall since 1990, which can be a contributing factor for the prolonged US drought. The CP El Ni&ntilde;o also weakened the summer GPLLJ strength leading to a drier environment in the central United States. Most contemporary coupled climate models can capture the impacts of the EP ENSO on US but not the impacts of the CP ENSO.   This project also documents the different impacts produced by the two ENSO types on stream flows in world's top 20 river basins, southern hemisphere circulation patterns, Antarctic surface temperature, and western Pacific and East Asian climate.  4. Broader impacts our the outcomes   The understandings obtained from this project have broader impacts in that they suggest a revision to traditional views of ENSO dynamics and impacts and how they may change as global climate changes. The project outcomes can help to improve ENSO predictions. The understanding obtained can also help in developing new ways to interpret paleoclimate proxies of Earth's past climate. Finally, the project trains graduate students and post-doctoral researchers in the rapidly growing Earth System Science Department at University of California, Irvine.
