<AbstractNarration>This award will support an observational study of novae, which are eruptive phenomena on stars that are the recipients of mass transfer in close binary systems.  The main goal will be to obtain radio imaging observations soon after outburst.  As part of this effort, the team will focus on understanding how thermonuclear runaway proceeds, the ejection mechanism for the nova envelope, and the processes that shape the nova remnants.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will include considerable involvement of the amateur astronomical community in the identification of promising novae for detailed study.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ At the start of this project to unravel the mysteries of novae -- the most common major stellar eruptions in the Universe -- NASA's Fermi satellite discovered that many novae produce gamma-rays.  Even more energetic than X-rays, gamma-rays were not expected from these (relatively) slow explosions, which occur when material that has been transferred to a white-dwarf star from a binary companion becomes hot and dense enough to ignite.  Working with collaborators, we used multiple arrays of radio telescopes to image one of the first novae to produce strong gamma-rays (nova V959 Mon).  Our observations showed that V959 Mon generated gamma-rays because a fast wind from the eruptive white dwarf collided with a slower torus of material that was ejected earlier in the eruption (see Image).  The collisions between these two flows created shocks that accelerated particles to nearly the speed of light.  Such fast particles can produce gamma-rays.  This finding led to new questions.  Do other novae generate gamma-rays in the same way?  How common are the types of colliding flows we observed?  Why don't all novae produce gamma-rays?  Based on additional radio observations of other novae (along with observations at optical and X-ray wavelengths plus theoretical considerations), we found that the answers to those questions seem to be: 1) probably; 2) quite common; and 3) because some of the flows are too fast.  In particular, the graduate student funded by this award led two papers that extended the findings described above, about particles being accelerated by colliding flows in novae, to two other nova-producing binary-star systems.  Furthermore, comparing measurements taken by amateur astronomers of brightness fluctuations from a well-known recurrent nova (T Pyx) to Hubble Space Telescope images of the "echo" of this light, we were also able to reconstruct the three-dimensional shape of another nova shell.  It turned out to be dominated by an inclined ring, supporting the idea that many novae expel material preferentially into the orbital plane of the binary, as in V959 Mon. In terms of why all novae do not emit strong gamma-rays, we participated in a theoretical investigation showing that slow shocks, behind which material can become very dense, are more likely to generate gamma-rays than fast shocks.  Moreover, our investigation of gamma-rays and shocks helped us address other, long-standing issues.  The quest to determine the origin of gamma-rays furnished hints about fundamental questions such as the ejection mechanisms, shaping mechanisms, and mass of the material thrown from novae.  For example, the prevalence of equatorial rings in novae suggests that binary companions help the eruptive white dwarfs expel their envelopes. Dense equatorial rings also explain how the wind from the luminous white dwarf gets shaped into bipolar lobes.  Finally, throughout the project, the PI worked with the American Association of Variable Star Observers (AAVSO) to support their efforts to, "...enable anyone, anywhere, to participate in scientific discovery through variable-star research."  As a member of the Governing Council of the AAVSO, including stints as Vice President and then President of that organization, the PI helped guide the AAVSO through the selection of a new Director as well as a period of tight funding.  The citizen scientists of the AAVSO, in turn, made crucial contributions to the scientific success of this research.
