<AbstractNarration>Dr. Sasha Hinkley is awarded an NSF Astronomy and Astrophysics Postdoctoral Fellowship to carry out a program of research and education at the California Institute of Technology.  In this project the fellow will perform a high-contrast imaging survey for exoplanets around nearby stars using a new instrument recently commissioned at Palomar Observatory.  This instrument, an Integral Field Spectrogragh combined with a coronagraph, works in conjunction with the Palomar Adaptive Optics system to achieve high-contrast images and spectroscopy of exoplanets.  The fellow has been one of the central architects for this instrument, the first of its kind and the only one in the Northern Hemisphere.   The fellow will use this suite of instrumentation to carry out a high-contrast, adaptive optics survey of nearby A and F stars with the goal of obtaining images and spectroscopy of exoplanets of several Jupiter masses.  Obtaining these data will provide a more complete picture of the true frequency of exoplanets.  The spectroscopic information will also allow investigators to gather information about the chemistry, composition, and thermal histories of these exoplanets, opening the door to the new field of comparative exoplanetary science.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this project include a significant educational component.  The fellow will create a set of inquiry-based physics laboratories for high school students in the Pasadena Unified School District.  He will work with the Director of the Caltech Pre-College Science Initiative (CAPSI) to develop these exercises and work with local teachers and educators to implement them.  CAPSI's effort to support inquiry-based learning in local high school science classrooms is a nascent five-year program, and the fellow will begin contributing immediately.  The ultimate goal of CAPSI's program is to create a district-wide model that will have broad impacts both locally and nationally.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In recent years, astronomers have identified hundreds of extrasolar planets---planets in solar systems other than our own.  The vast majority of these objects have been discovered indirectly by observing the variations induced in light of the exoplanet host star. Recently however, astronomers have obtained images of extrasolar planets directly, using sophisticated techniques such as adaptive optics on large ground based telescopes.  So far, the planets observed directly are out of reach to the indirect methods, and are already revealing detailed information through examination of their colors and spectra.  These studies are starting to reveal completely new aspects of exoplanetary science in great detail.    For my NSF Astronomy and Astrophysics Postdoctoral Fellowship hosted by the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) in Pasadena, I was one of the key members of a team that launched a new survey at Palomar Observatory with the goal of directly imaging extrasolar planets.  Caltech is the home of Palomar Observatory, still a leading site for astronomical research now equipped with Adaptive Optics, a technique for correcting aberrations in our astronomical images due to turbulence in the EarthÃ†s atmosphere. In addition, our project uses a specialized camera developed during my PhD thesis at Columbia University, that obtains many images at different wavelengths simultaneously. This helps to improve our sensitivity to planetary mass objects, but also will provide us with spectroscopy of any directly imaged exatrasolar planets. Obtaining these data will not only help to give a more complete picture of the true frequency of exoplanets, but the spectroscopic information will allow us to gather information about the chemistry, composition, and thermal histories of these exoplanets.    Support in the form of an NSF Astronomy and Astrophysics Postdoctoral Fellowship allowed me to spend dozens of nights at Palomar Observatory, assisting with the development of this new suite of instrumentation, as well as planning our survey of 200 stars nearby stars. A survey of this size requires a concerted effort of numerous people ranging from scientists at Caltech, engineers at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, to the mountain staff at Palomar.  Further, the intellectual merit of this project is reflected by the influence our Northern Hemisphere suite of instrumentation has had on other recently initiated Southern Hemisphere exoplanet direct imaging surveys such as (GPI and SPHERE at Cerro Pachon and Cerroo Paranal, respectively), as well as upcoming ones in the Northern Hemisphere (SCeXAO on Mauna Kea).   Indeed, research like this will have an extremely broad impact not only on the field of (exo)planetary science, but will also has the potential to captivate and nurture public interest in exoplanetary science.
