<AbstractNarration>The ice-tethered winch (ITW) will combine the design of two established technologies, the Ice-Tethered Profiler and Arctic Winch. Merging these technologies will expand upon their individual capabilities by creating a new instrument that can both telemeter subsurface data from beneath the ice and profile the water column over variable depths. The ITW will complement other existing Arctic observational efforts (e.g., icebreaker surveys, gliders, and moorings) by providing relatively high resolution (four profiles daily with less than 10 cm vertical resolution) time series of year-round, near-surface physical and biological properties, including temperature, salinity, pressure, turbidity, and chlorophyll. The ITW will transition between a Eulerian platform when tethered to landfast ice and a semi-Lagrangian drifter when in open water. Year-round data from the ITW will be freely provided in realtime via a newly created ITW website and the Cooperative Arctic Data and Information Service in accordance with the guidelines provided by the Arctic Observing Network.  The ITW website will not only provide a portal for data, but will also include an overview of the project and region targeted to the general public. A public talk will be given in Barrow, Alaska prior to deployment. ITW data will be integrated into the Physical Oceanography curriculum of the Nippon Foundation-POGO Centre of Excellence in Observational Oceanography (CofE) hosted at the Bermuda Institute of Ocean Sciences. Analysis of ITW data will be used in a student research project during CofE.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit  Over the past half-century, perennial ice cover in the Arctic has declined rapidly; consequently, the extent of the seasonal ice zone (SIZ) has increased. Due to remoteness, extreme weather, and ice dynamics, oceanic measurements in the SIZ are difficult and costly to acquire, particularly on a year-round basis. As a result, oceanic data in the SIZ are limited and sporadic. Because of proximity to land and high biological productivity, the shelf and marginal seas, which comprise the bulk of the SIZ, are important to indigenous coastal communities and marine life. To help fill the data gap that exists in oceanic observations over the Arctic shelf, we have developed and conducted prototype deployments of a new autonomous profiler, the Ice-Tethered Winch (ITW). The ITW compliments other existing Arctic observational efforts (e.g., icebreaker surveys, gliders, and moorings) by providing relatively high resolution time series of year-round, near-surface physical and biological properties, including temperature, salinity, pressure, optical properties, and chlorophyll. Data from the ITW are freely available, and may be accessed through the ITW website and at the AON Cooperative Arctic Data and Information Service.  Broader Impacts  Changes in the nature of the seasonal ice zone (SIZ), for example the timing of the freeze-up or break-up and how far ice extends offshore, have consequences to the marine life and human populations that depend upon this region. Unfortunately, limited oceanic observations within this region hinder our ability to fully understand the impacts of these changes to the Arctic system.
