<AbstractNarration>This INSPIRE award is partially funded by the Communication and Information Foundations Program in the Division of Computing and Communication Foundations of the Directorate for Computer &amp; Information Science &amp; Engineering (CISE/CCF) and the Economics Program in the Division of Social and Economic Sciences of the Directorate for Social, Behavioral &amp; Economic Sciences (SBE/SES), and addresses engineering and economic challenges in developing a sustainable pathway to an electric-vehicle based transportation system. In particular, the project aims to develop transformative technologies and economic/policy solutions that facilitate a paradigm shift from individual and on-demand charging of today to one of network-switched, interactive, and managed charging. The major benefits of the new paradigm include reduced peak power demand from large scale charging, improved profit potential for charging facilities, enhanced consumer experience, and ultimately the wider adoption of electric vehicles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project pursues joint economic and engineering solutions based on an architectural innovation that integrates renewable sources, responds to real time electricity pricing, and interacts with consumers through dynamic and service differentiated pricing. The project  employs economic modeling and optimization techniques to characterize demand and profit conditions. A dynamic model will be developed to investigate the interactions between charging facility investments and electric vehicle ownership.  Counterfactual analysis will be conducted to gain insights into the roles of consumers, investors, and the government and the impacts of different economic, policy and technological factors in the diffusion process of electric vehicles and charging infrastructure.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    Intellectual merits: This research addresses some of the major engineering and economic challenges in developing a sustainable pathway to an electric vehicle based transportation system.  In particular, the research aims to develop transformative technologies for large scale charging of electric vehicles that provide consumers low-cost charging by exploiting on-site renewable sources, local storage, real-time pricing of electricity, and flexibilities of charging schedules. Dynamic pricing mechanisms are considered to maximize profit for infrastructure investors.   A key technological innovation is a new charging architecture based on the concept of network switched charging controlled by an intelligent energy management system.  Near optimal deadline scheduling algorithms have been developed to minimize the charging cost subject to constraints on maximum power drawn and charging deadlines.  This project also develops a unified dynamic economic model that provides insights into indirect network effects arising from the diffusion processes of electric vehicles and charging facilities. In particular, the research project for the first time quantifies the impact of the current subsidy policies on electric vehicle purchases and informs the efficient policy design forward. Specifically, the results show that federal income tax credit of up to $7,500 for electric vehicle buyers contributed to about 40% of electric vehicle sales during 2011&ndash;13, with feedback loops explaining 40% of that increase. A policy of equal-sized spending but subsidizing charging station deployment could have been more than twice as effective in promoting electric vehicle adoption.  Broader impacts:  This research has significant educational impacts on cross-training engineering and economics students in energy research and sustainability sciences and on curriculum development.  The research also has technological impacts in other application domains such as cloud computing, internet of things, and health monitoring technology where the underlying technology developed can be applied.  Outside science and technology, the outcome of this research provides analysis of and insights into the effectiveness of various policy decisions and incentives.
