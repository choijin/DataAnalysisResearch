<AbstractNarration>This project is utilizing three interdisciplinary courses to educate students in the realms of genomics, molecular evolution, and the bioinformatics analyses of genes and genomes. Students participating in these courses come from several majors, departments, and colleges, providing a diverse multidisciplinary environment with great potential for peer learning. While developing hypotheses, students are gaining hands on skills in DNA sequence analysis in the Molecular Ecology Laboratory and Bioinformatics courses. They analyze metagenomic datasets that they helped to generate, using these to test hypotheses about microbial ecology, symbiosis, and the roles of microbes in digestion and nutrition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This thematic strategy is expected to actively engage students in the learning process, helping them to develop as critical-thinkers who understand the scientific method. To measure the success of this approach, students are answering a series of questions about their impressions and perceived understanding of bioinformatics throughout the sequence. They are also being tested on their knowledge of bioinformatics at the beginning and end of the sequence. Assessments of students taking all three courses, one or two of the courses, or none of the courses are being compared to determine the program's impact. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Successful completion of the sequence is producing students who are highly qualified for careers in bioinformatics, having worked with the types of datasets that bioinformaticians routinely analyze. The generation and analysis of high throughput datasets is modernizing bioinformatics education at Drexel, and the three-course sequence (and case-study based approach) is expected to serve as a model for other institutions.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project developed a three-course sequence to educate students about metagenomics through experiential learning by taking them from inquiry to analysis of the microbiome: Molecular Ecology Lab, Bioinformatics, and Computational Metagenomics.  Students developed hypotheses, designed lab experiments, sequenced the DNA from microbiomes, learned about bioinformatics algorithms, learned basic python/R scripting, became proficient in at least one metagenomics analysis software, and was able to analyze data generated from the microbiome experiments.  Over 100 students were impacted by the development of the 3-course sequence, with another 50 taking the bioinformatics and computational metagenomics courses once developed.  The new materials for bioinformatics course and the new computational metagenomics course developed under the award is available on our lab's Github (http://github.com/EESI).  Seven graduate students and 1 K-12 teacher participated in developing materials to teach biology, bioinformatics, and metagenomics.  Other outreach activities involved a lecture on machine learning and biology to the 2016 Philadelphia Science Festival and teaching DNA extraction and bioinformatics to middle school girls through Girls Inc. summer camp in 2017 and 2018.  Students trained will enter the workforce with skills needed to innovate in the tech, health, and environmental industries.  The work in this proposal will have impact not only on biology and medicine but helps students understand data science and the challenges of implementing data science and machine learning to tackle real-world problems.
