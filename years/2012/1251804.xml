<AbstractNarration>This proposal requests funds to support analysis of four sulfur isotopes in 70 bulk samples from three cores collected as part of recent ICDP drilling in the Barberton Mountain Land, South Africa. Samples include black shales, disseminated sulfide and sulfide layers in chert and barite. The proposed analyses will provide a first glimpse into the sulfur isotope geochemistry of these Palaeoarchean era (3600 to 3200 million years ago) sedimentary sequences with an excellent state of preservation. One goal of this work will be to evaluate the possibility that evidence exists supporting microbial reworking of sulfur, and if so, what information it provides for understanding sources of sulfur to and controls on sulfate concentrations in the oceans. A second aim of this work will be to evaluate whether variations in the relationship between &amp;#916;36S and &amp;#916;33S that are seen in other successions are present in the Paleoarchean. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Project is part of a broad international collaboration on sulfur isotopes on these core materials involving the PI, and scientists at University of Utrecht, Westf√§lische Wilhelms University (Muenster, Germany), the Swedish Museum of Natural History (Stockholm, Sweden) and the Institute de Physique du Globe (Paris, France). All of these groups are currently either involved in existing collaborations or are planning to work together under the umbrella of the Barberton Drilling project. This is seen as a unique opportunity to study a large number of samples using shared techniques at a high level of detail from the approximately 2 km of sedimentary drill core, providing ample room for joint studies and coordination between sub-projects to yield a more significant and comprehensive dataset. At minimum, one joint overview publication in a major international journal will results from this work.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  The major goals of this project was to collect sulfur isotope data that can be used to study the atmospheric, oceanic, and biological cycling of sulfur on Earth ~3500-3200 Ma.  The proposal to support this work was written to support analyses to be undertaken during the Sabbatical visit of Paul Mason (University of Utrecht) to the University of Maryland and thus supported an international collaboration that resulted in a publication that described sulfide mineralization in ancient rocks from South Africa.  The sulfur isotope data will provide information about the presence (or absence) of signatures for sulfate reducing bactera, about the nature of mass-independent chemistry in the atmosphere, and about the way that sulfur compounds are cycled in the Earth's early oceans.  It also provides information about the sulfide minerals and the metals linked to these sulfides formed at this time.  The proposal supported analyses undertaken by Paul Mason after his sabbatical.  Mason interacted with and discussed research with other University of Maryland students and gave presentations to the Department, facilitating technology transfer.
