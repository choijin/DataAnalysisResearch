<AbstractNarration>This project investigates how growers and farmworkers are responding to new knowledge about the negative effects of certain pesticides used in California's strawberry industry.  This concern arises in the wake of a contentious battle over methyl iodide, a highly toxic soil fumigant associated with birth defects that was designed to replace methyl bromide, an ozone depleting chemical that will be phased out by 2015 under the Montreal Protocol.  Vociferous opposition led to the withdrawal of methyl iodide from the US market in 2012.  Since then, the California strawberry industry has been seeking a viable replacement for methyl bromide, at the same time that it seeks to maintain access to a range of other soil fumigants to sustain high production.  While the industry argues that these chemicals are necessary to provide healthy fresh fruit for mass markets, their potential to cause birth defects have produced new concerns for farmworkers and nearby communities.  However, farmworkers are politically vulnerable and this thwarts their ability to contest agro-chemical use or to advocate for more protective application protocols or less toxic alternatives.  Compounding their vulnerability is the issue of proof, given the mobility of chemicals and workers, combined with generational time lags in the manifestation of potential negative effects from exposure.  At stake, then, are fundamental questions of what populations are deserving of health and well being, how uncertainty of exposure plays out in these calculations, and therefore how protection, whether in the form of technology-forcing regulatory restrictions or more restrictive application protocols, will be implemented.  To analyze these issues, the project will seek to determine 1) the use of methyl bromide relative to other chemical and non-chemical alternatives during the most recent phase-out period; 2) how enhanced visibility of farmworker health issues, combined with, and complicated by, continued regulatory uncertainty and the contingencies associated with exposure, have influenced grower decisions on the use of chemical and non-chemical substitutes to methyl bromide; and 3) how farmworkers' political and biological status have shaped their perspectives and self-advocacy on chemical and non chemical alternatives to methyl bromide and their respective application protocols.  To answer these questions, researchers will gather and analyze data from pesticide use permits to determine how fumigant use has shifted over the past decade.  In addition, they will conduct interviews with both growers and farmworkers in two different strawberry-producing regions: with growers to consider factors that shape growers' decisions to employ the various alternatives to methyl bromide and with farmworkers to learn whether the battle over methyl iodide has emboldened them to advocate for less toxic methods and/or enhanced their employment of self-protective practices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The phase-out of methyl bromide represents a profound and unique opportunity to learn what growers do when faced with a regulatory change.  This project will elucidate the relative roles of public outcry, economic need, ethical concern, and the availability of similarly toxic and less toxic substitutes in decision-making around toxic chemicals.  It potentially demonstrates the power of regulatory battles to shape on-the-ground practices, even when actual regulation is less than practically optimal, especially for a group that lacks rights and capacities to shape regulation and contest violations.  In addition, the project will have a substantial outreach and education component that will disseminate research to those who have a role in affecting regulation and a stake in minimizing exposure.  Outreach will take place through published reports, industry conferences, and public meetings.  Sharing the results of the research will potentially lead to safer practices, better training in the use of chemicals, and will possibly encourage the further development and dissemination of less toxic alternatives.  The research includes engagement with people from underrepresented groups in both the research and outreach and will thereby fulfill goals of inclusion.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This project examined how the California strawberry industry is contending with the regulatory phase-out of methyl bromide, a soil fumigant associated with ozone-depletion, along with tighter restrictions on other replacement fumigants, due to their high toxicity. Fumigants have been used for fifty years to control soil-borne plant pathogens, and the enormous increase in industry productivity was largely predicated on the efficacy and availability of methyl bromide used in combination with chloropicrin to control blight. The project also investigated the obstacles to farming without fumigants as well as farmworker perspectives on chemical use in strawberry production. Project activities included tracking changes in the use of chemical fumigants from 2004 to 2013 in the nine counties in which strawberries or strawberry plants are major crops; and semi-structured interviews with 75 strawberry growers, 55 strawberry farmworkers, and about 50 other industry stakeholders and experts including representatives of growers&rsquo; organizations and shippers, input suppliers, nursery owners, research and extension agents, regulators, and pest control advisors.&nbsp;</p> <p>Restrictions have not reduced overall use of fumigants. Instead, growers have increased their use of chloropicrin, as well as other allowable replacements. However, due to required mitigation measures some have shifted their operations to rural areas less affected by restrictions. Growers are mixed in their perspectives of the efficacy and safety of different chemical formulas. Some have witnessed the appearance of novel plant pathogens, which extension scientists largely attribute to the loss of methyl bromide, while others have found the replacement chemicals satisfactory. Paradoxically, at the same time that fumigant use has increased, more growers are experimenting with organic production. These experiments are motivated less by learning to farm without fumigants than a response to growing market demand for organic strawberries.&nbsp;</p> <p>The industry faces a number of other challenges in addition to fumigant restrictions and the appearance of novel pathogens. These include scarce and costly land appropriate for strawberry production, lack of pathogen resistant cultivars, labor shortages, drought, and weak prices. These other challenges also bear on growers&rsquo; ability to farm without fumigants, as the entire production system has been built on their use. Fumigation has allowed growers to plant strawberries on the same block year after year, and land values are based on that practice; plant breeding has been conducted with an eye toward productivity and long seasons rather than pathogen resistance; piece rate harvest workers &ndash; the industry standard &ndash; are attracted to fields with abundant berries, made possible by fumigation; warmer and drier summers appear to contribute to pathogen outbreaks; and growers are reluctant to experiment with alternatives to fumigation that are more costly and less efficacious. Low resource growers, who often rent more marginal land and carry high debt loads, are particularly vulnerable, and a predicted shake-out of such growers is already occurring.&nbsp;</p> <p>Although harvest workers are generally not exposed to soil fumigants per se, fieldworkers are much more concerned about pesticide use in general than growers. Although growers assert that pesticides are safe as long as they are handled properly, workers regard the chemicals they work with as dangerous and potentially harmful to their health regardless of whether application protocols are followed. Since many fear harassment or deportation, they tend not to complain of exposure related problems. They feel that foregoing work is the much bigger risk.&nbsp;</p> <p>Public concern with soil fumigants is strong and unlikely to diminish, contributing to the growth in demand for organics. The current director of California's Department of Pesticide Regulation has publicly stated his goal to phase out soil fumigants due to their toxicity for farmworkers, bystanders and neighbors.&nbsp; At the same time, the strawberry industry&rsquo;s challenges to growing without fumigants are not negligible. Acknowledging the real concerns on both sides of the dilemma has strengthened the case for the development of policies that will support growers in their efforts to reduce and cease the use of toxic fumigants. These may include higher public investment in technological innovations, including plant breeding and other less toxic alternatives for managing soil pathogens. Even then, most alternatives in the works would raise the price of strawberries considerably, putting them out of reach for low income consumers. Since strawberries and similar crops are widely touted as an important source of nutrition, recognition of the health and equity concerns at work makes the case for policies that support fresh fruit and vegetable consumption regardless of market prices and available technologies.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 04/02/2018<br>      Modified by: Julie&nbsp;Guthman</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1262064/1262064_10253873_1522680686433_483--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1262064/1262064_10253873_1522680686433_483--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Pathogen wilt in a buffer zone"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1262064/1262064_10253873_1522680686433_483--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Pathogen wilt in a buffer zone"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Pathogen wilt in a buffer zone</div> <div class="imageCredit">Julie Guthman</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Julie&nbsp;Guthman</div> <div class="imageTitle">Pathogen wilt in a buffer zone</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1262064/1262064_10253873_1522681041771_489--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1262064/1262064_10253873_1522681041771_489--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Fumigated field Lompoc"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1262064/1262064_10253873_1522681041771_489--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Fumigated field Lompoc"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Fumigated field with protective tarps</div> <div class="imageCredit">Julie Guthman</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Julie&nbsp;Guthman</div> <div class="imageTitle">Fumigated field Lompoc</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
