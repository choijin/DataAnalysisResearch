<AbstractNarration>Alcantar&lt;br/&gt;1239606&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal seeks funding to partially support the travel of 10 U.S. participants to attend technical symposium Novel Characterization Methods for Biological Systems, in Cancun, Mexico at the XXI International Materials Research Society Congress from August 12-17, 2012.  The participation of U.S. researchers, students, and postdoctoral fellows at this symposium demonstrates the nation's strong global standing in the important field of biosystems.  U.S. researchers and students will become more knowledgeable through the exchange of ideas, creation and enhancement of existing international collaborations, and continued participation at future leading materials forums and symposia.  This symposium convenes experts in experimental and theoretical biophysics tools, who would not normally exchange ideas, with the goal of interdisciplinary advances towards elucidating biomaterial's structures and properties using novel characterization techniques.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This symposium will attract a large audience of students, postdoctoral fellows, assistant professors, and professionals in the area of materials science and engineering.  Biosystems and their characterization contributes significantly to current understanding on molecular and surface behavior of biological, materials, micro- and nanoengineering and physicochemical systems.  Therefore, it is important to develop this multidisciplinary area to resolve the structure and dynamic behavior in the supramolecular and nanoscale systems that have a great technological relevance in industries such as health, pharmaceutics, microelectronics, energy, food, polymer, painting, construction, etc.  In order to further the NSF priorities of broadening participation and integration of research and education, the majority of the funds will be used for supporting the attendance of U.S. assistant professors, postdoctoral fellows, and students.</AbstractNarration>
