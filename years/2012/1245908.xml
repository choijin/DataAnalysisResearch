<AbstractNarration>The project is 1) improving advanced courses in the Building Science undergraduate program through the use of whole-systems thinking; 2) using innovative tools and teaching methodologies to reinforce the current changes in the building industry from traditional design-bid-build project delivery to integrative design project delivery; and 3) having students experience a collaborative, project-based learning environment as a two-semester capstone program within their degree curriculum.  The project replaces lecture-format courses with a project-based Integrative Design Experience Laboratory (IDEXlab) - an integrative design-fabrication-and-assembly studio with the objective of more profound learning as well as more effective and creative teaching. The pilot program seeks to bridge the gap between the traditional classroom and professions within the design and construction industry by promoting: 1) peer discussion and instruction; 2) effective collaboration between architectural and construction management concentration students; 3) critical thinking; 4) an interest in design and research in Building Science; and 5) the celebration of breakthroughs and discoveries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project addresses the building design and construction needs of rural Appalachia by providing a service-learning platform for students to engage while simultaneously offering real-world problems (which include physical sites, clients, and budgets) for students to solve creatively. Effective implementation of an innovative curriculum at Appalachian State University can serve as a model for other large institutions to consider the adoption of the IDEXlab curriculum as a replacement for traditional architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) science curricula.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Sixteen students from the Building Science program at Appalachian State University - eight Construction Management concentration and eight Architectural Technology and Design concentration - spent two semesters working with six faculty members to learn principles of integrative design through experiential learning as a part of the pilot curriculum called IDEXlab: Integrative Design Experience Laboratory.  During the first year of the grant, a team of five interdisciplinary faculty composed of architects, engineers, and material scientists researched the concepts of integrative design within the building industry as well as alternative, hands-on learning methodologies.  In addition to extensive book and journal research, the grant team interviewed prominent educators and building industry practitioners across the country.  Several trips were conducted for the research, including, but not limited to:  1. Snowmass, CO - a three day visit to Rocky Mountain Institute who developed a very relevant precedent called the 10xE principles for engineering education  2. Olin College - visit to innovative engineering program, another relevant precedent but an academic institution  3. Boston, MA - several days visiting Harvard's iLab, MIT's Media Lab and D-lab, and IDEO Boston to research innovation and collaboration  4. Auburn Rural Studio - visit to learn from the most established design/build academic program in the United States  5. Studio 804 - visit to Kansas University's exceptional design/build program through the School of Architecture   Upon compiling and synthesizing the research, the grant team developed student recruitment strategies and the final curriculum to be implemented in year two.  It was decided that seniors would be the best demographic to use in the pilot study and the intent was to provide all of their senior-level courses through an applied learning environment.  As such, an extra section of several tradtional lecture-based courses was used to parallel the existing Building Science curriculum and provide comparisons.  Overall, each student earned up to eighteen credit hours over two semesters to serve as a true capstone experience before graduation.  In the 2015-2016 academic year, the IDEXlab pilot curriculum was implemented.  All sixteen students worked in interdisciplinary teams to design and build multiple real-life projects as well as visit relevant industry leaders for inspiration.    To begin the fall semester, the sixteen were seperated into two groups of eight that were charged with design and building a composting toilet privy each within ten days.  Numerous issues were identified and lessons were learned that improved communication, teamwork, and design-thinking after missing deadlines and requirements.  For the remainder of the semester, students took field trips, met with industry leaders, participated in a workshop with IDEO, and began design of their final projects: a farmer's market and a welcome center.  The two major projects of IDEXlab were the primary vehicle for learning.  Spanning across the bulk of the two semester experience, the eight-person, interdisciplinary student teams researched, analyzed, designed, engineered, estimated, scheduled, and constructed full-scale buildings for non-profit community groups.  Rather than just hearing about real-world issues in a traditional lecture, these students expereienced them.  And through all of the difficulties found in producing actual construction documents, estimates, and schedules, the students finished with tangible products that enhance needy communities and serve as great portfolio pieces for future employment.  The outcomes of the pilot program, both tangible and intangible, are evidence in support of the research thesis that an integrative design approach not only offers a more comprehensive educational experience for fourth-year students in the Building Sciences program, but results in enhanced critical thinking.
