<AbstractNarration>The research objective of this EArly-Concept Grant for Exploratory Research (EAGER) is to validate theoretical hypotheses on bone failure mechanism at the mineralised fibril level in order to precisely measure the in situ mechanical signals to bone cells (osteocytes) and to detect possible variations among humans in collagen and mineral strengths. Bone is a living tissue with a complex and highly heterogeneous microstructure resulting from the continuous self-healing process called remodeling. Osteocytes are mechano-sensitive cells suspected to initiate remodeling upon detection of micro damage in their environment that is composed of an organic phase of non-collagen proteins and collagen fibrils that are mineralised by hydroxyapatite crystals. Studies under this award will follow a top-down approach applying a dual experimental and numerical method to test and model micro cracks and micro damage growing in fresh human bone. The method will quantify in situ the local mechanical stress field created by progressing micro cracks and micro damage near osteocytes in bone under mechanical load. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, this research will determine how human bone mechanically bears load at the collagen and hydroxyapatite level and how the mechanical signals produced in situ by micro damage could possibly stimulate osteocytes to initiate the tissue biological response. The precise measurement of the mechanical effects of micro damage in the osteocyte's natural environment is transformative in that it advances the general understanding of the role of mechanical stimuli in cell biology. When applied to elderly patients this will further help to genetically trace the tissue mechanics changes in different components of bone to advance regenerative therapies and bone tissue engineering. The educational plan includes the mentoring of graduate students in bone micro biomechanics and an international collaboration with leading institutions in bone experimental research.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The research objective of this EArly-Concept Grant for Exploratory Research (EAGER) validated theoretical hypotheses on bone failure mechanism at the mineralised fibril level where diffuse damage happens and precisely measure the in situ mechanical environment of bone cells (osteocytes).   This EAGER project followed a top-down approach applying a dual experimental and numerical method to test and model diffuse damage in fresh human bone and fresh human bone reseeded with live osteocytes at the progenitor and mature stages.  An efficient protocol to prepare clean intact human bone tissues was achieved.  The human samples were prepared in the three characteristic planes and reseeded with progenitor and mature osteocytes. The samples were then loaded under three point bending conditions after live osteocytes were reseeded on the fresh human donor tissues. The samples showed sub-micro fracture of the scale of a cell size near the canaliculi morphology and their alterations regions using confocal and SEM microscopy where bone diffuse damage could be imaged with fluorescent calcein.  This EAGER project revealed through confocal and SEM microscopy sub-micro cracks emanating along osteocytes cytoplasmic extensions and directly contributing the mechanical stimuli detected by the cells. As bone is a living tissue with a complex and highly heterogeneous microstructure resulting from the continuous self-healing process called remodeling, the 3D explicit osteonal tissue microstructure was digitally reconstructed from micro CT imaging.  This research determined how human bone mechanically bears load at the collagen and hydroxyapatite level and how the mechanical signals produced in situ by micro damage stimulating osteocytes to initiate the tissue biological response.  Workable in vitro living systems called Live Allograft Bone Systems also Live Allograft Biological Systems (LABS) to measure bone mechanical properties and cell biological in situ response were created.  Live Allograft Bone Systems (LABS) mechanically behaved as wet fresh bones.  Progenitor and mature osteocytes relocated in the in vitro live allograft bone systems as they would in vivo. The two types of cells reorganized in human bone as in vivo: the progenitor cells (hMSCs) relocated in the Haversian canals and the mature osteocytes (MLOY4) re-anchored on the mineralized ECM in an spatial arrangement as in vivo and started to rebuilt osteonal processes connections as in vivo. The phenomenon occurred in only 10 days.  Bone cell differentiation process appeared to adapt Ca membrane exchange rate to the expected in vivo mechanical load seen by the cell through its differentiation. The hMSCs released their cytoplasmic Ca at once under low mechanical load. The MLOY4 released their cytoplasmic Ca in small quantity under multiple increasing loads in cyclic manner. The MLY4 still retained an important amount of Ca at this stage.   The precise measurement of the mechanical effects of micro damage in the osteocyte's natural environment is transformative in that it advances the general understanding of the role of mechanical stimuli in cell biology of osteocytes at their different stages of maturation in relationship to the expected mechanical load applied in the native human tissue.  The educational plan included the mentoring of graduate students in bone micro biomechanics and an international collaboration with leading institutions in bone experimental research.
