<AbstractNarration>What are the foundational principles of computation?  Any computer, however advanced, is ultimately limited by quantum mechanics, so the laws of computation and physics intertwine.  Quantum computers, that take full advantage of quantum physics, do not yet exist, but are under active development.  This award seeks to discover new algorithms and algorithmic frameworks for future quantum computers, as well as new techniques for proving stronger security guarantees on present-day quantum cryptography devices.  The award will also be used for advising and supporting students, working with the PI and taking part in this research.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Quantum algorithms can work in very different ways than classical algorithms.  Two of the most successful approaches for developing quantum algorithms---span programs and learning graphs---were developed only recently, but have led both to many concrete algorithms and to general computational rules, e.g., for composing algorithms.  This research will extend and combine these approaches with physically inspired algorithmic techniques.  In addition, the research will consider what quantum computation can teach us about the principles of physics.  Are there intrinsic limits to how well we, as classical beings, can characterize quantum systems?  Answers to this question tie closely to cryptography, and should allow for highly secure key-distribution schemes.  By investigating the ultimate capabilities of quantum computers, the research will deepen our understanding of the basic principles of computation and physics.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ It is expected that in the next year, quantum computing devices with around fifty qubits will become available from several commercial quantum computing teams.  Smaller devices with lower noise rates will also come online.  These devices are very exciting.  They are not large enough, and have too much noise, to run very large quantum algorithms.  However, they should be large enough to run interesting experiments that test and steer the development of new theories, across fault tolerance, algorithms and complexity, and fundamental physics.  Our research in this project has focused on developing more efficient and practical fault-tolerance schemes (that allow a quantum computer to tolerate noise) and on quantum tests that can be run on small quantum systems.    Historically, simple tests such as the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) game were first used to establish that two devices share some positive amount of entanglement, beyond classical physics.  The first "loophole-free" experimental tests were shown in 2015 by Shalm et al.  However, to truly establish the power of quantum systems, it is important to be able to show large amounts of entanglement.  Following up previous work by the PI and collaborators (Reichardt et al., 2013), our research in this project devised efficient tests to demonstrate an asymptotically large amount of entanglement, which is critical for powerful quantum devices.  It has been followed up by still more efficient tests, and these tests have recently led to breakthroughs in the understanding of quantum multi-prover interactive proof systems; thus this research is of interest both for foundational physics and for complexity theory.    In related work, we introduced the concept of "overlapping qubits," a way in which a relatively low-dimensional quantum system can trick you into thinking it is larger.  We developed cheating strategies.  We also developed tests of dimensionality, to catch a cheating system.  The dimension of a quantum system is perhaps its most fundamental parameter.  Our tests give an efficient way by which you can verify that a quantum system indeed has exponentially many dimensions.    We generalized the CHSH game in a different direction, too, to study entanglement among three systems.  The standard CHSH game shows that two systems are entangled, that there is no "local realist" model explaining their behavior (a model first introduced by Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen, 1935).  However, it is conceivable that a different "non-signaling" theory beyond classical physics explains the systems' behavior.  Our three-system test is the first to rule out even non-signaling theories.  This is foundational physics, providing a way to verify quantum mechanics in a setting that has not been tested before.     Separately, we researched more efficient fault-tolerance techniques: how to deal with noise in quantum computers.  This is important for long-term applications, when we will want to build large quantum computers as efficiently as possible.  It is especially important, however, in the nearer term, when the quantum devices being built have extremely limited scale---few qubits---as well as other constraints such as limited qubit connectivity.  Nonetheless, the devices need to handle noise, both to run small algorithms, such as chemistry simulations, and to test noise models and develop fault-tolerance schemes for iteratively larger quantum computers.    Reliable qubits are difficult to engineer, but standard fault-tolerance schemes use seven or more physical qubits to encode each logical qubit, with still more qubits required for error correction. The large overhead makes it hard to experiment with fault-tolerance schemes with multiple encoded qubits. Our research reduce this overhead with a new "flag fault-tolerance" paradigm.  Usually in fault-tolerant computing, we try to keep errors from spreading.  For example, a distance-three code can correct one error, but not if that error spreads into two.  In flag fault tolerance, we instead try to detect that an error may have spread.  This continues a theme in fault-tolerance research that detected errors are easier to correct than undetected errors.  It allows for significantly more qubit-efficient fault-tolerant error correction.  For example, the 15-qubit Hamming code encodes seven logical qubits.  Our techniques allow for error correction and some computation to be carried out with just two more qubits (17 total), and universal computation to be carried out with 19 qubits total.  We also give fault-tolerance schemes using as few as seven qubits total.  These results show that significant fault-tolerant computation experiments can be carried out without very many qubits, possibly in the near term.  In the long term, they will improve the space efficiency of quantum computers.  We have further worked to adapt these fault-tolerance schemes to specific experimental platforms, such as superconducting qubits.    This research has involved graduate students Chris Sutherland, Rui Chao, Sourav Kundu, and Prithviraj Prabhu.  These students have been key in the results, and have also presented it at premier conferences such as QIP (both talks and posters), and with industrial quantum computing efforts.
