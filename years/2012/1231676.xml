<AbstractNarration>This project develops a portable power-assist orthosis to address the problems of impaired mobility due to lower-extremity weakness.  This robotic orthosis actively assists the user's joint motion according to his or her motion intent, and thus enables the user to perform certain critical, power-consuming tasks (such as the sit-to-stand motion) independently.  The orthosis is powered with a high-performance actuation approach, namely chemo-fluidic actuation, which combines the high-power-density pneumatic actuators with a high-energy-density monopropellant-based pneumatic supply.  In addition to the new actuation approach, the orthosis also features a new structure and user interface for effective load transfer and easy donning-doffing; and an effective motion control algorithm to enable interactive power assist according to the user's motion intent.  With the portable power-assist orthosis, the users reduce the reliance on the assistance by caregivers, enjoy a significantly improved life quality, and stay physically active to avoid the aforementioned issues associated with the sedentary life style.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project has broader impact to assistive technologies and can improve mobility of elderly individuals and people suffering from the impaired mobility due to lower-extremity weakness. The project can potentially reduce a considerable amount of physical assistance taking care of these individuals, and the cost of time and manpower in the care. The research of the project is incorporated into education activities by utilizing the rehabilitation robotics as an innovative education medium.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The rapid aging of the U.S. population nowadays is unprecedented in history: the number of older adults will double in the next 25 years.  By 2030, there will 72 million older adults, accounting for 20% of the general population.  As a significant consequence of such trend, a large number of older adults suffer from mobility impairment, resulting from the gradual degeneration of the musculoskeletal structure, or the related musculoskeletal or neural pathologies (e.g. stroke).  Such individuals are more likely to live in a sedentary lifestyle, and suffer from the various problems associated with the sedentary lifestyle, e.g. high blood pressure, depression, obesity, etc.  The research in this project aims at addressing the mobility problem with portable power-assist orthoses, which are wearable assistive devices that directly apply physical assistance to the users? limbs and joints (knee and ankle in this case).  To make them suitable for prolonged wearing, these orthoses need to be very compact and lightweight, which is the main challenge we tried to overcome in our research.  We first attempted to use pneumatic actuators to power the orthoses, because they generate high force output at very light weight.  However, the difficulty of incorporating a mobile pneumatic supply diminishes the practicality of pneumatically actuated orthoses.  Subsequently, we tried to use the traditional motor power, which is more convenient to use for such portable devices.  To make the devices practical, we intentionally chose smaller actuators to reduce the weight, but such choice also affects the assistive torques the orthoses can provide.  Additionally, for the knee joint, the most important situation that needs assistance is the standing-up process, and in the subsequent walking process the knee does not need much assistance at all (the major source of power for walking is the ankle).
