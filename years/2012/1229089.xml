<AbstractNarration>The NSF Sustainable Energy pathways (SEP) Program, under the umbrella of the NSF Science, Engineering and Education for Sustainability (SEES) initiative, will support the research program of Prof. Luping Yu and co-workers at the University of Chicago, Prof. Yang Yang and co-workers at the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA), and Prof. Lin Chen and co-workers at Northwestern University. The objective of this multidisciplinary collaborative project is to develop organic solar cells with power conversion efficiency competitive with amorphous inorganic solar cells.  Novel materials (both donor and acceptor materials) with the best power conversion efficiencies and controlled absorption windows will be synthesized.  Detailed structural and spectroscopic studies will be performed to probe and understand exciton generation, charge separation, and transport mechanism in these newly developed materials, which will form the foundation for device fabrication.  Novel geometries of tandem solar cells will be developed to maximize solar energy conversion.  Close collaborations with active feedback among the team will lead to rapid realization of the research goal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The overall viability of organic photovoltaics (OPV) as a sustainable energy technology will be assessed based on their environmental, health, and economic impacts via collaboration with a Dr. Peter Sinsheimer on urban planning, Prof. Zhu Yifang on public health, and Mr. Timothy Malloy on societal impact.  Issues associated with technology diffusion and possible commercial, institutional, legal, policy, technological, and cultural barriers associated with the design, development, and adoption of new sustainable technologies will be evaluated experimentally and/or based on viable models.  This collaborative effort will be used as a platform to attract underrepresented undergraduate students to the research area of sustainable energy pathways.  The project will provide great opportunity to educate and train graduate students and postdoctoral associates in system-based research in the area of sustainable energy pathways.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If this project succeeds, it will result in alternative solar energy harvest materials and devices that can be manufactured in an environmentally friendly approach, with flexibility, and at a low cost. It will change the landscape of renewable energy and exert significant impact on sustainable economic development and environmental protection.  The resulting technology may penetrate into our daily life, as it may be used in a wide range of electronic devices like portable battery chargers, energy saving computer displays, and house decorations. Students working on this project will be prepared to become leaders in renewable energy research and development.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[Outcome report  A new low bandgap polymer (PID2) containing TID unit was synthesized and investigated. A comprehensive picture of the effect of internal dipole moments on photovoltaic properties of BHJ solar cells was obtained.  TID sulfonyl group led to large internal dipole moment change &amp; lowered the energy levels of the corresponding polymers.   It was found that there exists an optimized ?&micro;ge values for high performance in OPV solar cells. The correlation of Jsc vs (&Delta;EA-DLUMO) seems to be a manifestation of the Marcus charge transfer theory in inverted region. The PID polymers were effective theird components in enhancing the PCE of ternary blend organic solar cells due to a better match in energy levels forming a cascade.  The PID polymers serve as hole relay in ternary OSC and participate in energy transfer resulting in &gt; 9% PCE achieved with PTB7-Th. More recently, new ternary system achieved a PCE of 10.5%, without detailed device optimization, indicating potential for further enhancement in OPV efficiency. Incorporation of n-doped multiwall carbon nanotubes (MWCN) in PEDOT interfacial layer enhances the PCE of OPV solar cells.  The mechanism of that enhancement is ascribed to more efficient charge separation, extraction and transport.  The  MWCN can facilitate self-assembly of polymer chains, resulting in smaller phase separated domains in PTB7/PCBM that favor charge separation.    Succeeded in recruiting a minority undergraduate students (2) and female high school students (3), all of them moved on to advanced studies.  In collaboration with UCLA teams, approaches to enhance efficiencies of solar cells was developed based on the inverted solar cell structure by using ZnO nanoparticles.     Sustainability   OPV-Environment interface: effect of Ozone (a key to environment) exposure to OPV active layer &amp; device were evaluated. Framework to identify benefits and environmental/human health impacts of OPV throughout product life cycle was investigated.  The impact of this effort is to lead us to explore more benign chemical approach, such as C-H activation reactions for polymerization to replace toxic distannanyl monomers.    14 Research Articles and 2 Review article made possible by this grant, accumulating more than 1000 citations already (9/30/16). 4 Theses defended by graduate students working on this grant. Two provisional patents are filed.           Last Modified: 12/05/2016       Submitted by: Luping Yu]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
