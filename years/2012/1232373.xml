<AbstractNarration>The international conference on the Progress on Difference Equations (PODE) 2012 will be held May 13-18 in Richmond, Virginia on the campus of Virginia Commonwealth University.  Web site: http://www.math.vcu.edu/PODE2012index.html.  The PODE 2012 conference is the latest in a series of PODE conferences that have focused on the study of difference equations.  Traditionally, these conferences have been held in Europe.  This will be the first of these conferences to be held in the United States.  The goal of the conference is to exchange significant ideas and results in the field of difference equations, as well as to establish research contacts across borders, not only between countries, but also between different ethnic and cultural groups and between novice and seasoned mathematicians.  Varied and novel ideas are shared both formally with talks and informally in casual settings.  Dissemination of information throughout the mathematics community at large is to be facilitated by the posting of the slides of talks on the conference web site and by the publication of the proceedings of the conference. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The field of difference equations, once primarily ancillary to differential equations, has within the past two decades evolved into an autonomous branch of mathematics, with applications to areas such as engineering, biology, medicine, physics, economics, and the social sciences.  During this time it has attracted mathematicians from other areas, who have brought to difference equations their diverse set of tools.  The PODE conferences are a significant means of fostering fresh ideas, enthusiasm, and collaboration to the expanding the field of difference equations both in breadth and in depth.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ More and more people are becoming aware of the power of mathematics in its ability to solve real world problems.  In fact, for centuries mathematics has been motivated by applications to many areas such as art, architecture, astronomy, and industry.  Currently, mathematics provides tools that are used to aid significantly in the solution of problems in fields as diverse as medicine, biology, physics, engineering, sociology, and psychology.     Over the past two decades, the field of difference equations has been particularly amenable to applications in areas outside of mathematics.  The international conference Progress on Difference Equations (PODE) 2012, which was the sixth incarnation of the PODE conferences and the first one to be held in the United States, brought together a diverse group of experts and novices in the field of difference equations.  This created an environment that fostered the dissemination and sharing of new information and the generation of novel ideas, which, in turn, will in the future be useful for applications to the areas of medicine, biology, and physics.     The proceedings of the conference will be made accessible to the mathematics and sciences community at large by its publication in 2013 or the early part of 2014 as a special issue in the journal Computers and Mathematics with Applications.
