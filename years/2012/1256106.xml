<AbstractNarration>This EArly-Concept Grant for Exploratory Research (EAGER) collaborative research project will explore a new and promising travel demand management strategy, inspired by various cap-and-trade schemes aiming to reduce greenhouse gas and air pollutant emissions.  Traffic congestion continues to threaten the economic prosperity and quality of life around the world.   It is widely acknowledged that demand management strategies could help alleviate traffic congestion, and if properly implemented, they could be effective and cost-efficient.  The cap-and-trade schemes considered in this research seek to couple direct travel demand restrictions with a trading mechanism. Because such a scheme typically involves creating mobility credits and trading them in a market, it is also known as a tradable credit scheme.   As an early exploration of this idea, the project will directly involve economists that will provide input to each research task and as part of the research analytical tools to answer critical design and implementation issues will be sought. Agent-based simulation will be used as the main evaluation tool for the proposed analytical framework and design concepts. Based on this simulation platform, the research will compare tradable credit schemes with traditional travel demand management strategies such as congestion pricing, and validate the effectiveness and practicability of the proposed schemes with varying behavioral travel assumptions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the project could provide a meaningful bridge between transportation and economics on the issue of cap-and-trade and research findings would be shared to advance both fields.  The work could shift the current paradigm associated with traffic congestion management policies. The findings from this research could also enhance choices among these policies and help provide for their prioritization. Accordingly, the research will be incorporated in education activities at both universities by offering new materials and case studies within the transportation curricula. Finally, research results will be broadly disseminated through a variety of media.</AbstractNarration>

Broader impacts The work provides a valid alternative to the current paradigm of thinking of congestion management policies. The findings from this research diversify the choice set of these policies and provide timely support to their prioritization. It has influenced education programs, at both universities directly involved, by offering fresh materials and case studies to expand their curricula. Finally, research results have been broadly disseminated through a variety of media. It has also led to a successful workshop participated by economists, transportation researchers, and local practitioners.     Intellectual Merits The proposed project develops analytical tools to address several critical design and implementation questions regarding tradable credit schemes.  The main results are summarized below.      To address the difficulty of identifying eligible travelers to distribute tradable mobility credits, the project proposes and analyzes a new tradable credit scheme that rewards only those who contribute to congestion relief (e.g. by choosing transit or traveling during off-peak time) with mobility credits. The analyses indicate that very simple designs of the scheme could reduce congestion significantly, and properly distribute the benefits among all the commuters through the credit trading.       To address the issue that market credit price may vary substantially, the project develops a sensitivity analysis approach to predict how credit price varies with respect to the perturbation associated with the supply or demand. A safety valve policy is then investigated to balance regulation success and price volatility under uncertainty.      Considering travel needs of both individuals and companies, the project analyzes tradable credit schemes on networks with two types of players, namely, a finite number of Cournot-Nash players and an infinite number of (infinitesimal) Wardrop-equilibrium players. The former are transportation and logistics companies while the latter are individual travelers. The project further examines how transaction costs would affect the trading and route-choice behaviors of both types of players, and discusses the equilibrium conditions on the coupled credit market and transportation network in the presence of transaction costs.      The project conducts a hypothetical case study built upon empirical data from Florida to compare socioeconomic impacts of gasoline tax, mileage fee and tradable mobility credits for regulating the vehicle miles traveled in Florida. It shows all three instruments are capable of achieving a hypothetical reduction in vehicle miles travelled. However, they generate different amounts of revenue and impose different socioeconomic impacts on Florida residents.       The project also identifies and investigates specific applications of the cap-and-trade approach for mobility management, including 1) tradable parking permits to manage downtown parking; 2) auction-based reservation system to manage the capacity of a bottleneck in morning commute; 3) a tradable credit scheme to implement staggered work times and 4) tradable credits as an instrument to control the length of the rush-hour queue at a bottleneck.
