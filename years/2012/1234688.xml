<AbstractNarration>The overall goal of this study is to advance our general understanding of the role of underwater sound in biological oceanography by characterizing spatiotemporal variation in an estuarine soundscape, and determine if this variation affects the settlement of larval invertebrates. The investigators will use larval bivalves and subtidal oyster reefs in Pamlico Sound, North Carolina as a study system. A combination of field and laboratory experiments will be used to test the effects of sound on larval behaviors and settlement. The underwater sonic environment has the potential to provide meaningful sensory information to all aquatic animals. Acoustic signals are transmitted relatively large distances, are present at all depths, and reflect biological and physical characteristics of the environment, while other cues (e.g. light, chemicals) are rapidly attenuated from the source. Sound is well established as an orientation and habitat selection cue for marine mammals and fishes, and has recently emerged as a potentially important contributor to larval settlement. Building capacity (knowledge, expertise, equipment) for integrating geophysical aspects of underwater sound propagation with ecological and oceanographic processes is central to bio-physical studies of larval connectivity and recruitment in marine systems. It also informs our understanding of the potential adverse effects of noise pollution in the ocean and may elucidate untested benefits of marine reserves - ultimately leading to healthier and better managed oceans and estuaries. The project supports graduate, postdoctoral and undergraduate student training, as well as educational outreach programs that span local, regional and national levels. Underwater sounds and their biological implications are of interest to a wide audience, and will be used to highlight the exciting nature of this inter-disciplinary science through: (i) an educational website allowing visitors to experience biotic and abiotic estuarine sounds and learn about their role in the environment, (ii) the sound files will be made available to the NSF-sponsored Wild Music travelling exhibit, and BioMusic/UPBEATS program at UNC-Greensboro, (iii) integration of estuarine soundscape lessons into NCSU/CMAST's Science Academy led by the Carteret County, NC School System and targets middle-school students, and (iv) data and results will be used by Southeast COSEE program for training to teachers.</AbstractNarration>
