<AbstractNarration>This EAGER award focuses on exploring the feasibility of the implementation of a new paradigm in the development of an integrative and interoperable data and knowledge management system for the geosciences for a new NSF initiative called EarthCube. Led by a team of expert Earth system modelers, this project focuses on developing new approaches for integrating and coupling model components so that holistic geoscience scenarios that involve the interaction of large scale climate and atmospheric circulation models and smaller, more heterogeneous component models of surface earth processes can be explored and more effectively used by a broader range of users. The project engages participants from a number of major NSF-funded geoscience modeling investments (CSDMS, NCAR, CUHAUSI). A main goal of the of the work is to bridge the gaps between present modeling frameworks, data standards, and computational architectures. The approach includes collection of all relevant approaches and then comparing their pros and cons and linking existing different "plug and play" modeling components together and assessing the accuracy and robustness of model results.  Major project goals are to see if more standard modeling protocols can be developed and to develop a general roadmap for improving the interoperability and meshing of model components that address phenomena at wildly different spatial and temporal scales. Broader impacts of the work include building new modeling infrastructure for science and leveraging prior NSF investments in cyberinfrastructure. It also improves the utility of, ease of use, and broader access of scientists and other potential users to more fully integrated and powerful earth systems models.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project contributed to shaping the vision of the on-going NSF initiative "EarthCube," which seeks to "create a community-driven data and knowledge management system that will allow for unprecedented data sharing across the geosciences" (from earthcube.org). The project involved leading scientists across hydrologic and atmospheric modeling and surveyed a broad scientific community to better understand how scientists are currently doing their work. It addressed questions of how scientists are currently modeling the various "parts" (ocean, atmosphere, freshwater, and earth surface) of the earth system and what's needed to better connect the science and the technology across these different disciplines to comprehensively model our earth holistically. This will both advance the science and contribute knowledge to solving some of society's most pressing environmental issues.  Over the course of the project, we held several workshops which brought together expertise from across the geosciences, and produced a "Roadmap" - a detailed technical document that distilled the expertise of the scientists in mapping out a path forward toward better earth system modeling. Project team scientists also successfully coupled two widely used modeling tools within the academic community - the National Center for Atmospheric Research's "WRF" model is a weather forecasting model that was placed within the Community Surface Dynamics Modeling System (CSDMS) - a system that makes it easier for scientists to access, use, and couple different models without needing specialized training or expertise for each individual model.   The project gave specific direction and suggestions to the National Science Foundation and others on what scientists need to develop and advance the next generation of Earth System models, provided a new resource to the thousands of scientists currently working with earth system models in CSDMS, and fostered community and collaborations through workshops.  The broader impact of this project is just beginning to be seen. Several early career faculty and graduate students were active participants in this process, and have already seen their research accelerated with the access to these new tools. Putting better tools in the hands of global change researchers will advance our understanding and provide better research on understanding and addressing major environmental issues such as climate change, extreme weather, and water resource scarcity.
