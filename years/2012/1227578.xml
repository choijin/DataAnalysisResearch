<AbstractNarration>This award funds research that will experimentally test hypotheses from development and political economics related to social capital, political enfranchisement, and trust in government using the unique circumstances of a new democracy in Libya.  The causal relationship between democracy and economic growth is hotly debated.  While some argue there is a causal relationship between the two, others claim an underlying characteristic of a given society jointly determines both governance and economic growth.  One candidate for such a characteristic is social capital.  This project sheds light on this question by examining whether, once a democratic election takes place, the stock of social capital in a society can be affected by who wins in that election.  The project uses innovative laboratory-style methods from experimental economics conducted in the field in a country that is engaged in free elections for the first time in many years.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will help us to understand mechanisms that support free elections and political enfranchisement in a fragile democracy, and deepen our understanding of the relationship between governance and economic growth.</AbstractNarration>

Economists have long studied external factors or constraints that keep people in poverty, such as lack of credit, lack of a functioning government including health, education, and legal institutions, and social norms that force people to act in certain ways that keeps them from advancing. A new wave of research, inspired by behavioral economics, is now exploring internal constraints. For example, people may not believe in themselves, they may feel like their efforts do not pay off, or they may be depressed. These problems affect their ability to make an effort to get out of poverty, and their lack of effort becomes self-fulfilling.  How their government functions can be a key input that determines their aspirations for themselves and their children. If they expect the government to function well, they may expect to have better health clinics, schools, social services, and policy outcomes in the future. This could lead them to make strides to improve themselves. There is some evidence that people who feel like their voice is heard, in a democractic process, they are happier with the policies enacted. When women are elected local leaders, people tend to be more optimistic about outcomes for their daughters.  In this research project, we wanted to see if participation in a relatively free and fair election in a country where such elections are rare would cause people to increase their aspirations for the future, and if this effect was different for people who supported the eventual winning candidate, compared to those who supported the losing candidate. To test these hypotheses, we surveyed voters in Bamako, Mali before and after the 2013 presidential election. We asked them who they support, and what they expect for the future of Mali and for their own personal fortunes.  Aspirations remained constant for supporters of the winning candidate. They fell significantly for supporters of the losing candidate. Both groups thought their country would improve, but supporters of the winning candidate thought it would improve more. There was no impact of the election results on stated ambitions.
