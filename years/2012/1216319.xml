<AbstractNarration>This project will investigate the vertical and horizontal spatial structure of hydrometeor (cloud and precipitation) fields using statistical correlation analysis applied to observed radar reflectivity as evidenced in satellite data e.g. CloudSat, derived surface rain-rates and other satellite data (including AMSR-E, MODIS, and CERES retrievals). Preliminary analysis incorporating all observations regardless of synoptic conditions, has indicated that  southern hemisphere extratropics have longer correlation lengths of hydrometeor occurrence in the horizontal and vertical than the northern hemisphere, however there are shorter correlation lengths in precipitation occurrence. To gain insight into such hemispheric differences, the plan is to draw out factors controlling precipitation and cloud structure in cyclones applying compositing techniques in the South Pacific region.  This project will advance discovery and understanding while at the same time promote teaching and learning by supporting directly a graduate student researcher, who will give local seminars on this research, as well as disseminate research results through conference presentations and peer-review publications.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Climate models suggest there will be changes in cloud properties at mid to high latitudes of both northern and southern hemispheres due to increased amounts of greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere.  These changes will result from a variety of factors including a poleward shift of storms and changes in the balance between liquid water and ice in clouds.  But confidence in model predictions of how clouds will change is low.   The change in clouds is important because this will change how much light clouds reflect to space and how much thermal energy or heat they help keep near the surface.     An analysis of NASA observations from the Multiangle-Imaging Spectroradiometer (MISR) and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) satellites has revealed a decline in the amount of very bright clouds at mid to high latitudes over the past decade.  The goal of this research project was to understand better the observed cloud cover changes, and in particular, under what meteorological conditions the changes in cloud were occurring over the South Pacific Ocean (where the changes have been particularly large) and why.  It was found that the cloud cover changes in the South Pacific are likely due to increases in surface pressure over the region, and in particular, occur primarily when high-pressure systems are located just east of New Zealand.   Similar, cloud cover changes in other mid to high latitude regions also appear to be related to increasing surface pressure.  The observed change may or may not be related to climate change, as other factors such natural variability may be involved.  Nonetheless, knowing the observed relationship between the change in surface pressure and cloud cover should prove useful in improving climate projections.
