<AbstractNarration>A request is made by the University of Hawaii to fund additional and replacement instrumentation for the R/V Kilo Moana, (KM), a 185? general purpose research vessel operated as part of the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS) research fleet.  The University of Hawaii (UH) supports two research vessels that provide platforms for research in the fields of oceanography, marine biology, geology and atmospheric science. They request funds to purchase oceanographic instrumentation and equipment in support of the multidisciplinary NSF/UNOLS projects to be undertaken on R/V Kilo Moana in 2012. In order of priority, they propose to: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1) Rebuild UH CTD and Niskin bottle inventory  $109,988&lt;br/&gt;2) Purchase 12 kHz acoustical pingers (2) $44,700&lt;br/&gt;3) Purchase metered overboarding sheave  $48,000&lt;br/&gt;4) Purchase additional set of Niskin bottles  $28,791&lt;br/&gt;                          TOTAL  $231,479&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:&lt;br/&gt; The principal impact of the present proposal is under criterion two, providing infrastructure support for scientists to use the vessel and its shared-use instrumentation in support of their NSF-funded oceanographic research projects (which individually undergo separate review by the relevant research program of NSF).  The acquisition,  maintenance and operation of shared-use instrumentation allows NSF-funded researchers from any US university or lab access to working, calibrated instruments for their research, reducing the cost of that research, and expanding the base of potential researchers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ An oceanographic research vessel must have the ability to reliably make precise and accurate real-time measurements of the water column and to collect adequate volumes of uncontaminated samples at discrete depths, normally achieved with a CTD rosette outfitted with an array of electronic sensors and remotely triggered sampling bottles.  Data from these sensors form the basis of a large body of modern marine research, and use of a ship-supplied CTD system has been requested for almost every cruise. Major equipment losses sustained during 2011 significantly reduced the R/V Kilo MoanaÃ†s ability to support CTD operations,  At that time post-cruise assessments also expressed concern for the contamination of water samples taken by the older, backup rosette and its water sampling bottles. This grant provided funds to replace that equipment and the Kilo Moana has been able to reliably collect the highest quality real-time water column data and samples.  These funds were used to procure the following CTD components:  One Sea-Bird SBE-32 remote bottle firing carousel and electronics, One Sea-Bird 9plus CTD with two pumps and dual temperature and conductivity sensors One dissolved oxygen sensor Thirty 12 L sampling bottles, and Other required items including interface cables, mounting hardware and a CTD spares kit.   All required items have been purchased and funds have been completely expended.  The result is that the R/V Kilo Moana now has two complete CTD/rosette systems to support NSF-funded research cruises.
