<AbstractNarration>Policy recommendations often have unintended consequences. This study aims to investigate one such unintended consequence: persistent negative child health impacts of a massive shift in behavior that occurred in Bangladesh around 1999 as millions of households moved away from the use of convenient shallow tube- wells as a source of household drinking water to less convenient deep tube-wells. The shift was in response to concerns that arsenic contamination in shallow tube-wells would increase health risks. However, the associated health risks for young children of switching away from backyard water sources appear to have been sharply underestimated according to preliminary findings by the investigators, which point towards substantial increases in child deaths in households that switch water source.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The empirical contribution of this study aims is to disentangle the impact of the behavioral shift from other socioeconomic factors that affect health. The researchers note that at the very local level there is quasi-random variation in arsenic contamination - with some households within the village contaminated and others, very close by, having uncontaminated wells. This analysis can therefore compare child mortality for households within the same village who do or do not have arsenic contamination in their water both before and after 1999, when the behavioral switch took place, and can thus identify the existence of unintended consequences.&lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;The work will contribute to determining the appropriate policy response to arsenic contamination across the world, and will develop methods that can be used to identify unintended consequences of multiple policy recommendations.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   In Bangladesh in the early 1990Ã†s, arsenic contamination was discovered in many of the shallow tubewells that households regularly employed for drinking and cooking.  A massive international effort was made to test over five million tubewells throughout the country and conduct awareness-building activities encouraging households to abandon contaminated sources. In a strikingly short amount of time, awareness-building efforts alone led an estimated 23% of the population to transition from backyard pumps to less convenient drinking water sources, including more remote tubewells or surface water sources. Poor alternative drinking water sources, however, meant that a switch away from arsenic-laden shallow tubewells often implied a switch to more inconvenient and potentially bacterially contaminated drinking sources. Although abandoning shallow tubewells contaminated with arsenic is likely to have a measurable latent effect on reducing mortality in older populations, given the relatively high burden of diarrheal disease, it could come at a significant cost to the health of younger populations. Given this context, this research study had three primary objectives: (1) to assess the impact on child mortality of the behavioral shift away from shallow tubewells; (2) to determine the channels through which diarrheal incidence may have increased, given the switch in water source; and (3) to provide a reasonable bound on excess mortality amongst adults/the elderly due to arsenic contamination.
