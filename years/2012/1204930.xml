<AbstractNarration>This project is developing the Building Efficiency for a Sustainable Tomorrow (BEST) National Center to support improvements in the field of building systems technician education. With the large scale transformation underway in the building industry, building systems technicians must be educated and prepared to manage the increasingly complex building automation and energy management systems now being installed or under development. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Center is: 1) creating a national network of industry advisors and research laboratories tasked with helping to define emerging industry skill requirements, validate model courses and curricula, and advocate for the mission of the Center to the larger community of industry stakeholders, 2) advancing the knowledge base of community college educators by providing opportunities and resources in the following priority areas: curriculum development, professional development, career pathway development, and dissemination of research, and 3) strengthening the national STEM pathway for educating building technicians and engineers starting in high school.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: Educators are advancing their knowledge and understanding of this multi-disciplinary field through professional development workshops that present best practices in building system technician education. Students are benefiting from enhanced industry-validated curricula and well-honed instructional strategies, as well as expanded program offerings and hands-on labs. The Center is creating links to research from national laboratories and research institutions on its website to inform curricular improvements. The project is leveraging the work of other centers funded by the National Science Foundation, as well as Department of Energy-funded research and development activities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: The Center responds directly to research conducted by the Building Intelligence Group that identified broad workforce trends and gaps in training for building system technicians. The Center is providing professional development and resources to improve classroom instruction and learning, as well as disseminating information on research and new technologies developed by national laboratories.</AbstractNarration>

Professional development and technical assistance &ndash; Advanced education for instructors has created a network of over 60 colleges which are active with BEST (see map). During the past five years, a total of 13 faculty workshops and 6 webinars have boosted curriculum adoption:  Nearly 500 individuals from 36 states and more than 120 colleges have participated at BEST events. Over twenty colleges are developing or embedding BAS content in their curricula due to the Center?s technical support. Various colleges are drawing upon BEST?s expertise as they start innovative programs for operating mission-critical facilities and labs supporting national security. BEST is also playing a formative role in shaping state BAS curriculum standards in Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Massachusetts, Nebraska, New Jersey and Ohio.   Lab innovations - The Center has provided faculty with new ideas and resources for designing instructional facilities. From compact HVAC and controls classrooms to Living Labs and BAS trainers, BEST has documented model labs and negotiated educational discounts to ease the effort and cost required to initiate new coursework and hands-on activities.

Currently, no such certification exists. BEST has completed a nationally validated DACUM and Job Task Analysis to identify and define key High Performance Building Operations Professional (HPBOP) skills and responsibilities. The goals are to:  Develop a national HPBOP certification and exam. Create a 2-year Associate of Science degree curriculum aligned with the certification. Design and implement a condensed pilot program for educating incumbent technicians.   For the last goal, BEST has worked with investor-owned utilities and other stakeholders on a plan to enhance the skills of incumbents in California. The successful completion of this pilot program in 2017 has reinforced the urgency of developing the certification and stimulated further interest among businesses and organizations to upskill the workforce.   BEST is also partnering with Association of Controls Professionals, a nonprofit organization whose mission is to create a community of practice for BAS controls technicians, educators, and related professionals. Complementary to HPBOP certification, development of BAS-related credentials and continuing education will strengthen the support of today?s "intelligent buildings."  Impact on students and the workforce - From 2014-17, more than 3,400 students took at least one course informed by BEST resources, and over 1,400 completed BEST-impacted programs. Nearly 1,500 were placed into the workforce, and it is expected that the number of reported workforce entries will rise as more colleges join the Center?s network.

The mission continues - In May 2017, BEST was awarded a 5-year renewal grant of $3.6 million from the National Science Foundation. This will allow the Center to extend its pioneering work with college educators and assist the high performance buildings and technicians so essential to the future of the nation and our planet.
