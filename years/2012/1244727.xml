<AbstractNarration>Project Description: The BCC-SBE Collaborative Research Project, "Using Archival Resources to Conduct Data-Intensive Internet Research," has three goals: (1) to build a community of scholars focused on tackling next-generation questions of Internet research through the use of archival digital data; (2) to create sample databases and develop a prototype research tool, HistoryTracker, using data from the Internet Archive, a library of Web pages from the World Wide Web; and (3) to maintain an active community of scholars using the cutting-edge community platform HUBzero. Co-PIs Weber, Lazer and Carpenter will lead a community building initiative to coalesce scholars around these three goals. In the long-run, this work will support ongoing interactions among community participants, including the collection of feedback, sharing research, and dissemination of databases collected through the course of this research and beyond. Convenient, efficient access to archival Internet data has the potential to open up countless new avenues of social science research. In addition, evidence from this research project will inform the creation and dissemination of general guidelines for conducting theoretically and methodologically rigorous longitudinal research using archival Web data.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Significance/Nontechnical: The Internet Archive is the single largest repository of archive Web data in existence, yet there is a significant lack of research-ready databases and tools available to the scholarly community. Funding of the BCC-SBE Collaborative Research Project, "Using Archival Resources to Conduct Data-Intensive Internet Research," will inform the creation and dissemination of general guidelines for conducting theoretically and methodologically rigorous longitudinal research using archival Web data. Co-PIs Weber, Lazer and Carpenter will work to bring together a community of scholars focused on research utilizing archival digital data. Subsequently, the principal investigators will lead the development of initial tools and sample databases for conducting ongoing research examining numerous issues pertaining to the development of the World Wide Web, and the behavior of individuals and organizations on the Internet.</AbstractNarration>

Datasets  The team at Rutgers University worked hand-in-hand with the Internet Archive and Northeastern University to extract and test datasets from web archive collections held by the Internet Archive.

Education  The project has provided numerous opportunities for education and development in the areas of engineering and technology. Working with PhD students from Social Sciences and Computer Science, the project has provided opportunities to teach about social science research implications from large-scale data. New techniques have been developed to extracted data from archived formats to research ready formats, which have required significant collaboration and integration of knowledge from the social sciences and computer science.

Ongoing discussions have taken place via the ArchiveHub website, and via a listserv setup to promote ongoing discussion.     Platform and tools for community interaction   Subsequent to the workshop, the ArchiveHUB website (http://archivehub.rutgers.edu) served as the project's central portal, gathering collective input, sharing updates, and ultimately publishing databases collected through the course of this research. A primary goal of ArchiveHub was to bring together a community of social science researchers focused on tackling questions of Internet research using datasets extracted by this grant. In addition to ArchiveHub, the Archives Unleashed workshop series provided an expanded forum for engagement (archivesunleashed.com) and has further enhanced the robustness of the community.     HistoryTracker is an open-source tool that allows for the extraction of social network data from data held at the Internet Archive and made available via the ArchiveHub website.
