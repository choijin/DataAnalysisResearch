<AbstractNarration>One of the key premises in paleoclimatology is that understanding of past climate can give us insight into present day and future climate.  A corollary is that the ability of climate models to faithfully simulate past climate, particularly during extreme periods such as the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM; ~20,000 years ago), will help us improve these models and give us more confidence in their projections of future climate change. Over the past few decades scientists around the world have periodically carried out an intercomparison of the latest model simulations of climate over the past few centuries and the future. In its most recent iteration (the Intergovernmental Panel of Climate Change Fifth Assessment Report, or IPCC AR5), this exercise also includes simulations of climate during the last glacial period (the Paleoclimate Model Intercomparison Project- Phase 3, or PMIP3). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary goal of this project, a collaboration between researchers from Columbia University's Lamont Doherty Earth Observatory and Oregon State University, is to evaluate the ability of the AR5 and PMIP3 suite of climate models to simulate the modern and LGM global ocean circulation. The goal is to both assess the state-of-the-art models used to project future climate change, as well as to contribute to a better understanding of climate and ocean circulation during the LGM. Previous assessments have been hampered by the lack of direct observations of past climates.  Fortunately, the interaction of ocean circulation with carbon dioxide and other biogeochemical trace material leaves behind chemical signatures in ocean sediments that record the climate and ocean circulation of that period.  Unfortunately, while scientists have become quite adept at measuring them, these chemical signatures are only indirect and imprecise recorders of ambient climate. To get around this problem, the researchers have developed a model capable of directly simulating biogeochemical tracers and their interaction with ocean circulation. Coupled with a novel computational technique, the researchers will simulate these tracers in the AR5 and PMIP3 models, and then compare them directly to the chemical signatures measured in sediments. By analyzing the results the researchers will be able to characterize the circulation of each model, identify the underlying factors responsible, and assess its performance against observed data. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The work is highly relevant to ongoing efforts to more accurately constrain past climates, to project the future impact of human activity on the climate system, and to develop models capable of simulating different climate regimes. The work involves collaboration with climate modeling groups around the world (Germany, Japan, France, and Australia).</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ One of the enduring mysteries in climate science is the cause of the ~80-100 ppm variation in atmospheric CO2 between Earth?s ice ages and its warm interglacial periods. Because of the magnitude of this change, the ocean, with its large capacity to store carbon, has generally been considered to play a controlling role, with many different mechanisms - from changes in the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) to an enhanced biological pump due to iron fertilization - having been proposed. However, the precise cause - or causes - of this variation still remains an open question as coupled ocean circulation-biogeochemical models (ESMs) have generally not been able to simulate the full, observed change in atmospheric CO2.     One way forward would be to use observations to better constrain ESMs. But this is hampered by the fact that the observational evidence for environmental conditions in the past is based on interpreting geochemical tracers archived in sediments. Since most current ESMs do not explicitly simulate these tracers, and as many of these isotopic tracers, 13C for example, are affected by a variety of processes, constraining ESMs with paleoceanographic data remains an indirect and uncertain business at best.     The goal of this project was to develop and apply modeling tools to overcome some of these challenges. In particular, we wished to apply geochemical observations to evaluate the ability of the PMIP3 suite of climate models, many of which are also participating in IPCC AR5, to simulate global ocean circulation today and for the maximum of the last glacial age (LGM, around 20,000 years ago).

Our primary result is that the faster and deeper AMOC simulated by the majority of the PMIP3 models are inconsistent with observations.    Elemental 231Pa/230Th ratios in marine sediments are frequently used as a paleoceanography proxy to derive the strength of AMOC. The working principle of this proxy is as follows: 231Pa and 230Th in the ocean are produced at a constant ratio by Uranium decay but adsorption onto particles removes these tracers differentially, with Th removed faster than Pa, via scavenging. Thus, due to longer residence time, Pa is advected by ocean circulation more than Th. This differential removal is reflected in the measured sediment as 231Paxs/230Thxs (xs denote excess 231Pa and 230Th activities after correction for what could be produced from U decay in the sedimentary minerals). Thus, the very rationale behind using this radionuclide ratio as a flux tracer depends on how well we understand the scavenging of these elements in the modern oceanic settings.     A specific goal of this project has been to study how these dissolved tracers (i.e. Pa and Th) interact with the particle field in the ocean in order to better understand the biogeochemical cycling of these particle-reactive elements and their use as a flux tracer in present and past oceans.
