<AbstractNarration>Learning Mathematics of the City in The City is an exploratory project that is developing teaching modules that engage high school students in learning mathematics and using the mathematics they learn.  Using geo-spatial technologies, students explore their city with the purpose of collecting data they bring back to the formal classroom and use as part of their mathematics lessons.  This place-based orientation is helping students connect their everyday and school mathematical thinking.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Researchers are investigating the impact of place-based learning on students' attitudes, beliefs, and self-concepts about mathematics in urban schools.  Specifically, researchers want to understand how place-based learning helps students apply mathematics to address questions about their local environment.  Researchers are also learning about the opportunities for teaching mathematics using carefully planned lessons enhanced by  geo-spatial technologies. Data are being collected through student interviews, classroom observations, student questionnaires, and student work. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the authors explain, "The use of familiar or engaging contexts is widely accepted as productive in the teaching and learning of mathematics."  By working in urban neighborhoods with large populations of low-income families, this exploratory project is illustrating what can be done to engage students in mathematics and mathematical thinking.  The products from the project include student materials, software adaptations, lesson plans, and findings from their research.  These products enable further experimentation with place-based mathematics learning and lead the way for connecting mathematical activities in school and outside of school.</AbstractNarration>
