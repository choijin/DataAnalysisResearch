<AbstractNarration>The ability of selective colleges to use affirmative action in admissions changed&lt;br/&gt;dramatically from the mid--1990s into the 2000s due to state bans and the 2003 Grutter v.&lt;br/&gt;Bollinger Supreme Court decision that clarified how affirmative action may be used.&lt;br/&gt;Little research has compared racial-&amp;#8208;ethnic and nativity differences in access to selective colleges across the two&lt;br/&gt;affirmative action contexts. Therefore, investigators examine application to, enrollment in, and&lt;br/&gt;graduation from four--&amp;#8208;year selective institutions, four--&amp;#8208;year non--&amp;#8208;selective institutions, Historically Black Colleges and Universities, and two--&amp;#8208;year institutions in the pre--&amp;#8208; and post--&amp;#8208;Grutter time periods to answer the following questions: 1) To what extent do native and immigrant black, white, Asian, and Latino students apply to, attend, and graduate from different types of colleges? 2) To what extent are racial--&amp;#8208;ethnic and nativity differences in college destination and graduation explained by SAT scores and other indicators of merit? 3) To what extent are racial--&amp;#8208;ethnic and nativity differences in college destination and graduation, SAT scores, and other indicators of merit explained by social and economic background characteristics? 4) How do group differences in college destination and graduation vary nationally across the pre-&amp;#8208; and post-&amp;#8208;Grutter time periods, and across states that banned and did not ban affirmative action? Investigators will analyze data from the National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988 (NELS) and the Education Longitudinal Study of 2002 (ELS). NELS and ELS are nationally--&amp;#8208;representative surveys collected by the National Center for Education Statistics that reflect high school graduates' enrollments in college in 1994 and 2006, prior to and after the 2003 Supreme Court case.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Understanding group differences in access to selective colleges is important to public concern about higher education because research&lt;br/&gt;suggests that selective colleges offer myriad advantages over non-Â­&amp;#8208;selective colleges (e.g., more&lt;br/&gt;rigorous courses, higher graduation rates, better career outcomes)</AbstractNarration>

Additionally, various states banned the use of affirmative action in admissions.  In our first manuscript, we use the Education Longitudinal Study of 2002-2012 to investigate the relationship between state bans on affirmative action and racial-ethnic patterns in seeking admission to a public selective college.

We hypothesize that in states with bans on affirmative action, blacks and Latinos are pushed from in-state public selective institutions to private selective, out-of-state selective, and nonselective institutions.  We find that black students in states with affirmative action bans are significantly more likely to attend out-of-state public selective institutions.  A third paper, recently accepted by Ethnic and Racial Studies, uses the Education Longitudinal Study to examine the relationship between SAT mismatch and college outcomes for students at selective institutions.  Selective colleges and universities use affirmative action to achieve diversity, given that blacks and Latinos have somewhat lower SAT scores than their Asian and white peers.  Critics of affirmative action argue that this results in lower grades and greater dropout among underrepresented minority groups; they are silent on whether mismatch harms white and Asian Americans, however.

Thus, although mismatch may lower performance at selective colleges, it does not appear to prevent students who may have benefitted from affirmative action from obtaining important credentials from America's elite educational institutions.  In our final paper, we use two unique datasets, the National Education Longitudinal Study and the Education Longitudinal Study, to examine how affirmative action context relates to collegiate outcomes at selective institutions in the United States.  Our use of two datasets provides us with a natural experiment to examine graduation and cumulative grade point average before and after the 2003 Supreme Court cases and before and after states instituted affirmative action bans.  We find that affirmative action context matters.  Underrepresented minority students have significantly higher grades in the period after the Grutter decision than before it, indicating that the holistic evaluation method required by Grutter may be enhancing educational outcomes for these students.  We find no support for the idea that banning affirmative action leads to better collegiate outcomes for minority students at selective colleges.   In sum, this project finds that restrictions on affirmative action via state bans exacerbate racial inequalities in higher education by facilitating the entry of groups that are already overrepresented in elite colleges.  However, changes commanded by the 2003 Grutter Supreme Court decision do not appear to exacerbate inequalities, as the holistic review required by the decision may have contributed to students' greater academic achievement in college.  And while mismatch is associated with lower grades, it does not appear to prohibit students from obtaining an important educational credential.
