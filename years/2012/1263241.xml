<AbstractNarration>This is an ongoing Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Program at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics (CfA), in which students will carry out individual research projects in solar physics under the supervision of CfA senior staff scientists for ten weeks during the summer.  The student projects mostly involve data analysis from space missions currently being supported at the CfA, such as Hinode, SDO, IRIS and Wind, or numerical modeling projects, depending on the students' interests and abilities.  The target group of students consists of undergraduates in STEM disciplines, with a preference for students from small colleges where there are few research opportunities. Through ongoing CfA international collaborations, the principal investigator (PI)'s team will invite a small number of international students to participate in the program. The PI plans to encourage minority student applications by making professional contacts at conferences that serve minority populations, as well as through contacting minority colleges and universities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI expects that student projects will frequently result in joint professional publications or presentations with their CfA mentor(s), providing undergraduates with valuable motivation and career development experiences. Since Solar Physics is taught at relatively few colleges and universities, this program provides an important service to the discipline. With its strong Space Weather component it has the double benefit to society of adding to our understanding of potential space hazards. Moreover, former participants of this program have reported that the exposure to professional research in a university environment helps them to decide whether to continue their education in graduate school, and whether or not to pursue research as a profession.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ For ten weeks in the summers of 2013, 2014, and 2015, a total of eighteen students participated in this REU program.  The students worked on a broad range of scientific projects having to do with the Sun and the solar wind.  Some students studied eruptions on the Sun and looked for the source of the solar wind, which are important scientific qustions related to how the Sun affects the Earth.  Other students studied the cycle of activity that happens on the Sun, and the heating of the corona, which are fundamental processes on the Sun that are not currently well understood.  The students presented their projects in a final talk to the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics at the end of the summer, and many of them also presented work at a professional scientific conference, such as the American Geophysical Union meeting or the American Astronomical Society meeting, thus disseminating their scientific results to a broad audience of scientists.  A major outcome of this grant is that many of the students that participated in this program went on to graduate school in the physical sciences. Of the students that participated in our program over the reporting period, fourteen have graduated, and eleven of those students are currently attending graduate school, or are planning on attending graduate school in the fall in the areas of physics, astrophysics, geophysics, engineering, or math.  Six of the students who continued on to graduate school are women, thus broadening the participation of underrepresented students in the hard sciences.  Another major outcome is that this program increased the students' exposure to scientific research, and improved skills needed to perform that research, such as computer programming, data analysis, reading scientific literature, and critical thinking skills.
