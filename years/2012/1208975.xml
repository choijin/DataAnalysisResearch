<AbstractNarration>Herbarium specimens provide a source of historical information useful to the study of global environmental change. The goal of this project is to provide data to support studies of the nature and consequences of environmental change in the New England region over the last three centuries. This project will digitally capture specimen data and images from about 1.3 million vascular plant specimens from herbaria across New England, enhancing the data with georeferencing, habitat, and phonological information. The digitization process will integrate with existing community efforts and will develop novel high-throughput digitization technologies to increase efficiency and decrease costs. All resulting data and images will be freely available on-line.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The data from this project will be of immediate use to scientists who study climate and land-use change, and will provide a better understanding of how global changes will impact the distribution of native and introduced plant species. This project will benefit research in taxonomy, ecology, morphology, biogeography, and evolutionary history by making available data on an entire regional flora in an electronic format. The methodologies developed will provide a model for other regions around the nation. In addition the project will utilize citizen scientists, school groups, and students providing training, research, and educational opportunities. . This award is made as part of the National Resource for Digitization of Biological Collections through the Advancing Digitization of Biological Collections program and all data resulting from this award will be available through the national resource (iDigBio.org).</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Since the 18th Century, New England has undergone extensive land-use changes from primary forest to widespread agriculture, and then to its current state, a mosaic of secondary forest and land cleared for development. New England is unique in North America for having a rich history of botanical collecting activity dating from the late18th Century to the present.  This means that we have a pre- to post-industrial botanical record of extraordinary value for the insights it can provide to a variety of questions.  Such insights include how climate change alters the timing of flowering phenology, and biases inherent in botanical collecting, to name only two.  Until now, these data have been largely hidden from public view in dozens of herbaria across the region.  The goal of this project was to complete the digitization of New England specimens held by the University of Massachusetts Herbarium.  The Herbarium has 241,000 accessions, of which 97,397 are from New England.  Herbarium specimens provide critical historical and modern locality information, allowing us to map plant species distributions.  In addition, we digitized the smaller collections of two herbaria without the resources to do so themselves, including 3,547 specimens from the Harvard Forest Herbarium, and 11,058 from Westfield State University.  All the digital specimen images and data are now stored and available for viewing and analysis by the general public, at the Consortium of Northeastern Herbaria Portal site (http://portal.neherbaria.org/portal/) and at natural history digital aggregators such as iDigBio (https://www.idigbio.org/portal).  Each site features crowdsourcing and citizen science initiatives to encourage the public to become involved in adding to and improving the quality of the data.  Several botanists have already provided updates to specimen identifications through viewing them on the portals.  In the course of this project we trained 23 undergraduate students, 3 laboratory assistants and one graduate student in various aspects of the operation.  These included use of the camera and associated software, pulling and filing of specimens, specimen repair, data entry and error correction.  Three of the undergraduates and the graduate student later became managers of the project and participated in training others as well as becoming involved with databasing, image post-processing, and uploading images and data to the portal.
