<AbstractNarration>The University of Chicago's Yerkes Observatory, the National Radio Astronomy Observatory, the University of North Carolina, the Astronomical Society of the Pacific, and 4-H are collaborating to provide professional development to 180 4-H leaders and other informal science educators, and engage 1,400 middle school youth in using research-grade robotic telescopes and data analysis tools to explore the Universe. Youth participating in 4H-based out-of-school programs in Wisconsin, West Virginia and North Carolina are learning about the universe and preparing for STEM careers by conducting authentic astronomy research, completing astronomy-related hands-on modeling activities, interacting with astronomers and other professionals who are part of the Skynet Robotic Telescope Network, and interacting with other youth who part of the Skynet Junior Scholars virtual community. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is innovative because it is providing a diverse community of 4-H youth (including sight- and hearing-challenged youth and those from underrepresented groups) with opportunities to use high-quality, remotely located, Internet-controlled telescopes to explore the heavens by surveying galaxies, tracking asteroids, monitoring variable stars, and learn about the nature and methods of science. Deliverables include (1) online access to optical and radio telescopes, data analysis tools, and professional astronomers, (2) an age-appropriate web-based interface for controlling remote telescopes, (3) inquiry-based standards-aligned instructional modules, (4) face-to-face and online professional development for 4-H leaders and informal science educators, (5) programming for youth in out-of-school clubs and clubs, (6) evaluation findings on the impacts of program activities on participants, and (7) research findings on how web-based interactions between youth and scientists can promote student interest in and preparedness for STEM careers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The evaluation plan is measuring the effectiveness of program activities in (1) increasing youths' knowledge, skills, interest, self-efficacy, and identity in science, including youth who are sight- and hearing-impaired, (2) increasing educators' competency in implementing inquiry-based instruction and their ability to interact with scientists, and (3) increasing the number of Skynet scientists who are involved in education and public outreach.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[Skynet Junior Scholars Skynet Junior Scholars engages youth and youth leaders in the process of conducting astronomy observations and investigations.  Astronomical observations are secured through the Skynet Robotic Telescope Network (Skynet).  Skynet telescopes are research instruments designed to capture the transient light of gamma ray bursts emitted by massive cosmic explosions before they fade away.  The educational collaborators on this project recognized the potential this network had for engaging youth in real observational astronomy projects without needing to be near a telescope, and so, Skynet Junior Scholars was created. The project is innovative because it is engages a diverse community of youth (with sharp focus on sight- and hearing-challenged youth) with three critical components that bring the act of doing science alive:   Access to research-quality, remotely located, robotic telescopes,     Lessons that guide youth through the processes of using the telescopes and analyzing data,    Caring experts in astronomy who provide advice in a safe online environment.  Youth experience the nature and methods of science as they explore their own questions and interactions with other participants.    In SJS, youth participants gained interest in  STEM careers by conducting authentic astronomy research, completing astronomy-related hands-on modeling activities, and interacting with astronomers and other professionals who are part of the Skynet Robotic Telescope Network, and by interacting with other youth within the Skynet Junior Scholars virtual community. Much of the initial work undertaken was to build the website infrastructure to enable youth to participate while protecting their privacy.  SJS is one of very few online programs that is open to youth under thirteen. Two websites were developed for this project: the Skynet Telescope Interface (skynet.unc.edu), and the SJS web portal (skynetjuniorscholars.org). Project partners collaborated to provide professional development to youth leaders including 4-H club leaders and extension agents, museum educators, after-school program coordinators. They gained experience using Skynet telescopes to complete a series of explorations and strategies for leading youth in inquiry-based science activities. These educators then engaged middle school and high school youth in using Skynet telescopes and data analysis tools to explore the Universe.  Through SJS, one hundred and sixty-seven youth leaders and leader supervisors from 27 states completed SJS professional development workshops. Of those educators receiving professional development, 36% were 4-H leaders or extension agents, 33% were teachers, including 9 staff associated with Wisconsin schools for the Blind and Deaf, and the remaining 30% were a diverse mix of educators from a variety of backgrounds including state and National Park staff, museum educators, amateur astronomers, and planetarium educators. In total, one hundred and seventy-three Skynet Junior Scholars youth groups have been created, which include 1531 youth accounts. Research activities focused on understanding 1) the development of youths' knowledge, skills, interest, self-efficacy, and identity in science, including youth who are sight- and hearing-impaired, and 2) educators' competencies necessary to successfully implement inquiry-based instruction with youth. Skynet Junior Scholars journal articles include publications in NSTA Science Scope and Connected Science Learning.  Skynet Junior Scholars staff, leaders and youth attended American Astronomical Meetings in 2015, 2016, and 2017.  SJS posters and/or talks were presented by: staff in 2015, by staff and SJS leaders in 2016, and leaders and youth in 2017.   Skynet Junior Scholars continues beyond funding from the NSf to continue to provide   youth access to a network of professional grade telescopes   an online virtual community for youth and leaders designed for accessibility and privacy measures appropriate for youth including those under the age of 13.     a growing number of astronomical activities and resources, a gallery, and a forum    resources for  youth and youth leaders who work with blind and low vision, deaf and hard of hearing.     opportunities for scientists to share their science and be involved as mentors for leaders and youth.    an avenue for collaborative partners to share telescope resources with a broader audience.    a growing community of telescope owners and scientists who further the development and power of Skynet and Skynet Junior Scholars.      Partners on the project were The University of Chicago's Yerkes Observatory, the Green Bank Observatory, the University of North Carolina, the Astronomical Society of the Pacific, and the West Virginia University and University of Wisconsin Extension Services (4-H).
