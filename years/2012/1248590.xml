<AbstractNarration>This project is to hold a workshop on the subject of wind hazard and related fields. The two-day workshop will discuss ongoing research and practice in the subject area. The workshop is under the sponsorship of American Association for Wind Engineering (AAWE). Participation at the workshop will be by academicians, researchers and practicing architects and engineers. The venue of the workshop is Hyannis, Massachusetts. This is the third workshop in a series of workshops held every two years.&lt;br/&gt;The objective of the workshop is to provide a forum for young investigators to present and discuss their ongoing research. The subjects of wind hazard, wind engineering, and wind energy are of importance to the nation. Students and Post-doc fellows are encouraged to present their research on an informal setting. The forum provides an opportunity to present research to their peers and receive feedback to improve the quality of research. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
