<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses this problem:   with the explosion of data and apps, it is ever harder to find information in context.  How can information be found if it was lost or not captured in the first place?   The proposed solution enables to 'capture the moment' : the connections among pieces of disparate information across apps and the human mind, while people keep working with familiar tools.   Captured information is globally addressed, persistent in time, and hyperlinked based on the user's work:  hence, it can be found -as it was- via searches or navigating the links. This project will involve research and development to beta test the technology with selected professional users while they use familiar tools, and to validate the benefits with respect to the status quo.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to significantly improve personal and collaborative information management and search, and to solve inefficiencies in information technology that affect productivity.  The initial target users for the product are researchers that perform studies using disparate information and data from various sources of information and compile documents:  the product has the impact to enhance scientific collaboration.   The technology can be expanded to significantly improve personal and collaborative information management for a worldwide user base, with specialized products in many information intensive professions, resulting in a leap in actionable knowledge production and productivity.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This Small Business Innovation Research project tackled this problem: reuse of knowledge is hard or impossible.   Knowledge consists of the relationships among pieces of information that support problem solving, wherever they may be.  The more information is produced and scattered around, the more humans have to keep in their mind the relationships among the relevant facts and time that make it actionable.   How can knowledge be found digitally if it was lost or not captured in first place?  This project enabled the research and development of a beta system that validated technical feasibility and market potential in several industries.   The technology innovation consists of capturing knowledge non-invasively and broadly so it can be reused:  the connections between pieces of information get captured while people work in their usual computing and communication environments. It also enabled to find beta users and enterprise pilot projects.  The result of this project can be seen at xap.io:  an online service with desktop and mobile apps.  The product that will evolve from this beta has the otential to reduce inefficiencies, loss, and costs, and improve knowledge liquidity; the impact will be felt in by enterprises and individuals, with improved health care, engineering, finance, law and more.  The vision of the Globidea, and its broadest impact will be to launch the first global notarization service and identification system for the capture and reuse of information relationships. Globidea will establish and lead the industry standard to support the liquidity and accountability of information that will fuel the knowledge economy, and define a new currency: the certificate of knowledge capture.
