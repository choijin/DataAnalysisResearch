<AbstractNarration>As transistors shrink in size, they enable more functionality on the same area of silicon. However, small transistors are also more susceptible to intermittent errors due to alpha particles striking the silicon. Engineering systems to tolerate such errors is a problem that will become increasingly important over time. Evaluating fault tolerant designs has traditionally been almost impossible because (i) faults occur very infrequently, (ii) they require highly detailed (and thus time-consuming) simulations to determine whether they have any real effect, and (iii) millions or even billions of such simulations need to be performed to determine whether the design can actually tolerate particle strikes with different charateristics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project addresses the problem through a set of interlocking simulators, each at a different level of accuracy and simulation speed. The initial particle strike is modeled in extremely high detail for a short time until it can be modeled by a faster simulator with less detail, and so on. How to intelligently decide when the particle strikes, what it strikes, and when to transition between simulators are some of the core intellectual components of this project. Such a simulator could help develop techniques to build more efficient and effective reliable systems than are possible today.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The advances in semiconductor technology following Moore?s law have made transistors smaller and faster but also more susceptible to intermittent errors, such as due to alpha particles. A major challenge for hardware designers is to be able to evaluate the tolerance of their designs to these errors because such analysis requires highly detailed and thus slow simulation; billions of simulations are needed to determine whether the design can tolerate particle strikes with different characteristics.  This project has developed simulation methods that allow a substantial increase in reliability analysis capabilities. This was achieved through a novel hierarchical fault injection framework that strategically combines lower-level simulations (at circuit/RTL levels) with higher-level (ISA-level) simulations. As a result, it achieves both increased accuracy and higher performance compared to traditional simulation methods. Detailed fault analysis is possible in this framework, as it tracks fault propagation from circuit-level nets to application outputs. Faults are injected at the circuit level to achieve highest accuracy, and the framework aggressively tries to promote to higher abstraction levels to increase simulation performance. The high performance and uncompromising fidelity offered by the proposed simulation framework greatly expands the usefulness of statistical fault injection simulations, allowing hardware designers to much more quickly evaluate entire systems? reliability.  The combination of innovations in this project has allowed the performance of the framework to be an order of magnitude higher than a baseline simulator while achieving better accuracy. Improvements in the future can further increase performance by three orders of magnitude.  The project was carried out in close collaboration with leading US semiconductor companies, enhancing the technology transfer potential of this research. The ultimate result of this research is that it enables more accurate reliability analysis of digital systems and thus contributes to the ability to build reliable computing systems at nanometer scale.
