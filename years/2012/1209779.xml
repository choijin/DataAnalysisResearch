<AbstractNarration>This project will consider the effects of reproductive behaviors, such as egg production and parental care, on survival and future reproduction.  Reproducing females face a trade-off because current reproductive efforts can reduce survival and hence future reproductive output. Using an invertebrate model (Arizona bark scorpions), the investigators will use behavioral and physiological studies to understand the adverse effects of current reproduction on female survival and future reproduction. They expect to find that female Arizona bark scorpions will act in ways that enhance the health of their offspring regardless of any negative impacts on their own survival. This investigation addresses a basic question in animal life histories and reproductive behavior. The findings of this project will be applicable to a wide range of scientific fields, including animal behavior, reproductive biology, physiology, evolutionary biology . This study also provides opportunities to train undergraduate students in field biology. These students often include members of groups traditionally underrepresented in science. The investigators will produce a television episode about their research and give talks at elementary, middle, and high schools.  These outreach activities will expose young students to animal biology and scientific research.</AbstractNarration>

Significant time and energy costs associated with reproductive activities can have negative consequences on other aspects of an organismÃ†s life. To decrease high reproductive costs, behavioral and physiological tradeoffs may occur, resulting in changes in the activity patterns of individuals during a reproductive bout. We used an invertebrate model (Arizona Bark Scorpions, Centruroides sculpturatus) in behavioral and physiological studies to investigate adverse effects of reproductive activities on the body condition of scorpions.

This cost may compromise the survival of post-reproductive females by limiting their ability to recuperate the energetic resources invested in reproduction.  To examine the effect of reproduction on the preferred temperatures of females, we designed and constructed a thermal gradient and recorded the body temperatures (Tb) of pregnant and non-pregnant female scorpions over a 24-hour period. Using a Profile Analysis, we found that pregnant females selected significantly higher Tb than non-pregnant females. The selection of higher Tb by pregnant female C. sculpturatus may improve the development of offspring, but may also cause pregnant females to be more susceptible to death by overheating.

Male scorpions with longer chelae and tails may experience greater reproductive success, though increased mating success with females, compared to males with shorter chelae and tails.
