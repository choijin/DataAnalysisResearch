<AbstractNarration>This proposal aims to establish the nanoBIO node of the reconfigured Network for Computational Nanotechnology (NCN) at Illinois. The proposed node will create extensive online resources with the purpose to position the NCN Cyber Platform as the focal point for collaborative interactions of a diverse computational and experimental nanoBIO community. Although the proposal covers a comprehensive range of activities, the overriding goal is to organize the node as the first step towards a nanoBIO eco-system, by completing a set of four high-priority technical objectives: 1) development of critical online computational tools as essential building blocks for nanoBIO device simulation and experimental validation; 2) development of workflows linking simulations at different scales and leading to an extensible online environment for nanoBIO device design; 3) creation of transformative educational resources for biology, infusing modern nanoscience concepts via interactive simulation and visualization; 4) demonstration of a new paradigm for information sharing and knowledge discovery, with innovative scalable databases for searchable collections of computational and experimental nanoBIO datasets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To optimize the available resources, the nanoBIO node planning strategy has been to organize a network within the network, reaching out to key bioengineering and life science groups on campus, followed by forging partnerships with related IGERT programs, multi-university centers, and industrial collaborations to create a national fabric of interactions. A key partnership has also been established with the University of California-Merced to capitalize on existing collaborations in research and education and to leverage their computational biology based undergraduate programs. A cooperative effort to design engaging material between UC-Merced and the School of Molecular and Cellular Biology at UIUC will drive the NCN to become a revolutionary biology classroom environment that integrates research with education and stimulates undergraduates to develop interdisciplinary thinking, mirroring the IGERT mission. These rich online resources will also facilitate the access and understanding of nanoBIO concepts in K-12 education. To address the focus on devices and systems, the nanoBIO node will engage laboratories at UIUC with cutting-edge expertise in computational biology, bio-device fabrication and information technology, these laboratories include: the Beckman Institute, the Micro &amp; Nanotechnology Laboratory, the Institute for Genomic Biology, and the National Center for Supercomputing Applications. UC Merced will also play an important role in creating and directing qualified underrepresented students towards pursuing careers in nanoBIO disciplines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: An immense challenge faced by designers and manufacturers of nanoBIO devices and systems is the lack of integrated computational and training tools addressing the multiple length scales and the physical complexity needed to bridge biology with engineering. The establishment of a dedicated nanoBIO node of NCN provides an exciting opportunity to address this and formulates a comprehensive plan with nation-wide reach to support nanoBIO research and education. The vision for this NCN nanoBIO node is to form an active community that accelerates the creation of multidisciplinary computational tools and transformative training materials in nanoscience and nanoengineering for the design of novel nanoBIO devices and systems that will have a positive influence on our quality of life and environment. This effort will have a major impact on the development of human resources by facilitating training. The availability of online tools will also benefit industry, particularly small businesses and nanoBIO start-ups needing access to specialized resources.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: The urgency to contain health care costs and improve services, the imperatives to provide safe and plentiful food supplies, and the need for efficient bio-fuel production as part of a sustainable energy strategy all point to biology as the pivotal science of the future, and nanotechnology as the enabler. The ultimate goal of the nanoBIO node is to create resources for the discovery of devices suitable for nanoBIO applications, and to train the next generation of leaders who will translate nanoBIO technologies from research to the marketplace. These are crucial steps toward sustained transformation and revitalization of the health care industry, with broad potential impact on the creation of new high-tech jobs in an important manufacturing sector in the US. A new breed of scientists and engineers, with expertise across multiple physical and life science disciplines, is needed to sustain this vision. The node aspires to be the catalysts for truly innovative interdisciplinary education opportunities, putting forward an exciting educational plan which lays the foundations for a multi-faceted and integrated K-to-PhD pathway.</AbstractNarration>
