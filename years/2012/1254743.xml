<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;#1254743&lt;br/&gt;Chen&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The long-term research goal is to establish a new multi-modal imaging platform that combines optical imaging and MRI for multi-scale parallel imaging of neural activity. As a step towards this goal, the proposed research objectives in this CAREER proposal are: 1) Investigate depth-resolved neural physiological changes using multi-contrast OCT; 2) Implement MRI-compatible parallel photonic needle interface (PPNI) for simultaneous MRI/OCT; 3) Establish multi-scale MRI/PPNI-OCT imaging in live&lt;br/&gt;animals. They will apply this novel imaging technique to the mouse trigeminal system, which is associated with patterned array of whisker-related neural modules in various brain structures, and provides an excellent model system to investiate cellular and molecular mechanisms of neural pattern formation and plasticity. They will image populations of whisker-related neurons in the cortex and subcortical trigeminal centers using  PPNI-OCT/MRI, which will allow to simultaneously investigate whisker-evoked activity patterns in the brainstem, thalamus, and cortex.</AbstractNarration>
