<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;#1233727&lt;br/&gt;Valentine, Richard L.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nanotubes may enter drinking water either through their use in novel treatment technologies or by release from nanomaterials.  This project addresses their chemical processing by free chlorine and chloramine disinfectants. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:  Converging lines of evidence suggest that chlorine-based oxidants will react with CNTs via an electron transfer reaction that may also result in chlorine addition (i.e., C-Cl bond formation) to the CNT surface as well as other reactions with surface functional groups.  However, these processes have not been investigated at environmentally relevant conditions, and soluble products of this reaction, especially disinfectant by-products remain unknown.  Changes in CNT behavior resulting from chlorination have not previously been considered.  Studies will focus on the identification of material properties of a variety of functionalized CNTs that promote reactivity toward chlorine-based disinfectants.  Changes in surface properties and the potential formation of known disinfection by-products will be characterized.  The investigators will also assess the impact of these disinfectants on the aqueous stability and cytotoxicity of CNTs.&lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;Broader Outcomes: Collectively, results of this work will improve the ability of engineers and scientists to predict the fate and effects of CNTs in the environment.  Cytotoxicity data for chlorinated CNTs, in combination with established toxicities of identified disinfectant by-products should help regulators develop sound policy that limits the human and ecological health risks posed by CNTs during their life cycle.  The project outcomes will help catalyze the responsible design and application of CNTs, providing manufacturers with guidelines about CNT properties that should be avoided so as to minimize adverse environmental impacts. In addition to moving society toward more sustainable development and applications of nanotechnology, broader impacts of this work will address the need for nanotechnology education at the undergraduate, graduate and professional level in environmental engineering.   As the signature outreach effort for this project, the investigators will work with several agencies and organizations in Iowa that are responsible for drinking water supply, treatment, distribution, regulation, and finance to provide this target audience with important information about the future roles that nanotechnology may play in the delivery of safe and acceptable drinking water as well as potential regulatory implications.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Engineered nanomaterials hold great promise to revolutionize society, but only if their novel properties can be harnessed without unintended consequences that pose unreasonable risks to human or ecosystem health. While recent focus has explored adverse outcomes of direct exposure to engineered nanomaterials through food or drinking water, little, if any, work has considered their potential to produce hazardous byproducts via reactions that are likely to occur during the environmental processing of nanomaterials.  This work considered the fate, reactivity and transformation of a popular form of engineered nanomaterials, carbon nanotubes (or CNTs), during water and wastewater treatment.  Specifically, the final step in standard water and wastewater treatment is disinfection to remove harmful pathogens, which is often accomplished using chlorine as a chemical disinfectant. However, because chlorine is highly reactive, it can produce unwanted disinfection byproducts (or DBPs) such as chloroform through reactions with naturally occurring compounds (i.e., organic matter) that are ubiquitous in water supplies.  The structure and chemistry of many commercially available carbon nanotubes are evocative of natural organic matter. Accordingly, our work was guided by the hypothesis that reactions of chemical disinfectants with CNTs would produce known, and potentially hazardous, DBPs, including classes regulated in drinking water (trihalomethanes and haloacetic acids).  General outcomes of this work include the first evidence that:  CNTs can serve both as a precursor (via reaction with chlorine) and source (via unwanted byproducts of CNT synthesis) of known and regulated DBPs;   the nature and amount of byproducts formed during reaction with chlorine-based chemical disinfectants depends on the surface chemistry (or functionality) of CNTs;  chlorination also transforms CNTs, resulting in the addition of chlorine to their surface, and these reacted CNTs exhibit different environmental fate and effects (e.g., toxicity) relative to pristine, unreacted analogs; and  trends in the formation of DBPs can be described using the established chemistry for more traditional precursors such as naturally occurring organic matter.    Specific findings linking CNT composition and solution chemistry to byproduct formation include:  Nitrogen-functionalized CNTs (N-CNTs) represent a source and precursor of N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA), an unregulated but emerging DBP that is toxic at low (nanogram per liter) levels in drinking water. N-CNTs function as a source of NDMA because of residual NDMA bound to the surface of commercially available materials, presumably because NDMA is formed as a byproduct during N-CNT production. Oxidized CNTs (e.g., carboxylated CNTs) promote the formation of haloacetic acids, which are regulated in drinking water. Some oxidized CNTs also yield a unique byproduct, chloropicrin, which we propose results from the reaction of residual nitrate that persists on the CNT surface after the use of nitric acid in the CNT surface oxidation process. Brominated DBPs can be generated during chlorination of CNTs if bromide is present in the water sample at naturally abundant levels often encountered in water supplies.
