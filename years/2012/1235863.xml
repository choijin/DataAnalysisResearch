<AbstractNarration>1235863&lt;br/&gt;Wagner&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A challenging scientific and engineering problem is accurately predicting the flow of complex fluids containing solid particles, such as nanoparticles, colloids, crystals and larger particulates.  Such suspensions are encountered in a wide array of consumer products (e.g. paints, cosmetics, and foods), in nature (e.g. sediments, concentrated protein solutions and blood), as well as multiphase fluids of significant national concern (e.g. transuranic tank sludge), and as critical components in emerging devices for energy storage (flow batteries). The flow of such suspensions are often thixotropic, whereby the material's rheological properties are time and flow history dependent. The proposed research addresses this challenge though a transformative approach, namely developing a multiscale microstructure-based framework that will be thermodynamically consistent and generally applicable for all flows. A key component will be to identify the internal variables that properly define the microstructure. Validation of the theory and modeling will be accomplished by leveraging a complementary development of new experimental techniques to simultaneous measure the rheology and microstructure of such systems. Thus, a systematic, combined theoretical/experimental investigation on well-defined, model thixotropic systems is an important component of the research plan. The intellectual merits of the research include the development of a robust, theoretically rigorous framework for modeling the general, time dependent flow of concentrated suspensions. This systematic and integrated effort will lead to a new capability in the modeling and understanding of complex thixotropic systems that can significantly aid in the rational engineering of many materials of industrial and national importance.  The broader impacts of this work include educating PhDs and BCHEs in suspension rheology necessary for careers in industry and academic research.  Modules are to be developed for K-12 education by building on and improving current laboratory demonstrations.   The models and knowledge developed in this research have potential to improve many industries as the processing and flow of thixotropic suspensions is critical to chemicals, materials, and pharmaceutical manufacturing and handling.  As an application of particular importance, the PIs will be working with partners at Sandia National Laboratory to address the national challenge of processing suspensions of radioactive tank sludge at Hanford and other critical issues concerning nuclear waste management.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ "Thixotropy" refers to the time-dependent material properties associated with the flow, or "rheology" of suspensions of particles.  Such suspensions exist in nature, such as in muds and sediments, in industrial practics, such as in "red mud" from mining operations, ceramic sluries, and in the processing of many industrial products based on particles, in consumer products, such as toothpaste and abrasive cleaners, and in goverment laboratories, such as the transuaranic waste from nuclear weapons manufacturing.  This research addressed the challenge of  modeling of particulate suspensions that are time-dependent though a transformative approach, namely developing a multiscale microstructure-based framework that is thermodynamically consistent and generally applicable for all flows. A key goal is to relate the suspension's properties under flow to the properties of the individual particles that make up the suspension.  This allows scientists and engineers to formulate or adjust the formulation of such suspensions to achieve the desired flow or processing properties.  An equally important goal is to develop an overarching theoretical framework that can be used to both judge the validity of existing models and as a guide to developing better models.  A further goal is to develop a standard, world-wide recognized data set available for all working on this problem to test and validate and compare various models and approaches.  These goals were achieved in the course of this research.     The intellectual merit is the development of a foundational understanding of a problem that has vexed theoreticians since the seminal work on dilute suspensions by Albert Einstein in the early 1910's.  For the first time, a direct, quantative connection has been established between the properties of the particles making up the suspension and the bulk flow properties of the suspension.  Further, a framework has been established for judging the thermodynamic valditiy of such models that can be used to guide their continued improvement.  Finally, tests of prevaling models were performed by validation against an expanded data set on a model system used world-wide by the community and improvements in leading models developed from this comparison.  Improved models  for modeling polydisperse suspensions are presented and validated.  Our coarse-graining approach leads to a fundamentally new foundation for the development of robust and accurate models.     The broader impacts include the publication of a new algorithm based on the "thermal annealing" approach that has wide applicability in all branches of science where complex models must be compared and/or fit to multiple data sets.  Further, a material property data set is provided for public scientific use that is broader than those previously tested and includes a wider range of rheological tests for use by scientists world-wide working in this area.  A PhD student sucessfully graduated and is currently a Col. in the U.S. Army teaching at West Point Academy, a second PhD student is expected to graduate shortly and an undergraduate research assistant and underrepresented minority high school intern educated and mentored during the course of this research.
