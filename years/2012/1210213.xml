<AbstractNarration>This action funds Boon-Ling Yeo of University of California, Davis to conduct a research project, entitled "Optimal Regulation and Management of Nitrogen to the Atmospheric, Terrestrial, and Aquatic Ecosystems," during the summer of 2012 at Motu Economic and Public Policy Research in Wellington, New Zealand.  The host scientist is Dr. Suzi Kerr. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Intellectual Merit of the research project lies in advancing environmental management of a dynamic pollutant, which takes different forms in the atmospheric, aquatic, and terrestrial ecosystems.  The research provides novel insights for developing an efficient multimedia pollution permit trading scheme with rules governing trades both within and between airborne and waterborne nitrogen emissions.  The multidisciplinary nature of the research, which combines biogeochemistry, economics, biology, and social sciences, can lead to a coupled human-ecosystem-based approach for managing nitrogen pollution and connect ecological research results to human demands for ecosystem services and regulations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.  These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Excess levels of nitrogen in surface and groundwater as well as elevated levels of N in the atmosphere can have myriad adverse effects on ecosystems and human health.  The agricultural sector has been identified as the largest source of N pollution, and the intensity of agricultural production affects both nutrient and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.  New Zealand is the first country in the world to implement a nationwide GHG Emissions Trading Scheme that includes forestry and will later include agricultural emissions as well.  Furthermore, since NZ also has an existing nutrient trading scheme to control for water quality in Lake Taupo (which is also being considered in Lake Rotorua), NZ provides an ideal context for the applied study of environmental policies involving tradable permit schemes for air and water pollution permit markets.      Environmental policies designed to reduce one type of pollution may have complementary effects on the other type.  This research explores this issue in the Lake Rotorua catchment in New Zealand using an agro-environmental economic model, NManager.  The Regional Council is planning to implement a nutrient trading scheme to reduce nutrient discharges to the lake, especially from non-point sources such as farmland, while at the same time the NZ government is planning to include agricultural GHG emissions into the NZ emissions trading scheme.  We model the abatement costs, potential level of total cost savings; and environmental impacts of agricultural production under three policy scenarios: the inclusion of agricultural in (1) the nutrient trading market only; (2) the NZ GHG emissions trading scheme only; and (3) both the nutrient trading market and the NZ emissions trading scheme concurrently.    This research shows several key findings both analytically and numerically.  First, this research suggests that the total level of GHG emissions within the catchment declines when a nutrient trading scheme is introduced alongside an existing GHG emissions trading scheme.  Second, the permit price of nutrient leaching is inversely related to the permit price of GHG emissions.  Third, the sensitivity of GHG emissions to the permit price of GHG is lower when both pollution trading schemes are in place.  In other words, the demand for GHG emissions becomes less responsive to a change in the price of GHG permits when there exists a permit price for N leaching.  Finally, the total economic profit loss from pollution abatement is lower when GHG emissions and nutrient discharges are both being managed compared to the sum of the economic profit loss from regulating GHG emissions and nutrient discharges separately.  Within the field of environmental economics and policy, this research represents an important advance in further understanding the environmental management of a dynamic pollutant like nitrogen, which can take different forms in the atmospheric, aquatic, and terrestrial ecosystems.  This research has provided some insights and extended existing knowledge on how the interactions of two related pollution permit schemes designed to manage air and water pollution separately affects the level of two different but related pollutants.  Investigating the interactions of two separate tradable pollution permit schemes is an important area of research because the environmental impacts (e.g. land-use change from pastoral farming to forestry) to each regulation can be quite different depending on what other regulation is already in place.  In addition, the distribution of the costs and benefits to the various stakeholders and local governments will also vary depending on what combination of policies is implemented.  This research has helped address questions of inter-relationships between two pollution markets that have not previously been addressed before.
