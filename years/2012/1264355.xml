<AbstractNarration>This proposal will investigate whether the presence of target bile acids in a solution outside a droplet of liquid crystalline material (5CB) will trigger a radial-to-bipolar transition in the structure of the liquid crystal, which can then be detected simply by polarized light microscopy. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, this method of detecting bile acids is much easier than existing technique and might be employed in more remote locations where sophisticated analytical tools are not available.</AbstractNarration>
