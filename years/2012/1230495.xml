<AbstractNarration>States are known to play a critical role in shaping scientific research. Inaccuracies in how states and science intersect can mischaracterize relationships between science and power, incorrectly treat contemporary state-science interactions as thoroughly innovative breaks with the past, and draw attention away from non-state actors in shaping science. To understand state-science relationships, social scientists, policymakers, and historians of science have relied heavily on a conceptualization of science and states in the decades following the second world war known as cold war science. In this characterization, the conflict between the USSR and the US was the critical determinant of state-science relations, and consequently, when the cold war ended, science-state relations changed dramatically. Analysts of cold war science have recently raised questions about this framework, and have shed new light on how long-term and durable geopolitical trends, including decolonization and the evolution of an internationalist world order, have shaped and continue to shape science. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this conference is to build on this recent scholarship by bringing together a wide range of analysts of science and power to exchange new global perspectives, share new knowledge of the complex dynamics of knowledge and power, and to investigate cultural dimensions of scientific inquiry, in order to enhance understanding of science in the cold war, question the basic validity of the cold war framework, and generate new insights about long-term science-state-power relationships.    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Dark Matters conference offers a rare opportunity for scholars working on diverse national, regional, organizational, and disciplinary contexts to cross the boundaries of specialization, encourage cross-fertilization of ideas, and foster collaborative research in the future. Conference papers are incorporated into an edited volume accessible to students and that serves as resource for established analysts of science studies, science policy, and history of science.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In the post-World War II era, high science and advanced technology became central components of political power and international competition worldwide.  Scholars in the history of science and in science and technology studies are only just beginning to appreciate the fully global dimensions of technoscience and its ties to statecraft in the period from the mid-twentieth century onwards.  This project worked to advance understanding in this area by convening two meetings&mdash;"Dark Matters: The Contents and Discontents of Cold War Science" in Barcelona, Spain in May/June 2013, and "Dark Matters II: Science and the Cold War in a Decolonizing World in Vancouver, Canada in September 2014&mdash;that showcased cutting-edge research and forged new discussions about science, technology, and global order after World War II.  Current historical and contemporary research underscores the need to reckon with the enormous diversity and variation in the possibilities that peoples and nations worldwide identified with science, technology, and modernity in the decades after 1945.  The place of science and technology in the cold war conflict between the United States and the Soviet Union; the more localized political settings that shaped science in Europe under circumstances ranging from the fascism of Francoist Spain to the borderland between East and West in the two postwar Germanys to the declining imperia of the British and French empires; the roles that international organizations such as the Food and Agriculture Organization and the World Health Organization played in scientific and medical affairs; and the embeddedness of science and technology within wide-ranging conceptions of nationalism and national identity across Asia, Latin America, Africa, and the South Pacific during an era of intense anti-colonial nationalisms in the 1950s, æ60s, and æ70s suggest the multiplicity of purposes and cross-purposes that science and technology have served in recent world history.     Persons interested in learning more about this project are invited to consult the programs of the two meetings and related materials online at http://www.cehic.es/ficha_congresos.php?sitelang=ca&amp;idnoti=238 and http://www.ligi.ubc.ca/?p2=modules/liu/events/view.jsp&amp;id=1259.  Video excerpts from parts of the proceedings of the Barcelona conference are available at: http://www.upf.edu/shc/videos/dark_matters/.  In addition, a forthcoming issue of History and Technology on "Nation, Knowledge, and Imagined Futures" will draw from research presented at the Vancouver workshop in order to explore the rich and convoluted mixtures of human expediency and imagination that shaped the complex relationships between science, technology, and nation-building across the developing world from the 1940s to the 1980s.
