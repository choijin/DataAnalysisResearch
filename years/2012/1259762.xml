<AbstractNarration>The College of New Jersey, a public, primarily undergraduate, residential, comprehensive institution of higher education, is improving access to, and is increasing success of, financially-needy students who seeking a bachelor's degree in Biology or Chemistry with plans go to graduate school or enter the STEM workforce.  Building on experiences and outcomes from a prior award, the PERSIST program includes a well-defined application process (with a required interview), peer and faculty mentoring, tutoring, mini-bridge component, and career development programming.  Over the 5-year project, 34 unique individuals are receiving scholarship support including two cohorts of freshmen, one cohort each of five sophomores or five juniors, as well as 6 seniors (for just the first project year).  The project is increasing the retention and graduation rates of students from underrepresented groups by thoughtfully addressing academic disadvantages that otherwise talented and motivated students from low-performing high schools bring with them.  In addition, PERSIST is designed to allow carefully chosen students, the time and academic support necessary to improve basic skills, leading to a reduction in an artificially acquired achievement gap.  The project is documenting and disseminating effective peer and faculty mentor strategies for students, is increasing student-faculty interactions, is improving the effective use of math and science tutoring, and is sharing, through presentations and publications, the findings.  By deliberate design, PERSIST practices are having a halo effect and are benefitting far more students than just those who receive scholarships.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   Intellectual Merit:  The College of New Jerseyâ€™s (TCNJ) Chemistry and Biology Departments developed the PERSIST (Program to Enhance Retention of Students In Science Trajectories) 2.0 project.  The goal of the project was to increase the number of underprivileged students that graduate with a Chemistry or Biology degree at TCNJ through a combination of scholarships, supportive academic/community programming, and peer/faculty mentoring.  From 2014 to 2019, PERSIST 2.0 supported 35 scholars who graduated with a Chemistry or Biology degree at a rate of 83% in 4.5 years, an increase of over 20% of comparator groups (62%; students with a FAFSA expected family contribution of less than $12,000).  When examining racial data, PERSIST 2.0 had consistent graduation rates between white (81%), latinx (80%), asian (83%), and other (100%; black, two or more, did not respond) groups which indicates the program has eliminated the race gaps that exist in the comparator group.  Moreover, the successful program outperformed all Chemistry and Biology graduation rates by nearly 10%.  With the excellent outcomes of the program, we have demonstrated that inclusion does not equate to lowering standards.  When the correct support structures like tutoring, mentoring, and active programming are in place, our students flourish in STEM majors with excellent post TCNJ outcomes, including medical school, graduate school, teaching, and industrial positions.     Broader Impacts: The project helped to shift the systems at TCNJ and the School of Science by forging partnerships, shifting the culture, and implementing structural changes on how TCNJ creates supportive culture and classroom environments for all STEM majors.  A lasting partnership was developed with the Education Opportunity Fund (EOF, low income and mostly underrepresented minority students) to develop a new summer bridge program for STEM students.  Through the lessons learned from PERSIST 2.0 and other NSF DUE projects, the TCNJ School of Science created a new Student Success Committee that is focused on faculty development to create student-centered learning environments that are more supportive and use modern teaching pedagogies.  The successful PERSIST 2.0 program not only has helped the students in the program, but helped to guide our strategic priorities towards inclusive excellence to support ALL of our students. We believe these models of inclusive excellence are generally transferable to other STEM departments and to other institutions.
