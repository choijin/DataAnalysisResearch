<AbstractNarration>This research is a component of a broad community experiment named SOAS (Southern Oxidant and Aerosol Study) designed to further investigate the oxidation of the emissions (biogenic volatile organic compounds; BVOCs) of plants in the context of the atmospheric environment of the Southeast United States.  Secondary organic aerosol (SOA) particles arise, in situ, from atmospheric reactions of BVOCs  together with the subsequent partitioning of these products into condensed phase materials. The direct measurement of sensitivities of SOA production rates and properties to various environmentally relevant perturbations in the ambient conditions at the SOAS study site will provide a convenient test point for the description of the chemical mechanisms of SOA formation, needed for use in a variety of climate and air quality models.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will involve undergraduate and graduate students, research staff and faculty, creating an environment for student development and exposure to interdisciplinary research and collaboration.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Organic vapors in the atmosphere react with radical species to create chemical products that prefer, at least partially, to exist in a solid or liquid phase.  The condensed material is referred to as secondary organic aerosol (SOA).  The formation of this SOA is controlled by various environmental parameters including temperature, relative humidity, and the presence of other constituents.  In summer (July) 2013, a field campaign to investigate SOA formation in a forested area downwind of significant anthropogenic emissions was held in Centerville, Alabama.  The original approach of this project was to perturb ambient air in a chamber to investigate the response of SOA to the perturbation.  Because of technical difficulties associated with the chambers, the project instead focused on generation of continuous pollutant time series at the field site location and novel analyses of the resulting data sets.     Time series generated by this project include size-resolved particle composition and concentration collected using an aerosol mass spectrometer at a temporal resolution of 2.5 minutes.  These time series were used to perform statistical analyses to determine the most significant aerosol constituents (in order, organic aerosol, sulfate, ammonium, and nitrate).  In addition, factor modeling was used to estimate the most important contributors to organic aerosol (in order, less oxidized material (LO-OOA), more oxidized material (MO-OOA), biomass burning (BBOA), and isoprene-derived SOA (IEPOX-OOA)).  The significant average BBOA influence was driven almost exclusively by one outlier event.  The MO-OOA and IEPOX-OOA time series appear to be driven predominantly by photochemistry, while the LO-OOA peaked at night.     The time series of gas-phase pollutants (taken from a collective field site data repository), sulfate aerosol, MO-OOA, LO-OOA, and IEPOX-OOA were used to challenge what it means for air to be "aged."  It is commonly assumed that the relative fraction of MO-OOA compared to LO-OOA will increase as air "ages."  Thus, as other age metrics increase (such as the relative conversion of nitrogen oxides to more oxidized forms), so should this ratio.  However, the opposite is seen at the field site, where the LO-OOA fraction inceases as the nitrogen oxide age increases.     In addition to novel scientific findings, this project had significant broader impacts.  This was a highly collaborative project that necessitated and enhanced interaction between researchers from various institutions (in this case, most specifically Rice University and Texas A&amp;M University).  Both graduate (one of whom was a female from a developing nation) and undergraduate (one of whom was a male from an underrepresented minority in STEM fields) students experienced field research for the first time.  The Rice team participated in all on-site outreach activities and science team meetings.  Findings were disseminated through oral and poster presentations at national meetings and will continue to be so through peer-reviewed literature.  Finally, the paradigm of thinking of air as "aged" was reviewed, and the results should influence other air quality scientists in determining how that definition is made and applied during air quality field campaigns.
