<AbstractNarration>This NSF Accelerating Innovation Research (AIR) project will create an innovation ecosystem between/among public-private partners to provide weather  warning systems, technologies, and processes.  Assessing the guidelines for optimal scale of rainfall-runoff and employing high resolution analyses of the current state of the atmosphere will enable pinpointing areas where storm development will occur. Additionally, social science methods will evaluate human response to flood warnings with recommended warning strategies.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Weather has significant societal impacts. 3.4% or $485 billion of the 2008 U.S. gross domestic product is  sensitive to weather variability, and the extreme weather of 2011 resulted in at least 922 deaths and  more than $70 billion in total economic losses.  This will be one of the first deployments of X-band radars for flood warning in the U.S.  These activities will result in the creation of new knowledge in the fields of flash flood warning, storm initiation, and urban-scale decision-making.</AbstractNarration>

Four private companies deployed their own x-band radars in the Living Lab to refine their technology with our engineers, obtain user feedback, and showcase  their technology. 23 new X-band radars have been sold into regional markets both in the US and internationally based on their experience in the living lab.  Adoption of the regional radar deployment model.   A broadcast media company has made a major financial commitment to deploy X-band radars in urban markets across the country, based in part, on the CASA Living Lab. Radars are currently being deployed in Dallas, Chicago, LA, and the mid-Atlantic coast.  Operational use of CASA radar data by National Weather Service office in Fort Worth.  CASA data is disseminated in real time to the NWS decision support system for use in real-time severe weather warnings. Development of licensable version of the Meteorological Command and Control software for radar system operations and product generation; development of a prototype storm initiation product.    Education and Outreach outcomes include:  Two entrepreneurship classes were offered at the University of North Texas under the project.  These students developed a feasibility assessment and a business plan for commercialization of CASA radars and related data services. The students also got an opportunity to engage with potential end customers of the technology and venture capitalists and students involved in the technical research for the project.  One post-doc participated in the I-corps project to evaluate potential for small scale radars.  Research outcomes were published and presented at several domestic and international conferences, meetings with the National Weather Service personnel and local public safety officials such as emergency managers and storm water managers. 5 Masters or PhD theses were awarded based on research conducted in the the Living Lab.      Organizational outcomes include:  Development of a multi-sector partnership that will fund on-going research, technology transfer and operations for the CASA Dallas Fort Worth Living Lab for Severe Weather Warning Systems beyond the end of current award. Funders include the north Texas public safety community and the National Weather Service for network operations; industry and federal grants for sponsored research; and a private company that is providing broader institutional support.  Active and growing practitioner partnerships. The project started with commitment and participation from just two private sector firms, but over time has grown to include participants from eleven weather data resellers, eleven small and large local businesses that get impacted by weather, eight weather sensor manufacturers and two disaster relief non-profits.   Strategic Partnerships with European Network for Living Labs (ENOLL) and The Global City Teams Challenge (GCTC), a collaborative network of  "Action Clusters," working on groundbreaking applications of Internet of Things (IoT) technologies within the smart city/community environment.  These associations will connect us in the future to like-minded organizations, partners, funding sources, and new ideas.
