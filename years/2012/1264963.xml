<AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Heterogeneous, solid catalysts are widely used to promote desirable chemical reactions. One very common example is the automotive catalytic converter, which catalyzes the chemical conversion of the environmentally hazardous components of engine exhaust into benign products. The ?active? catalysts in the catalytic converter contain expensive precious metals, like platinum, palladium, and rhodium as the active metal sites. Other processes critical to society, like the production of ammonia for fertilizer or of gasoline for fuel, all depend on catalysts to promote the key chemical reactions. In many of these cases the available catalysts are expensive, perform less than perfectly, or seriously degrade in performance over time. Further, there are many reactions for which good catalysts are simply unknown. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In most cases, heterogeneous catalytic reactions happen at the surface of the catalyst. This interface has traditionally been studied under ultra-high vacuum, where it is relatively easy to tease out the various chemical events. Quantum mechanical, density functional theory (DFT), molecular models are well suited to studying these interfaces and processes in the high vacuum limit. There remains however a gap between these traditional approaches and the real conditions of catalytic interest. It is now well understood that at operating conditions, a catalyst surface is often crowded with lots of molecules and that these molecules can even cause the catalyst surface to change shape or chemical form. To understand and improve heterogeneous catalysts, one must study and model them at these more realistic conditions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The National Science Foundation Catalysis &amp; Biocatalysis Program is awarding three researchers, Professors William Schneider and Franklin Tao of Notre Dame University and Christopher Wolverton of Northwestern University to collaboratively tackle the high-pressure challenge through a combination of advanced computer models and ambient pressure experiments. By combining the expertise of Schneider at Notre Dame in molecular-level modeling of catalytic reactions with the expertise of Wolverton at Northwestern in multi-scale cluster expansion models, tools will be developed to predict the behavior of a metal surface under reaction conditions. The tools will be developed and validated initially against the ambient pressure experiments of Tao at Notre Dame. The workers will study in particular the reactions of CO and NO at platinum and rhodium surfaces, reactions relevant to environmental protection. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The students will be exposed to an interdisciplinary, multi-institutional collaborative research program which will lead to cross-fertilization of ideas. Three graduate students advised by the principle investigators will work together on the theory and experiments. The models will be disseminated to the catalyst community, and have the potential to advance both the application of existing catalysts and discovery of design principles for new ones.</AbstractNarration>

One very common example is the automotive catalytic converter, which catalyzes the chemical conversion of the environmentally hazardous components of engine exhaust into benign products. The active catalysts in the catalytic converter contain expensive precious metals, like platinum, palladium, and rhodium as the active metal sites.

In many of these cases the available catalysts are expensive, perform less than perfectly, or seriously degrade in performance over time. Further, there are many reactions for which good catalysts are simply unknown.   In most cases, heterogeneous catalytic reactions happen at the surface of the catalyst. This interface has traditionally been studied under ultra-high vacuum, where it is relatively easy to tease out the various chemical events. Quantum mechanical, density functional theory (DFT), molecular models are well suited to studying these interfaces and processes in the high vacuum limit. There remains however a gap between these traditional approaches and the real conditions of catalytic interest. It is now well understood that at operating conditions, a catalyst surface is often crowded with lots of molecules and that these molecules can even cause the catalyst surface to change shape or chemical form. To understand and improve heterogeneous catalysts, one must study and model them at these more realistic conditions.      The overarching goal of this effort is to develop tight connections between atomically precise experimental measurements and computational predictions of catalytic metal surfaces under reaction conditions.  Common computational approaches to catalysis typically begin with models of high symmetry surfaces, e.g. the (111) facets of the late transition metals, and with some dilute coverage of a single adsorbate.  As is well known and as we have modeled in prior work, adsorbates can interact in non-linear ways at a surface, influencing the energetics of adsorption, the arrangements of adsorbates, and ultimately micro-kinetic and macroscopic reactivity at the surface.  Further, adsorbates can restructure an ordered surface, for instance by rearranging atoms at the surface or, in the case of metal alloys, preferentially drawing one constituent to the surface.  In this work, we are combining laboratory-scale in situ high pressure scanning tunneling microscopy (HP-STM), density functional theory (DFT), and cluster expansion (CE) techniques to understand these phenomena (1) at a (110) metal surface and (2) at the (111) surfaces of metal alloys.      Bimetallic surface alloys (alloys made with two distinct metals) play a crucial role in the pursuit of rational design of heterogeneous catalysts because of the possibility to tailor electronic and geometric structures. In order to rationalize various experimental observations about catalytic activity of bimetallic surfaces, the relationship between adsorption energetics and surface configuration need to be investigated. Many researchers have observed that adsorbate binding energy shows a strong linear correlation with the nearest-neighbor atom types at the adsorption sites in some alloy systems. However, interactions between adsorbed oxygen with second-nearest-neighbor atom species have shown significant contribution to oxygen binding energy in the Pt-Ni alloy system. To better understand how local atomic order affects adsorption energies on bimetallic surfaces, we systematically studied modifications in adsorption energies of a wide variety of adsorbates (O, C, N, H, S, CO and NO), on various binary combinations among Pd, Rh and Pt with alloying on the surface layer on the (111) facet.      We have also developed models of surface adsorption of species on bimetallic and trimetallic surfaces, and used these models to predict a new PtCuAu trimetallic catalyst for hydrogen evolution.  Experimental validation of our predicted catalyst confirms that the predicted catalyst has 7 times higher activity for than current state-of-the-art Pt catalysts (based on Pt content).  This predictive method can be applied to a wide range of catalyst situations and represents an important step towards the design of novel, improved catalysts.
