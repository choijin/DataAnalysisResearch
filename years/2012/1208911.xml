<AbstractNarration>The researchers conduct millimeter-wavelength interferometry of CO (and related isotopologues) gas and dust emission from circumstellar disks that are at different stages of growth. The PI and his research team will also model the molecular chemistry and radiative transfer for each disk in order to estimate mass as a function of time. The new mass estimates will be used to constrain models of disk and planetary formation and evolution.  He plans to use the Submillimeter Array (SMA) on Mauna Kea, and ALMA.   A graduate student at University of Hawaii-Manoa, undergraduate student at University of Hawaii at Hilo and student in the Research Experiences for Undergraudates (REU) summer program will also participate in the research.</AbstractNarration>
