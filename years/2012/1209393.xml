<AbstractNarration>This action funds Eric Lee King of The University of Georgia to conduct a research project, entitled "Methane dynamics in Taiwanese mud volcanoes," during the summer of 2012 at the National Taiwan University in Taipei, Taiwan.  The host scientist is Dr. Li-Hung Lin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Intellectual Merit of the research project is to elucidate emissions of methane, a potent greenhouse gas, from terrestrial mud volcanoes. Data indicates the possibility for terrestrial mud volcanoes to have a different mechanism, and therefore different environmental controls, for methane oxidation than their more common marine counterparts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.  These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.</AbstractNarration>
