<AbstractNarration>ISE Research: Contextualizing Science Learning and Motivation in Rural and Indigenous Adolescents through Mapping Sustainable Practices is a three-year interdisciplinary research project. Researchers from the University of New Hampshire will investigate impacts of contextualization on science learning, motivation, and positive attitudes toward science of early adolescents from rural and Indigenous populations. The project will yield research findings that can help identify contextualization as a means to engage rural and Indigenous adolescents. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project team uses a systematic approach that incorporates mixed methods of data collection and analysis to learn more about how culture and community (contextualization) impact STEM learning. They hypothesize that contextualizing science learning to culture and community will enhance rural majority and Indigenous early adolescents' science knowledge and positively strengthen motivation and attitudes toward science. Local community and Indigenous group members provide expertise that contributes to the design of the research and the related curriculum as well as the interpretation of the findings. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will contribute to what we know about how underserved and underrepresented youth engage in STEM learning in relation to their world views. This work will help advance the informal science education field in terms of providing rigorous evidence that can inform theory on learning and motivation among disadvantaged STEM learners as well as address practical issues around the design of STEM programs for rural and Indigenous groups.</AbstractNarration>

The project was renamed the Sustaining and Promoting Indigenous and Rural Adolescents Learning Science (SPIRALS)(www.spirals.unh.edu).   Middle-school (4-8thgrades) students (n=604) selected a local practice typical in their community (e.g., hunting, gardening, lumber company) and determined its level of sustainability based upon four conditions of sustainability which were the reduction of energy and waste, the wise use of natural resources as well as determining if the practice as fair to all living organisms. Systems maps were created prior to the students? investigations to determine their prior knowledge, knowledge gaps and misunderstandings about the practice. Students then worked on a systems map after their local practice investigation to determine how sustainable their practice was.  A final project was created by the students and presented to a public audience (see SPIRALS curriculum attachment).  Creation/Conceptualization of Community-based Science Education Model  Interviews, group-generated systems maps, and final projects from 348 students participating in research activities were examined for how students learned systems thinking and sustainability, as well as how using community-based assets elicited motivation for science learning.   Our model of CBSL in the SPIRALS curriculum was most successfully implemented when the teachers acknowledged the intertwined nature of learning with a community's social practices (see community-based science learning model attachment).  SPIRALS created opportunities for students to explore their lived experience while learning science. This foundational position allowed students to more easily assume the identity of a science learner that coincides with their larger current identities and visible career options for future.  The CBSL model incorporated the systems mapping of sustainable practices situated in the learners' communities (see systems map example attachment), promoting the use of community expertise/experts to pursue investigations, and encouraging the dissemination of student findings beyond their immediate classroom (see final project example attachment).  Motivation to Learn Science  Interviews showed that teachers (n=24) and students (n=135) became more aware of the ubiquitous role of science played in the everyday lives of their communities. Engaging students in authentic community social practices outside of traditional educational settings and encouraging them to conduct research by directly interacting with community members established a rapport that students found valuable, motivating and educational (Jablonski, et al., 2017).  One goal of this CBSL model is to situate learning tasks within broader community social practices and within an academic discipline that shapes their knowledge and identity as learners based on personal experiences and value for their communities (Bang, 2015). Community members were identified as science experts who produced and used scientific knowledge and skills within their daily lives. Our research found that students were motivated to learn sustainability by interviewing community members in their workplaces, or when the members visited a school. Students, however, benefitted most when they interacted with spaces in their communities for a fully immersive experience.  System Mapping as a Reflection of Systems Thinking  The project team developed an analytic approach to the systems maps to capture students? level of systems thinking that was adaptive to many types of community practices and sufficiently comprehensive to capture varied levels of systems thinking understandings. The SMART tool was based upon the qualitative Interaction Analysis technique (Jordan &amp; Henderson, 1995) involving individual and then consensual coding of human activities, such as artifacts.  Individual coders wrote an overall description of a systems map, commenting specifically on components, overall connections, directionality of connections, and clarity of the functional boundaries around the system of interest. After assessing each essential systems element, coders determined an overall systems thinking rating for each map to enable pre-post comparisons. To ensure consistency across coding each overall systems thinking assessment level was operationalized to include considerations of map clarity, logic, as well as attempted and successful demonstration of complexity in regards to each essential system element.  Theanalysis of the students? systems maps and interview provided evidence that systems mapping supported student?s understanding of how different components in the community-based practice were interdependent on each other.  Mapping also encouraged them to think about the community-based practice in terms of relationships and connectedness as a precursor to determining the level of sustainability of that practice.    When students were asked what part of the curriculum they enjoyed or learned from and most students often cited systems mapping and their many benefits. The students also enjoyed creating a visual representation of what they knew about a community practice prior to and after their investigation demonstrating their learning gains. Students also commented on how creating the systems maps made it easier to learn.       Last Modified: 01/28/2019       Submitted by: Eleanor D Abrams]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
