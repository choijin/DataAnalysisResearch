<AbstractNarration>This action funds Laura Aiko Michelle Walsh of the University of California, San Francisco to conduct a research project, entitled "Broadening cell sheet tissue engineering," during the summer of 2012 at Tokyo Women's Medical University in Tokyo, Japan.  The host scientist is Dr. Teruo Okano.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Intellectual Merit of the research project is elucidating the determinants of successful cell attachment and detachment from the polymer poly-(N-isopropylacrylamide) (pNIPAM), a thermoresponsive polymer that is used to grow and detach an intact sheet of cells.  This polymet has major applications in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine but is also useful in learning about basic mechanisms in cell biology because different cell types and species have different behavior on this polymer.  Therefore, understanding the parameters of successful cell adhesion and detachment are very important to elucidating the basic mechanism of cell behavior on the polymer, as well as broadening the clinical applicability to previously incompatible cell types. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.   These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Cell sheet fabrication (CSF) has major applications in tissue reconstruction and regenerative medicine.  Cell sheets have intact extracellular matrix (ECM) on the underside and can be layered.  With the addition of porous membranes and other techniques, some cell types can be grown into cell sheets without xenogeneic factors such as fetal bovine serum or murine feeder cells, hugely increasing biological compatibility.   The success of the CSF technique is dependent on successful cell attachment and detachment. There are differences in cell behavior on pNIPAM coated surfaces between different cell types and species.  Discovering the elements that control cell behavior will expand the tissues the CSF technique will be able to regenerate through developing better methods to encourage cell adhesion and detachment of intact cell sheets.  At Tokyo Women's Medical University, working with Dr. Okano's laboratory, I was able to investigate elements controlling cell attachment and detachment to a thermo-responsive polymer by both physical and biological methods, thereby acquiring experience with new techniques. To investigate adsorbed proteins, we used Atomic Force Microscopy to examine the surface topography of the polymer surface before and after cell adhesion and detachment, as well as the effect of different proteins in the media used with the cells. To study the composition of proteins on the surface, we used X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy. To investigate the cell surface receptors for extra cellular matrix proteins that adsorbed to the surface of the polymer, I used qPCR to quantify mRNA expression levels. These techniques were used for multiple cells types with differing ease of cell sheet harvesting.  Our inquiry and findings investigate whether we could elucidate cellular differences that could be leveraged to increase the number of cell types that can be used to make cell sheets, thereby expanding the disease states that can be treated using cell sheet fabrication.  More specifically, we investigated whether we can use differences in cell adhesion protein receptors expression and the extracellular matrix proteins adsorbed to the polymer that these receptors bind to can be harnessed to expand the cell types we can use for cell sheet fabrication by, for instance, by supplementing (if the protein was found to be correlated with easier cell sheet detachment) or decreasing (if that protein was correlated with  difficult detachment) that protein in the media used to culture the cells.  Further investigation will be needed to expand and confirm our initial findings.       Last Modified: 11/27/2012       Submitted by: Laura Walsh]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
