<AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;03 July 2012&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number:  1217210&lt;br/&gt;Institution:  Columbia University, Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory&lt;br/&gt;PI:   S. Higgins&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal requests four Shipboard Scientific Support Equipment (SSSE) items for the R/V MARCUS LANGSETH operated by Columbia University, Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory (LDEO); namely Line Islands cruise coring support equipment, wireless remote controls, a 40 KVa uninterrupted power supply and a commercial-grade sign maker.  Funding of these items will greatly enhance science support capability and safety on board the vessel.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:   The LANGSETH supports federally funded scientific research throughout the world?s oceans to expand human knowledge of the ocean environment and is the only 3D seismic vessel in the Academic Fleet.  During operations, the vessel routinely exposes graduate and undergraduate students to seagoing oceanography through real-time satellite connectivity from ship to shore, and open house events.  The LANGSETH is scheduled to complete nearly 200 NSF sponsored days in 2012.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   The 2012 Shipboard Scientific Support Equipment (SSSE)  award provided critical support for infrastructure in successfully supporting science objectives on two cruises that R/V Marcus Langseth prepared for on short notice.  This included  supporting an Remotely Operated Vehicle  called "JASON" on a cruise off of Washington State as well as other lab support onboard.  This included provideing deck support for a variety of equipment including 5 lab vans, two winches and lab equipment.  The second cruise was a sediment coring cruise to the Line Islands in the remote Pacific Ocean that we previously were not set up to be able to support. The R/V Langseth was modified to provide temporary coring winch onboard along with lab vans and support for coring equipment on maindeck.  Installation of wireless controls for winches  for deployment of science equipment over the side of the vessel was supported by this award that improves safety for technicians.    A commercial quality label/signmaker was funded for making improved permanent labels around the vessel that saves time and resources.   Funds originally planned for a  power backup upgrade was redesignated with support of the National Science Foundation for completing installation of new phone and public address system that was completed in 2015.    The remaining funds  alllowed us to improve to important bridge equipment for communications  that included a new INMARSAT C system for two-way data and messaging from the vessel and support for installation of a new Electronic Chart Display and Information System (ECDIS) on  the R/V Langseth.
