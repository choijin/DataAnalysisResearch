<AbstractNarration>This project will develop and evaluate a prototype system to provide on-line process monitoring and guidance to the performers of health care processes. An Institute of Medicine report has estimated that nearly 100,000 people per year die in US hospitals from preventable errors, and subsequent reports have suggested that many of these errors arise due to the complexity of hospital processes.  The project will demonstrate how contextual information (retrospective, current, and prospective) can be used to provide process performers with timely information that could reduce errors, provide expedited warnings of impending hazards, and improve outcomes. Techniques to accumulate and represent historical data will be developed and will feed into profile-based analysis techniques that will evaluate probabilities and support making fine-grained process distinctions. These capabilities will provide a strong technological foundation for evidence-based, continuous process improvement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Project technologies will be evaluated first using synthetic event streams generated by process model driven simulations, then by human simulations with nursing students using patient mannequins, and finally with medical professionals in simulated clinical settings. Processes to be examined include blood transfusion, chemotherapy, medication administration, and patient identification verification. Early community success in applying medical checklists and recent experimental results with proactive process guidance in a hospital emergency department are positive indications that the approaches proposed here have an excellent chance of gaining acceptance and improving medical outcomes.  Moreover, the technologies developed here, although evaluated specifically for health care, will also apply to human-intensive systems increasingly employed in a wide range of domains in society. The validated medical processes and the proposed prototype will be an effective framework for educating medical professionals in current best practices. This project will also educate computer science and engineering students about the challenges posed by the medical domain, encouraging a new generation of specialists in this emerging interdisciplinary field. Its societal appeal will also help engage bright, energetic minority and female students thereby helping broaden the participation of underrepresented groups in STEM generally and in computer science and engineering particularly.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>It is now well-known that medical errors are one of the major causes of death in the US. Although checklists have been shown to reduce errors in several domains, there is resistance to adopting them in medical care, perhaps because they tend to be somewhat limited, focusing primarily on the major, normative steps. The goal of this project was to develop a tool-supported framework for dynamically creating situational-aware, adaptive checklists that are responsive to the current situations facing the patient and process performers. The major outcomes include:</p> <ul> <li>Technology support for automatically monitoring process events and then using that information to determine the context of the current process while it is being performed. Deviations from the desired process can be detected and reported relatively quickly after a deviation occurs, and evaluated using derived event streams. </li> </ul> <ul> <li>Technology support for generating a Smart Checklist user interface that shows the current status of an executing process, including completed steps, steps currently being performed, and a brief view of impending steps. Patient vital signs and other relevant data can be incorporated into the user interface as well. The interface to medical devices was built upon the Massachusetts General Hospital Interoperability framework (MD PnP) that provides a consistent interface to a wide range of devices. (Figure 1 shows an example generated Smart Checklist) </li> </ul> <ul> <li>Detailed process models for an outpatient blood transfusion process, chemotherapy administration, and emergency room flow in addition to initial process models for verifying patient identifiers for medicine administration and for cardiac surgery. These models are represented in the Little-JIL process definition language that provides rich semantics for supporting nominal as well as non-nominal, or exceptional, situations, concurrency, and human flexibility. (Figure 2 shows an example of a Little-JIL process model.)</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Technology support for evaluating the process models for vulnerabilities, especially when critical steps are performed incorrectly. Given a particular hazard, an event that should be avoided, our technology creates a fault tree model of how that hazard could arise based on the Little-JIL process model. The fault tree is then analyzed to compute minimal cuts sets, collections of incorrectly performed events that could cause the hazard to occur if all occurred on a single execution of the process. By examining these cut sets, domain experts can determine if the process is vulnerable to failures and propose process modifications that can then be modeled and also analyzed. (Figure 3 provides an example (and simplified) fault tree for the blood transfusion process where the hazard is that a patient receives the wrong blood type. Figure 4 shows the minimal cuts sets that might allow this hazard to occur.)</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Technology support for simulating scenarios based on the process models, plus specifications of the resources and constraints on their utilization, and information about the distribution of the expected inputs and individual events in the model. Model checking technology is used to verify the consistency of the resource constraints. The effectiveness of this approach has been demonstrated using the Little-JIL process model for an emergency room. Although there are many systems that support simulation, the Little-JIL simulator is based upon a detailed Little-JIL model of the process; our studies have shown that it provides more accurate predictions and is easier to introduce and evaluate alternative process and resource models.&nbsp; (Figure 5 shows output from a battery of simulations of an emergency department under two different patient scheduling priorities.)</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Technology for automatically generating requirements for selected components of an overall complex system so that the overall system requirements are guaranteed to be maintained. Thus, for example, if a new medical device is being considered for a medical procedure, the requirements that that device should adhere to can be determined based on the process that will be using it; alternatively, the requirements for the process can be determined based on the specified behavior of a set of devices employed by a medical procedure. These requirements could then be subsequently monitored to detect and report violations if they occur. </li> </ul> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The technology mentioned above, plus technology developed on previous NSF grants to support process modeling and analysis, provide a framework for continuous process improvement. A detailed process model can be defined, carefully analyzed for potential sequence errors using model checking and then evaluated using fault tree analysis (FTA) and failure modes and effect analysis (FMEA) to discover vulnerabilities. Proposed process improvements to address discovered errors and vulnerabilities, detected by these techniques or during the execution of an actual process, can be easily evaluated to assure that the modified process definition addresses these problems and does not introduce new problems, before the modifications are actually incorporated into the real-world process. &nbsp;(Figure 6 provides a high-level overview of the framework.) <br /> <br /></p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 01/31/2017<br>      Modified by: Lori&nbsp;A&nbsp;Clarke</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div
