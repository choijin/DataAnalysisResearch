<AbstractNarration>This grant provides funding for the development of experimental and theoretical approaches to determine the extent to which monomer eluting from the inside of hollow nano-tubes reduces stresses generated during polymerization.  During polymerization (curing of polymer), a process during which a liquid monomer becomes a solid, the individual monomer units become more densely packed, and the material takes up less volume.  When this decrease in volume is prevented because of constraints at the boundaries of the part, it causes the polymer chains to exert stresses.  These stresses can cause the polymerized material to debond or induce failure of the part.  Experiments and modeling will be performed to evaluate the extent to which this curing stress is reduced with the addition of nano-tubes.  Nano-tubes of varying dimensions will be manufactured, blended with two different monomers in different volume fractions, and tests will be performed to determine the extent of reduction in polymerization stress.  Experiments will also be performed to determine the extent to which mechanical properties are affected by the use of monomer filled nano-tubes.  Modeling will be conducted to understand the underlying physics in order to optimize nano-tube dimensions and volume fractions to generate a maximum reduction in polymerization stress.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the results of this research will lead to improvements in the integrity of polymer-matrix and other composites while enabling their high speed manufacture.  The primary goal of this work is to determine how nano-tubes of different dimensions added in varying volumes to neat resin contributes towards a reduction in polymerization stress.  A reduction in polymerization stress can lead to improved dental fillings, and rapid manufacture of glass-fiber epoxy layups, among other applications.  Computational tools will also be developed to enable modeling the development of polymerization stress and the extent to which it can be reduced by the addition of nano-tubes.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ We evaluated the manufacture and use of hollow nano-tubes to reduce polymerization or residual stresses within materials.  These stresses are responsible for early failure of components.  In dental composites, these stresses are responsible for separation of the dental composite from the tooth surface.  Means to reduce these stresses would enable an increase in the lifetime of the dental composite.  We developed an inexpensive process to manufacture silica fibers with various microstructures within the fibers, incuding hollow fibers that were subsequently ground to obtain nano-tubes.  We thoroughly characterized the process for manufacture of the fibers, termed centrifual jet spinning, leading to an understanding of the parameters that influence the development of microstructure within the fibers.  Using these hollow nano-tubes in photo-polymerizing dental composites, we were able to demonstrate a significant reduction in polymerization stresses, without affecting the mechanical behavior of the dental composites.  Parameters that influenced the reduction in polymerization stresses (or shrinkage stresses), such as the rate of polymerization within and outside the hollow region of the fiber, estimated size, shape and amount of porosity within the fiber before and after polymerization, and constraints on the boundaries of the fibers were related to the amount of reduction in polymerization stresses.  We were also able to demonstrate that using these to manufacture epoxy based polymer composites enabled us to reduce thermal induced residual stresses.
