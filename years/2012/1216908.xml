<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project will investigate an ultra-wideband tunable radio frequency filter for use as a universal channel selection filter to maximize spectrum utilization.  The research during Phase I will focus on high fidelity modeling of a tunable phase shifter design to provide high linearity, low insertion loss and efficient power utilization.  It will also focus on circuit design for continuously tunable cancellation of distortion to fabrication of the circuit in CMOS in a design that will provide linear operation at input high power, independent of signal modulation, coding or channel frequency.  The goal is design of a circuit that can be miniaturized for integration in hand held devices of all types to provide continuously tunable reception initially from 700 MHz to 3 GHz, and with a channel bandwidth tunable to 20 MHz and more to support current and pending, as well as legacy, wireless communications standards.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is it will maximize the carrying capacity of the wireless spectrum, enabling its efficient utilization at frequencies from White Space to WiFi.  In addition to benefitting consumer communications, it will also benefit research and technical education, as well as biomedical care by providing continuously tunable RF filters for such instruments.  Continuously tunable center frequency will allow smart phones and other software defined radios to use any frequency, by contrast with the limited channel selection provided by the switched filter banks in use today.  The distortion cancellation capability will enable linear operation at high input power, such as in receiving OFDM signals from a nearby tower, preventing dropped calls and increasing quality of service.   The net result will be to maximize simultaneous users and increase their quality of service while reducing the size, weight and complexity of handheld devices and increasing their reliability, helping the industry meet consumer expectations and aiding continuing growth of wireless industry, which shipped over 500 million smart phones in 2011.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This research project focused on development of a universal channel selection filter to replace the rapidly proliferating switched banks of off-chip fixed frequency filter used in Smartphones.  The goal was to provide technology helping meet the stated national priority of increased spectrum efficiency with funding under the Enhanced Access to RF Spectrum (EARS) program.  During the course of this research, we investigated a new class of ultra-wideband tunable interference-delay effect (SLIDE) filters.  The project entailed assemblage and testing of a proof of concept device using discrete components.  It also entailed design, fabrication and testing of a CMOS prototype.  Both the assemblages and the CMOS prototype demonstrated continuous tuning from 700 MHz to 3 GHz.  A discrete component assemblage was also used in saturating two-tone tests, which demonstrated that the SLIDE topology cancels inter-modulation products by &gt;&gt;50 dB at all test frequencies between 700 MHz and 3 GHz.  Research also considered some fixed frequency topologies that could be integrated front-end chips as alternatives to the off-chip filters in use today in certain applications such as GPS reception.  Finally, the effort investigated enhancements to the CMOS prototype to reduce die size and enhance linearity and power consumption, which enhancements will be implemented in Phase 2.   The intellectual contribution of this project is the validation of a new class of filters that provide ultra-wideband tuning while also mitigating in-band interference.  As first demonstration of this ultra-wideband tunable technology, this project opens up an area for fruitful basic and applied research to enhance and commercialize this technology.     The contribution to broader, societal objectives include enabling consumer wireless devices that can access any permitted frequency while reducing size, complexity and cost.  An additional, both intellectual and broader, benefit is the use of a portion the SLIDE topology as an ultra-wideband tunable, wideband anti-jamming filter that has demonstrated &gt;40 dB rejection of severe wideband interference of GPS reception.  In addition to enhancing civil and consumer navigation, this will provide protection of critical GPS-dependent segments national infrastructure, e.g. the national grid and aviation, against intentional or inadvertent interference.  It can also be adapted to reject such interference in wireless communication from White Space to Wi-Fi and beyond, improving reliability and signal quality for users.
