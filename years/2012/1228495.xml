<AbstractNarration>This project will measure the transport of reactive chemical species into the tropical Tropopause Transition Layer (TTL) over the Western Pacific warm pool region during boreal winter when tropospheric air masses in this region are preferentially transported into the lower stratosphere. The sources, chemical evolution, and transport of trace gases and their degradation products in this region can substantially impact the chemistry of the lower stratosphere but, to date, relatively few measurements have been made and, consequently, our understanding of and ability to predict the associated processes and feedbacks are uncertain. The extremely low ozone concentrations measured with ozonesondes are expected to result in very low levels of OH radicals and, thus, longer lifetimes for reactive gases whose primary sinks are oxidation pathways involving OH. The simultaneous occurrence of deep convection and prolonged lifetime of organic compounds in the TTL can significantly impact the stratospheric halogen budget. Because the chemical and radiative properties of this region are key factors in the mechanisms that link atmospheric composition and climate forcing, the CONTRAST experiment will provide measurements necessary to diagnose, constrain, and improve chemistry-climate models. A suite of gases, particles, and meteorological parameters will be measured in situ from the NSF GV aircraft and interpreted to elucidate the roles of active convection and long-range transport on the vertically resolved chemical composition of the tropical atmosphere particularly in the altitude region that dominates convective outflow (12-14 km). Moreover, CONTRAST will be scheduled and coordinated in collaboration with two other airborne studies planned for the same time and geographic location:  The NASA EV1 project ATTREX (Airborne Tropical Tropopause Experiment) and the European CAST (Coordinated Airborne Studies in the Tropics). With complementary instrument payloads, coordinated flights of the GV, the NASA Global Hawk, and the UK Bae146 will provide an unprecedented examination of the full atmospheric column, from surface to &gt;19 km, over the tropical western Pacific Ocean.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The unique suite of benchmark measurements under the auspices of CONTRAST will improve fundamental understanding of convective transport processes in the tropics and our ability to model the role of deep convection in chemistry-climate interactions. The project will train students in atmospheric chemistry who are directly involved in the deployment and subsequent data analysis and modeling activities. Broader education and outreach activities will be developed using web-based tools and media.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This award consisted of seed funding to develop a field campaign to measure the atmospherc composition in the tropical Western Pacific.  This region is of great interest because compounds produced by ocean biology are released to the atmosphere.  These compounds contain chlorine, bromine, and iodine molecules that can have potentially important implications for the global atmosphere.  The seed funding resulted in the formulation of the CONvective TRansport of Active Species in the Tropics (CONTRAST) field campaign, which will take place in Guam during Jan and Feb 2014.  The most extensive deep clouds in EarthÆs climate system develop in the Tropical Western Pacific (TWP) during NH winter. These clouds pack sufficient energy that, on occasion, they  punch through the boundary that separates the lowest atmospheric layer  (the troposphere) from the overlying stratosphere. As Earth warms, the  intensity of tropical convection will increase. The TWP is the nexus  between global warming and large-scale changes in atmospheric  composition.  Tropical convection rapidly transports air from just  above the ocean surface to high altitudes. Scientists have long been  interested in the vertical lofting of atmospheric gases produced by  ocean organisms and the chemical fate of these compounds as they  decompose in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere. Convection  together with chemical processing in the TWP controls the composition of  the sub-tropical global troposphere as well as air that enters the  lower stratosphere.  CONTRAST will quantify how convection redistributes atmospheric gases in the  tropical atmosphere. Observations will be obtained by the NSF/NCAR  Gulfstream-V (GV) aircraft from a deployment in Guam during Jan and Feb  2014.
