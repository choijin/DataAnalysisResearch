<AbstractNarration>The principal investigator will work on five mathematics research projects in the general area of `Lie Theory and Geometry.' The first project concerns a solution of the celebrated Valiant's conjecture in Geometric Complexity Theory asserting that if the permanent of a square matrix of size n can be realized as a linear projection of the determinant of a square matrix of smallest size m, then the function m grows faster than any polynomial in n. The second project is aimed at solving a conjecture of Hitchin on the nonvanishing of primitive adjoint invariant forms restricted to certain subspaces of a semisimple Lie algebra.  This has interesting implications on the geometry of the moduli spaces of semistable principal bundles on smooth projective curves. The third project (jointly with E. Feigin from Russia and P. Littelmann from Germany) aims at studying the graded character of any finite-dimensional irreducible representation (more generally of a Demazure module) of a semisimple Lie algebra. The aim of the fourth project is to study the saturated tensor cone for symmetrizable Kac-Moody Lie algebras. This project is an extension of an earlier project for the semisimple Lie algebras completed by the PI jointly with P. Belkale. The fifth project concerns the completion of a graduate textbook on ``Verlinde formula, its complete proof and consequences." The proof of the Verlinde formula (which was initially conjecturally given by the mathematical physicist E. Verlinde) as well as various applications are scattered through the literature and there is no single source containing these; such a book fill a void in the existing literature.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This mathematics research project brings together several areas of mathematics including Topology, Combinatorics, Algebraic Geometry and Representation Theory, and is expected to have significant consequences in Mathematics and in Computer Science. More specifically, the first project on the Valiant's conjecture in Geometric Complexity Theory has significant implications towards a major unsolved problem in Theoretical Computer Science commonly referred to as Cook's ``P versus NP" problem. Informally, it asks whether every problem whose solution can be quickly verified by a computer can also be quickly solved by a computer; it is considered to be one the most important open problems in the field. In addition, it is expected that the solution will spawn a lot of activity in the area. Two books authored by the principal investigator (one of these coauthored with M. Brion from France) have become standard texts on the subject. The PI is working towards the completion of a new graduate textbook on ``Verlinde formula, its complete proof and consequences." This would be the very first book on the subject; it is expected that it will serve as a basic source for graduate students and professional mathematicians and mathematical physicists alike thus substantially promoting teaching and learning. The PI has successfully supervised six Ph.D. students and one Master's student; he is currently supervising two Ph.D. students. He has coorganized several prestigious international conferences in Germany and USA. In addition, he is coorganizing an interdisciplinary summer school in Utah aimed mainly at Ph.D. students and postdoctoral fellows in Mathematics and Computer Science.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The PI Kumar's research lies in geometry, which is a central area of modern mathematics.  Geometers study many different geometric spaces.  Some simple examples of these spaces are curves like circles or parabolas, and surfaces in three-dimensional space, such as spheres or tori (colloquially known as donuts).  However, as is the case in Kumar's research, more complicated spaces are also studied, many of which are four, five, or even infinite-dimensional.       Because such spaces can be very difficult to visualize, mathematicians have developed a number of techniques to help understand them.  The most relevant technique to Kumar's research is to associate to each space an algebraic structure a context within which addition and multiplication can be performed, and therefore a context in which certain equations can be solved.       Algebraic structures can be studied from a purely algebraic viewpoint, and understanding the algebraic structure associated to a space allows greater understanding of the geometry of the space.  For example, consider a circle and a figure-eight.  These spaces are different as the circle has only one hole while the figure-eight has two holes.  The number of holes in a space is a simple example of a property that is encoded in the algebraic structures associated to these spaces.  However, many deeper and more subtle geometric properties are also encoded in the algebraic structures.  Moreover, for very complicated spaces, such as infinite-dimensional spaces, it is often easier to compute the algebraic structure associated to the space than to visualize the space itself.       I am studying a family of geometric spaces called flag varieties of Kac-Moody groups.  These spaces are ubiquitous throughout modern mathematics because they lie at the intersection of several central areas of mathematics including algebraic geometry, representation theory, and combinatorics.  They are spaces which can be quite complicated and are often infinite-dimensional but can be better understood by studying two related algebraic structures called the T-equivariant cohomology and the T-equivariant K-group.  In both of these algebraic structures, the operation of addition is simple, but the operation of multiplication, in contrast, is complicated and not well understood.  One of my primary goals is to better understand the multiplication within these algebraic structures.       The multiplication in the T-equivariant cohomology and T-equivariant K-group is determined by certain polynomials called the structure constants.  I have been studying these structure constants both by working to determine certain theoretical properties that they must satisfy as well as performing explicit computations to determine the exact structure constants in some common examples.  More specifically, it has been known for some time that the structure constants in the T-equivariant cohomology exhibit a positivity property as proved by Kumar-Nori and Graham.  A similar property in the finite dimensional case was proved by Brion (2001) and  Anderson-Griffeth-Miller (2008) for T-equivariant K-group.  It was extended by Kumar (the PI) and Baldwin-Kumar in the infinite dimensional case. This is one of the major achievements of this NSF grant of Kumar.   This work facilitated a breakthrough in studying the saturated tensor cone for symmetrizable Kac-Moody Lie algebras (a certain important class of infinite dimensional Lie algebras) by Kumar jointly with his Ph.D. student Merrick Brown.      In another direction, Kumar has completed writing a substantial part of a book on `Conformal Blocks, Generalized Theta Functions and Verlinde Formula' This will be the very first book on the subject. This has been a long term (spanning several years) project, which is nearing completion soon.   The Verlinde dimension formula attracted considerable  attention from mathematicians and physicists when it was realized that the space of conformal blocks admits an interpretation as the space of generalized theta functions. The theory has undergone tremendous developments in various directions and connections with diverse areas abound. The Verlinde formula and the ideas behind its proof have found numerous applications, e.g.,  in the theory of moduli space of vector bundles on curves, multiplicative eigenvalue problem, rank-level duality (just to name a few). The works leading to the Verlinde dimension formula and connection between conformal blocks and generalized theta functions as well as various applications are scattered through  the literature and   there is no single source containing various developments in and around the Verlinde formula explaining both of its aspects: the space of conformal blocks and the space of generalized theta functions, with details of proofs.   This book seeks to  fill this big void in the literature.            Last Modified: 06/07/2017       Submitted by: Shrawan Kumar]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
