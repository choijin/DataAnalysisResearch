<AbstractNarration>The dramatic growth of wireless sensor networks (WSNs) in the last few years has seen the emergence of a variety of applications and pilot deployments that span scientific, engineering, medical and other&lt;br/&gt;disciplines. This project addresses an important research problem in sensor networks: energy management. By using hierarchical WSNs with different resources at different proxy and sensor tiers, as well as novel machine learning methods, we plan to develop DURACEM, a data-driven uncertainty-guided architecture that addresses energy efficiency across many sensor network services in a unified manner. Our architecture is built around (a) prediction models of phenomena, energy usage, and communication and the uncertainty in these models, (b) a slew of services that can exploit the uncertainty measures to save energy and&lt;br/&gt;(c) an overall energy optimization framework that combines the different models and services at both the proxy and sensor tiers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;DURACEM has the potential for broad social impact. Our proposed research will provide fundamental services and tools to build next generation hierarchical sensor networks. DURACEM will provide a suite of efficient&lt;br/&gt;prediction models, as well as a variety of energy-optimized services built over these models. Our source code for our tools, libraries and prototypes will be made available to other researchers via an open-source software license. The project also focuses on building an inter-disciplinary teaching lab that can spur adoption of sensor networks by educating students across engineering and sciences. The project includes the development of a comprehensive curriculum that provides graduate and undergraduate students with core systems and analytical skills in sensor networks. The DURACEM project will enhance the research experiences of minority groups at University of California, Merced (UCM), which is one of only few research universities in the nation with a Hispanic student population greater than 40% and it is considered a Hispanic Serving Institution. The project includes an outreach undergraduate component specifically targeted to the minority&lt;br/&gt;students.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

Throughout the project, we have developed all the components of the DURACEM architecture, working on multiple real application domains, from wireless communication and solar prediction systems, to HVAC building and irrigation control.  Overall, as part of the project, we have developed the following:   Wireless link simulation models for low-power transceivers. Model adaptation techniques applied to the wireless medium and occupancy models. Solar Irradiance hardware and models for solar prediction and forecasting. Occupancy sensors (hardware and software) to be deployed in buildings. Human-in-the-loop quality of comfort mobile apps for buildings. Multiple types of HVAC building control algorithms, from gray-box data-driven thermodynamical models to pure black-box data-driven models (RL). A full system was implemented to take over HVAC building control, interfacing with the building sensors through the BACNet protocol (the industry standard), and providing full visibility to current Building Management Systems (BMSs) installed on campus. Multiple models for model-based irrigation control, including a novel hydrodynamical model built from first principles to fully data-driven approaches for model construction. Multiple schemes for irrigation control, including fully decentralized actuation at the sprinkler head level, with different schemes for control, from centralized optimization to fully distributed control. A campus water irrigation testbed to perform irrigation research.     We have also been extremely successful in publishing our work in the top publications venues, including 6 Transaction of Sensor Networks (TOSN) papers, 15 peer-reviewed conference papers mostly in top venues (2 SenSys, 5 IPSN, 1 Infocom, 1 Ubicomp, 5 BuildSys), 6 peer-reviewed poster abstracts, and 1 demo abstract.
