<AbstractNarration>The American Institute of Mathematics (AIM) will conduct a series of three annual Research Experiences for Undergraduate Faculty (REUF) workshops during the summers of 2013, 2014, and 2015, and additional activities for participants afterwards to support continuation of research engagement sparked by the workshop.  At each REUF workshop four senior mathematicians (leaders) who have experience doing research with undergraduate students will present problems in a variety of areas, after which the participants and leaders will divide into groups and work on the problems; the workshop will conclude with group presentations of each project. Most of the time will be spent doing mathematics, but there will also be whole group discussions about topics such as best practices in undergraduate research led by the organizers. Since numerical experiments and computational investigations are crucial to much of the research done with undergraduates, the workshop will also include instruction in using the free open-source mathematics software Sage.  AIM directors will facilitate the management of the workshop, and participants will receive full funding.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The REUF workshop and ongoing activities will provide faculty participants whose undergraduate institutions have limited research activity with a research experience investigating open questions in the mathematical sciences and equip them to engage in research with undergraduate students at their home institutions.  In addition, some participants will become involved in long-term research collaborations with other faculty at the workshop.  The recruitment efforts for REUF will particularly focus on faculty at minority-serving institutions as well as underrepresented minority faculty at undergraduate colleges. The REUF project will lead to more and better undergraduate research experiences for students of the faculty participants, and greater engagement in mathematical research by the faculty participants, thus expanding and diversifying the mathematical workforce.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Research Experiences for Undergraduate Faculty  Outcomes Report for NSF DMS 1239280  The American Institute of Mathematics (AIM), in partnership with the Institute for Computational and Experimental Research in Mathematics (ICERM), conducted annual Research Experiences for Undergraduate Faculty (REUF) workshops during the summers of 2013, 2014, and 2015, and additional activities for participants afterwards to support continuation of research engagement sparked by the workshop.  By supporting the involvement of undergraduate faculty in research in the mathematical sciences with undergraduates, the REUF workshops have an immediate impact on these faculty and their students.  Many of the faculty participants spread the culture of undergraduate research throughout their departments, thereby having a long term on their colleges and universities and many future students.  At each REUF workshop four senior mathematicians (leaders) who have experience doing research with undergraduate students present problems in a variety of areas, after which the participants and leaders divide into groups and work on the problems; the workshop concludes with group presentations of each project. Most of the time is spent doing mathematics, but there are also whole group discussions about topics such as best practices in undergraduate research led by the organizers. Since numerical experiments and computational investigations are crucial to much of the research done with undergraduates, the workshops also include instruction in using the free open-source mathematics software Sage. AIM and ICERM directors facilitate the management of the workshop, and participants receive full funding.   More information about REUF can be found on the REUF website, http://reuf.aimath.org/.  Some of the research projects involve mathematics with significant practical applications, such as modeling of diseases such as river blindness and cancer, where better mathematical understanding of the biological process can lead to more effective treatments, and power domination of graphs, which is used to determine placement of monitoring units in electrical networks to minimize costs.  Specific outcomes of the REUF workshops since 2008 that involve participating undergraduate faculty include:  250 undergraduate research students mentored  159 student research presentations 21 honors/senior theses supervised  6 publications with student (co-)authors (3 from this grant) 28 grants for faculty-student collaboration 23 faculty publications based on REUF research (10 from this grant) 35 faculty presentations based on REUF research   Other notable outcomes:  Special sessions at the Joint Mathematics Meetings      organized by REUF alumni  Development of      new undergraduate courses on REUF research topics  Departmental      changes such as the creation of a for-credit undergraduate research      seminar for math majors  During 2015-2016 AIM and      ICERM also provided advice to Duke University about the REUF program to      assist with the development of the REUF on the Mathematics of Data held in      July 2016.
