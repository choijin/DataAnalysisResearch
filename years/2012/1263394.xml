<AbstractNarration>The REU site at the University of Utah is designed to create a unique and effective research environment for 10-weeks during the summer for 8 students that are selected from around the country. The University of Utah  Department of Physics and Astronomy currently offers a wide variety of research programs in which undergraduates are making significant contributions. The research opportunities within the REU program are numerous and can range from theoretical modeling to experimental work.   For the REU student participants, this program has six specific goals: 1) acquiring research tools, 2) hands on research experience, 3) scientific social networking and activities, 4) fostering diversity through mentorship, 5) developing writing and presentation skills. 6) exploring future directions.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The REU program continued the unique and effective research environment for 10-weeks during each summer for 8 students that were selected from around the country. The U of U Department of Physics and Astronomy currently offers a wide variety of research programs in which undergraduates are making significant contributions. During the REU program students were trained to:  Build excellent research skills, which will serve as a foundation for future interest in continuing education and/or industry careers; Created a unified REU program in the department of Physics and Astronomy that covers all research areas currently not supported by external REU funds;  Increased female and minority student participation in research and established the department as a fostering environment for female and minority students; and  Established a strong cohort environment among students.   During the our funding cycle, more than half of our participants have been female and more than half have come from colleges and universities with limited research opportunities. This REU proposal acted as a central element in our efforts to advertise and recruit students from colleges and universities with limited research opportunities along with female and minority students for research by:  Incorporating female and minority students in research while providing mentoring from female faculty to establish research as a possible fun career in their future. Providing research  opportunities for students from institutions with limited research activity. Establishing the University of Utah as a creative place for pursuing a professional degree in physics and astronomy.    Our REU students have indicated a strong desire to continue into PhD programs in Physics and Astronomy.          Last Modified: 07/31/2016       Submitted by: Saveez Saffarian]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
