<AbstractNarration>1264705(Vogel). Rapid and sensitive detection of bovine respiratory disease (BRD)-associated viral infections in live animals is recognized as key to minimizing the impact of this disease. Currently, the most common method of serological diagnosis is fluorescently labeled ELISAs. ELISA-based testing is limited as it typically relies on the detection of a single viral antibody subtype within an individual test sample per ELISA plate, the testing is relatively slow (up to 1 week) and expensive (~$5 per test). A low-cost multiplexed platform capable of detecting several antibody markers related to BRD infections in the same test assay would offer significant economic benefits for routine serological testing. Additionally, rapid on-farm ?cowside? multiplexed diagnostic capabilities would be a major step forward towards more efficient and effective management, control and/or eradication of BRD-associated pathogens. At present there is no electronic field based test for disease diagnostics available commercially for the animal health sector, let alone for BRD.  Our team will address these challenges by building inexpensive electrochemical sensors for detection of biomarkers associated with BRD infection.</AbstractNarration>
