<AbstractNarration>Collaborative Research: Defining controls on incisional avulsions in alluvial basins&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;River avulsion occurs when water is diverted out of a river and creates a new channel on the surrounding floodplain. The associated flooding can be catastrophic for people living along rivers, but hazard mitigation is difficult because models cannot predict the timing, location, or style of river avulsion.  Incisional avulsion occurs when a new river channel is established through erosion rather than deposition, and, although it is common in some river systems, this avulsion style is particularly poorly understood. The goal of this study is to define the sedimentologic and hydrodynamic conditions associated with incisional avulsions. Using combined modeling and field approaches the PIs will evaluate how characteristics such as floodplain topography, slope, ground cover, and overbank deposition control avulsion styles and test the hypothesis that incisional avulsions occur in steep fluvial systems with topographically rough, unvegetated, well-drained floodplains that lack abundant overbank suspended-sediment supply. Modeling work will be conducted with Delft3D, a physics-based numerical model that solves the equations for water flow and sediment transport, and field-data collection will focus on ancient strata where channel and floodplain characteristics can be measured for large numbers of paleoavulsion deposits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results from this project will help improve prediction of avulsion flood hazards and will enhance understanding of the relationships between channel avulsion and floodplain erosion and deposition. Avulsion is also a primary control on the distribution of fluvial hydrocarbon, groundwater, and CO2-storage reservoirs. Better understanding of avulsion processes gained through this research will aid subsurface predictions of reservoir quality and location. Broader impacts of this work also include development of a self-paced, web-based education module about rivers and avulsions. In collaboration with the Geoscience Outreach Foundation the PIs will design a Rivers from Above curriculum comprising guided tours of rivers and avulsions using Google Earth and Google Maps. Rivers from Above will focus on river forms and patterns, river avulsion, and avulsion impacts on society. The PIs will work with the outreach offices at Penn State and Boston College to develop, pilot test, and evaluate module activities in Pittsburgh- and Boston-area schools, targeting underserved communities in each region. Finally, this proposal will also support the education and training of several graduate and undergraduate students and the early careers of two junior faculty members.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Rivers are dynamic features that move, twist, and wiggle as they carry water and sediment from mountains to the coast.  Possibly the most dramatic river movement is the avulsion, which is the wholesale abandonment of the present river in favor of a new location on the adjacent floodplain (Figure 1).  Understanding this process is critical because of the widespread flooding produced by avulsions. For example, the Yellow River in China has avulsed twelve times in the last 200 years creating hazards for the surrounding population.  But avulsion flooding also deposits huge volumes of sediment that create good reservoirs for oil and natural gas, fertile floodplains, and over geologic time substantial parts of the stratigraphic record.  Improved understanding of avulsion processes will help to manage rivers and mitigate hazards, and also enhance our ability to interpret and predict fluvial stratigraphy for earth history, climate reconstructions, and subsurface resources.  Our understanding of river avulsions is limited because they occur infrequently&mdash;usually every 500 to 1000 years&mdash;making them hard to observe.  Currently there are two models for how avulsion channels move to new positions on the floodplain. Avulsion channels can prograde from the main channel across the floodplain, or they can incise directly into the floodplain. There are several well-documented cases of the progradational avulsion model, but our understanding of the incisional model still lags behind.  This project was designed to fill that gap by using coupled numerical and field-based study to identify the conditions that promote incisional avulsions.  We proposed that avulsion style is related to the tendency for floodwaters to erode or deposit sediment [Hajek and Edmonds, 2014]. We developed a scaling analysis of floodplain erosion and deposition rates, tested it with morphodynamic modeling, and showed that field data from ancient deposits are consistent with modeling results. These results demonstrate that floodplain morphodynamics may determine how rivers relocate and that assessing the relative influence of floodplain erosion and deposition may be useful for predicting sedimentation patterns in avulsive systems.  We also investigated the conditions that promote sediment transfer from the channel and deposition on the floodplain [Millard et al., in review].  We found that the right recipe to deposit sediment to the floodplain consists of small grains that are easy to move and deep, standing water that promotes settling and deposition of those small grains.  To test controls on avulsion style, we used remote sensing data. Avulsions occur infrequently making direct observations of avulsion style rare.  To overcome this, we created a novel dataset of avulsions on modern rivers that is unmatched in its breadth and number of observations [Edmonds et al., 2016].  Using Google Earth Engine, the new "big data" cloud-computing platform, to search through Landsat images from 1984-2014, we found 55 avulsions in the Andean and Himalayan foreland basins.  From these data we found robust scaling laws that describe how avulsions select new positions (see example in Figure 1).  The results clearly suggest this selection is bi-modal.  Roughly half of channels occur via progradation, whereas the other half occur via incision.   We also investigated the mechanics of how incisional avulsions work.  To do this we analyzed topography data from floodplains on rivers in Indiana.  The topography show that floodplains contain a startling number of channels that could serve as pathways for avulsion.  Through detailed mapping [David et al., 2016] and numerical experiments [David et al., 2016; Nijhuis et al., 2015] we found out that these floodplain channels form from headcuts that migrate upstream and connect together pre-existing meander bends (Figure 2).  This suggests to us that incisional avulsions may be tightly linked to the tendency of floodplains to initiate headcut erosion.      Whether or not rivers avulse by incision or progradation influences the evolution of river systems.  In particular, anabranching rivers, which are defined as a system of multiple channels that carry water and are separated by vegetated or otherwise stable alluvial islands, are thought to be related to avulsion.  We show instead that anabranching rivers initiate from an instability between the alluvial bed and water flow [Moron et al., 2017], which is similar to the process observed in braided streams.  Though once anabranching is established channels tend to avulse by progradation suggesting that the incisional style is not relevant, and placing further constraints on the conditions under which anabranching rivers form [Moron et al., in review].  In summary, this project has demonstrated that river channel avulsion can occur through progradation or incision.  Both styles are equally common in the modern and ancient record.  Incisional avulsions occur in river system that are steep sloped and have relatively coarse-grained sediment.  One possible mechanism for establishing incisional channel is headcut erosion that connects together pre-existing topographic lows.  Together these results have more firmly established how avulsions work.             Last Modified: 12/22/2016       Submitted by: Doug Edmonds]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
