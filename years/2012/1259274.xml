<AbstractNarration>Funds are provided for the project that aims to improve quantification of long-term particulate organic carbon (POC) decomposition in marine sediments. The PI will conduct a global survey of POC data collected by DSDP, ODP, and IODP to test models relating sediment age and temperature to POC decomposition rates, which will be averaged separately for different environments. Results will provide constraints on marine methanogenesis and the carbon cycle budget. The study hopes to advance understanding of the long-term organic carbon cycle, which plays a role in climate change. Two undergraduate students will be involved in the research, one of which will be recruited from a Consortium for Ocean Leadership program that targets underrepresented minorities.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Marine sediments buried at depths up to 1,000 m below the seafloor have been recently found to host an active biosphere of microorganisms that live in the pore water trapped between mineral grains.  The primary process that supports these microbes is the degradation of small amounts of solid organic carbon (plant and animal residues) that fall to the seafloor and are incorporated into sediments.  A major product of this degradation process is microbial methane, which forms vast amounts of gas hydrate (a solid compound of water and methane) within continental margin sediments worldwide.  Gas hydrates can dissociate when the climate warms, and the consequent release of methane, a greenhouse gas, can amplify the warming.  The process of organic carbon degradation in sediments is still poorly understood, limiting our ability to model its effects on the cycle of carbon burial in the oceans and to predict the size and distribution of the global gas hydrate reservoir during past and future climate change.  The major goal of this project was to improve our understanding of the process of microbial degradation of organic carbon in continental margin sediments.  To this end, we assembled data collected during more than 40 years of NSF-supported scientific ocean drilling in 419 drill sites: organic carbon content of sediment sampled at various depths below the seafloor, sediment ages, and sediment temperatures.  These data were then analyzed to characterize the variation in organic carbon content with age and burial temperature.  The degradation process turns solid organic matter is into soluble compounds that dissolve in the sediment pore water; hence, degradation lowers the amount of solid organic carbon within sediment.  We found that the average amount of organic carbon in continental margin sediments decreases from about 1.3% of total sediment mass to a nearly constant value of about 0.6% at ages of 5-10 million years.  This progressive decrease suggests that the degradation of organic matter continues over several millions of years and confirms it is a long-term source of energy for the deep biosphere.  We also compared data in two sets of drill sites that experienced either relatively low or high temperatures during burial, and found different average organic carbon contents at ages of 5-10 million years: 0.4% in the high-temperature sites and 0.77%, almost twice as much, in the low-temperature sites.  The markedly lower organic carbon content in sediments that experienced higher temperatures suggests that temperature is an important control on the extent of organic matter degradation.  The results of this project provide key information to quantify the amount of carbon buried within marine sediments over geologic time and to determine the rates at which organic carbon is degraded and methane generated by microbial activity.  To broaden participation in science and engineering with a professional development opportunity, the project involved an undergraduate student from an underrepresented minority (Ernesto A. Martinez). The student fully participated to the project by working on data collection and analysis using state-of-the art computer programming, presented results at a major scientific conference (the 2013 Fall meeting of the American Geophysical Union), and co-authored the final paper that summarized the results.  Support for the student was provided by this project and by an internship program funded by the Council of Ocean Leadership.
