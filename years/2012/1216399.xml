<AbstractNarration>The proposed project aims to determine how social conditions for Alaska Natives living in small arctic communities have changed since 2000, and differ among communities and small regions. The Census Long Form Survey historically provided much of the data for measuring social and economic conditions in the U.S. Its replacement with the American Community Survey (ACS) after the 2000 Census has raised serious concerns about whether Census data continue to provide accurate measures of well-being in rural Alaska communities, at a time when the region faces unprecedented environmental and socio-economic change. The project addresses the uncertainty with ACS data by developing a new set of social, economic, and cultural indicators with increased capability to detect differences at local scales.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specific objectives include: (1) systematically examine the reliability of ACS data for rural Alaska by disaggregating published margins of error into components expressing dispersion across communities, years, and individuals; (2) construct socio-economic indicators for rural Alaska communities and regions with substantially smaller margins of error than published results; (3) estimate key indicators for communities where observations are sparse or missing entirely; and (4) test whether communities and regions have changed or differ significantly with respect to one or more indicators. The project pursues these objectives through modeling and statistical analyses of multiple primary data sources, including individual interview data from the ACS and the previous censuses in cooperation with the U.S. Census Bureau. Project outputs include a set of socio-economic indicators with improved reliability over published ACS figures that can help state and local governments and non-governmental organizations allocate funds, plan, and evaluate social service and economic development programs. A pioneering application of data assimilation with a social system model aids arctic social observing system design by revealing highest priority targets for new data collection for observing and understanding social change in arctic communities.</AbstractNarration>

Investigation of the data also uncovered two significant sources of error not included in published error margins, which just address error due to sampling. The most significant deficiency arises from the Census Bureau decision to not request or record information in the survey on income of children under age 15. This policy may have minimal consequences in most states, but  it has caused substantial underreporting of income in Alaska, where nearly all children receive PFDs, and thousands of Alaska Native children also receive dividends from several Alaska Native Regional Corporations that enrolled descendants of original beneficiaries. Project research determined that underreporting of PFD income in the ACS results in underreporting of the number of Alaskans with incomes below the federal poverty threshold by 10-15 percent. Another source of non-sampling error derives from miscoding previous state of residence for interstate migrants. Project research determined that the coding error led to over-estimation of out-migration from Alaska by about 40,000 people annually for many years.

The SIRAC project investigated these concerns as it used ACS data to determine how social and economic conditions for rural Alaska Native communities have changed since 2000. Specific project objectives included:   Understanding  sources of the high published margins of error in ACS estimates for  key indicators for rural Alaska communities;   Constructing  experimental new estimates of the census socioeconomic indicators  for rural Alaska communities with substantially smaller margins of  error than published results;   Providing  new community-level estimates of key indicators where observations  in the ACS are sparse or missing entirely;   Testing  hypotheses about social and economic conditions in rural Alaska  communities since 2000.   To achieve these objectives, project researchers worked with the Census Bureau?s Center for Economic Studies to access individual ACS and Census records at the University of Southern California Census Research Data Center.
