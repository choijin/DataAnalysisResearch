<AbstractNarration>The research objective of this Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) Program award is to apply observability methods and reachability analysis and controller synthesis from hybrid control theory to the analysis and design of human-automation systems.  Methods and tools will be created to validate and design collaborative hybrid systems.  A formal framework will be developed that incorporates both qualitative human factors guidelines for user-centered design, and mathematical models of human input and user interfaces, into a mathematically rigorous framework for collaborative hybrid systems.  This research specifically addresses: 1) prioritized, dynamics-driven user-interface design, 2) collaborative control synthesis, 3) verification of safety with a human in the loop, and 4) customizable displays.  These techniques will be used to 1) assess information content in multi-modal user interfaces (modeled as output maps of hybrid systems), 2) identify regions in the state-space with potential for ?fighting? between the human and the automation, 3) associate state configurations with multiple levels of safety, and 4) assess efficacy of user-interfaces under imperfect information that represent inaccurate mental models or various levels of user training.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the results of this research could help identify problems (such as automation surprises, fighting between the human operator and the automation, inadequate or excessive information contained in the user interface, and false or frequent alarms) in safety-critical, high-risk, or expensive collaborative systems before they are built, tested, and deployed.  The proposed research and education plan will contribute to the formal methods in human computer interaction community, and to the control theory communities focused on the design of decision support aids.  Developed theory, code, and data will be disseminated in a timely manner.  Graduate and undergraduate students will benefit through new and resigned courses that incorporate active learning techniques, as well as through mentoring and participation in the proposed research.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The main research outcomes of the award are the development of new mathematical theory and computational algorithms for human-automation systems.  The theory and algorithms developed help assure safety in dynamical systems, and help prevent human-automation interaction problems, at the design stage.     The primary intellectual merit of the completed research is the development of formal methods and tools for collaborative hybrid systems, that incorporate mathematical models of qualitative human factors guidelines for user-centered design, and enable mathematically rigorous assessments of safety in stochastic dynamical systems.  Some of the key outcomes are novel characterizations of set properties, which enable efficient computation of safety likelihoods for certain classes of dynamical systems.  Such mathematical characterization is important because it helps to assess safety, that is, the ability to maintain hard constraints (i.e., to prevent violation of an aircraft?s flight envelope, or to complete a satellite rendezvous and docking maneuver while remaining within a line-of-sight cone), despite uncertainty that is inevitable in any real-world dynamical system.  The result of this calculation is an assessment of the highest likelihood of safety possible from a given starting point, as well as the precise controller needed to achieve that safety likelihood.  While this computation is typically quite challenging, this research has made it simple and tractable for a common class of systems.  A Matlab toolbox, SReachTools, was developed to make these algorithms easily implementable.   Another key outcome is the design of new optimization-based algorithms to identify potential problems in user-interfaces for complex systems, which could otherwise be overwhelming due to the sheer volume of information that the human operator must process.  Most interface design methods are done ad-hoc, by designers who are unfamiliar with the physics of the underlying dynamical system.  In contrast, our method incorporates the human?s level of trust, constraints for situational awareness, and the underlying dynamics of the physical system, into the optimization problem, so that the elements identified by the optimization will, by construction, be inherently compatible with both human limitations as well as the physical system.  We have also developed optimization-based algorithms to detect mode confusion and other inconsistencies between the physical system and abstracted representations of the human?s mental model or the training manual for the system.  The goal of this method is to detect potential problems by identifying inconsistencies between these models at the design stage.  The main educational outcomes of the award are the re-development of an undergraduate controls course to incorporate active and collaborative learning techniques.  A novel collaborative assessment, in which students work in teams of three to solve a mini-engineering design problem, was shown to improve the ability of students to monitor their own as well as their peers? learning.  This skill is an important marker of student success.  A new method to characterize collaboration was also developed, based on analysis of eye-tracking data gathered while students completed the assessment.  As opposed to post-hoc characterizations, ones that rely upon self-assessment, our approach assesses the dynamics of shared gaze, to not only identify when students focus their conversation and gaze upon the same topic, but also identify implicit students roles, such as leadership, in the collaboration.   The research and education outcomes in this project support the broader impacts of the grant, by broadening participation of underrepresented minority students, disseminating results broadly, and improving reliability, trust, and safety in human-automation systems.  Graduate students from underrepresented groups completed MSc and PhD degrees as part of this project, and the collaborative, educational assessment for an undergraduate control theory course has been shown to help all students improve their learning skills.  Research results have been published in widely read, archival venues, presented at refereed conferences, and incorporated into invited presentations at several top academic institutions as well as at government labs.  In addition, the computational tools developed as part of this work are available on Github as well as on the PI?s lab webpage, featuring work from this project.  The research and education conducted as part of this project has contributed to a foundation of work to make human-automation interaction in complex, safety-critical systems reliable, trustworthy, and safe.
