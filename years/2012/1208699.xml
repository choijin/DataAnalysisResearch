<AbstractNarration>This action funds Tyler James Volkoff of University of California, Berkeley to conduct a research project, entitled "Numerical studies of static and dynamical properties of liquid helium in aperture arrays," during the summer of 2012 at Konkuk University in Seoul, South Korea.  The host scientist is Yongkyung Kwon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Intellectual Merit of the research project drives from the use of numerical simulation to analyze a dynamical phase transition in liquid helium when driven through an array of nanoscale apertures by an external driving force. A Monte Carlo algorithm is used to sample estimators of relevant thermodynamic quantities and an order parameter for the transition is derived and interpreted.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.   These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.</AbstractNarration>
