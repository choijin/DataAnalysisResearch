<AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CIF: Small: Fast In Vivo Optical Imaging in the Heavily and Weakly Scattering Regimes&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Kevin Webb, Purdue University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Optical imaging is important in medicine because it provides unique information about human health and an avenue for inexpensive and portable instruments for laboratory, clinical and home use. Within a deep-tissue optical diffusion tomography framework, it becomes possible to determine chemical and molecular information for blood chemistry monitoring and understanding diseases. The research on faster and more accurate deep-tissue imaging is a critical step in facilitating more widespread use of optics in medical research and for treatment. Another important challenge for in vivo optical imaging is access to the regime within a few millimeters of the skin, with application to skin cancer, for example. This research involves the development of a method that describes optical tissue properties on this near-surface length scale and hence provides a basis for imaging. Collectively, this work will be important in applications like the early detection of cancer, intra-operative imaging to ensure all tumor nodules are removed during surgery, and blood chemistry monitoring.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More specifically, various optical diffusion tomography modalities describing scatter and absorption, fluorescence, and fluorescence resonance energy transfer parameters are being developed. The approach avoids a background scattering emulsion, in which the subject is placed, by use of a laser body scan to define the geometry and an unstructured mesh forward model based on the diffusion equation. In this work, a multigrid method coupled to the unstructured mesh permits fast and accurate imaging. In the weakly scattering regime, an imaging method based on the Bethe-Salpeter equation that uses a rigorous field correlation over space and frequency is being developed.</AbstractNarration>
