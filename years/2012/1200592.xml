<AbstractNarration>The goal of this research is to investigate and develop discrete optimization algorithms for problems of clustering, pattern recognition, data mining and image processing. The research will address the theory and practice of such discrete optimization techniques, and will compare them to traditional approaches including variational models, spectral analysis, support vector machines and Principal Component Analysis. Algorithms will be implemented and their practical performance will be evaluated in applications of medical imaging; security detection; and image segmentation. The theoretical analysis will address the performance of algorithms for several clustering problems, which cannot be solved efficiently and optimally. For such known hard problems the performance will be evaluated in terms of how close the solutions attained are to the optimum, or the worst case error ratio.  Efficient implementations will be developed to solve quickly pattern recognition and clustering problems on a sequence of data-sets  that differ slightly from each other (e.g. for dynamically changing images, as in video).  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results of this research are expected to improve automated or semi-automated methodologies for pattern recognition, image segmentation, clustering and co-segmentation. The anticipated benefits include the reduction in cost and the frequency of human error in image analysis. In particular, automatic identification of unusual or pathological features is expected to improve diagnosis and reduce the cost of evaluating medical images by introducing accurate and fast automated procedures.  The high speed of the proposed methodologies will permit real time deployment and mayl contribute to speeding up the rate of research and development in health-care, biological sciences and homeland security applications.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  Under this award, the PI has developed combinatorial techniques that incorporate pairwise similarities and deliver high accuracy and effective delineation of clusters or patterns or objects in images. These algorithms proved effective in terms of accuracy as compared to known machine learning techniques.  The use of pairwise similarities brought for the fore several challenges. One challenge is how to utilize pairwise similarities and how to compute them, so as to achieve the most accurate outcomes in particular contexts and in general.   A second challenge is the complexity issue that arises when applying such techniques to large scale data sets- the number of pairwise similarities grows quadratically in the size of the data set.  The PI's teams developed specific metrics that are applicable in contexts of image segmentation; in detection of nuclear threats when only low resolution information is available; in spam detection; and in neural signals extraction.   The PI and her team developed the technique of "sparse-computation" and "sparse-reduced computation" which have proved dramatically effective in enabling the use of pairwise similarities even in massive scale data sets (up to 10 million objects).  The techniques enabled the use of pairwise similarities not only for the high accuracy combinatorial optimization methods developed by the PI, but also for other methods that are inhibited by the use of pairwise similarities. Those include the k-nearest neighbor algorithm, the Support Vector Machine with radial kernels method and the spectral algorithm.  In addition to theoretical and method developments, the PI's team implemented the data mining combinatorial algorithms, the sparse-computation, and the sparse-reduced computation methods.  We demonstrated, in theory and in practice, that these techniques are more efficient than existing techniques, and that the quality of segmentation and clustering is in general better than that of existing techniques.
