<AbstractNarration>This project organizes a speaker's series that will take place at the 3rd International Conference on Language Documentation and Conservation (ICLDC), to be held at the University of Hawai'i at Manoa (UHM) in late February of 2013. The speaker's series meets the need to share specific examples of exemplary interdisciplinary research in the field of language documentation with the conference attendees. Sometimes called "themed" documentation, this research approach exemplified by the speakers invites the layering of more than the one standard discipline within a given project. In this speaker's series, work in ethno-biology, spatial cognition, language acquisition and sociolinguistics are specifically addressed in relation to the documenting of endangered languages. As the speakers will attest, the emerging science of language documentation has evolved to be highly interdisciplinary and begs to be further defined by new methods that blend the contributing disciplines in intellectually interesting ways. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The speaker's series builds on the conference theme of "Sharing our Knowledge" which was chosen to reflect this new interdisciplinary trend within the discipline of language documentation. This series of four targeted presentations, each involving a different sub-discipline, will fill a gap in the conference structure by providing current examples from expert researchers of ongoing interdisciplinary work within the field. By adding this to the conference, these examples will allow the broader conference audience, as well as workshop participants, to interact with researchers who are actively engaged interdisciplinary research. The resulting papers, to be submitted by the speakers, will form a special issue on interdisciplinary research within language documentation for the Journal of Language Documentation and Conservation in order to reach an even broader audience.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This proposal requested funds to support a speakerÆs series which took place at the 3rd International Conference on Language Documentation and Conservation (ICLDC), held at the University of HawaiÆi at Manoa (UHM) in 2013.  The speakerÆs series was a response to the disciplinary trajectory and filled the need to share specific examples of exemplary interdisciplinary research in the field of language documentation. Four speakers were invited and each presented a different perspective on the way in which cross-disciplinary work can be realized in the context of language documentation leading to a richer research context and more comprehensive research results.

The four talks will be published as a collection of academic papers in a forthcoming special issue of the online Journal for Language Documentation and Conservation.   Intellectual Merit: As a new discipline, the field of endangered language documentation has been in the process of defining itself in terms of goals, methods, approaches and general scope for the past ten to fifteen years.  Language documentation continues to centrally focus on recording the worldÆs rapidly vanishing languages. However, a number of researchers have been promoting an interdisciplinary approach as that yields a broader scope of data from any given project. This is sometimes called æthemedÆ documentation and it invites the layering of more than the one standard discipline. Projects which add a focused content area investigation, in the context of doing language documentation, provide more value for money in terms of providing both rich linguistic data but also rich data related to other specific disciplines such as botany, astronomy, geography and more. The emerging science of language documentation then has evolved to be highly interdisciplinary and begs to be further defined by new methods which blend the contributing disciplines in intellectually interesting ways. The speakers to be supported by the present project are all engaged in exemplary research that brings interdisciplinary approaches and methods to bear on language documentation projects.
