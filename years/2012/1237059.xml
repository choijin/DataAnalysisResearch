<AbstractNarration>In 2013, a multi-institutional team of U.S. marine chemists and geochemists will launch a major expedition to the Pacific Ocean to map and study the distribution of trace elements and isotopes as part of the International GEOTRACES Program.  Because of their proven value as natural tracers of both sedimentation dynamics and hydrodynamics in the sea, radioactive daughter isotopes in the natural U-Th radionuclide series will be of immense value to all GEOTRACES researchers.  In  particular the naturally-occurring Pb210/Po210 radioisotope pair would be useful for quantifying rates of particulate scavenging of other trace elements and isotopes of interest in the U.S.GEOTRACES Pacific campaign.  This is because these two isotopes are themselves particle-reactive and radioactive, thus providing a natural clock for tracking the vertical transport of other particle-reactive substances.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this project, researchers at Wayne State University and CUNY Queens College will sample and analyze several hundred dissolved and particulate (large and small) samples for 210Po and 210Pb along the U.S.GEOTRACES Eastern South Pacific section. About two thirds of the samples will be focused at six so-called "super stations" (sites chosen for intensive study), half above the main thermocline and the other half down across the benthic nepheloid layer (the zone of suspended material extending several meters above the seafloor). The depths will be chosen according to regional atmospheric input, ecosystems, and coordinated with sampling by other researchers onboard. The other third will be taken within the hydrothermal plume in the vicinity of the East Pacific Rise. The data will be synthesized according to interface scavenging models by particle types (e.g. fine/colloidal, lithogenic and biogenic). As such, the proposed work will be closely coordinated with that of other U.S.GEOTRACES PIs funded to study other particle-reactive or dissolved trace elements and radionuclide isotopes during the campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BROADER IMPACTS: The broader impacts are closely linked to those of the GEOTRACES Program as a whole:   to enhance (1) research infrastructure by providing a broad array of 210Po and 210Pb data useful for biogeochemical scavenging models, (2) education by mentoring graduate and undergraduate students, teaching by example from proposed research, (3) participation of under-represented students interested in careers in the geosciences, (4) research training of graduates in marine radiochemistry, and 5) public dissemination of results through publications, presentations, and on a dedicated public website at Wayne State University.</AbstractNarration>

Pb-210 and Po-210 are the progeny of Rn-222 in the U-238-decay   chain and has contrasting biogeochemical behavior in marine system. Po-210   preferentially bioaccumulates within organic tissues, in addition to the   removal by terrigenous and biogenic particulate matter. Pb-210 is   predominantly removed by terrigenous particulate matter. Their overall   geochemical behavior in marine system is relevant to export of particulate   organic carbon and other key micro-nutrient elements from the upper ~200 m,   export fluxes of sinking particulate matter, sediment mixing and deposition   rates.&nbsp;</p> <p>As a part of our   group (Gillian Stewart, Queens College &ndash; particulate phase both 0.8-51 and   &gt;51 um), we measured particulate and dissolved activities of Po-210 and   Pb-210. The primary objective is to improve our understanding of processes   that control the distribution of Po-210 and Pb-210 nuclide cycles in the East   Pacific and its interfaces.&nbsp;</p> <p>We collected and analyzed   135 seawater samples from 6 super stations from east to west along a transect   from Peru to Tahiti, covering a distance of over 8,400 km. The contrasting characteristics   in these six stations include: most productive shelf waters off of Peru where   upwelling is one of the highest, and water with a strong oxygen minimum zone,   East Pacific Rise (EPR) hydrothermal plume and most oligotrophic waters. The   uniqueness of this program is that we have access to a large amount of ancillary   data (e.g. concentrations of pigments, nutrients, key micro-nutrient trace   metals, suspended particle concentration, Ra-226, stable Pb, etc) to   interpret our data in light of other key parameters.</p> <p>Based on our   results, we report the following: i) There is a wide-spread (64 % of all   500-m integrated layers) disequilibrium between <sup>210</sup>Po and <sup>210</sup>Pb   in the whole water column that we have analyzed. While radioactive   disequilibria between these two nuclides were not uncommon (from earlier published   results) in discrete depths, disequilibrium at 500-m integrated layer   indicates varying extents of preferential removal of <sup>210</sup>Po and   remineralization of <sup>210</sup>Po-enriched biogenic particulate matter   affecting the <sup>210</sup>Po<sub>T</sub>/<sup>210</sup>Pb<sub>T</sub> activity ratio. However, <sup>210</sup>Po<sub>T</sub>/<sup>210</sup>Pb<sub>T</sub> ratio over the whole water column varied between 0.97 and 1.09 (3% deficiency   to 9% excess of <sup>210</sup>Po), due to preferential removal of <sup>210</sup>Po   or more extensive remineralization of <sup>210</sup>Po in the water column; ii)   From a comparison of the inventories of <sup>210</sup>Po and <sup>210</sup>Pb   and the nutrients in the upper and bottom 300 m of the biologically most   productive (ST-1) and least productive waters, we propose that the whole   water column activity ratio of (<sup>210</sup>Po/<sup>210</sup>Pb)<sub>T</sub> can be utilized as a metric for the quantification of biological productivity   of a given station; iii) The residence   time of <sup>210</sup>Pb in 500-m layers vary widely. Overall, the residence   time of <sup>210</sup>Pb is much longer (71 y to &gt;600 y) in the most oligotrophic   station (ST-36) compared to previously reported values for the deep ocean,   but the residence time at 2,500-3,000 m at ST-26 is the lowest, 14 y. There   is an overall decrease in residence time from 1000 m to the sediment-water   interface in the most productive margin waters off of Peru; iv) The atmospheric depositional flux   calculated using <sup>210</sup>Pb concentration in aerosols decreases from   the station off of Peru to the farthest oceanic station, indicating the   contrasting differences in the sources of air masses as a source of   atmospheric <sup>210</sup>Pb at the study sites; v) There is strong correlation between   inventories of total <sup>210</sup>Pb and particulate Al, but there is no   correlation between <sup>210</sup>Po and particulate Al, suggesting much less   removal of <sup>210</sup>Po by lithogenic material compared to <sup>210</sup>Pb;   vi) There is an intense scavenging of <sup>210</sup>Po in the hydrothermal   vent waters compared to the most oligotrophic waters, resulting in the lowest   residence time of <sup>210</sup>Po in the water column. A 35% excess of <sup>210</sup>Po   over <sup>210</sup>Pb at 1,000-1,500 m indicates much active remineralization   in that layer. The whole water column scavenging of <sup>210</sup>Po and <sup>210</sup>Pb   in the EPR site is affected by the Fe and Mn released from the vent which is   transported far away distances, both horizontally and vertically; and vii) There   is a strong coupling between the upper and bottom 300 m in terms of   scavenging intensities, as observed both in the EPR and most oligotrophic   stations.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 01/07/2017<br>      Modified by: Mark&nbsp;Baskaran</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1237059/1237059_10205271_1483816525264_VerticalprofileofPo-210--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1237059/1237059_10205271_1483816525264_VerticalprofileofPo-210--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Vertical profile of Po-210"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1237059/1237059_10205271_1483816525264_VerticalprofileofPo-210--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Vertical profile of Po-210"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Vertical profile of total (particulate + dissolved) Po-210</div> <div class="imageCredit">Niedermiller et al. - Mar Chem (in submission)</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Mark&nbsp;Baskaran</div> <div class="imageTitle">Vertical profile of Po-210</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1237059/1237059_10205271_1483816899760_VerticalprofileofPb-210--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1237059/1237059_10205271_1483816899760_VerticalprofileofPb-210--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Vertical profile of Pb-210"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1237059/1237059_10205271_1483816899760_VerticalprofileofPb-210--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Vertical profile of Pb-210"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Vertical profile of total (particulate + dissolved) Pb-210 along the East Pacific Zonal Transect (samples collected in RV Thomson during 25 October - 22 December 2013)</div> <div class="imageCredit">Niedermiller et al. - Mar.
