<AbstractNarration>This project has the following goals: (i) to undertake the analysis the Variability of the American Monsoon Systems (VAMOS) Ocean-Coupled-Atmosphere-Land-System (VOCALS) datasets;  and (ii)to assess aerosol-cloud interactions for the southeast Atlantic and the dynamics that affect them. Precipitation impacts on aerosol indirect effects will be examined using remotely-sensed airborne VOCALS datasets and satellite-derived values. Aerosol transport pathways, their influence on and interactions with the southeast Atlantic stratocumulus deck at synoptic and diurnal time scales will also be examined, using a  suite of observational datasets and reanalyses encompassing multiple years. A combination of approaches (empirical orthogonal functions, compositing, and backtrajectories and Lagrangian particle dispersion modeling) will be utilized. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will improve understanding the dynamical influences on aerosol-cloud interactions in the Southern Hemisphere. This has the potential to improve the capability of future climate predictions; thus this activity has substantial broader impacts.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This award has focused on understanding the dynamics accompanying the aerosol and low distributions of the southeast Atlantic.
