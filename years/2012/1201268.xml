<AbstractNarration>The moduli space of stable n-pointed curves of genus g, is endowed with vector bundles having interesting positivity properties and connections to many different areas of mathematics and mathematical physics. Over a point, the bundles are naturally described as conformal blocks, vector spaces that arise as basic objects in rational conformal field theory.   The projects in this proposal are focused on three general themes, aimed at developing our understanding of vector bundles of conformal blocks bundles and their interplay with cycles on the moduli space.  The first project aims to show the Chern classes of so-called "critical level bundles" are subject to ''strange identities'',  given by interchanging roles of level and rank.  The second project explores properties of conformal blocks divisors, including their corresponding morphisms, questions of finite generation, and applications.  The third project is concerned with cones of positive cycles on varieties, illustrated for the moduli space of stable n-pointed rational curves via conformal blocks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Moduli spaces of stable curves with marked points occupy a unique and prominent position in the algebro-geometric universe. As moduli spaces, they give insight into the study of smooth curves and their degenerations, and as special varieties, they have played an important role in developing general theory. Recent work has revealed that many combinatorial aspects of the spaces are reflections of underlying geometric structures embodied by vector bundles of conformal blocks. The projects in this proposal aim both to use the features of these vector bundles to discover the nature of the moduli spaces, and also to use the architecture of the moduli spaces to reveal underlying relationships between the vector bundles.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The moduli space parametrizing  stable n-pointed curves of genus g has played an important role in the literature: as a means of learning  about smooth curves and their degenerations, as a model for moduli spaces generally, and as a test variety for developing theories in algebraic geometry.  My recent work concerns vector bundles $\mathbb{V}$ of conformal blocks and the moduli space of curves.   At a point in the moduli space, these bundles are  vector spaces  of conformal blocks, intrinsic objects  in 2-dimensional conformal field theory.    We can use vector bundles of conformal blocks as a tool to study the moduli space of curves: New birational models of the moduli space of curves have been found using first Chern classes of vector bundles of conformal blocks, and all previous models have been shown to be given by them, including those given by tautological classes.  In the paper {\em{Veronese quotient models of $\overline{M}_{0,n}$ and conformal blocks}}, written with Jensen, Moon, and Swinarski, which appeared in the Michigan Journal of Mathematics, we studied certain birational models of $\overline{M}_{0,n}$ that we call Veronese quotients, introduced in the work of Giansiracusa and Simpson.   We  found the divisor classes on $\overline{M}_{0,n}$ that give morphism to these spaces, showing  that for particular choices, the maps are given by conformal blocks divisors.     We have also made advances in our understanding of vector spaces of conformal blocks by studying vector bundles of conformal blocks on the moduli space of curves, as we illustrate in the following three examples.    Given a vector space of conformal blocks V for a smooth marked curve $(C,\vec{p})$, a fundamental result, involving work of many mathematicians including Beauville-Laszlo, Faltings, Kumar-Narasimhan-Ramanan, and Laszlo-Sorger, states that the (dual of the) vector space $V^*$ can be canonically identified with global sections $H^0(X, L)$, where $X$ is a particular moduli space of vector bundles on $C$, and $L$ an ample line bundle on $X$. For more than 20 years it has been an open problem to understand if and when such interpretations for vector spaces of conformal blocks may or may not carry over for such stable curves. In  {\em{Scaling of conformal blocks and generalized theta functions over $\overline{M}_{g,n}$}},  Mathematische Zeitschrift,  2016,  with Kazanova and Belkale,   by studying the vector bundles using intersection theory on $\overline{M}_{g,n}$, we showed such geometric interpretations do not have to hold at singular curves.   In the paper {\em{Nonvanishing of conformal blocks divisors on $\overline{M}_{0,n}$}} with P. Belkale and S. Mukhopadhyay, which has appeared in Transformation Groups, 2016, we introduce and study the problem of finding necessary and sufficient conditions under which a conformal blocks divisor on $\overline{M}_{0,n}$ is nonzero.  We answer this problem completely for $\sL_2$ bundles, showing that the divisors are nonzero for $\ell$ up to critical  and theta levels (which are equal for $\sL_2$),  as long as the bundle has nonzero rank.  We show  the divisor is equal to zero when $\ell$ exceeds the theta level.   We simplify the question for divisors of any type, showing that if certain rank conditions are satisfied, conformal blocks divisors are subject to additive relations. Among other applications, using a quantum generalization of Fulton's conjecture, we prove a scaling identity for divisors associated to rank one bundles.  We use these results to study two infinite families of critical level divisors, and their associated contractions.       In {\em{Critical level vanishing and identities  on $\overline{M}_{0,n}$}},  with P. Belkale and S. Mukhopadhyay, which has appeared in Algebraic geometry, we show conformal block divisors in type A are subject to so-called critical level identities.
