<AbstractNarration>This action funds Jia Liu of Columbia University to conduct a research project, entitled "Matching theory with observations for neutron stars," during the summer of 2012 at Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) Sagamihara, Kanagawa.  The host scientist is Ken Ebisawa.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Intellectual Merit of the research project lies in generating new knowledge about neutron stars.  A neutron star is a type of stellar remnant thought to result from the gravitational collapse of a massive star.  The center of a neutron star contains the densest matter in the universe.  Knowing the mass and size of the center would be very useful for  many areas of physics.  This research focuses on a property of accreting neutron stars, that they show a sudden increase in x-ray luminosity every few hours to days, to compare simulation results from a mathematical model with actual data from space telescopes.      &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.  These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ OBSERVE X-RAY BURSTS WITH ASTRO-H SXS  Jia Liu (Columbia University) Masahiro Tsujimoto, Ken Ebisawa (ISAS, JAXA)  1. MOTIVATION  To date, the internal structure of neutron stars is still a puzzle. Understanding the equation of state(EOS) of the matters at the core of neutron stars is the key to probe interactions of matters in extremely dense environments(Lattimer &amp; Prakash 2001), an experiment that is currently impossible in terrestrial laboratories.  Astro-H is JapanÃ†s next X-ray mission scheduled to launch in 2014. The Soft X-ray Spectroscopy(SXS) onboard utilizes the revolutionary micro-calorimetry technology, which measures the temperature rise of the HgTe absorbers upon each incident X-ray photon, rather than counts electrons as in CCDs and gratings. The high energy resolution of SXS opens a new window for probing the center of neutron stars.  2. MASS AND RADIUS MEASUREMENT  To constrain the EOS, we simply need to measure the masses and radii of neutron stars, two quantities that depend directly on EOS. Precise mass measurements have been done using relativistic orbital effects for neutron stars in binaries(Thorsett &amp; Chakrabarty 1999). Radii measurements, however, are extremely difficult due to the small sizes of neutron stars relative to their distances.  Timing and spectroscopic observations have been adopted to measure the radii of neutron stars. The spectroscopic approach is the focus of this work. If we can detect absorption lines or edges in neutron star spectra and identify their rest wavelengths, mass-radius ratio can be inferred from the gravitational redshift 1+z=(1&minus;2GM/Rc2)&minus;1/2. However, detecting absorption features has proven to be a difficult task. Detection of a 13 angstrom absorption line in EXO 0748-676 by XMM/Newton(Cottam et al. 2002) generated much excitation, but the line origin remains in debate.  X-ray bursters are the most promising places to observe absorption features. X-ray bursters are accreting neutron stars in Low mass x-ray binaries, where heavy elements are continually supplied by accretion from the donor and act as absorbers (Ozel&amp;Psaltis 2003), and the thermonuclear burning provides 10 times energy than persistent flux during X- ray bursts.  The precise measurement of the spectral lines gives much more information than the gravitational redshift . When rotational broadening dominates the line width, we can obtain the radius information through vrot = R&omega;sini and delta_E/E=vrot/c. When Stark effects dominates, line width is proportional to M/R2(Paerels 1997). The high energy resolution of SXS make it sensitive to detect weak lines, line velocity, and the broadening of weak lines.  3. SXS OBSERVATION OF X-RAY BURSTS  We propose a group of X-ray bursters to be observed with SXS with criteria:  1) Slow rotators to minimize the rotational broadening effects; 2) High enough burst rate to ensure at least one burst to be observed during a 100 ks observation; 3) We also included any objects with previously identified features.  We adopted a list of ~100 X-ray bursters compiled by in Ã†t Zand (2012). A quarter of them show burst oscillations, a direct indication of the neutron star spin and can help us constrain the line shape. We then searched for relevant parameters summarized by Galloway et al.(2008), and reference therein. Finally, we selected &sim;10 targets as the most promising start for SXS observation(Table 1).  We use XSPEC wabs*bb*gabs*gabs model to simulate the absorption lines using Astro-H response files, where wabs is the interstellar photoelectric absorption using Wisconsin(Morrison&amp;McCammon 1983) cross-sections, bb is a blackbody with temperature 1.8 keV, and two gabs are Gaussian absorptions at 0.95 keV and 4.1 keV with equivalent width 0.013 keV and 0.158 keV, as seen by Cottam et al. (2002) and Nakamura et al. (1988), respectively.  Our main simulation results are:  &bull; 1000 s of exposure time is desired to have a strong signal to noise, es...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
