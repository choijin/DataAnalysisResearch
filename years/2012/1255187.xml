<AbstractNarration>The modern Bayesian toolbox contains many highly structured models tailored for continuous data.  These tools allow us to handle data sets that are not merely large, but also dense: varying in time or space, rich with covariates, or deeply layered with hierarchical structure, and indexed in ever more baroque ways. But the field has not progressed nearly as far in modeling discrete data.  Indeed, many common discrete-data models have long been viewed as too difficult to work with on a routine basis, due to the analytically inconvenient form of the likelihood functions that arise.  The investigator will develop inferential tools for discrete-data problems that exploit new data-augmentation schemes as well as recent advances in parallel and distributed computing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Discrete data sets typically involve either event-count or categorical outcomes (yes or no, this choice or that).  The goal of the investigator's research is to leverage detailed spatial information to better model and predict these outcomes.  In many cases this will involve physical space.  For example, spatial patterns are very important when public health authorities look for excess reports of respiratory infection at a cluster of hospitals, or when law-enforcement officers deploy equipment that detects radiation anomalies at a crowded public event.  But it may also involve a more abstract notion of space.  For example, patients in a clinical trial can be located in a space defined by their genes and behavior.  This information is useful for personalized medicine: that is, deciding whether someone belongs to a special sub-group that is helped by a drug, even if the wider population isn't.  Though the proposed research is in the area of statistical methodology, the work is inherently interdisciplinary, and seeks to provide statistical solutions for pressing scientific problems. The PI has very good ideas how to transform the education of statistics in a more interdisciplinary and more data oriented way so that UT-Austin can become "one of the most innovative statistics programs in the world" as the PI writes. His research is integrated into the education of the new Division of Statistics and Scientific Computation (SSC) at UT-Austin.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    In conjuction with my research team at the University of Texas, I have used this grant to develop new statistical methodology for the kind of complex, large-scale data sets that scientists, businesses, and governments now must routinely deal with.  The applications of my team's work span the social, physical, and biomedical sciences, and the findings arising from that work have successfully influenced medical practice and policy responses to public health problems. Some of the scientific questions and problems we've addressed using these new methods include:  - how to find hidden "dirty bombs," by applying our statistical methods to data from radiation detectors used by law enforcement  - investigating the relationship between asthma exacerbations and the transmission of respiratory disease, to help schools and public health agencies better plan their response to flu season and be better stewards of their resources. Health experts have observed that children with asthma tend to have the worst symptoms at the same times each year&mdash;when school starts in the fall, and after extended breaks in winter and spring. Researchers had previously speculated that environmental factors such as air quality in schools might be to blame, but our study, published in PNAS, confirmed that the primary driver of seasonal waves of worsening asthma symptoms is the prevalence of common colds. Asthma exacerbations driven by the common cold cause millions of missed work or school days and $50 billion in health-care costs in the U.S. every year. These findings demonstrate how careful statistical modeling can lead to improved public-health strategies. (For example, at the riskiest times of year, doctors could give extra "nudges" for asthma patients to adhere to preventative medications, and schools could take extra measures to reduce cold transmission.)  - how women in Latin America responded to the outbreak of Zika virus and concerns that babies would be born with microcephaly.  Our findings were widely covered in the national and international news media: the New York Times, the Washington Post, AP, Reuters, NPR, CBS/ABC/NBC/Fox, the BBC World News, and many others. The American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology released a statement saying that our study "provides alarming insight on how the Zika virus is affecting the lives of pregnant women."  - how staffing decisions at hospitals can affect complication rates on the labor ward.  Large, complex data sets are ubiquitious in the modern world, and my team and I have worked hard to make sure that scientists have the tools they need to analyze them as effectively as possible.
