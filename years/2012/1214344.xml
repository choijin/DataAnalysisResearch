<AbstractNarration>This award funds the research activities of Professors K. Becker, M. Becker, and E. Sezgin at Texas A&amp;M University. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research project addresses fundamental aspects of string theory and also explores connections to other areas of physics such as high temperature superconductivity. The first set of projects deals with string perturbation theory and the construction of D-brane effective actions. The results of such work could also be used to check the consistency of models of particle physics obtained from string theory. Another topic to be investigated concerns the application of string theory to condensed matter physics, specifically high temperature superconductivity. Other topics to be investigated include conformal field theories beyond two dimensions, as well as the development of remarkable higher-spin extensions of Einstein gravity and their holographic descriptions.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research described in this proposal is envisioned to have significant broader impacts.  Beyond the interdisciplinary nature of this research, stretching from high-energy physics to condensed-matter physics, these impacts also include the training of graduate students working towards their Ph.D.'s and the training and mentoring of postdoctoral fellows who will be directly involved with the research funded under this award.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This proposal describes the work of 3 PIs:  K.Becker, M.Becker and E.Sezgin. During this reporting period K.Becker and M.Becker have worked together with their students and postdocs. The work of E.Sezgin will be described separately.  K.Becker and M.Becker have worked on  the following string theory problems:  (1) Wrote 2 papers on string theory scattering amplitudes in the NSR formalism. The most general 3- and 5-point functions in this formalism were achieved  (2) It was shown that SU(N) holonomy manifolds become SU(N)-structure manifolds once alpha' corrections are included. Such manifolds are not necessarily Ricci-flat, but preserve supersymmetry. Our analysis was done in the target space effective field theory appoach, rather than in terms of a sigma model worldsheet.  (3) Exampes of Kaluza-Klein compactifications on G_2 and Spin (7) manifolds were worked out. All fields in the compactification, massless and massive were taken into account..  (4) Two projects on boundaryconformal field theory have been worked out. It was shown that the RG-flow in the bulk theory can be described in terms of defects, and the most general type of defects can ne catalogued.  E. Sezgin has worked in the following areas:  Higher spin theories:  These are remarkable extensions of Einstein's theory of gravity with an infinite tower of higher spin fields interacting with each other in a highly nontrivial way. They have enormous enlargement of spacetime symmetries and point at a profoundly different way of thinking about spacetime, its geometry and the equations that govern the gravitational dynamics. E. Sezgin worked on several aspects of these theories, including their generalization to admit a novel geometric formulation, and development of an action principle, which has been long lacking, and higher spin holography. His work on high spin theories resulted in 8 papers in the four-year period of this grant.  Supergravity theories:  Supergravity has long played an important role in the development of quantum gravity, with the motivations of taming its divergent behavior, providing a framework for unification and phenomenology. The importance of supergravity has all the more been appreciated, as it describes the low energy limit of superstring theory, and making it possible to capture several of its important properties. E. Sezgin's work on supergravities produced 7 papers in this grant period, with new results on higher derivative supergravities in four and higher dimensions, their compactification and spectra, their holographic aspects, topologically massive supergravities at the classical and quantum level, and nonrelativistic Newton-Cartan supergravity.  Dualities and conformal field theories:  Supergravity theories, as effective field theories of superstrings, have remarkable duality symmetries, which map different backgrounds on which the superstring theory is realized.  E. Sezgin worked on the unification of these symmetries in eleven dimensions, proposing a new extension of the conjectured E(11) symmetry, as well as their realization at the level of wordvolume of membrane theories. E. Sezgin also constructed novel superconformal field theories in six dimensions, expected to play a role in holography in higher dimensions. His work in these areas produced 5 papers in this grant period.  Broader Impact Criteria: Our work was published in well known journals that are accessible to the general public.  The PIs organized a workshop on string scattering amplitudes at the Simons Center at Stony Brook, and a workshop on generalized geometries, supergravities and strings at the Mitchel Institute for Theoretical Physics and Astronomy at Texas A&amp;M University, both in 2017.  Intellectual Merit: The work performed by the 3 PIs is interesting and new and as such satifies the NSFs intellectual meric criteria.
