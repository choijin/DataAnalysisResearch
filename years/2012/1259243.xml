<AbstractNarration>The Principal Investigators will install instrumentation to observe strain build-up and fluid behavior near the up-dip end of the Cascadia Subduction Zone.  The project will establish a borehole geodetic observatory offshore of Vancouver adjacent to an existing CORK observatory, which will be enhanced with tiltmeters and temperature-monitoring instrumentation. Real-time data will be streamed onshore and made available to the community via the NEPTUNE Canada system. Long-term data analysis goals include capturing and characterizing slow-slip events and/or major earthquakes. The project will enhance scientific infrastructure and produce widely accessible data that will advance understanding of earthquake and tsunami hazards. A graduate student at RSMAS will be supported and at WHOI students and/or post-doctoral researchers will be involved in the cruise and data analysis.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goal of this project was to install an instrumentation system that can record both the shaking from seismic waves and the slower strain build up and release from plate motion near the updip end of the Cascadia subduction zone megathrust fault.   The observatory was installed in an existing borehole offshore of Vancouver Island Canada that was installed by the International Ocean Drilling program.  Our instruments were installed in the summer of 2016 and connect to a undersea cabled observatory run by Ocean Networks Canada in the summer of 2017.   Understanding how the updip end of the subduction zone works is important because how this part of the fault breaks governs the generation of the tsunami in a great earthquake.   Our system is now the most sensitive equipment for detecting small motion of the fault in this region.    The data, which flows to shore in real time through the ONC cable will allow us to determine if the shallow part of the fault is locked and storing strain or releasing it.   The sensors are located at the bottom of the 300m deep borehole and hence are only a few km from the plate boundary.   They can detect strains as small as 5e-8.    The data is available in real-time to anyone through the IRIS data management center and the ONC data center.  Because it is available in real-time, it also has the potential to be used by the Canadian earthquake and tsunami warning systems.   Depending on where the earthquake starts and what it looks like in detail, our sensors could provide some of the most crucial data for knowing that the shallowest part of the fault has slipped and if it likely generated a significant tsunami.
