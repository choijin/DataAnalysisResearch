<AbstractNarration>Collaborative Research: The provenance of "Grenville" age detrital zircon in western North America and the Neoproterozoic to early Paleozoic evolution of southwestern Laurentia&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;R. Lang Farmer, University of Colorado, EAR-1251851&lt;br/&gt;Christopher Fedo, University of Tennessee, EAR-1251869&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;Detrital zircon U-Pb age determinations have become a primary tool in siliciclastic sedimentary provenance studies due in part to the advent of rapid, in situ methods of obtaining isotopic data from individual zircon grains.  However, the ability to collect such data is outstripping our understanding of the limitations of using U-Pb age spectra in interpreting continental tectonics and paleogeography.  In this study, PIs are interested in assessing the significance, in terms of the sediment provenance, of variations in the age spread and relative peak height of specific detrital zircon age populations in siliciclastic sedimentary successions.  Their approach is through combined in situ zircon U-Pb and Hf isotope analyses, data to be obtained using the laser ablation-multicollector ICPMS technique.  PIs will target Mesoproterozoic to Cambrian sedimentary successions in the SW United States and northern Mexico, rocks that have been extensively used for U-Pb detrital zircon studies, but for which there is little detrital zircon Hf isotope data.  Existing U-Pb age spectra reveal that a significant fraction of the detrital zircons in these rocks were derived from 1.0 Ga to 1.3 Ga ("Grenville") basement sources.  The width and relative peak heights described by detrital zircon in this age range vary considerably both temporally and spatially within these sedimentary successions.  Many samples are dominated by ~1.1 Ga detrital zircon, which on the basis of their U-Pb ages alone implies that these zircon were all derived from the same Mesoproterozoic basement source.  However, PIs pilot Hf isotopic studies of "Grenville" detrital zircon show that the ~1.1 Ga grains vary by over 15 epsilonHf(0) units and reveal that these zircons do not all share the same provenance.  This fact is not recognizable from the U-Pb age spectra alone.  Based on this observation, it is suggested that combined U-Pb and Hf isotopic data can be used to explore how changes in the characteristics of the "Grenville" peaks in detrital zircon age spectra reflect changes in the ultimate bedrock source of these detrital grains.  A better understanding of the basement provenance for Mesoproterozoic detrital zircons can, in turn, be used terms to refine models for the Precambrian to early Paleozoic tectonic and paleogeographic evolution of North America.  PIs will conduct a broad survey of the U-Pb and Hf isotopic compositions of potential sources of "Grenville" zircon amongst 1.0 Ga to 1.3 Ga igneous rocks within the Grenville Orogen in the central and southern Appalachians, in the Llano Uplift in Texas, and among the ~1.1 Ga igneous rocks distributed throughout Paleoproterozoic crust of the SW U.S. and northern Mexico.  They will apply this information, along with whole-rock Nd isotopic analyses on samples for which such data not already available, to assess the provenance of "Grenville" detrital zircon in siliciclastic sedimentary rocks in the Death Valley region and in the Caborca area of central Sonora (MX).</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project bears on the use of uranium-lead (U-Pb) and hafnium (Hf) isotopic analyses in the mineral zircon to determine the sources of sediments generated, transported, and deposited on the North American continent in the past.  Zircon grains are formed during the crystallization of the magmas from which continents are constructed and are resistant to destruction during weathering and erosion of the original igneous rock and during subsequent transport on EarthÆs surface as sediment.  Because the element uranium readily substitutes into zircon, the original crystallization age of individual sedimentary (detrital) zircon can be determined using the U-Pb isotope decay scheme.  Matching the age of a detrital zircon with the ages of potential source rocks then allows the provenance of the zircon to be estimated.  Hafnium is also readily admitted into zircon and is an element that displays natural variations in its isotopic compositions, because of the radioactive decay of an isotope of lutetium (177Lu) to an isotope of hafnium (177Hf).  Comparison of the Hf isotopic compositions of sedimentary zircon and igneous zircon in potential sediment source regions can also be used in sediment provenance studies.  Both the U-Pb and Hf isotopic compositions of zircon can be determined in situ using laser ablation mass spectrometry techniques.  In this project, we studied the sources of ~1.1 Ga (Grenvillian) detrital zircon found in Neoproterozoic and Cambrian sedimentary rocks throughout the conterminous U.S. and northern Mexico.  Grenvillian detrital zircons are common in these sedimentary rocks, the latter dating to the time when the supercontinent Rodinia disaggregated about 500 million years ago.  Source rocks for Grenvillian detrital zircon are are found along the entire southeastern and eastern margins of North America and as discrete igneous bodies that intruded older (~1.7 Ga) continental crust in southwestern portions of the continent.  The widespread distribution of "Grenvillian" age rocks is an issue because previous workers have suggested that a "flood" of ~1.1 Ga detrital zircon eroded from the eastern margin of the continent were transported from east to west directed river system across the continent during the Neoproterozoic and early Cambrian. But with so many potential sources of ~1.1 Ga detrital zircon, in such different geographic locations, is not clear what implications the occurrence of Grenvillian detrital zircon in a given sedimentary rock has for reconstructing the paleogeography of Laurentia.  We obtained Hf isotopic data from ~1.1 Ga igneous rocks in the southern Appalachians, the Llano uplift (Texas),  northern Mexico (see photo) and the western U.S.   Our new data confirm that igneous zircon in Grenvillian rocks in the southern Appalachian Mountains have lower 177Hf/176Hf values than Grenvillian rocks to the north in the Adirondack Mountains or to the southern in the Llano Uplift and adjacent regions.  The ~1.1 Ga igneous rocks from Paleoproterozoic terranes vary between the high values observed for Llano uplift rocks (Franklin Mountains-Texas) to much lower 177Hf/176Hf values, consistent with the derivation of their parental magmas from melting of older basement rocks (northern Sonora, Colorado).  Grenvillian detrital zircons were analyzed from sedimentary rocks deposited at or just above the "Great Unconformity", a widespread surface of non-deposition or erosion that separates Precambrian basement rocks from overlying Neoproterozoic and Cambrian sandstones.  Multiple Hf isotopic populations exist among the Grenvillian zircon.  For example, the Wood Canyon Formation in southern California, a Neoproterozoic sandstone deposited directly on Precambrian basement, carries only "high" 177Hf/176Hf Grenvillian zircon.  These zircons were likely derived from Grenvillian rocks in present-day Texas, potentially due to surface uplift and resulting erosion of the continent in this region during continental rifting and t...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
