<AbstractNarration>This collaborative project transforms learning in introductory biology courses through a&lt;br/&gt;technology-supported, active-learning pedagogy that is informed by theory and&lt;br/&gt;evidence about learning systems. Specifically, this project overcomes students'&lt;br/&gt;problems in understanding complex biological systems and distributes learning in a way&lt;br/&gt;that actively engages students in and out of class. This project evaluates the&lt;br/&gt;effectiveness of the pedagogy, provides research on how introductory biology students&lt;br/&gt;articulate complex processes within and across biological systems, and investigates&lt;br/&gt;development of reflective and deep learning approaches.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this project results from a technology-rich approach, allowing&lt;br/&gt;instructors to communicate selected content outside of class and replacing traditional&lt;br/&gt;lectures with promising active learning strategies in class. An approach adapted from&lt;br/&gt;engineering that analyzes systems in terms of their Structure, Behavior, and Function is&lt;br/&gt;the theoretical framework employed to facilitate learning and understanding of biological&lt;br/&gt;systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project creates broader impacts by building and strengthening community within&lt;br/&gt;and across institutions. At the collaborating institutions alone, several hundred students&lt;br/&gt;are expected to benefit from the enhanced instructional framework. Dissemination of&lt;br/&gt;practices and curricular materials should impact students at multiple institutions and&lt;br/&gt;levels in the biology curriculum. Research findings are expected to be disseminated as&lt;br/&gt;oral and poster communication at local and national meetings of professional societies.&lt;br/&gt;Further, outcomes of this research are also expected to be disseminated via&lt;br/&gt;manuscripts targeted for science education journals. Contributions to the STEM&lt;br/&gt;education research literature should yield insights to the broader academic and science&lt;br/&gt;education research communities.</AbstractNarration>
