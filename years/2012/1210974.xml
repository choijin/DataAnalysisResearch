<AbstractNarration>The goal of this program is to study the distribution of galaxies to test the assumption of statistical isotropy, which is the idea that the universe, on average, looks the same in every direction in the sky.  A cosmological origin of the violation of statistical isotropy would invalidate basic assumptions used in the standard analyses to extract cosmological parameters.  Dr. Huterer will explore numerically and analytically the use of large-scale structure data to probe inflationary physics in the presence of astrophysical and instrumental systematics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of the work include training of undergraduate and graduate students.  In addition, Dr. Huterer will run a two-week summer course for high school students as part of Michigan Math and Science Scholars program. He will also work with teachers in high-schools from the Detroit metro area, visiting their institutions, giving lectures in classes, and helping them develop astronomy curricula.</AbstractNarration>
