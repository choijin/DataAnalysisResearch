<AbstractNarration>This project develops models for information assurance education and outreach that can be disseminated to other institutions. The primary focus areas of this project are a high school outreach program, a multidisciplinary information assurance curriculum, and a community lecture series. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The high school outreach program is a four-week summer program for high school students and high school teachers in two aspects of information assurance - introduction to cryptography and explorations in network security and vulnerability analysis. The purpose of the outreach program is to introduce self-exploratory projects to students who have never participated in a research project and to encourage participating teachers to disseminate the ideas back to their classrooms during the school year. This program will help cultivate interest in information assurance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed multidisciplinary information assurance curriculum incorporates computer science, mathematics, political science, criminal justice, and other related fields to build a strong program that addresses both the technical and social aspects of information assurance.  Developed in consultation with faculty of the respective departments and with members of the law enforcement and intelligence communities, the intent of the curriculum is to create well-rounded graduates with a broad base of knowledge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The community lecture series addresses the lack of information assurance education channels in the region. The annual free community course provides in-depth exposure to information assurance topics, with culminating lectures featuring regional and national speakers. The proposed activity is a model for community engagement and education which will raise community awareness of information assurance issues.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This program increased the capacity for information assurance education at California State University, Bakersfield (CSUB) and developed modules that can be disseminated on a regional and national scale. The goal was to increase interest in the information assurance field and to increase the capacity for high-quality education.   The primary objectives of the grant were to increase interest in information assurance related undergraduate degrees through a high school outreach activity and to increase the rate of undergraduate students pursuing graduate degrees or careers in information assurance through a multidisciplinary information assurance program.  The high school outreach program was a four-week, all-day program where the high school students came on to the CSUB campus and participated in hands-on activities related to cryptography and cyber security. A diverse population of students, reflecting the demographics of the Kern County region, participated in the summer program. Pre- and post-surveys were used to measure changes in attitudes towards college in general and information assurance majors in particular. Students reported an increase in interest in attending college and an increase in interest in cyber security as a result of participating in the program. Additionally, 21.5% of the participants are now pursuing college degrees at CSUB, primarily in computer science and mathematics.  The multidisciplinary information assurance program consisted of developing an information security concentration in computer science and creating an undergraduate student research program.
