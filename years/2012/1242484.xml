<AbstractNarration>The program builds upon the breakthroughs made in improving the efficiency of light and mechanical energy harvesting at NSF I/UCRC: Center for Energy Harvesting Materials and Systems (CEHMS). Sun light and natural wave oscillations are promising source of energy for recharging the onboard batteries. Current photovoltaic conversion technologies have challenges in terms of material utilization, long term stability, conversion efficiency, energy storage density and most importantly cost competitiveness ($/Watt). Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have been shown to be better alternative if price/performance ratio is compared. DSSC can absorb diffused sunlight and can convert it efficiently into electricity. DSSCs can also work in cloudy weather and low-light conditions. Efforts will be made towards integration of the DSSC module with the bell of the proposes robot without affecting the rowing propulsion mechanism. Secondly, non-linear magnetic levitation based inductive energy harvester will be incorporated in the appendages of the robot to harvest the wave energy. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The team has the expertise and knowledge and desire required to develop the Bio-inspired Underwater Surveillance Vehicle (BUSV). The outcome of the I-Corps project will be technology demonstration and a clear go/no go decision regarding viability of BUSV. If successful, a spin-off company resulting from the I-Corps effort will lead to creation of high tech ? high paying jobs and contribute to the national economy. In addition to many defense applications, civilian industries related to water quality sensing, pollution monitoring, chemical spill such as oil spills cleaning, and robotic aquariums will benefit from the proposed technology.</AbstractNarration>
