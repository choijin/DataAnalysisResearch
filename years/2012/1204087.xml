<AbstractNarration>The regional response of the high Arctic to past climate events is little known beyond the time period covered by the Greenland ice cores. However, in Spring 2009, a 3.6 million year long sediment record was successfully recovered from Lake El'gygytgyn, a 12km diameter meteor crater lake located 100km north of the Arctic Circle in Chukotka, NE Russia. This grant will continue studies of the paleoclimate record from the lake cores. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Analysis of the sedimentary record will greatly extend the known climate history. The team will integrate data analysis with climate modeling to test four hypotheses regarding the relationship between high Arctic climate and climate of other regions. First, no terrestrial Arctic record yet covers the mid-Brunhes transition in sufficient detail to determine whether the cooler interglacial periods observed in the first several 100ky cycles in the Antarctic are also found in the Arctic. Second, the amplitude of 40ky -duration glacial/interglacial cycles in the terrestrial Arctic during early Pleistocene is not known. Third, terrestrial Arctic temperatures during the Late Pliocene, a period of elevated atmospheric pCO2, are also unknown. Fourth, the team will investigate Arctic temperature response to cooling during Marine Isotope Stage 2. These results will help determine the sensitivity of the Arctic to atmospheric CO2 levels. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant will provide the scientific community with information about the magnitude of climate changes in the Arctic during the 100ky glacial cycles, the 40ky glacial cycles, and from prior to the initiation of Northern hemisphere glaciations. These data will allow direct comparison to the EPICA ice cores, long Asian loess, speleothem, and lake records, and comparable marine records and Global Climate [computer] Models. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Both the public and policy makers remain confused about issues relating to climate change. This work should help clarify the background of natural variations in Arctic climate, so that the modern changes can be seen in context.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Four PhD students and one post-doctoral fellow will receive science and mentoring support. In addition, the team will train STEM teachers by bringing five western Massachusetts teachers per summer to UMass for two weeks to gain hands-on laboratory and field experience and jointly develop curricula that address core elements of the Massachusetts Department of Education science standards. Because lakes and ponds are common across parts of the US, a portion of the teacher training will focus on lake/pond sediments with regard to the environmental and climate change they can document in their communities. This will be accomplished in collaboration with the middle school Earth science teacher who was at Lake El'gygytgyn in 2009 as the PolarTREC teacher.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>During the 4<sup>th</sup> International Polar Year 2007 to 2009, the International Continental Scientific Drilling program, the Office of Polar Programs at the US National Science Foundation, and the German Research Foundation provided funds to conduct scientific drilling in northeast Arctic Russia at Lake El'gygytgyn (Figure 1). Located at 67 degrees north latitude about 100 km north of the Arctic Circle, Lake El'gygytgyn was created by a large meteorite impact about 3.6 million years ago that created a basin 20 kilometers in diameter. This unique basin is the largest and deepest unglaciated freshwater basin in the entire Arctic. Scientific drilling in spring 2009 into a frozen lake without any road infrastructure was logistically challenging and unprecedented, but successful involving an international collaboration between scientists in Russia, USA, Germany, and Austria (Figure 2). Until this project was completed, little was known about the climate change history that took place in the Arctic over the past few million years. The research was risky because of its remoteness, but the science successful providing the first information on the natural evolution of the Arctic borderlands over the past 3.6 million years. Today Lake El'gygytgyn measures about 171 meters (560 feet) deep and contains about 318 meters (1040 feet) of sediment and organic matter deposited since the time of the impact. This sediment and organic matter contains both physical fossils and molecular organic fossils (biomarkers) that allowed us to reconstruct past changes in seasonality, temperatures and precipitation. We recovered sediment in replicate boreholes (Figure 3) from Lake Elgygytgyn providing extraordinary insights as to how the Arctic region interacts with other parts of the world on long and short timescales. We likewise understand more clearly how changes in the Earths oceans, atmosphere and landscapes can impact and influence the trajectory of change in the polar regions over years to centuries to millennia.&nbsp; Overall, we have gained new knowledge about the remarkable sensitivity of the Arctic to even small atmospheric forcings caused by climate change. This sensitivity gives us predictive scientific tools for better forecasting into the near future how the Arctic will respond to the anthropogenic warming now taking place. As a result of this international project, we reflect on the broader accomplishments:</p> <p>The Lake El'gygytgyn sediment record has produced the highest resolution record yet established, documenting the past 3.6 Myrs of Arctic climate evolution and change, much like reading a book backwards in time. This record is truly unprecedented. So far, some 75 scientific papers have been published by our international research group; we have given dozens of public talks to kids and adults of all ages. The project is a true benchmark of scientific diplomacy, bringing many countries together to achieve remarkable scientific goals. (Figure 4).</p> <p><br />The project discovered evidence for over a dozen Arctic super interglacials, i.e., natural warm periods, that were warmer than most warm periods of the past 3.6 million years. Nearly all of these warm cycles were the result of natural causes between 2.8 Ma and 1.0 Ma when the worlds climate changed between warm and cold cycles every 41,000 years; only 2-3 super-warm periods occurred during the past 1 million years when warm and cold climate cycles were dominated by 100,000 year cycles caused by changing dimensions of Earths orbit around the Sun. Some warmer periods can be linked to times when the Greenland Ice Sheet and possibly the West Antarctic Ice Sheet were smaller causing a serious rise in global sea level. Using biomarkers, we identified a super interglacial from 1.1 Million years ago that was nearly 50,000 years long (Figure 5)! And another interglacial about 205,000 years ago that was warmer than expected.&nbsp; This past history suggests the polar regions are extremely sensitive to small changes in warming driven by natural orbital configurations and feedbacks. This correlation has serious consequences for the future because anthropogenic, global-scale warming drives an increase in Earth?s temperature in much the same way.&nbsp;</p> <p>The Lake Elgygytgyn record provides the first impressions we have of how the Arctic evolved from forested landscapes and sea-ice free summers to an Arctic of warm interglacial and cold glacial cycles dominated by permanent sea ice over the Arctic Ocean and the presence of a Greenland Ice sheet.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;Lake Elgygytgyn contains fossil molecules of organic matter, so-called biomarkers, which record temperature and precipitation change in the past.
