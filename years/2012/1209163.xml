<AbstractNarration>The University of West Georgia ADVANCE IT-Catalyst project has a unique focus on Master?s institutions that aspire to become more research intensive, and the impact of that transition on the retention and advancement of STEM women faculty.  Specifically, this project is characterized by an in-depth examination of institutional policies and practices, and identification of those that may serve as barriers to tenured women faculty.  The project is also expected to develop novel mechanisms for supporting and expanding the numbers of senior level STEM and STEM-related women faculty. The outcomes of the University of West Georgia ADVANCE IT-Catalyst project will be used as the foundation for a comprehensive strategic plan that will guide the institution toward sustainable institutional transformation aimed at eliminating the inequities inherent in the current academic culture.  A robust dissemination plan, which includes Human Resources personnel, will allow the University of West Georgia to articulate best practices to a wide range of institutions of higher education and contribute to the knowledge base regarding how women faculty can be supported and advanced in similar institutional climates.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Men and Women?s Perceptions of the Balancing Act of Women Faculty- Work, Life, and Gender Bias    Introduction The goal of this study was to gain a deeper understanding of men and women faculty members? experiences with work-life balance and gender bias, and the effects of formal and informal institutional practices.  Methodology The research team recruited faculty from the College of Social Sciences and the College of Science and Math to participate in focus groups.  Only full-time faculty members were invited for participation (N=138). Participants were separated by gender and rank into groups. The final response rate was 10.8% (n=15), including three groups: four untenured females, four untenured males, and five tenured females.   Results Overall, the results demonstrated that there is both subtle and blatant gender bias occurring at the university. In regards to work-life balance, both men and women felt strain balancing family, social, and work obligations; however, they did feel they received support from colleagues and department chairs.   Gender Bias One theme of gender bias was that women were not given the same opportunities as men. Furthermore, women felt overlooked and discussed feelings of being left out of social events or even during impromptu meetings. This resulted in decisions being made by the male faculty members, without the voice of female faculty.  One prominent theme within both the male and female untenured groups was events of subtle bias. Women would discuss events where they felt a presence of gender assumptions, but state that it was not purposeful.  Within the three focus groups, only one woman made comments regarding multiple incidents of blatant sexism and prejudice against women faculty members.   Tenured female faculty members saw instances of gender bias, particularly during the tenure process. Conversely, faculty praised the university for being able to slow down the tenure clock, and that they had observed women successfully advance in their departments. There was some questioning as to whether that was attributable to departmental- or institutional-level support.  Comments about gender bias also arose within the male untenured faculty group. One male faculty member seemed to be more aware than others about occurrences of gender bias, while another became more aware of the subtle implications when a female faculty member pointed it out.  Members in both the tenured female and untenured male group talked about how faculty members treated female students, particularly how male faculty members treated female undergraduate and graduate students. These events were demonstrable of more blatant, rather than subtle gender bias.  Within all three groups, participants raised questions about whether workloads and types of work were distributed fairly among men and women faculty members.  There were a few comments by women regarding their own role in their workload assignments, stating they were somewhat to blame for the extra work, particularly with advising and committee work. Women also pointed out that while they had agreed to take on more work, it was often because it was harder to say no, particularly for women who were child free.   The Work-Life Balance: Family Care, Children, and Spillover Effects  Participants were asked to describe what a balance of work and life was, and how work fit into their life. Generally, the theme was that work should fit into life, not the other way around.  Participants also commented on how balanced their own life was, whether they were good at separating work from home life, and how institutional practices helped or hindered that balance. While some cited the flexibility of their job as a positive to achieving balance, others argued that same flexibility as a negative.  One predominant concern with work-life balance was being a good parent, researcher, and teacher. This issue arose within all three groups. While family came first, there were times when the balance was not so clear. Participants expressed guilt about their jobs taking them away from their kids, but also some guilt about how having kids affected their careers.  In the same regard, women and men commented about the "family friendly" environment at the university, stating that they felt support when having to take care of their kids, when they were pregnant, or when the women were taking maternity leave.  Policies &amp; Programs at the University  Participants within the three mixed groups, as well as the one mixed group, were asked to assess what policies/programs they would like to see implemented or revised at the university. There were three predominant suggestions: paternity leave (from the men?s group), on-campus daycare, and dual-career assistance.   Conclusions  Overall, women and men praised the environment  for being supportive of family, particularly at the departmental level. While there were select occurrences of blatant and subtle sexism and discrepancies in workload, most often, participants showed general gratitude towards their colleagues and department chairs for being supportive of them (and others) during times of need.
