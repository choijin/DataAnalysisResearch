<AbstractNarration>The project is 1) developing an open source, virtual, online tensile testing laboratory simulation; 2) conducting research to compare the costs and learning outcomes for using on-site, hands-on tensile testing equipment versus an online simulation; 3) creating close industry ties through blended learning opportunities for students; and 4) disseminating the simulation via faculty development. The project is testing the hypothesis that online learning improves outcomes and simultaneously reduces instructional costs. It is bridging a gap between existing tensile testing software products that are either too simple or too complex. The project is using a comprehensive assessment of student learning, along with a quasi-experimental research design, to determine the impact of the simulator on students and their instructors compared to traditional learning without the simulator. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although the proof of concept in the project pertains to a common engineering learning activity, the research is applicable to other engineering areas and other disciplines. The project includes activities that can be easily adopted by other institutions with little cost. The open-source tool being developed will be disseminated to undergraduate and high school faculty members who teach strength of materials courses, thus increasing the likelihood of adoption. Access to a virtual lab will allow groups with limited resources to attain desired learning outcomes without large capital investments for tensile strength testing equipment.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Virtual Online Strength Testing Simulation provides a virtual tool for students to learn how to use material testing equipment and perform simulated tests when this expensive equipment is not available in their institution.  While this project was originally envisioned to support tensile testing in high school Project Lead the Way courses (a nation-wide pre-engineering curriculum), its scope expanded (at no additional cost) to include additional testers and the ability to use them in both a high school and a college environment.   This project provides virtual learning environments for three common types of material tests:  Tensile Testing (testing material strength when being pulled apart) Impact testing (looking at material fracture resistance, i.e. how ductile or brittle the material acts)  Hardness testing (which can be used as a non-destructive method to determine material strength)   There is also a demonstration and practice module with each tester, allowing students to learn the testing steps and calculations required to interpret the data.  Testing with both high school and college subjects showed students learned the material equally well with the virtual tester as the actual hardware.  Students preparing for hands-on labs can use these virtual tools to learn testing procedures and required calculations prior to the laboratory experience.  This software and associated technical papers are available on-line and are free for all to use at http://pltwohio.org/tensile.php.
