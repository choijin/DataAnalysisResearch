<AbstractNarration>This award to Old Dominion University is for the development of a Spark-assisted Laser Multicharged Ion Deposition and Implantation System.  This system is expected to be a major improvement in performance and cost over existing multicharged ion sources and will have the ability to select ion charge and kinetic energy over a wide range. Multicharged ions have recently attracted significant attention for use in tools for nanoprocessing and nanofabrication of various electronic devices and sensors. They also have applications in medical imaging and treatment and in chemical analysis. This project integrates a laser multicharged ion source with a cost-effective ion density amplification stage based on a spark discharge. The multicharged ions are selected and transported to a processing chamber. With increased charge state, the ions carry substantial potential energy. The multicharged ion interaction with the solid involves the release of this potential energy in addition to its kinetic energy. For slow multicharged ions, the release of potential energy can be localized to a depth of a few nanometers (10-9 meter) at the surface, making them ideal for nanoprocessing. On the other hand, fast multicharged ion beams can deposit significant energy at a relatively deep target location, making them ideal for applications requiring localized high energy deposition as used in carbon ion radiotherapy.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The multicharged ion source is being developed at the Applied Research Center, which is a consortium of four Virginia universities, the Jefferson Lab, and several industries; all share lab facilities. Old Dominion University (ODU) collaboration with consortium members involves joint use of resources by students, course sharing, and joint publications.  Results will be incorporated in several graduate and undergraduate courses in diverse subjects, such as nanotechnology, plasma processing, microelectronic fabrication, statistical process control in semiconductor manufacturing, solid-state electronics, semiconductor characterization, pulsed power, and renewable energy. This project will involve several faculty and graduate students and collaboration with researchers at Université du Québec en Outaouais. A user facility will be established for multicharged ion applications. This facility is expected to operate for at least 15 years with 2-5 graduate students continuously using the instrument. Undergraduate students will be involved in this multidisciplinary work as part of their senior design course and in summer projects. ODU is an urban university with a diverse student population, and this instrumentation development project will be particularly useful in attracting underrepresented groups. The multicharged ion technology will be featured in ODU engineering open houses, Jefferson Lab open houses, and the annual Hampton Roads Technology showcase. The development of the spark-assisted laser multicharged ion source will represent a new scientific and industrial tool with many potential applications in various industries, in particular in the emerging nanotechnology industry.  ODU will seek industrial partners for licensing patents, know-how transfer to industry, and commercialization.</AbstractNarration>
