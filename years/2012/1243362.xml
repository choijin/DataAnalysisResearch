<AbstractNarration>This award will provide support for the International Neutrino Summer School (INSS 2012) to be held at Virginia Tech from July 10-21, 2012. The funds will be used to help support young scientists from US institutions to enable them to attend the school.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The school aims to serve as a broad introduction to neutrino physics that covers both accelerator and non-accelerator neutrino experiments, both neutrino properties and neutrino interactions, and both theory and experiment. The goal of this series is to train the next generation of neutrino physicists, and the curriculum covers many topics: introductions to both the Standard Model and oscillation phenomenology, accelerator and reactor neutrinos, neutrino cross sections, and neutrinos in cosmology, just to name a few. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For Broader Impacts, it has a particular focus on early career scientists and graduate students. The target audience consists of graduate students and recent post-docs in both theory and experiment.</AbstractNarration>

In addition to attending formal lectures students worked in groups to solve problems such as designing experiments to measure critical neutrino properties and they were given opportunities to present work from their tutorial sessions.  More than 70 students from 14 different countries participated in the school.  20 students from US institutions were support in part from this NSF grant.  Many of the students educated in this school will continue on to be a part of the next generation of neutrino science.
