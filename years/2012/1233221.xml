<AbstractNarration>This award supports the National Research Council's (NRC) Board on Science Education and Board on Testing and Assessment (BTOA) to conduct a fast-track 12-month consensus study to create a strategic plan for tracking the implementation and improvements in STEM education outlined in the NRC's report, "Successful K-12 STEM Education" (2011).  The study is in response to the language in the FY12 Commerce, Justice, and Science Appropriations Bill, approved by Congress November 2011, that calls for NSF to support such tracking and submit a report to the Committee by November 2012.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A committee, with the appropriate expertise, will identify existing and additional measures needed to track to the 2011 report's recommendations; discuss the feasibility of including such measures in existing programs of data collection and link them to existing and improved measures of science learning outcomes; and identify additional research needed to inform a full-scale evaluation of progress toward the report's recommendations.</AbstractNarration>

In response, the  NRC convened the Committee on an Evaluation Framework for Successful  K-12 STEM Education to take on this assignment.  Intellectual Merit: The committee developed  14 indicators linked to the 2011 report's recommendations. By providing a  focused set of key indicators related to students' access to quality  learning, educator's capacity, and policy and funding initiatives in  STEM, the committee addresses the need for research and data that can be  used to monitor progress in K-12 STEM education and make informed  decisions about improving it.  Broader Impacts: The recommended indicators provide a  framework for Congress and relevant deferral agencies to create and  implement a national-level monitoring and reporting system that:  assesses progress toward key improvements recommended by a previous  National Research Council (2011) committee; measures student knowledge,  interest, and participation in the STEM disciplines and STEM-related  activities; tracks financial, human capital, and material investments in  K-12 STEM education at the federal, state, and local levels; provides  information about the capabilities of the STEM education workforce,  including teachers and principals; and facilitates strategic planning  for federal investments in STEM education and workforce development when  used with labor force projections.
