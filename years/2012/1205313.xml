<AbstractNarration>In this project the PI will work with Trinity undergraduates to employ the laser-induced-grating experimental technique, forced Rayleigh scattering (FRS), for measurements of molecular-tracer diffusion coefficients within E. coli baths to see if the diffusion coefficients on micron length scales increase with the bacterial concentration. The PI will also show using simple Fourier concepts that FRS can be uniquely employed to directly measure and quantify Lévy deviations from Gaussian diffusion if the tracer molecules are indeed driven into Lévy flights by the swimmers. This work on molecular transport at the very small Reynolds number will help significantly in a complete comprehension of swimmer-driven small-molecule flux over ranges of swimmer length scales and Reynolds numbers that describe all marine organisms. The PI will also collaborate with a Trinity microbiologist to develop an undergraduate laboratory experiment in which students investigate the manner in which E. coli have evolved so that they outrun molecular diffusion during chemotaxis.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[                 Work continues on examining the effects of bacteria on molecular diffusion.  In keeping with the biophysical nature of the project, we have also studied how molecular diffusion within water is different from other solvents.  In a first project, we tested the predictions of free volume theory, which predicts the temperature dependence of the diffusion coefficient.  We found that the energy associated with the diffusion of an organic molecule in a solvent was in agreement with free volume theory for seven different organic solvents, but the free-volume prediction for water was too low by a factor of 12.  We attributed this discrepancy to (1) the additional "zero point" free volume acquired by water due to its hydrogen bond structure, and (2) the planar nature of the solute, allowing it to diffuse through a hole considerably smaller than its entire volume.  These results were published in the Journal of Chemical Physics.  In a second project, we studied the diffusion of an organic molecule in aqueous and non-aqueous binary solvent combinations.  If the combination did not include water, we found good agreement with the predictions of free volume theory for the change in the diffusion coefficient as the mole fraction was varied.  For aqueous combinations, however, a minimum in the diffusion coefficient occurred at a specific mole fraction, which cannot be explained by free volume theory.  We proposed that in an aqueous combination, two solvent shells will be formed.  The first shell is formed around a solute molecule by the organic solvent, which is the better solvent.  A second solvent shell is then produced as water hydrogen-bonds to the hydrophilic side of the first organic solvent shell.  Beginning with either pure solvent, a solvent shell is formed to slow the diffusion of the solute, leading to a minimum in the diffusion coefficient.  These results were also published in the Journal of Chemical Physics.   A total of eight Trinity undergraduates worked on the project; three of these have appeared as co-authors on the publications.
