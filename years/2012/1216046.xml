<AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;11 July 2012&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number:  1216046&lt;br/&gt;Institution:  University of Washington&lt;br/&gt;PI:   W. Wilcock&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal requests one Shipboard Scientific Support item for the University of Washington for the R/V THOMAS G. THOMPSON and the broader Academic Fleet; namely a group purchase of winch level wind up-grades for compliance with latest UNOLS research vessel safety standards.  This item will enhance safety, extend cable life and reliability, and provide greatly improved support capabilities to science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact and Intellectual Merit:  The PI addressed the Broader Impacts and Intellectual Merit of the proposed equipment specifically for the R/V THOMPSON and BARNES.  The research projects supported have been individually peer-reviewed for scientific merit.  The University of Washington vessels support federally funded scientific research throughout the world?s oceans to expand human knowledge of the ocean environment.  During operations, the vessels routinely expose graduate and undergraduate students to seagoing oceanography through the ?Teachers at Sea? program, real-time satellite connectivity from ship to shore, and University open house events.  All told, the THOMPSON and BARNES are scheduled to complete nearly 260 NSF sponsored days in 2012.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The National Science Foundation designated the University of Washington as the lead in developing and managing the NSF directed project to refurbish and upgrade the Markey DESH-5 hydrographic winches utilized on ships in the UNOLS fleet.   UW awarded a contract with Markey Machinery Company in 2012  to develop an upgraded flagging block level wind system that would enhance the performance of the DESH-5 winches while significantly extending the service lives of both the winches and the science wires.  The initial contract also required Markey to complete refurbishments of two winches from R/V Atlantis in conjunction with the implementation of the flagging block level wind upgrades.     A supplemental grant provided additional funds to continue the work initiated in this project while also enabling the upgrade and refurbishment of a DESH-5 winch that was installed on R/V Marcus Langseth in 2013.     Another supplmeental grant provided the funds to refurbish and upgrade a DESH-5 winch that was installed on R/V Roger Revelle in 2016.  A final supplemental grant allowed the refurbishment and upgrade of two DESH-5 winches that there installed on R/V Thomas G. Thompson in 2017.    In summary - six (6) winches were upgraded / refurbished.  These "refreshed" winches now enable science over-the-side operations higher sea states with significantly reduced wear and tear on the science wire.   We anticipate that the winches will now be able to operate successfully for the remaining service life for each of the four oceanographic research ships.
