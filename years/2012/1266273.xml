<AbstractNarration>This is a travel grant for students and junior researchers to participate in America's Conference on Wind Engineering. American Association for Wind Engineering holds this conference every four years. The next conference will be held in Seattle, Washington in June 2013. Not only is it important that the United States research community be represented at this prestigious conference for wind engineering in North and South America, it is critical that the students are encouraged to enter the field of wind engineering. The number of investigators pursuing research in wind hazards and their impact are relatively few in the country as compared to investigators in earthquake engineering. Windstorms such as hurricanes and tornadoes continue to cause an increasing amount of damage each year. It is important to deveoop individuals who are well versed in wind engineering and wind hazard mitigation research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In meeting with their international colleagues, the experienced researchers will present recent findings and discuss mitigation strategies for extreme wind events at the conference. Participation of students and junior faculty in this conference will broaden and expand their vision in wind engineering.  Lessons learned about how to prevent, respond and recover during and after an extreme wind event are essential to pursue research in life safety and mitigation of damages to civil infrastructure and to property. In addition, climate change, urban population shifts to coastal regions, and the federal mandate for increased renewable energy generation in the future, are important matters for scientific and engineering scrutiny and consideration that require a workforce familiar with wind engineering principles. It is important to engage and sustain students and young researchers in the wind engineering field. A concerted effort is planned to attract women and students from underrepresented groups to participate in the conference.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The 12th Americas Conference on Wind Engineering was held in Seattle, Washington on June 16-20, 2013.  Travel funds were provided to selected registrants through this grant.  A review panel of three engineering professionals - a senior professor (male), a junior professor (female) and a partner in a structural engineering firm (male) - screened individuals for funding based upon applications made through the conference website.  Calls for applications for travel grants were made though other venues such as the Structures Congress 2013 meeting, the American Association for Wind Engineering newsletter, the Puget Sound Chapter of the American Society of Meteorologists meeting, and the American Society of Civil Engineering online calendar.  Out of approximately two hundred total attendees from several countries, twenty-six students and eight junior faculty from US institutions were provided with travel awards so that they could attend the conference. Students were required to co-chair and assist with conference technical sessions.  The recipients were diverse with respect to geographical location and gender.  The conference provided a unique opportunity for US researchers to meet and present results to an international audience.  Collaborative research projects were discussed and initiated through this conference.  Participating in this conference provided professional development for all recipients.
