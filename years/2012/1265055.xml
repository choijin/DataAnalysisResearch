<AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;The proposed effort will use modern integrated wavelength division multiplexing to minimize the&lt;br/&gt;amount of external points of interface needed by optical probes while maximizing the total points of optical stimulation on an augmented electrophysiological neural recording probe. Array waveguide grating demultiplexers will be fabricated on neural probes and will be used to segregate multiple optical signals passed over a common fiber. The improvement of optical channel density will allow for more precise stimulation of local nuclei, enable high spatial and temporal multiplexing of selective stimulation of neurons and will allow for more flexibility when implanting neural probes. To allow for individual or multiple channels to be activated, the authors will build a ?polychromator? which will utilize a grating to separate spectral components from a broadband light source and project the spectrum onto a digital mirror device (DMD), similar to those found in digital projectors. Since the spectral information will be encoded spatially, spectral bands can be selected using the DMD by activating or deactivating columns of pixels. The resulting spectral bands will be collimated and used to provide a source with carefully controlled and manipulated spectral bands, allowing for direct spatial control of the stimulus through on-probe demultiplexing.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Optogenetics provides unprecedented capabilities for manipulating neural activity with light.  Significant advances have been made over the past decade in the development of excitatory and inhibitory opsins for optical control of cellular processes.  Complementary methods for delivering light with cellular precision in vivo are also required to use these technologies to maximum effect.   This project focused on the development and validation of nanophotonic probes that employ the toolkit of integrated silicon photonics, adapted to visible wavelengths.  Our probes facilitate the technique of wavelength division multiplexing (WDM), which is exceptionally well-suited for optogenetic probes because typically the optogenetic actuators expressed in neurons respond to a relatively broad spectrum of light (~50nm); this permits accommodating many spectral channels within their absorption bands.  Additionally, unique assignment of different wavelengths to specifically located emitting pixels (termed E-pixels) can be accomplished using array waveguide gratings (AWGs; Fig. 1), which are passive components that don't generate excess heat. Our prototype devices (Fig. 1) feature minimally-invasive implantable shanks having cross-section dimension of less than 18um X 20um at the tip, and of about 18um X 90um at the base.  These shanks comprise nine E-pixels that are collectively addressed spectrally through one single-mode optical fiber.  We implement the E-pixels using diffractive grating couplers (Fig. 2a). Measurements and simulations results indicate that E-pixels emit highly directional beams at a typical engineered angle ranging between 2 to 30 degrees normal to the probe surface (Fig. 3).  We characterize the width of these beams by imaging a beam in a fluorescein solution and in fixed mouse brain slices soaked overnight in a fluorescein solution, and by numerical simulations. The resulting in-plane and out-of-plane divergence angles are 1.7 and 1.25 respectively.  The resulting full width half maximum (FWHM) beam width at a distance of 200um from the probe shank is only 25um, which is on the order of neural cell body.  Our embodiment of the optical demultiplexer is realized with a visible wavelength AWG (Fig. 2b). AWGs are often implemented for use with infrared light in telecommunications technology, however, only rarely have they been realized within the visible spectrum. In contrast to previous demonstrations, the blue-wavelength AWGs in this work have a compact footprint of less than 150um X 150um, and thus are well suited for integration into our miniature photonic probes (Fig. 1). By appropriately synthesizing the multispectral light input, either individual E-pixels or a multiplicity of them can be addressed, independently and simultaneously (Fig. 3b).

The corresponding extracellular electrical recording for 10 seconds long pulses (Fig. 4) reveals repeated and intense multi-unit spiking activity in response to light pulses delivered by the photonic probe.  In a second experimental setup, the functionality of the probes was assessed via two-photon functional imaging of cortical neurons co-expressing both ChR2 and GCaMP6s. The photonic probe was inserted at an angle of ~35 degrees into cortical layer 2/3, and was directed upwards. The population of n...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
