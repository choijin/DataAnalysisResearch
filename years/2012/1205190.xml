<AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit.  The 2012 Rustbelt RNA Meeting will be held October 19-20, 2012, at the Crowne Plaza in Dayton, Ohio. The Rustbelt RNA Meeting is the major Midwest regional meeting of RNA researchers. The intellectual objective of the Rustbelt RNA Meeting is to provide an inexpensive, high-caliber, interdisciplinary meeting for RNA researchers in the Midwest. The field of RNA structure, function, and processing is growing at a rapid pace. RNA now has a demonstrated role in many important biological phenomena, such as carcinogenesis and development. Exciting new research areas, for example, to find functions for long noncoding RNAs, are bursting with new information that reaches into unexpected areas of cellular biochemistry. These functions are well beyond the obvious prominent role for RNA as a product of transcription, a template for translation, or as structural/catalytic components of spliceosomes and ribosomes. At the same time, the methods used to study RNA are becoming increasingly diverse, ranging from synthetic and physical chemistry to biochemistry, genetics, and biophysical approaches all the way to cellular imaging and computational methods. Exchange of information on topics such as these offers an excellent opportunity for improving understanding of basic mechanisms of gene expression mediated by RNA.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts.  The broader impact of the Rustbelt RNA Meeting is in trainee and junior faculty development. The Rustbelt RNA Meeting strongly emphasizes trainee participation. One major feature of the Rustbelt RNA Meeting is the participation of graduate and undergraduate students from a wide range of institutions (from large research-intensive universities to small, primarily undergraduate colleges). In addition to offering opportunities for interactions with principal investigators and other trainees, the Rustbelt RNA Meeting provides invaluable experience for trainees to present their research in an educational and supportive atmosphere. Importantly, trainees account for the majority of both poster and oral presentations. Such presentations instill confidence in the trainees and inspire trainees in the audience to present their results orally in the future. Students feel more comfortable to ask questions when the speaker is a fellow student. The smaller size of the Rustbelt RNA Meeting also benefits trainee presenters because of the greater attention paid to them by principal investigators. To encourage top-notch presentations, prizes are awarded for outstanding oral and poster presentations. Finally, the Rustbelt RNA Meeting is an excellent forum for junior investigators to network as well as to showcase their emerging research programs and develop new collaborations.</AbstractNarration>
