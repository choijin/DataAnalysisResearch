<AbstractNarration>This planning grant at Virginia Union University seeks to develop a strategy to establish a major program in Physics and Pre-Engineering in the School of Mathematics, Science and Technology. This project is in support of the institution's strategic plan and focuses on an assessment for long-term plans. Implementation plans will be developed through meetings, workshops and consultations with both internal and external evaluators. The planning process will include a self-study of the science, technology, and mathematics undergraduate programs, survey students and alumni, visit institutions with successful Physics and Pre-Engineering&lt;br/&gt;programs, and establish relationships with institutions who offer advanced degrees in engineering to examine reinstatement of a dual-degree engineering program at Virginia Union University. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project has great potential to positively impact the number of underrepresented minority students pursuing both undergraduate and advanced degrees in Physics and Engineering. The project also proposes to engage the private sector and national labs to ensure that workforce needs are appropriately addressed.</AbstractNarration>
