<AbstractNarration>1253890&lt;br/&gt;Anikeeva&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This CAREER proposal aims to bridge the gap between advanced optoelectronic&lt;br/&gt;materials design and invasive and outdated devices used to treat neurological&lt;br/&gt;disorders. By developing flexible, biocompatible polymer-based optoelectronic scaffolds&lt;br/&gt;(OPTELS) a strategy for incorporating individual optically sensitive neurons into neural&lt;br/&gt;recording and stimulation devices will be created. These trapped neurons will be&lt;br/&gt;investigated as relays of optical stimulation or inhibition to intact neural networks, which&lt;br/&gt;will potentially enable future clinical applications of optogenetics, a powerful optical&lt;br/&gt;neural stimulation tool, without genetic modification of the patient. Specifically the&lt;br/&gt;project will be focused on the following objectives: (1) Developing fiber-inspired&lt;br/&gt;fabrication methods for hollow-core polymer-based OPTELS and employing them to&lt;br/&gt;isolate key materials parameters (surface geometry, charge, flexibility) contributing to&lt;br/&gt;survival and growth of electronically active neurons; (2) Using OPTELS to investigate&lt;br/&gt;and control neuronal growth with the goal of axonal guidance along the OPTELS core.&lt;br/&gt;The proposed study will explore chemical, optoelectronic and mechanical stimuli and&lt;br/&gt;employ OPTELS ability to record and stimulate neural activity to determine factors&lt;br/&gt;contributing to axonal growth; (3) Employing neurons trapped in OPTELS cores as relay&lt;br/&gt;devices of optical neural interrogation. Genetic modification will be applied to the&lt;br/&gt;neurons trapped within the OPTELS cores to enable expression of light-sensitive ion&lt;br/&gt;channels - opsins. The controlled formation of synapses between these relay neurons&lt;br/&gt;and the outside networks will be applied to the investigation of optogenetic interrogation&lt;br/&gt;of the network without directly genetically modifying it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project will explore materials interfaces between optoelectronic devices&lt;br/&gt;and neural tissues providing a pathway towards intimate physiological neuroprosthetic&lt;br/&gt;devices for treatment of debilitating neurological conditions such as Parkinson's disease&lt;br/&gt;or spinal cord injury. The educational and outreach components of the project are&lt;br/&gt;designed to enhance materials engineering and optoelectronics education at MIT and at&lt;br/&gt;inner city community colleges through classroom training and hands-on laboratory&lt;br/&gt;internships. Specifically the outreach program aims to increase awareness about the&lt;br/&gt;impact of engineering in medicine among community college students and teachers&lt;br/&gt;through the seminar series "Medical Electronics and Optics: Life-saving Engineering",&lt;br/&gt;and 10-week research and education summer internships in the PIs laboratory. In&lt;br/&gt;addition new lecture material and device-design based assignments will be developed&lt;br/&gt;for the core undergraduate course on optical and electronic materials and a graduate&lt;br/&gt;photonics course will be adapted to senior undergraduates with the goal of advancing&lt;br/&gt;optoelectronics knowledge among the students. The educational materials will be made&lt;br/&gt;available to worldwide community of learners through an open MIT web-based&lt;br/&gt;resource.</AbstractNarration>
