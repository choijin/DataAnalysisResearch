<AbstractNarration>The LSAMP Alaska Alliance is the BS STEM undergraduate portion of a comprehensive longitudinal model that starts with middle school students, extends through high school, into the undergraduate years, on to graduate school and into the professions.  The project objective is to effect a systemic change in the hiring patterns in the fields of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) by increasing the number of individuals on a career path to leadership in STEM fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;LSAMP senior level funding will allow for:&lt;br/&gt;1. additional improvements to the undergraduate education experience by building upon the work we are doing at the critical junctures of the transition between high school and college and the transition from undergraduate to graduate school &lt;br/&gt;2. expansion of capacity for undergraduate research; &lt;br/&gt;3. building capacity to conduct international research projects; and &lt;br/&gt;4. strengthening LSAMP presence on the Alliance Community campuses.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Louis Stokes Alliances for Minority Participation (LSAMP) has catalyzed the development of a comprehensive longitudinal model with the Alaska Native Science &amp; Engineering Program (ANSEP) that begins working with middle school students, extends on through high school, into the undergraduate years, on to graduate school and into the professions. LSAMP is the university undergraduate portion of the model.  The objective of ANSEP is to effect a systemic change in the hiring patterns of Alaska Natives in the STEM professions. There are approximately 2,000 students in the pipeline. An evaluation conducted by the Urban Institute (2015) has found that our work improves the preparation, increases the participation, and ensures the contributions of Alaska Natives and others in the STEM enterprise.  We started in 1995 with a single student.  Since our first LSAMP award in 2001, we have been successful in leveraging our total LSAMP funds by a factor of more than 10.  These funds have been used to develop our model, institutionalize our work, and provide for sustainability.  We no longer need to remediate our students when they arrive for their freshman year.  ANSEP Systemic Changes     In 2006, we opened our canoe-shaped learning center on our campus.  It is equipped with computer labs and study space that is forever reserved as a home base for our university students. All of the funds for construction were provided by our partner organizations.  Ongoing maintenance is paid by the University of Alaska Anchorage. In 2010, we started building our longitudinal model down into middle school by focusing on academic and social preparation for college success.  Our students now come into the university hyper-prepared for science and engineering BS degree programs.  We have secured a second building on the UAA campus so that our middle school academy can operate continuously year-round.  Approximately 500 new middle school students are participating annually.  Seventy-seven percent of our middle school students successfully complete algebra 1 prior to eighth-grade graduation.  The national average for all students is 26% (Nord et al., 2011). In August 2016, we established a year-round Acceleration High School as an extension of the summertime Acceleration Academy which we have been operating since 2010.  The school has a capacity of 350 students.  In our Acceleration components, students earn university credits that count towards BS degree programs in classes taught by University faculty.  At the new high school, students can graduate in as little as three years with up to 45 credits earned that count toward BS STEM degree programs.  Acceleration students arrive at the university socially and academically hyper-prepared for success. We no longer need to remediate our students. In Fall 2018, we will be opening a second ANSEP Acceleration High School on the UAA campus. Since our first NSF award in 2001, we have increased the average annual underrepresented STEM BS graduate number from 16.67 to 53.4.  The Urban Institute (2015) found that 75% of our students enrolled in BS STEM degree programs since 2010 have either graduated or are still enrolled.  There were 445 minority STEM BS graduates during the most recent grant term. We have built our graduate success component with support from the Sloan Foundation and others so that more students transition into graduate school.  In Fall 2016, we have 13 graduate students statewide. We have developed state and other funding streams to support a full-time professional staff of 13 and a temporary staff of up to 60 during peak periods of pre-college activity. In 2008, our partner organizations provided the funding for the Dr. Herbert P. Schroeder endowed chair so that there will be a faculty advocate for minority students in Alaska in perpetuity along with funds to support programmatic activities. We have developed a ?Grow our own Ph.D.? component where students earn PhDs and return to join the tenure-track faculty.  Two ANSEP graduates have done this so far, and are on the University of Alaska Anchorage College of Engineering faculty.  One is the only civil engineering Ph.D. in the world who happens to be Alaska Native and the other is the only engineering education Ph.D. in the world who happens to be Alaska Native.  They are the first ever tenure-track underrepresented minority faculty in engineering.             Last Modified: 02/01/2018       Submitted by: Herb Schroeder]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
