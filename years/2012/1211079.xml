<AbstractNarration>This project will design and implement "Myrmex", a novel crowdsourcing system for physical-world tasks. For example, an elderly community member could use Myrmex for help getting mail from a remote post office, as the system would assign the task to a participant who routinely passes that way. Myrmex leverages the capacity of computers (monitoring, matching participants to tasks) to facilitate human activity (assigning and performing tasks). The project will: 1) develop new privacy-preserving methods for location and context tracking; 2) design and implement incentives for continuous use of a new social system; and 3) create and implement models of best times and places to notify and offer tasks for participants.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts: The Myrmex system will help strengthen bonds and connectivity within a community and provide assistance for community members for running their daily lives. Matching tasks and people based on locations and paths will also help conserve resources and benefit the environment due to the reduced travel miles needed to perform a task.  The project will provide multidisciplinary training for undergraduate and graduate students. It will also provide the research community with an anonymized dataset of human mobility patterns and task activities, and tools to analyze human behavior.</AbstractNarration>

We studied the motivations and experiences of individuals who regularly complete physical-world tasks posted in on-demand mobile workforce marketplaces. Our results revealed the main drivers for participating in an on-demand mobile workforce, including desires for monetary compensation and control over schedules and task selection. We also identified the main reasons for task selection, which include situational factors, convenient physical locations, and task requester profile information.  We designed and implemented a novel smartphone platform for Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA). This platform was utilized in several interdisciplinary collaborations and within the project. These collaborations included studies with clinical psychologists to examine the real-time emotional experiences and functions of nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI), and with social scientists to measure and understand inequality in neighborhood experiences.   We discovered that utilizing personality traits in machine learning prediction models improved the accuracy of predicting people?s busyness, availability and willingness to participate in tasks. Our model for predicting the levels of people?s busyness was a substantial improvement over state of the art methods.  The project resulted in the Rutgers Hazard Tracker app. This is a public policy innovation and has made an impact beyond science, engineering and the academic world. The app allows easy and simple physical-world crowdsourcing for documenting hazards by volunteers.  The innovation here is that when problems are clearly documented and presented to the utilities, they have to deal with the problems. Utility companies are not able to brush the issues aside or claim they were unaware of issues after a natural disaster. The collaboration with a township allowed volunteers to cover over 250 miles of electrical and utility systems and identify roughly 350 hazards that were subsequently attended to by the township?s utilities.  Several hundreds of media outlets including several well-known and prestigious press, broadcast TV and radio networks, in the United States and around the world featured our research.  We have made the source code publicly available for the major software prototypes and study applications generated in the project.  Finally, the project trained several undergraduate and graduate students in the areas of security and privacy engineering, mobile computing and human-computer interaction. The project also promoted many students underrepresented in STEM disciplines.       Last Modified: 12/14/2017       Submitted by: Janne Lindqvist]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
