<AbstractNarration>This collaborative research investigates a new class of dialog-based, home robotic healthcare assistants to facilitate a new level of in-home, real-time care to elderly and depressed patients, providing lower total costs and higher quality of life. An emotive, physical avatar, called a companionbot, which possesses the ability to engage humans in a way that is unobtrusive and suspends disbelief will be built in this project. The companionbot will be an integration of human language technology, vision, other sensory processing and emotive robotic technology to proactively recognize and dialog with isolated and elderly patients suffering from depression. The companionbot will utilize proactive or companionable dialog based on the context with users suffering from depression. This will require the first multimodal integration of a user model, environment model, and temporal processing with spoken dialog understanding and generation to produce dynamic dialog and emotive interaction, beyond the traditional scripted dialog and emotion. Object recognition, facial expression recognition, and human activity recognition will augment natural language processing to provide current and historical context important to dynamic dialog. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A team of skilled researchers, assembled from the University of Colorado Boulder, University of Denver, CU Anschutz Medical Campus, and Boulder Language Technologies, will work together to achieve the project goals. The investigators will use the companionbots as a tool to run clinical trials to monitor and dialog with their partners to detect signs of physical and emotional deterioration. The companionbots can then notify remote caregivers, as necessary, provide warnings, reminders, life coaching and therapeutic dialog, extending independence and quality of life, and even saving lives. The other benefits of such a system include continuous, annotated data to improve doctor-patient interaction and analysis, real-time monitoring of mental state for remote healthcare providers and, ultimately, real-time intervention as part of a comprehensive treatment strategy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition, this research will promote both STEM practice and research education at the graduate and the undergraduate levels of the affiliated institutions. The companionbots are ideal for teaching the next generation of engineers and scientists in critical emerging technologies, as they permit either a deep focus on specific topics or an interdisciplinary perspective while providing a simple high-level interface to manage everything else. Furthermore, the project will develop related educational material to support others and will provide public outreach to K-12 classes in the area.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Summary:  The Companionbots project focused on the creation of components of a new class of dialogue-based, home robotic healthcare assistants to facilitate in-home, real-time care for elderly and depressed patients, improving their quality of life and reducing the total cost of care. The project has advanced home healthcare companion robot technology that integrates human language technology, machine vision, and other sensory processing to proactively recognize and address potential physical and mental health problems. The benefits of an eventual integrated system include continuous, labeled data to improve doctor-patient interaction, real-time monitoring of mental and physical state for remote healthcare providers and, ultimately, real-time intervention as part of a comprehensive treatment strategy.  Intellectual Merit:  These Companionbots offer the potential of a profound transformative effect on healthcare, and society in general as the percentage of people over the age of 65 increases dramatically, from 12% to 20%, over the next two decades. This is the first work with the aim of proactive companionable and therapeutic dialogue with users suffering from depression. To achieve this, the companionbots must exhibit more robust spoken dialogue based on context. This requires the first multimodal integration of a user model with spoken dialogue understanding and generation to produce dynamic emotive interaction, beyond the traditional scripted dialogue.  The project has produced state-of-the-art results in recognizing a person?s communicative intent, predicting a person?s next communication goal, determining when it is your turn to speak, recognizing resistance to health behavior change, identifying the topic of the conversation, recognizing negativity in someone?s language, recognizing the things a person likes (and dislikes) discussing, and learning concepts based on interactions with participants.  Broader Impact:  Advanced Discovery &amp; Understanding While Promoting Teaching, Training &amp; Learning: The companionbots provide an exciting platform for both STEM practice and research education at the graduate and the undergraduate level, and provides the supporting technology that will allow disciplinary or interdisciplinary student researchers to become productive quickly and focus on their areas of interest. The companionbot?s are ideal for teaching the next generation of engineers and scientists in critical emerging technologies, as they permit either a deep focus on specific topics or an interdisciplinary perspective while providing a simple high-level interface to manage everything else.   Broadening Participation: The Companionbots project has encourage much higher participation in science and engineering research by women, in part, because many are inspired by helping others and are drawn in by the healthcare, cognitive, and social interaction aspects of the research enabled.   Enhanced Infrastructure: The Companionbots project has established a state-of-the-art open infrastructure to support healthcare and fundamental STEM research and has facilitated new interdisciplinary collaboration opportunities across the university. As an integral part of Companionbots, numerous corpora and datasets will be developed and released to the broader research communities.  Benefits to Society: Companionbots will open the door to a new world of important healthcare and healthcare research and the consequent possibility of vastly improved quality of life for numerous people, especially for our parents and our aging population. Improved healthcare support for the elderly is vital to avert the severe impending pressures (care-based, economic &amp; social) expected due to our aging population.
