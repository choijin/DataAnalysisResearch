<AbstractNarration>This project develops techniques for finding non-Shannon information inequalities and strives to geometrically characterize the space of vectors whose components are the entropies of subsets of jointly distributed discrete random variables.  Specific sub-topics include the geometric description of inner and outer entropic region bounds, such as: the Shannon space, the Ingleton space, the common information space, the linearly representable space, and the copy region space. In addition, a unified approach to many important mathematical questions with engineering applications is studied using information theoretic inequality implications.  Special cases include: random variable conditional independence implications, entropic region membership, information inequality identification, and network coding capacity bounding.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The problems in this field are of interest as fundamental theoretical questions and are also strongly motivated by communications applications in the area of network coding.  Most of the study is analytic in nature, but the project also exploits computer assisted discovery and verification of new non-Shannon information inequalities for four and more random variables using techniques based upon auxiliary variables.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The discovery of new non-Shannon information inequalities provides improved bounds on the set of all entropic points.  Such improved bounds lead to better bounds on the transmission capacity of networks.  Calculating the capacity of a network is traditionally an extremely difficult, and usually intractible, problem.  New inequalities also shed light on the basic understanding of both probability and information theory fundamentals.  As information theory has proven to be an important and practical field over the last half century, a firm theoretical basis for it is necessary.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are some broader impacts resulting from the proposed activity: The project involves active participation of graduate students, undergraduates, and also high school students, commensurate with their backgrounds and abilities. Graduate student participation provides training for careers in academia and industry.  Undergraduate participation encourages research as a career and steers students towards academia and research in general.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project concerns the mathematical foundations of passing information in a network.  In most information networks, packets are passed using the technique of routing.  With the technique of network coding, packets are combined to increase the throughput of the network. This technique takes advantage of under-used communication links.  However, the theory of network coding is still in its infancy, though it has been shown to be closely tied to the study of information inequalities.  If the codes are linear, then the throughput is closely connected to Linear Rank Inequalities.  A primary goal of this project is to linear rank inequalities in order to better understand the potential improvement that can be achieved using network coding.  In 3 variables, the Shanon Inequalities completely describe the linear rank space.  In 4 variables, there is an additional inequality known as the Ingleton Inequality.   We have a complete list of linear rank inequalities in 5 variables.  It turns out there are 28 of them.  They are now published on the arXiv along with a proof that the list is complete.  In 6 variables, the complexity explodes.  We have now identified 6.4 million new linear rank inequalities and have proved each of them to be sharp.  That is, each of them contains a face on the Linear Rank Space. The work is too massive to put into a research paper and the list grows daily.  However, they have been kept on a website for all to see and the main results were presented at a conference on Network Coding in Paris, Feb,2016.    In seven variables, we have discovered that there are Linear Rank Inequalities that are characteristic dependent.  This suggests that their structure is much more complicated than previously thought.  In particular, it implies the Linear Rank Space is not convex.  The results were published in a paper, "Characteristic-Dependent Linear Rank Indqualities with Applications to Network Coding".  This paper shows that certain 7-variable linear rank inequalities hold in some characteristics and not in others.  These results have since been expanded to show that for any finite or co-finite set of characteristics, there is a linear rank inequality that holds only for those in the set.  In fact, there is a network that is linearly solvable if and only if the field characteristic is in the given set.
