<AbstractNarration>The general question of how epizootics are initiated and terminated in marine invertebrate populations and how this process is supported by transmission provides a basis for expanding the evaluation of marine disease outbreaks. Addressing this question requires development of a theoretical framework for disease transmission among invertebrates in marine systems. Such a framework will contribute to the general advancement of the understanding of the Ecology of Marine Infectious Diseases (EMID). This proposal outlines a combined experimental and modeling effort that will provide a general theory for marine invertebrate diseases. The model will be informed using Dermo disease, caused by Perkinsus marinus, in Eastern oysters (Crassostrea virginica), as an experimental system. However, the model will be applicable to all sessile or nearly sessile species whose movement is restricted to small scales (e.g. bivalves, gastropods, sea urchins, corals) and to a range of hydrodynamic regimes from estuaries to lagoons to coral reef tracts. This project is interdisciplinary and is integrated across several disciplines. The team has a unique mixture of expertise in molluscan pathology and epizootiology, genetics, and modeling of coastal and estuarine systems, disease processes and the genetic milieu, as well as a long history of successful collaborative research. By integrating our expertise across disciplines, this project promises to provide novel insights into the disease transmission process for infectious diseases that are poorly described by traditional susceptible-infected-resistant models built upon contact rates. This deficiency in modeling disease transmission is widespread across many taxa of sessile marine organisms. The project also responds to the recommendations in EMID workshops for the development of general frameworks for marine diseases that can be applied to specific systems and to understanding the determinants of transmission of diseases and the spread of pathogens by environmental factors. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results of this project will provide an important advancement in the theoretical basis for modeling diseases and disease transmission in marine systems. This project will contribute to the training of students and early career scientists in disciplines of genetics, pathology, genomics, and population and circulation modeling that is needed to solve many of the important problems associated with fisheries and marine coastal systems. Project results will be disseminated through scientific conferences, publication in the peer-review literature, and websites. Project results will be used in ongoing outreach efforts through a collaborative outreach program between the Department of STEM Education and the Center for Coastal Physical Oceanography at Old Dominion University. Additional outreach will be through the Partnership for the Delaware Estuary and the Bayshore Discovery Project, organizations engaged in public outreach for Delaware Bay.</AbstractNarration>

The trends in Dermo disease, oyster length, and oyster sex ratio all are consistent with the hypothesis that increasing temperature during the 2000s resulted in an increase in <em>P. marinus</em> infection intensity sufficient to increase the mortality rate in late summer and fall in the larger animals (Figure 3). This simultaneously reduced Dermo prevalence in the winter at the time of sampling and resulted in the decline in the length of the largest animals. Coincident with the decline in length is the expected decline in the fraction female, such that the percent female in the largest animals dropped to &lt;50% throughout much of the Gulf of Mexico.

This project investigated experimentally and theoretically the relationships between the (1) number of infective particles in the water column and the acquisition of these by invertebrate filter feeder populations, such as oysters, and the (2) interactions between virulence of the infective particles and susceptibility of the invertebrate population to infection.  Sessile hosts such as oysters are exposed to water-borne parasites through suspension feeding. Mesocosm experiments showed that oysters, and their associated community of suspension-feeding organisms, compete for suspended particles, including water-borne parasites. Changes in oyster density and the composition of oyster reef communities influence the rate oysters become exposed to water-borne parasites.  Experimental genetics studies showed that Dermo disease infection intensity in oysters is positively correlated with pathogen (Perkinsus marinus) dosage at early but not late life stage, suggesting there is genetic difference in susceptibility at low dosages, but later re-infection would overwhelm almost all oysters. At the same dosage and early life stage, wild oysters were infected faster and at higher intensities than selected resistant oysters, again suggesting some genetic differences in susceptibility at early stages.  An important outcome from this project is development of a theoretical basis for mathematical representations of the dynamics and epizootiology of a diverse array of marine infectious diseases, with focus on the processes that interact to drive the initiation and termination of epizootics. Epidemiological theory is adapted to develop coupled marine disease-population models for sessile marine invertebrates that are then embedded in a hydrodynamic model (i.e. Regional Ocean Modeling System, ROMS).  The mesocosm and genetic studies informed the development of this model.   Simulation results from the marine disease-population model show that the relationship between filter feeder population density and infective particle acquisition is bimodal; high and low densities can mitigate against disease development.  For Dermo disease, high population densities, now only found in aquaculture, can limit disease invasion through foraging interference and depletion of infective particles in the water column (Figure 1), but no density is low enough to suppress disease development.  The basic reproduction number (R0), a measure of epizootic potential of a disease, estimated from the model for Dermo disease is 90, in comparison to a value of &lt;1 for a disease in a non-epizootic state. Simulations showed that management approaches to control Dermo disease should focus on optimizing performance of the diseased stock.  Pandemic disease also depends on diffusion and advection of infective particles in the water column.
