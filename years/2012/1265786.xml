<AbstractNarration>The goals of this research project are to (1) assess how new data streams available during a crisis can improve logistical decisions, and (2) facilitate data stream integration into humanitarian logistics operations, such as search-and-rescue (SAR) and relief distribution efforts. Since the devastating January 2010 Haitian earthquake, there has been an increasing use and a deeper understanding of the role of new technologies in disaster relief, as well as the challenges of integrating these technologies into response activities. The deliverables of this project will be a comprehensive data source taxonomy focused on humanitarian logistics and a formal description of the necessary processes to prepare real-time datasets for use in humanitarian emergencies. Furthermore, this work will identify needed advances in dynamic routing models to accommodate these new data streams and the complex set of decisions in the field. Field-based activities will bring together undergraduate/graduate students, faculty and practitioners.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ultimately, this project will provide a framework for researchers in the field to further this line of work. The project also identifies a new class of routing models that combine orienteering and path planning problems needed to address the challenges of these unique problem settings. Integration of emerging data streams into humanitarian logistics, such as SAR operations, has potential to save lives and minimize suffering of people affected by natural disaster and other crises. The likelihood of success in model creation and implementation in practice will increase with a series of ongoing conversations between practitioners, inter-disciplinary research teams, humanitarian organizations and the broader crisis mapping community. This research will also impact undergraduate and graduate students by exposing them to new applications of their operations research knowledge.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The response to the January 2010 Haitian earthquake marked a transition in disaster relief characterized by an unprecedented use of digital technology to collect and disseminate information.  The years since have seen a deepened understanding of the role of new technologies in disaster relief, as well as the severe challenges of putting these technologies to use. The goals of this project are to (1) assess how new data streams available during a crisis can improve logistical decisions, and (2) facilitate integration of data streams into humanitarian logistics operations, such as search-and-rescue (SAR) and relief distribution efforts.  The key activities of the project are analysis of relevant data streams, development of dynamic stochastic routing models for humanitarian logistics and continual feedback with practitioners throughout the project.  Intellectual merit  In this project, the team developed a comprehensive data source taxonomy focused on humanitarian logistics and a formal description of the necessary processes to prepare real-time datasets for use in humanitarian emergencies.  The taxonomy and analysis of data streams provide a framework for other researchers in the field of humanitarian logistics to further this line of work.  The investigation of available data sources used to create the taxonomy revealed a lack of real-time data related to transportation infrastructure.   Many models in operations engineering for humanitarian logistics make assumptions about the transportation networks and availability of data, which this research has shown might be more challenging than expected.   Thus, our team developed imputation methods to fill in necessary gaps to capture the current state of transportation networks immediately following a disaster.  Further, the development and dissemination of a publically available data set from the Haiti earthquake will allow researcher to evaluate their models and solution approaches on a consistent data set.  Additionally, the project introduced a new class of routing models combining orienteering and path planning problems that address the challenges of the problem settings. New solution approaches, focused on finding adaptive policies and addressing uncertainty and dynamic data streams, expand the use of such logistical models.     Broader impacts  Integration of emerging streams of data into humanitarian logistics, such as search and rescue operations, has potential to save lives and minimize suffering of people affected by natural disasters and other crises.  The likelihood of success in model creation and implementation in practice can increase with ongoing conversations between practitioners, inter-disciplinary research teams, humanitarian organizations and the broader crisis mapping community.  This project was an important step in these conversations.  This project has exposed undergraduate and graduate students to new applications of their operations research knowledge. This work has engaged students in humanitarian logistics and train them to be leaders in the field.       Last Modified: 10/01/2018       Submitted by: Karen R Smilowitz]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
