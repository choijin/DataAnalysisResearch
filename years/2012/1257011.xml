<AbstractNarration>The Schloss Dagstuhl - Leibniz Center for Informatics is one of the leading computer science research centers worldwide. Dagstuhl hosts more than 3000 internationally renowned researchers each year in Germany, in seminars on the important topics and the recent developments in computer science and its application to science, technology, and society.  Many of these seminars are organized with the participation of researchers from the United States. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award provides support for the participation of US-based junior faculty researchers in the Dagstuhl seminars and activities. It offers them the opportunity to meet the leading scientists in the world in a collegial setting during the weeklong seminars and gain valuable experience with the larger scientific community.  It is a competitive process of selection, providing support for an estimated 80 scholarships annually for three years, open to all Dagstuhl seminars.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This grant supported outstanding junior researchers based in the US to attend Dagstuhl Seminars and Dagstuhl Perspectives Workshops. These are a series of highly selective international scientific meetings geared towards work in progress in research areas of emerging relevance in or involving computer science.  These meetings take place at Schloss Dagstuhl -- Leibniz Center for Informatics, a remote site in Germany, whose facilities are especially set up to foster scientific interaction and communication.

The goal of this grant was to give young and exceptionally promising researchers from the United States, who are most likely to benefit from attending Dagstuhl Seminars, the means to do so in the form of financial support for travel and accommodations.  During the period of March 2015 till the end of September 2019, this grant provided 176 junior scientists (including 55 women) based in the US with travel and accommodation support in order to attend 136 Dagstuhl Seminars.  The intellectual merit of this program is at least two-fold. On the one hand the junior researchers clearly benefit from the close interaction and discussions with such a select group of international researchers as typically found at Dagstuhl. On the other hand also the seminars benefit from the presence of the junior researchers as they often can contribute new ideas or techniques novel to the topic at hand.  Participation in Dagstuhl events has a broader impact on the careers of junior scientists. Immediate access to top researchers and the opportunity to present own work before senior colleagues, two key components of the Dagstuhl experience, can significantly shape not just the scientific work of junior researchers but also their careers.
