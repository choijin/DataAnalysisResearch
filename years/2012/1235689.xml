<AbstractNarration>This award provides support for a workshop, jointly sponsored by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and the National Science Foundation (NSF), to be held in June 2012 in Reston, Virginia, to develop a research agenda (roadmap) for critically needed windstorm and coastal inundation impact reduction basic and applied (problem-focused) research.  Of interest to the NSF-supported wind engineering research community will be the long-term research agenda, with broad strategic approach and objectives, for basic research needs for wind hazard mitigation for buildings, structures, and lifelines, including new and existing construction.  Topics to be explored at the workshop include performance-based design; computational fluid dynamics; characterization of flood flow around buildings, including the influence of scour and flood-borne debris; and impact of research on loss reduction.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop will be led by an organizing steering committee and include experts from science and engineering disciplines related to wind hazard mitigation and community resilience research.  Their interaction and synergy at the workshop will result in a rigorous set of recommendations that illuminates the most important research directions for the wind engineering field.  The outcome of the workshop will be a report that outlines a five-to-ten year roadmap for basic wind engineering research. The report will be made available through the Applied Technology Council web site at https://www.atcouncil.org/.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Grand challenges identified in this report were developed by participants in an NSF-sponsored workshop. These grand challenges focus on research needs for windstorms and coastal inundation. Develop Simulation Techniques to Predict Disaster Losses  For non-synoptic windstorms (e.g., thunderstorms, tornadoes), develop simulation methods of physics-based storm parameters and tracks of differing probabilities over populated areas to predict losses using local topography and building stock information (similar to HAZUS software for hurricanes). The data required for the simulations should be developed in a way that facilitates collection and inputting into the simulation models, improving upon existing data collection and inputting techniques. The purpose of these simulation tools would be to develop more efficient and cost-effective building and infrastructure designs and design strategies and to predict windstorm disaster losses more accurately.  Define Hazard Characteristics of Wind Interacting With Other Environmental Effects Windstorms most often are accompanied by other environmental effects, such as storm surge, rain, and wind-borne debris. The influence on building designs and event losses caused by the simultaneous impact of wind and one or more of these other environmental effects is not well understood and has been inadequately considered in current design practices. Studies have been conducted on the effect of high winds and wind-driven rain, but the combined effects of high winds with storm surge at a building site have not been studied in any substantive way. Results from research studies of the combined effects of these hazards could significantly improve designs, suggest changes in materials being specified, and reduce losses. DevelopæSmartÆ Buildings  æSmartÆ buildings would have wind performance monitoring systems built into the building that could provide information on building health or damage, and assist in predicting possible collapse, warning any building occupants of impending dangers, predicting excessive drift caused by wind, or alerting an owner about infiltration of either excessive amounts of water or air.  Develop Observation and Measurement Technologies for Coastal Flood Hazard, Load, and Building Response Data Collection  Complete coastal inundation hazard data include time histories of water elevation, wave height and velocity, amount and type of sediment, and amount and characterization of flood-borne debris. There currently are no technologies or systems that provide this information even though some of the data is usually available for some locations after coastal flood events. Information on velocity and sediment is currently not available at all during or after a storm. Technologies should be able to generate flood load information from the flood hazard data (e.g., water elevation, wave heights and velocities) using hazard mapping information that incorporates inundation level and elevations to predict building response. Buildings and other structures should be instrumented in a hurricane coastline-wide programto validate flood and flood-borne debris loads.  Integrate Coastal Inundation Hazard Mapping at Parcel-Level Scales, With Flood Hazard Information Physics-based flood mapping methodology is needed that will provide both inundation limits and elevations at any building site using GPS coordinates. The methodology should include both coastal influences, as well as rainfall runoff, and be available to users electronically, using GPS coordinates for the location. This technology should be capable of providing the flood load information for the GPS location of interest.  Develop Probabilistic Storm Surge And Tsunami Models That Incorporate Changing and Future Conditions  Methodologies are needed to determine probabilistic flood risks for short- and long-return periods for both hurricanes and tsunamis, considering changing and future conditions. These changing and future conditions include sea...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
