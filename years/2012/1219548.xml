<AbstractNarration>With National Science Foundation support, Drs. Timothy Scarlett, Kostalena Michelaki and Carl Lipo from Michigan Technological University, Arizona State University and California State University-Long Beach respectively will lead an interdisciplinary and multinational team of collaborators to investigate the newly discovered Rehydroxylation Dating Technique (RHX dating) for fired-clay ceramic artifacts. The technique works by measuring the mass of water that has bonded with clay mineral crystals in a ceramic fragment, then measuring the temperature-dependent rate at which that ceramic sample reabsorbs and bonds with water, and finally using those measures to calculate each fragment's age (or time since last firing). If it proves reliable and accurate, this new dating tool could revolutionize archaeological practice around the world. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The researchers will collaborate with counterparts at Tel Aviv University, as well as teams of faculty and student researchers at the Universities of Manchester, Edinburgh, and Bradford. The faculty and student research teams will engage in a series of "blind" RHX dating tests on the same set of carefully chosen samples. The international teams will determine if experimental results can be independently replicated by different labs currently doing RHX research, including statistical evaluations of rates of error and repeatability, measuring the effects of temperature and humidity on the RHX process, and examining the possible effects of artifact storage conditions on dating outcomes. Ultimately, the combined results of these experiments will allow the collaborators to refine the model that best describes the rehydration/rehydroxylation process. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This new dating technique, if proven valid and reliable, will effect substantial changes on archaeological practice. Studies of ceramic technology and practice are central to archaeological research into larger questions of human adaptation, cultural processes and change, colonization, and trade and exchange. With a comparatively minor initial investment, almost any archaeology lab in the world could set up the relatively inexpensive instrumentation and begin producing RHX dates for ceramic samples. The technical staff would not need a great deal of advanced training or support. This technique, if proven, will provide an inexpensive tool that can be widely available for scientists around the world. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will have broad impacts on teaching, training, and learning in archaeological science. Drs. Scarlett, Michelaki and Lipo have built their research collaboration by creating discovery-based, hands-on learning opportunities for multidisciplinary teams of graduate and undergraduate students.</AbstractNarration>

However, it is difficult to date them accurately and precisely. By comparing the shapes and/or decorative motifs of pots we can put them in relative order but we cannot provide an actual calendar date. Thermoluminescence (TL) can date individual sherds, but it is complicated and expensive, requiring samples from securely excavated contexts and specialist labs and technicians. Museum or survey ceramics cannot be dated with TL. This limits our understanding of several regions in the world.  Ceramic Rehydroxylation Dating (RHX) was presented in 2009 by scientists at Manchester University in England as a technique that could solve these problems. For low cost and with high precision RHX could date the last time a ceramic had been fired, using simple measures (weight change), undertaken with simple infrastructure.  The basic principles of the method are simple. Clay, even when dry, contains in its chemical composition water molecules known as æhydroxylsÆ. This is known as æchemical waterÆ. The water potters add to clay to make a pot is mechanically bound to the clay platelets, but not part of the chemical structure.  During the early stages of firing a pot, the mechanically bound water is driven off. At that point the pot has dehydrated. As the temperature rises, the chemically bound water disappears. When that happens dehydroxylation has occurred. The dating clock has been set to zero.  When the pot is taken out of the fire it rehydrates, absorbing moisture from the environment until it equilibrates with it. Water molecules (xydroxyls) also begin to return into the chemical structure of the ceramic. Rehydroxylation, is a slow chemical process dependent on temperature.  The Manchester team described the rate of rehydroxylation as a power law, and stated that mass gain during rehydroxylation increases as the fourth root of the time since last firing. Thus, if we can figure out the mass gain, then we can figure out how long it has taken for this gain to occur, given that we know the rate at which it is happening.

Our samples were taking a very long time to dehydrate and dehydroxylate in the first phase of the experiment. We made changes in our protocol, following the advances our colleagues at MTU and CSU-Long Beach were making, but we could still not date our Neolithic samples accurately.
