<AbstractNarration>The object of this proposal is to pursue new approaches to some fundamental problems in Galois theory, following recent breakthroughs in this subject.  The focus of research will be on lifting finite (possibly ramified) Galois covers of smooth projective curves over a commutative ring and on finding small rings of definition for such lifts.  These problems pertain to the classical Inverse Galois Problem as well as to the question of finding the relations between etale fundamental groups of various kinds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal deals with fundamental questions about the solutions of algebraic equations.  The study of the symmetries of such equations has been the motivation for the development of much of abstract algebra.  Advances in abstract algebra have been essential to the development of modern technology.  Some particular examples of applications of abstract algebra include the compression and transmission of data, cryptography, search algorithms and solving optimization problems in the physical sciences, engineering and economics.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project (a Focused Research Group) was a coordinated effort by faculty at USC, the University of Pennsylvania and the University of Virginia to attack some central problems in the theory of coverings of curves.  The basic question is when can a cover of smooth projective curves in positive characteristic lift to characteristiic zero.  The main conjecture was stated by Oort many years ago and this was recently proved. The PI's from USC and Penn had formulated a more general conjecture and had developed some machinery to attack this problem.  A new obstruction to lifting was obtained (called the KGB obstruction).  The problem is still open but some special cases were solved, a local-global principle was proved and numerous publications were produced.  New ideas and techniques have been developed to attack this problem but also other related problems.  A more general conjecture was formulated in terms of the KGB obstruction mentioned above. Very siignificant progress was made on classifying automorphism groups of an important family of curves called Katz-Gabber curves.  One paper has been submitted and another paper with a much more general result is in progress.  Work on these projects will continue.    In terms of broader impact, three graduate students were partially supported at USC and another four students have been supported at Penn and Virginia. Several of the thesis topics of the students are directly related to this project.   There was also a week long workshop entitled Lifting Theorems and Galois Theory held in Banff, Canada (at the Banff International Research Station) from August 16 to August 21.  There were 42 participants including several graduate students and postdocs.   Many of the participants travel expenses were supported by the grants.
