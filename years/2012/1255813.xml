<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project focuses on the design and construction of a medical device that treats ischemic stroke by virtue of breaking-down endovascular occlusions using a proprietary Electro-Fluidic Thrombolysis (EFT) technology.  EFT utilizes low energy electrical pulses to create acoustic micro shockwaves (along with vigorous fluidic effects) that will efficiently emulsify clot into sub-capillary size particles.  This effect generates vigorous fluidic motion with no moving parts based solely on the interaction of short voltage pulses with conductive liquids (such as saline or blood).  The electrical pulses are delivered via microelectrodes into an engineered tip design at the distal end of a catheter, causing a suction of the nearby occlusive material into the tip for further safe emulsification without causing any damage to the surrounding tissue.  Currently available therapies to physicians offer low performance as they take hours to complete the treatment.  In the case of clot-busting drugs, the added contraindications limit their use to less than 4% of the population.  The expected speed and effectiveness of EFT will offer improved patient outcomes, and reduced costs; since in the case of stroke, lack of effective therapies are associated with enormous costs for rehabilitation and long term care.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will be the development of a disposable microcatheter that works as an intelligent delivery system along with an inexpensive voltage generator for the effective and safe emulsification of intracranial occlusions for the treatment of ischemic stroke.  Ischemic Stroke remains the third leading cause of death in the US with approximately 20% of the nearly 700,000 annual victims dying shortly after the initial attack, while most survivors require full or part?time care.  The understanding of the effects of short electrical pulses with conductive liquids (such as saline or blood) and the resultant mechanical and fluid-dynamic effects would be essential in transforming this technology to a true platform technology with several medical applications.  Although the initial market focus is ischemic stroke, it is believed that this platform technology can also be used to recanalize coronary and peripheral vessels.  The proposed approach to endovascular thrombolysis offers several advantages over drug therapy and other medical devices, including improved patient safety, more rapid recanalization and fewer contraindications.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Ischemic Stroke remains the third leading cause of death in the US with approximately 20% of the nearly 800,000 annual victims dying shortly after the initial attack, while most survivors require full or part&ndash;time care.  For this grant, Oramic proposed the use of the companyÆs proprietary Electro-Fluidic Thrombolysis (EFTTM) technology that utilizes low energy electrical pulses to create vigorous fluidic effects and acoustic micro shockwaves to efficiently emulsify a thrombotic occlusion. Stroke is the leading cause of serious, long-term disability in the United States, with an estimated direct and indirect cost of $73.7 billion in 2010.  In the future, the proposed modality could be modified to address occlusions in other vascular anatomies (coronary and peripheral); thus greatly expanding the marketplace of the underlying technology.  The fluidic motion of the EFTTM effect can be engineered with no moving parts based solely on the interaction of short voltage pulses with conductive liquids (such as saline or blood).  The overall system consists of a low-cost pulsed voltage supply and a disposable microcatheter (&le;1mm OD) capable of navigating the tortuous neurovasculature with a multitude of microelectrodes embedded in it.  The microcatheter can be used in conjunction with standard guiding catheters and guidewires through femoral access, utilizing established interventional techniques. The expected speed, effectiveness, and low cost of EFT can offer Interventional Neuro Radiologists (INRs) a superior alternative with improved patient outcomes, and reduce overall costs; since in the case of stroke, lack of effective therapies are associated with enormous expenditures for rehabilitation and long term care. Stroke is clearly an area with unmet needs for both patients and physicians.  Patients suffer the consequences of stroke while the medical community remains disheartened due to the limited treatment options available for this patient population.  Barriers to successful acute stroke therapy include physiologic time to restoration of blood flow, patient knowledge and behavior regarding acute stroke symptoms, risk of recanalization therapies with a damaged blood brain barrier, and access to well organized delivery of care.  Multi-modal recanalization therapies suited to fit specific anatomy need to be studied. Although there were many notable innovations that emerged as a result of this grant; like in pulsed RF delivery for medical applications, RF microelectrode development into medical micro-catheter constructs with sub mm dimensions, engineered microfluidic engines driven by RF micro-electrodes for applications beyond medical (to name a few), there were 2 major objectives ahead of us towards the completion of this work and eventual future commercialization of the EFT effect: (a) Product development of the EFT microcatheter into a robust and durable tool that can withstand the rigors of a clinical setting for its intended use and (b) The verification of such construct under design control for a pending animal testing trial as a final and ultimate test of the design as a whole before any future human clinical studies. Significant work was devoted towards the development of both the proprietary micro-catheter multi-electrode tip as well as the RF pulse generator.  The emulsification rate (amount of thrombotic material that can be emulsified per unit time) of soft thrombus was also studied and measured in vitro, to ensure both the effectiveness of the effect as well as to design bench-top metrics to evaluate the development of the multielectrode tip.  Such validated metric was also used later on to verify the manufacturing process of such catheter tip. Significant innovative processes were implemented to ensure the durability of the catheter tip under considerable treatment time.  A duality of feedback mechanisms were incorporated to monitor the effectiveness of the EFT effect as well as the integrity of the distal tip ...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
