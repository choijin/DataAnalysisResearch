<AbstractNarration>The CC-NIE Network Infrastructure project at San Diego State University&lt;br/&gt;(SDSU) is constructing and deploying a Science DMZ to support data&lt;br/&gt;intensive science and accommodate specific end-to-end dataflow scenarios&lt;br/&gt;between SDSU and other universities and national laboratories.  The&lt;br/&gt;design of the Science DMZ follows the vision and architecture laid out&lt;br/&gt;by the Energy Sciences Network (ESnet).  Cisco Nexus 7000 and 2000&lt;br/&gt;series switches are deployed, along with a 10Gbps connection to the&lt;br/&gt;CalREN-HP network with exclusive use by the Science DMZ.  Researchers at&lt;br/&gt;SDSU are hosting delay-sensitive applications and datasets on Lustre&lt;br/&gt;parallel file systems directly attached to the Nexus switches.  These&lt;br/&gt;applications and datasets support research projects in the numerical&lt;br/&gt;simulation of earthquake rupture and wave propagation, coastal ocean&lt;br/&gt;modeling, pulse detonation engines, vortex rings in Bose-Einstein&lt;br/&gt;condensates, and large-scale data for proteomics, gene promoter&lt;br/&gt;bioinformatics, and microbial metagenomics.  The project will directly&lt;br/&gt;impact the faculty and students who encompass the Computational Science&lt;br/&gt;Research Center which draws participation from all science and&lt;br/&gt;engineering departments at SDSU.  The Science DMZ provides researchers&lt;br/&gt;with the capability to rapidly exchange large datasets and deploy&lt;br/&gt;Web-based science applications that are accessible through a dedicated&lt;br/&gt;network that is separate from, and therefore not impacted by, general&lt;br/&gt;Internet traffic generated by the campus population.  The DMZ will&lt;br/&gt;promote remote usage of computing resources at SDSU, cultivate&lt;br/&gt;development of collaborative tools for sharing data with the broader&lt;br/&gt;scientific community, establish new research partnerships, and foster&lt;br/&gt;new mentorship opportunities between faculty and students engaged in&lt;br/&gt;computational science.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The CC-NIE award provided funding that allowed San Diego State University ("SDSU") to acquire infrastructure to implement a Science DMZ ("SDMZ") network that conforms to the recommendations and specifications given by the Energy Sciences Network ("ESnet") in document https://fasterdata.es.net/science-dmz/.  An SDMZ is a resource that enables high-speed scientific data transfer and a network for hosting scientific applications and datasets that can be efficiently shared with collaborators at other research universities and national laboratories.  The SDSU SDMZ network is physically separate from the San Diego State University enterprise network, and is configured in a way that optimizes the performance of scientific applications and scientific data transfer.  This award specifically funded the acquisition of an Alcatel-Lucent OmniSwitch 10K, five OmniSwitch 6900s, a Brocade MLX-e router, single-mode and multimode fiber optic cable, and fiber optic cable components.  In addition, a Dell PowerEdge R720 rack-mount server was purchased and installed in the Computational Science Research Center ("CSRC") Data Center to host SDSU?s main perfSONAR station perfsonar.sdsu.edu to measure throughput and packet loss between SDSU?s SDMZ and the SDMZs of other participating universities and institutions.  The SDMZ provides research scientists with high-speed network access to Internet2 connected research institutions, national research laboratories on the ESnet, XSEDE supercomputing resources, and parallel-distributed Linux clusters in the CSRC Data Center.  Researchers at SDSU can exchange scientific datasets at 100Gbps with collaborators at other institutions and remote supercomputer center resources when performing numerical computations, with low latency and packet loss.  Another outcome of implementing a Science DMZ at SDSU has been the deployment of IPv6, the installation and use of perfSONAR for measuring and monitoring network throughput, latency, and packet loss, the regular use of Globus for scientific dataset exchange, and the use of the InCommon federation CILogin Service for authenticated access to SDMZ computing resources.    The implementation of a SDMZ at San Diego State University has enabled data driven intensive science in such areas as  Earthquake Rupture and Wave Propagation Simulation (Kim Olsen, Ph.D. and Steven Day, Ph.D.; Professors of Geological Sciences) Understanding the Role of Terrestrial, Atmospheric, and Marine Systems in Global Change (Walter C. Oechel, Ph.D. and Aram Kalhori, Ph.D., Professors of Biology) Numerical simulation of geologic carbon storage and hydrofracturing (Christopher Paolini, Ph.D. and Jose Castillo, Ph.D., Professors of Computational Science and Mathematics) Residence Time Driven Flame Spread (Subrata Bhattacharjee, Ph.D., Professor of Mechanical Engineering) Parallel 3-D General Curvilinear Coastal Ocean Modeling (GCCOM) (Jose Castillo, Ph.D. and Mary Thomas, Ph.D, Professors of Computational Science and Mathematics) High-Order PSIC Methods for the Simulation of Pulse Detonation Engines (Gustaaf Jacobs, Ph.D.; Professor of Aerospace Engineering) Coral reef informatics, halophile genome sequencing, viral dark matter identification, prophage identification in bacterial genomes, and metagenome analysis (Robert Edwards, Ph.D.; Professor of Biology)   All of these research projects generate and depend on the exchange, storage, and large scale processing of data sets on distributed-parallel Linux clusters.  The PIs and their affiliated graduate students who work on these projects benefit from having an ability to exchange large (many terabyte) datasets with people and systems at 100 Gbps, without being impacted by general-purpose enterprise network traffic generated by the greater SDSU student and faculty population.  Researchers at SDSU who develop and execute parallel codes on many-core supercomputer resources can download resultant multi-terabyte data sets to local SDSU workstations for post-processing and visualization, with rapid turn-around time.  Prior to the SDMZ, researchers were forced to wait 10-15 hours to download multi-terabyte datasets from remote supercomputer resources following each simulation.  The SDSU Science DMZ is managed by the CSRC, a group of tenure-track faculty, research scientists, staff engineers, post-doctoral researchers, and graduate students who stem from a wide array of departments including mathematics, biology, computer science, chemistry, astronomy, geology, physics, as well as aerospace, electrical, and mechanical engineering. The CSRC has partnerships with adjunct faculty around the world, including industry leaders, head scientists at national labs, and distinguished professors at prominent research universities.  CSRC associated researchers and their scholars greatly benefit from the introduction of an SDMZ by providing them the capability to rapidly exchange large datasets and deploy network sensitive science applications on SDSU servers.  The implementation of a SDMZ has placed computational research at SDSU on par with other nationally ranked research universities and provides much needed and dedicated 100 Gbps connectivity to national labs and supercomputing centers.  Scientific discovery has been advanced while promoting teaching, training, and learning by involving postdoctoral, graduate, and undergraduate students who now utilize the additional network throughput for deploying new gateways that provide to access scientific datasets.  This practice has promoted remote usage of computing resources at SDSU and the development of collaborative tools for sharing data with the broader scientific community.
