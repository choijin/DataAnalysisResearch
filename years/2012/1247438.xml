<AbstractNarration>In this EAGER project funded by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program of the Chemistry Division, Rigoberto Advincula of the University of Houston will study how to synthesize polymers with their backbones twisted into precisely-defined knots.  The approach is to synthesize supramolecular metal complexes in which the ligands are linked together into knots via chains that contain iniferters for reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerizations or ring insertion polymerizations (RIP).  Next, the links will be expanded via polymerization, and finally the metal ion templates will be removed to yield the free, knotted polymer.  The broader impacts involve training undergraduate students and graduate students, incorporating template synthesis and knot theory into the chemistry curriculum at the university, and creating a website describing the results of the project and containing educational information on knot theory.&lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;This work will enhance our fundamental understanding about the physical behavior of polymer chains.  Polymer chains are the fundamental units of plastic materials, and further knowledge about their properties could lead to new applications in adhesives, structural materials, and automotive and aerospace composites.</AbstractNarration>

The famous Moebius strip, the works of the artist M.C. Escher, and the ancient Celtic and Arabic art all identify with cycles and macropolycycles.

Mathematics uses the Knot Theory to quantify and predict the topology of these cycles and knots. In polymer science, investigating chains and knots at the macromolecular level is important for understanding properties such as flow behavior, phase separation, crystallization, and compatibilization.&nbsp; This project has focused on understanding the phenomena that underlies the chain (catenane) and knot formation of polymers through the use of supramolecular templates that can be formed by ring closure and statistical threading. Supramolecular templates have been formed by non-covalent interaction of metal complex templates that positions initiators for growing arms through living free radical polymerization such as atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) followed by ring closure (ATRC). The challenge is in producing polymers with high yields and preserving the template structure to enable investigation of physico-chemical properties that affect polymer entanglement and crystallinity. The PI and his group has successfully demonstrated this approach including the formation of grown polymers through ring expansion. Characterization is deemed important in order to understand the mechanism of polymerization with these type of initiators. The project has disseminated the findings through a number of publications in journals such as Chem. Comm., Reactive and Functional Polymers, Polymer International. A number of presentations have been made in national and international conferences. More importantly, a number of Ph.D. students benefitted from the project through research and training in the area of macromolecular chemistry and physico-chemical characterization of polymers.
