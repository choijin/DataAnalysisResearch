<AbstractNarration>This research will explore the motivations for and outcomes associated with the stewardship of sustainable yard practices and design, with "sustainable yards" being those that more closely mimic natural processes and vegetation composition and configuration. The research will be guided by a conceptual framework that focuses on the poorly understood linkages between the motivation for urban stewardship of sustainable yards, and the ecological outcomes from yard management. The project will investigate perspectives on the aesthetic and ecological functions of residential yards through targeted interviews and focus groups with scientists, practitioners and homeowners. A landscape intervention study will also be conducted to test how various lawn mowing regimes in private yards influence pollinator diversity. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As our world becomes increasingly urbanized, identifying ways to reconcile urban development with ecological integrity remains a challenge. Despite the benefits of sustainable yards for improving urban biodiversity and hence, reconnecting urban dwellers with nature, sustainable yards are not implemented at a scale that impacts local or regional sustainability. This research, and associated outreach and education activities, will contribute to our understanding of how to maximize the benefits provided by residential yards for people, biodiversity, and ecosystem processes. Residential yards provide an opportunity for urban dwellers to put into practice the reality that "sustainability begins at home" and to make individual household-level yard management decisions that can scale up and improve city-level sustainability for people and wildlife.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is supported under the NSF Science, Engineering and Education for Sustainability Fellows (SEES Fellows) program, with the goal of helping to enable discoveries needed to inform actions that lead to environmental, energy and societal sustainability while creating the necessary workforce to address these challenges. With SEES Fellows support, this project will enable a promising early career researcher to establish themselves in an independent research career related to sustainability.</AbstractNarration>

Despite this effort, coupled with numerous &lsquo;how to&rsquo; books and websites, less than five percent of all yards are managed for wildlife, and thus fail to contribute to improving urban biodiversity and sustainability.As a NSF SEES Fellow, I designed a research program to identify simple and effective solutions for enhancing bee habitat in lawn-dominated suburban yards while simultaneously exploring the associated ecosystem services and disservices of lawn management.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Intellectual Merit</p> <p>Widespread population declines of bees and other pollinators from habitat loss are a growing concern in the United States. Nonetheless, cities and suburbs support a surprising level of bee richness and abundance, and nectar and pollen from common flowers such as dandelions, white clover and other &lsquo;weedy&rsquo; species growing spontaneously in lawns have the potential to support bee conservation in urban and suburban areas. However, their presence and abundance are controlled by yard management decisions, particularly lawn mowing frequency.Lawn mowing, a popular American pastime, removes floral resources and vegetative cover which negatively impacts pollinators, while also altering soil conditions due to compaction and solar exposure.&nbsp;Given the cumulative area of lawns in urban and suburban areas in the U.S. and the millions of people that manage these systems, it is important to explore how altering lawn management behaviors influences floral resources, and in turn, the implications of relaxed management practices on bee populations and ecosystem services.By designing a robust research program, I experimentally tested the links between human behaviors (lawn mowing) with ecological processes (pollination and soil respiration) and biological outcomes (insect diversity), and identified alternative yard management regimes that maximize the benefits provided by these yards for people, biodiversity and ecosystem processes.Working within suburban, lawn-dominated yards in Springfield, MA, I assigned participating yards to one of three different mowing frequencies: mowed every week, every two weeks and every three weeks, and documented how lawn flowers, bees, soil respiration from the soils beneath the lawns, carbon emissions from the lawn mower and ticks responded to the different management practices. Mowing every 3 weeks resulted in as much as 2.5 times more lawn flowers and greater diversity of bee species, the abundance of bees was greatest when lawns were mowed every 2 weeks. Further, 111species of bees were documented, which represents more than a quarter of bee species recorded in Massachusetts. Soil respiration, as driven by soil moisture and temperature, did not differ amongst mowing treatments though carbon emissions from the mower were more than twice as high for the yards mowed weekly compared to every three weeks. However, the soil respiration from the lawn far exceeded the carbon emissions from the mower itself, identifying a key component to consider for addressing urban sustainability goals.

More research is required to determine whether the results in Springfield, MA hold true in other cities throughout the nation, however the spontaneous flowers that were key to making lawns viable habitat in Springfield are common. Planting and maintaining existing tree cover can further enhance the ecosystem services of these urban green spaces. This research gives homeowners who are motivated to manage their lawn to benefit wildlife and urban sustainability, an option that does not necessitate expensive plantings, more work, or a green thumb. Mowing less frequently, i.e., every two weeks, can improve pollinator habitat and can be a practical, economical, and timesaving alternative to lawn replacement or even planting pollinator gardens, and has the potential to be widely adopted if it can overcome barriers to social acceptance. Most importantly, this research shows that individual households can contribute to urban conservation.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 09/28/2018<br>      Modified by: Susannah&nbsp;Lerman</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1215859/1215859_10190608_1538146188100_LODDEB2014--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1215859/1215859_10190608_1538146188100_LODDEB2014--rgov-800width.jpg" title="2-week treatment"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1215859/1215859_10190608_1538146188100_LODDEB2014--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="2-week treatment"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">An example of a 2-week treeatment yard.
