<AbstractNarration>Professor Marcus Weck is supported by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program of the Chemistry Division to study the formation of multiple synthetic non-biological polymers, which fold into secondary structures, into supramolecular block copolymers thereby creating materials with well-defined 3D architectures.  The research design is based on the synthesis of a small library of telechelic polymers (building blocks) that contain noncovalent recognition motifs at their chain ends.  Each building block is either helical, sheet-forming or a random coil.  These building blocks will be self-assembled into supramolecular main-chain block copolymers yielding a single material containing multiple 3D architectural motifs.  Systematic structure-property relationship studies to elucidate parameters of polymer chain lengths, block lengths, and recognition motif on the self-assembly behavior of the polymer building blocks will be carried out. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed study is a step towards the rational design of well-defined, 3D polymeric architectures, which has been postulated as a key requirement for the next generation of complex materials for a variety of industries including those in the electro-optics, energy, nanoscience and the medical fields.  This project in polymer chemistry and nanoscience pairs cutting edge research with the training of undergraduate and graduate students and extensive outreach activities to enhance the understanding and teaching of polymer science to K-12 school children.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ During the three-year funding period, research funded through this grant focused on developing synthetic materials, in particular polymers, that fold into well-defined three-dimensional architectures.  In particular, the PIs group synthesized, assembled, and characterized sheet and helix forming polymers based on oil-based monomers.  Such complex, diverse, and highly functionalized polymers are suggested to be the next key material for a variety of critical applications including electro-optical, optical, biological, energy, biomedical and computer-based applications.  Additionally, such folded synthetic materials can yield deeper insides into the folding processes in Nature and a more detailed understanding of protein folding.  Besides the development of novel synthetic strategies towards such materials, the PIÆs group also developed characterization methodologies to identify polymer end-groups, an essential prerequisite for the formation of block copolymers driven by non-covalent chemistries.    The broader impact of the proposed science is the integration of the research into the educational programs ranging from K-12 to the home institution and undergraduate programs across the country, the development of close interactions with the private sector, as well as the broadening of participation of women and underrepresented minorities.  The PIÆs research group hosts bimonthly third and fourth grade inner city school children and introduces them to the excitement of polymer science through a series of very basic demonstrations.  In the final year of the grant, the PI has extended this outreach to pre-K children to excite them about science at an early age.  The PIÆs lab has also an excellent track record of working with industry on polymer-related problems, transferring knowledge to the private sector (through patents and former group members), and bringing his science to the marketplace.  Finally, the PI has a demonstrated commitment to increase the participation of underrepresented minorities as well as women in the sciences.  All four graduate students supported on the NSF grant were female (one of these students an African American minority student).  Two have already graduated with a Ph.D. and joined the chemical industry.           Last Modified: 09/24/2015       Submitted by: Marcus Weck]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
