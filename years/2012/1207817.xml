<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award:  DMS-1207817 &lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator:  Daniel S. Freed&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research in this proposal fits into the broad interaction between geometry and high energy theoretical physics, with a focus on algebraic topology.  There are both purely mathematical projects influenced by the physics and projects which apply topology to concrete current problems in quantum field theory, string theory, and condensed matter theory.  On the mathematics side we seek a categorification of the Atiyah-Singer index theorem.  This requires us to develop generalized differential cohomology theory further.  We will also investigate several problems in topological field theory, particularly concerning invertible theories, which have implications for algebra and low-dimensional topology.  On the physics side we begin to study aspects of the maximal superconformal field theory in six dimensions, which is playing an increasingly central role in applications to mathematics.  We also continue our work on topological questions in Type II superstring theory.  The PI will use his experience in this area to attack topological questions in condensed matter physics, a new area for his research.  There are also graduate student projects in various directions in geometry and topology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research supported by this grant develops modern ideas in geometry which are closely connected with current work in theoretical physics.  Quantum field theory was developed in the last century to explain elementary particle physics, and it has had spectacular implications for mathematics as well. String theory is more speculative from the physics point of view, even more mysterious in mathematics, yet it too provides profound geometric insights. Many of the projects to be pursued here lie at the interface between geometry and these physical theories.  They are part of a much broader community effort to bring new ideas from physics into mathematics.  Some projects investigate mathematical structures and problems suggested by the physics. In others the PI collaborates with physicists to apply modern techniques in geometry and topology directly to problems in physics.  The longterm value of such basic research for society, above and beyond its intrinsic intellectual value, can be only be measured now by understanding how fundamentally our current technology and economy rely on basic research of past decades and centuries.  This grant also supports a longstanding outreach program in Austin which engages middle and high school students in mathematics.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Topology is the branch of geometry which investigates large-scale properties of shapes, those which do not change when the shape is continuously deformed. Very loosely speaking, this part of geometry forgets the trees and opts instead to study the forest.  That often pays dividends for both internal questions in mathematics and also for applications outside of mathematics. Over the period of this grant we addressed both aspects of topology.  Two sets of results apply ideas and techniques in topology to questions in condensed matter physics.  The buzzword for this area is "topological phases of matter".  An everyday example is the ice-water-vapor trichotomy.  But the current interest is not in the everyday, but in more exotic materials, whose different phases may find applications in such areas as quantum computers. My own work, with collaborators, applies recent developments to classes of systems of current interest.  We prove general mathematical statements which reproduce classification results physicists deduced by other methods, and extend in new directions.  It is quite nice--and not at all unusual--when very recent ideas in mathematics, which were developed largely because of internal motivations, find applications outside of mathematics.  During this period I also completed several other projects with less immediate application outside of mathematics.  A few are part of my longterm work on the geometric structure of quantum field theory, the most comprehensive theory of nature at high energies.  Others lie more squarely in geometry, in one case bringing a new point of view to a familiar and widely-used construction, and another making progress on a geometric construction of an object of great interest in other parts of mathematics.  This NSF grant included support for graduate students.  They work on their own research in this general area, often with overlaps to the projects indicated here.  There was also support for an outreach program we run at UT Austin.  This Saturday Morning Math Group and Math Circle gathers local middle and high school students for enrichment activities led by faculty in mathematics and the sciences, as well as guest speakers.  It is one of the longest running programs of its type in the country.        Last Modified: 06/27/2016       Submitted by: Daniel S Freed]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
