<AbstractNarration>Portal to the Public: Expanding the National Network (PoP: ENN) is implementing around the county the successful NSF-funded Portal to the Public model in which researchers are trained to communicate and interact with the general public at informal science education (ISE) institutions about the research that they are conducting.  The project, which follows on a thorough evaluation of the model at eight sites and current implementation at an additional fifteen sites, will incorporate twenty new ISE sites into the growing network, provide training and mentorship to ISE professionals on the use and adaptation of the PoP implementation manual and toolkits, and develop an enhanced network website that will serve as a communication and innovation hub.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The work is responsive to the needs and activities of ISE organizations which continue to expand their missions beyond presenting to the public established science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) and are working to become places where visitors can also experience the process and promise of current research via face-to-face interactions with researchers.  The project is expanding both the kind and number of institutions involved around the country and is facilitating their capacity to develop a knowledge base, share experiences and best practices.</AbstractNarration>

PoP: ENN created a broad, living network of ideas and strategies for scientist/public engagement in ISE settings. Specifically, this broad implementation project:  1. Broadened the dissemination of the Portal to the Public "guiding framework" to over 30 new ISE organizations that represented a broader range of ISE-types, including university outreach groups, zoos and aquaria, and botanical gardens.  2. Supported collaboration among participating institutions and scientists through in-person convenings, webinars, and enhanced online resources.  3. Supported innovation by working to connect the Network with communities outside the dissemination sites such as other networks (e.g., the National Alliance for Broader Impacts), national initiatives (CAISE), professional societies (AAAS) and funding agencies.  By expanding and strengthening the Network and its connections across the field, we aimed to help improve the programs at individual sites, which in turn support ways of engaging the public in the process of science and improve public understanding of current science and research. Each site?s programs increase the public?s awareness of the scientific work being done in their community and allow for scientists to be seen as accessible members of the local community.  The results of this project?s summative study confirmed that PoPNet was able to achieve its major objectives. PoPNet created an emerging network of participating institutions. PoPNet also created institutional value based on connection to scientific research via scientists and their institutions. The benefits extended to the institutions? audiences who where able to engage first-hand with scientists and with current research in accessible and enjoyable ways.
