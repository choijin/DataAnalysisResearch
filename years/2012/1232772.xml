<AbstractNarration>This engineering education research project seeks to investigate the alignment between the popular Maker movement and engineering careers.  The researchers plan to develop models of how those involved in the hobbyist community, as represented by the Maker movement, find their ways into engineering degree programs.  The proposed approach uses qualitative data collection and theories grounded in how adult learners navigate career pathways.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader significance and importance of this project arises from the current emphasis on creating more STEM graduates.  The project specifically investigates alternative pathways into engineering degree programs which may be taken by those currently under-represented in engineering.  This project overlaps with NSF's strategic goals of transforming the frontiers through preparation of an engineering workforce with new capabilities and expertise.  Additionally NSF's goal of innovating for society is enabled by supporting the development of innovative learning systems.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ "making" community builds additive innovations      Should Makers Be the Engineers of the Future?  Micah Lande (PI)/Shawn Jordan, Arizona State University (NSF EEC 1232772)  Might Young Makers Be the Engineers of the Future?  Shawn Jordan (PI)/Micah Lande, Arizona State University (NSF EEC 1329321)     outcomes  Makers are part of a growing community of builders and tinkerers that celebrate and share their creations through events like Maker Faires. Flagship Maker Faires attract more than 100,000 people in the San Francisco Bay Area and New York City. Through interviews with 4 dozen adult Makers at Maker Faires in the US, the research team has captured educational pathways in and around engineering, and the knowledge, skills, and attitudes developed during their Making activities.     impact / benefits of research  This research will help to illustrate the similarities and differences between the activities of Making and everyday practice of engineering. Early results suggest the following understanding of the Maker community:     What Making Means. Participants collectively defined "making" as "making something." It matters less what the creation is but more so the act of creating and building an artifact.      Additive Innovation. Participants actively practice additive innovation, where they contribute to an open community of sharing and learning. Citizenship in the Maker community means additively building on the work of others and freely sharing knowledge and processes back with the community. The Making community is an additive innovation network, both as a social and intellectual community.     Playful Invention. Interviews captured stories of exploration and leveraging personal interests. Elements of creativity, whimsy, and novelty were embedded in participantsÆ projects and personal excitement can be its own driver. Failures are celebrated as a mark of learning.     Making and the Engineer of 2020. Makers demonstrate lifelong learning, practical ingenuity, and creativity by the action of Making itself, and their contribution to additive innovation networks.       further info/interesting details  Our study of Adult Maker Pathways has been extended to include Young Makers and their educational and career ambitions.  By broadening the focus of our research efforts, the research team aims to explore Making and STEM pathways and inform engineering educational efforts. For Young Makers, parents are additional, active members of the additive innovation network, supporting their children financially, technically, logistically, and emotionally. We plan to expand our interview strategy to include parents, as they have strong opinions about the benefit of Making for their kids. Making is beginning to cross with formal engineering education. For example, MIT has started accepting Maker portfolios as part of their admission processes.
