<AbstractNarration>The objective of this research is to build a Nonlinear Optical (NLO) Spectrometer that will allow the spectrum of nonlinear absorption to be measured over a range of greater than two octaves of bandwidth (&lt;400nm to 1800nm) in ~1 hour, do this using an absolutely calibrated method and yield the dispersion of the nonlinear refractive index over the same spectral range.  This instrument is transformative to the NLO field as it now takes days for a single material measurement. The approach is to base the spectrometer on the widely used and cited (&gt;3000 citations) Z-scan technique.  The optical source for the NLO Spectrometer will be an exceedingly high spectral energy density White-Light Continuum (WLC) generated in a noble gas at moderate pressure.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;      The intellectual merit of the proposed activity comes from the instrument?s capability to drastically increase the speed (and hence depth) of characterization of NLO materials.  This new capability will allow for more rapid feedback on NLO properties to both theoreticians and synthetic chemists and other material scientists and in turn lead to the development of improved NLO materials. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;      The broader impacts from this great increase in data generation rate are the instrument's potential to impact several fields beyond nonlinear optics, including optical data storage, multi-photon micro-fabrication, imaging (both biological and chemical sensing), photodynamic therapy (medical), and telecommunications. Additionally, this equipment will allow undergraduate, graduate, and research scientists to benefit from a rapid characterization facility, giving the opportunity to learn more about optical field-matter interactions.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ We have developed a Nonlinear Optical (NLO) Spectrometer based on a widely and rapidly tunable, high energy laser source obtained from "White-Light Continuum" (WLC) generation.  This spectrometer is analogous to a linear optics spectrophotometer that measures the absorption of materials as a function of wavelength; however the NLO Spectrometer does this for high enough irradiance that the absorption changes.  For example, materials at high irradiance (power per unit area) can simultaneously absorb two low energy photons as opposed to one large energy photon.  The "two-photon absorption" (2PA) is irradiance dependent. Associated with this 2PA is nonlinear refraction where the index is also irradiance dependent.  This instrument has the capability to measure the spectrum of nonlinear absorption, for example 2PA, along with the dispersion of the nonlinear refraction. Thus this instrument actually gives more information than the linear spectrophotometer since it also gives refractive index information.     The optical source used for the NLO spectrometer is a WLC.  Our early research showed that we can generate WLC with the bandwidth and energy needed for this practical NLO spectrometer provided we use high energy femtosecond pulses to generate the continuum.  This is what was done by purchasing a high energy femtosecond laser.  Thus, the majority of the funds for this device was to purchase the 12 milliJoule, 40 femtosecond, kHz repetition rate amplified Ti:Sapphire laser (Coherent) along with an optical parametric amplifier.  We then optimized the high spectral irradiance WLC to allow the development of the rapidly-tunable NLO spectrometer which can give spectra from ~1700nm to 400nm using the WLC.  We can also use this system for other wavelength, but it then requires tuning a separate optical parametric device and take more time.  Thus this system enables measurements of NLO spectra of materials rapidly and accurately over an extremely broad spectral range, &gt; 2 octaves. We estimate that this NLO Spectrometer increases the speed of characterization of nonlinear optical materials by at least ten times and hence is transformative to the field of NLO.  Progress in areas such as telecommunications, bio-imaging, nano-sensing, and optical power control, requires the engineering of novel materials possessing large optical nonlinearities. This has generated a need to develop advanced technologies to efficiently characterize these NLO materials. Developed by our group in the early 1990Æs, the Z-scan technique [1] is the simplest and most widely used technique for NLO materials characterization.  This technique has been cited ~4000 times and is the most highly-cited IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics publication.  However, in order to measure the full NLO spectra of a material, the Z-scan technique requires the use of high energy tunable laser sources that cover a broad spectral range, such as optical parametric generators/amplifiers (OPGs/OPAs). The use of OPGs/OPAs requires constant phase matching of nonlinear crystals to generate and amplify particular frequencies, which leads to the repeated realignment of optical experiments. Generating a complete spectrum for one material can occupy several researchers for several days.  By replacing the tunable optical parametric amplifier (OPA) with a fixed wavelength OPA which then produces a WLC, we can then use the WLC as the source for Z-scan measurements.  This WLC covers the entire spectral range of two octaves with enough spectral irradiance to show nonlinear absorption and refraction at each wavelength (in ~10nm bands).  We originally introduced this as a more rapid method to measure NLO spectra. It eliminates the need for realignment at each wavelength greatly saving time. This WLC Z-scan utilizes a single, ultra-broadband, stable WLC filament created from the intense femtosecond pump source (OPA) focused into a chamber filled with krypton gas at moderate pressure (about 2 atmospher...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
