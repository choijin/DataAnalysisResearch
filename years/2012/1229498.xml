<AbstractNarration>With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation Program, Professor Derrick Kolling from Marshall University and colleagues Michael Norton, Michael Castellani, Xiaoping Sun and Nalini Santanam will acquire an electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectrometer with liquid nitrogen and liquid helium cooling systems and the capability of analyzing samples in the gas, liquid, or solid phases from 3.8 K up to room temperature. The proposal is aimed at enhancing research training and education at all levels, especially in areas such as (a) synthesis and characterization of ionic charge-transfer magnets; (b) transient catalytic states trapped via an ultrafast freeze-quench apparatus; (c) using light-induced ESP (LESR) to characterize molecular wires and multimolecular assemblies in a DNA origami testbed; (d) chemical and photochemical reduction of uranyl UO2(2+); (e) study in diluted magnetic semiconductor; and (f) oxidized lipids in cardiovascular disease.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An EPR spectrometer yields detailed information on the geometric and electronic structure of molecular and solid state materials. It may also be used to obtain information about the lifetimes of free radicals, short-lived, highly reactive species involved in valuable chemical transformations as well as the initiation of pathological tumor growth. These studies will impact a number of areas, from the synthesis of inorganic and organic molecules to the development of new solid state materials to compounds of magnetic and biological interest. Employing examples inspired from ongoing research, this instrument will be an integral part of research and teaching at the undergraduate and graduate levels at Marshall University as well as at the University of Charleston.</AbstractNarration>

Intellectual Merit: EPR spectroscopy detects unpaired electrons and can provide information about their lifetime and surroundings. These unpaired electrons can be found in biological systems, semiconductors, ground coffee beans, metals, and in a personÃ†s skin following exposure to UV light.  A diverse group of student and faculty researchers have used the EPR spectrometer to further their scientific research. Their efforts on the instrument have increased our understanding of how the site of photosynthetic water oxidation assembles, given us clues on how to precipitate uranium compounds from contaminated water, allowed us to study the structure of novel semiconductors, helped elucidate the role that radicals play in obesity, and test the efficiency of sunscreens in preventing the formation of free radicals in the skin upon exposure to sunlight.  Broader Impacts: The instrument has also been an educational tool for dozens of students who were taking courses in biochemistry, inorganic chemistry, instrumental methods, physical chemistry, modern physics, and medical biophysics.
