<AbstractNarration>The investigators will develop a high frame-rate tomographic imaging facility, and a physics-based inversion methodology, in order to quantify three-dimensional motions of the aurora at its finest scales. Although several theories have been suggested to account for structuring at these scales, determining which model is correct and under which circumstance requires knowledge of two parameters not directly observed by a single imaging system: 1) the transverse motion  or spreading) of auroral forms with respect to the convecting frame of reference, and 2) the change in average energy of the primary particle spectrum, manifested in the apparent vertical deformation of auroral forms. The former addresses the dispersion of energy across magnetic lines of force, while the latter addresses changes in coupling between electromagnetic and kinetic energy. The new approach uses a physical model of particle penetration in order to regularize the poorly observed field-aligned dimension. In addition to regularizing the problem, this approach provides access to the physical quantity of interest: the space-time variability in the primary electron spectrum.  The research leverages technologies recently developed in the commercial and defense sectors (e.g., Electron Multiplying CCD cameras, solid state drives, millisecond GPS synchronization).  If successful, the research will provide new observational evidence needed to address a fundamental unresolved question space physics. The results will contribute to the understanding of universal plasma processes occurring throughout the cosmos.  The project supports an early career space scientist, a graduate student in engineering, and several  undergraduate research assistants.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The aurora borealis, or northern lights, is a spectacular reminder that our world is surrounded by matter in a plasma (or ionized) state.  Auroras are produced when high energy electrons and ions streaming along Earth?s magnetic field impact the gases in our outer atmosphere, causing them to radiate in a spectrum of colors that depends on particle energy and the impacted gas.   The source of these plasma beams remains a subject of debate.  Particularly confounding are observations of auroral structure with scale size in the 10?s of meters range.  These scales do not fit well with our current understanding of plasma acceleration mechanisms in the universe.  This project tests the hypothesis that such fine-scale structure in the aurora is caused by electrons with a much lower energy than the bright features within which they are embedded.   The physical theory involves the interaction of ambient electrons at about 10,000km altitude with low-frequency magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) waves, called Alfven waves.   Our method to  determine particle energy is to triangulate the altitude of the auroral emissions.  Lower energy particles cannot penetrate as far into the atmosphere, causing the aurora to appear at a higher altitude.  The emission altitude is determined from auroral images recorded at multiple locations simultaneously.     Such a "tomographic" analysis of the aurora has been attempted before, but not at these spatial and temporal scales.   Fine-scale structure in the aurora varies on millisecond time scales, so we need cameras with high sensitivity and high frame-rate that are carefully synchronized.   This was accomplished using CMOS camera technology.   CMOS cameras emerged in the early 2000?s and quickly became a disruptive technology in the video industry.   These are the cameras responsible for the ultra-slow-motion replays seen during sporting events.   The camera network we deployed, called the "High-Speed Tomography" (HST) experiment, involved three CMOS cameras deployed in a triangular configuration with separation of about 3 km.   The short separation distance was needed because the features to be triangulated are both very narrow (100 meters) and very far away (100 km).   The experimental was successful, demonstrating clearly that the ephemeral 100-meter-scale features in active auroras are consistent with large fluxes of incident electrons in the 100 to 800 eV range.  This supports the hypothesis that the electron source was produced via coupling with Alfven waves, a hypothesis originally proposed by the PI and his collaborator based on single-station optical measurements.
