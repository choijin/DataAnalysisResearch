<AbstractNarration>The Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms Program supports Professor Michael D. Johnson of New Mexico State University to investigate and characterize the location of redox active metal complexes in reverse micelles (RMs) using a combination of NMR, UV-vis and FTIR techniques.  The goal is to better understand complex reactivity as a function of compartmentalization via interfacial penetration, and to investigate catalysis via increased ion pairing at the interface.  Microelectrode electrochemistry will be used to establish whether modified reactivity in RMs is due to a change in the Marcus driving force.  Professor Johnson will also measure the rates of electron transfer for a set of complexes with systematic variation in complex charge (local electrostatics at the interface), location, hydrophobicity and ligand nucleophilicity.  The aim is to correlate reactant location with thermodynamic parameters such as redox potentials.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The work has potentially broad biological impact in the refining of metallodrug uptake efficiency and assimilation when redox chemistry precedes the onset of physiological activity, e.g., in anti-cancer agents (PtIV/II, RuIII/II) and vanadium agents for diabetes (VV/IV).  The results may also help predict the rates of redox reactions in vivo within small molecule siderophores (FeIII/II). Non-biological applications include predictions of aqueous chemical reactivity within the cavities of catalytic microporous solids, and within the water droplets formed during electrospray MS, which have been assumed (but not verified) to be representative of the chemistry in bulk solution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Professor Johnson has extensive experience in student training and outreach and is especially committed to undergraduate research involving underrepresented groups, particularly Hispanic and Native American students.  He is directly involved in a Minority Access to Research Careers program at NMSU - one of the largest MARC programs in the country, sending 8-10 graduating senior students per year to graduate programs in the physical and life sciences.  Other students have gone on for MD, DDS, DPharm., D.Psy. or other post graduate degrees. Through this program Professor Johnson has impacted over 200 undergraduates during the past 15 years.  Professor Johnson also participates in the Bridges programs at NMSU, whose mission is to increase the transfer rate of Native American Students in Arizona and New Mexico from area community colleges to 4-year degree programs.  He is also active in the annual Undergraduate Research and Creative Arts Symposium (URCAS) at NMSU.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ We have examined the effects of confinement of molecules within a nanoscale sphere of water continained within a Reverse Micelle, RM.  These RMs are composed of sodium AOT surfactant molecules dissolved in isooctane.  Three specific projects have been studied in the past year:  complexation of vanadium(V) with peroxide, redox reactions of glutathione with ferricyanide, and the determination of pKas of hydroxybenzenes.   Project 1 has shown that hydrogen peroxide complexes with aqueous vanadium(V) in acidic media to form the bis-peroxovanadate(V) species via formatin of a monoperoxo species.  The equilibrium lies far to the bis-peroxo species and the rates of reaction are enhanced by 1-2 orders of magnitude, depending on the size of the RM.   Project 2 showed that glutathione reductions of ferricyanide are enhanced significantly upon encapsulation within RM.  Enhancements of 5 orders of magnitude were observed.  This behavior is similar to that of ascorbic acid.  Since both of these are important bioreductants, we wonder whether these enhancements are due to association membrane surfaces and if this is a common biological phenomenon.  Project 3 has demonstrated that only small changes in pKas are observed when neutral molecules are placed within RMs.  Changes no more than 0.3pKa units were observed upon encapsulation.  This implies that the rate enhancements observed in project 2 must be due to changes in redox potentials.        Last Modified: 10/02/2017       Submitted by: Michael D Johnson]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
