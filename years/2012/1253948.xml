<AbstractNarration>Non-linearities abound in any complex biomechanical simulation. As a human hand folds into a fist, non-linear contact and material forces give rise to characteristic bulges and folds. As red blood cells crowd down a capillary, advection and contact non-linearities cause them to bump and twirl. These essential dynamics are also the main computational challenges in a simulation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project investigates the efficient simulation of these and other biomechanical non-linearities. It specifically investigates projected physics methods, also known as model reduction methods, which have been known to accelerate simulations by multiple orders of magnitude, but also have trouble incorporating arbitrary non-linearities. The research team explores a variety of promising approaches, including multidimensional cubature, exponential integrators, and vector partitioning. Source code is routinely released into the public domain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is driven by two main applications. The first is high-quality, virtual humans, which can be used in surgical simulation and training, as well as visual media. The second is simulating flexible micro-particles in blood flow, which assists in designing effective shapes that deliver radiation payloads to cancer sites. The visual results of this research are highly accessible to non-specialists, so they are packaged into a publicly available app that is used to engage undergraduate researchers, and used during high school outreach to encourage involvement in science and engineering.</AbstractNarration>
