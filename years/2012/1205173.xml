<AbstractNarration>This research project will focus on a number of areas related to the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) Experiment: 1) co-leading the ongoing collaboration search for continuous gravitational waves; 2) developing new algorithms for detecting quasi-periodic sources from both isolated and binary neutron stars and 3) detector characterization of Advanced LIGO interferometers focused on spectral line identification and mitigation. The work to be carried out thus includes both searching in existing LIGO data for evidence of rapidly spinning, non-axisymmetric neutron stars in our galactic neighborhood and preparations for searches in the far more sensitive data expected from Advanced LIGO.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Discovery of gravitational waves from astrophysical objects will mark a major milestone in science, simultaneously confirming one of the fundamental predictions of gravitational physics, while opening up an entirely new field of astronomy. The detection of such waves from rotating neutron stars would be especially interesting because many such sources are expected to continue emitting for long durations, allowing follow-up investigation of increasing precision, and because it is believed that these waves will provide insight into the poorly known structure of these exotic stars. The research to be carried out, on both the instrumental and analytical sides, will provide training to undergraduate and graduate students in state-of-the-art science at the frontier of knowledge.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Discovery  Gravitational waves now provide a new window to the universe, thanks to the exquisitely sensitive interferometers of LIGO (Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory). The discovery by LIGO in September 2015 of gravitational waves from the merger of two massive black holes marked one of the major milestones in science of the last century.

The PI served on the LSC Executive Committee and on the Detection Committee, which validated the GW150914 discovery before its announcement to the world in early 2016.   Intellectual Merit  The Michigan group's primary focus in the LSC, however, is to find continuous gravitational waves radiated by rotating neutron stars in the galaxy. The PI  has co-led the LSC working group searching for such  continuous-wave sources for eight years, with effort devoted in recent years to preparing for discovery in the Advanced LIGO era, which began in fall 2015. The Michigan group developed the first all-sky search program (TwoSpect) for unknown binary sources of continuous waves, with results published in 2014, using Initial LIGO data. A search is now under way using this program with Advanced LIGO data taken in fall 2015 / winter 2016.

Broader Impacts  Over the years the Michigan group has trained many graduate students, many undergraduates and a handful of high school students to work at the forefront of physics research and instrumentation. The group has taken full advantage of several special programs at the national and university level to attract students, including female and Hispanic students.  The PI and graduate students have given outreach talks, including a pair of video-taped "Saturday Morning Physics" lectures immediately following the February 2016 discovery announcement, lectures now shown regularly on local Ann Arbor community television.  The group has also collaborated with the Ann Arbor Hands-On Museum (for which Riles served for two terms on the Board of Trustees) in building LIGO-related exhibits, most recently on a seismology exhibit ("Make a Quake") nearing completion.
