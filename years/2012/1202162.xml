<AbstractNarration>The next generation of laser intensities, say a factor of 1000 more intense than current laser intensities, would both open up new avenues of fundamental research and give rise to new applications. The current technology is limited by the material properties of gratings and amplifiers. But optical elements made out of plasma do not suffer this limitation. Hence, the next generation of lasers almost certainly should involve plasma technology. The research objective of this project is thus to identify plasma-based mechanisms that compress laser pulses, to evaluate experimental progress in this area, and to identify the experiments that will retire the key uncertainties. This project will consider both compression in the micron wavelength optical regime as well as the extension of these effects to sub-micron wavelengths, where alternative compression techniques fail at even lower intensities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this project lie beyond simply predicting new plasma effects and in building a much more powerful laser. As an enabling technology, the broader impact of this project lies in how various subfields of physics might utilize the next generation of lasers. Apart from the opportunities at high intensity in probing strong field effects, there is the derivative technology that higher intensities invariably enable shorter durations. Thus the next generation of intensities will usher in as well the next generation of pulse durations, into the sub-attosecond regimes, thereby providing the time-resolution that could enable the probing of, for example, nuclear phenomena.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Project Outcome Report     Electromagnetic Wave Compression in Plasma   PI:                                         N. J. Fisch  Organization:                         Princeton University  Project Grant Period:            06/15/2012 - 05/31/2016     The main objective is to identify and quantify certain limits of achieving extreme laser intensities using plasma.  Mainly due to the method of chirped pulse amplification, laser intensities have grown remarkably during recent years. However, the attaining of very much higher powers is limited by the material properties of gratings. These limitations might be overcome through the use of plasma, which is an ideal medium for processing very high power and very high total energy.  In plasma, long duration laser light might be converted to laser light that of much shorter duration, slightly lower frequency,  and much higher intensity. To accomplish this conversion, a long pump laser pulse, carrying significant energy, irradiates the plasma. A short counter-propagating pulse, with a frequency somewhat below the pump pulse frequency, then quickly depletes the pump energy.  The difference frequency is the plasma frequency, so a plasma wave grows and mediates this energy conversion. The short pulse becomes shorter yet as it propagates through the pump laser, all the time growing in intensity.  The objective is that the short pulse reach the highest intensities, which generally occurs for the shortest output pulses.     During the project grant period, we identified ways in which this conversion can be optimized.  For example, in general, the amplified pulse is in the form of a train of spikes, but it is also possible to arrange for most of the energy to be in the first spike, thereby achieving yet higher intensity.   There are also a number of deleterious effects that need to be avoided, such as the tendency of the amplified wave to break up, or, worse yet, the tendency of the mediating plasma wave to break up and thereby fail to mediate the energy conversion.    The technology advanced here could lead to the next generation of laser intensities at a variety of wavelengths.  The impact will be felt in developing technology in the optical wavelengths, primarily between one micron and a quarter micron, which covers, for example, both Ti:Sa as well as Kr:Fl laser technologies.  As a result of these theoretical efforts, a number of experiments are now being proposed worldwide to reach these exciting regimes.
