<AbstractNarration>An implicit objective of most college and university programs is to develop student capacity for creativity.  However, creativity itself is not typically taught or included as a topic in most undergraduate curricula or as an independent discipline.  Teaching creativity is a dimension of higher education found primarily in Fine Arts and Design, and within specific areas of the Humanities, such as Creative Writing.  Within STEM it is embedded in some engineering programs.  This project is expanding understanding of creative thinking as a dimension of undergraduate coursework in STEM.  It is creating opportunities for developing student creative thinking and increasing the effectiveness of faculty in delivering a curriculum that has been infused with exercises that reinforce creative thinking as an integral part of undergraduate STEM education at the University of Southern Maine.  The major step in achieving this goal is engaging STEM faculty in workshops to introduce them to techniques for infusing creativity into courses.  The principal goal is to engage faculty in STEM disciplines and to help them develop modules for incorporation into existing courses. Five day summer institutes bring together a cohort of 8 faculty members from the Departments of Applied Medical Sciences; Environmental Science; Exercise, Health and Sports Sciences; Biology; Computer Science; Mechanical Engineering, and Technology.  During the workshops faculty learn strategies for how to create modules that combine creative thinking with STEM course materials. These modules will be incorporated into existing curricula.  Faculty will join in a second summer institute the second year and will both develop and refine their modules and also incorporate them into one of their scheduled upper level classes for the academic year.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:  Few studies for teaching creativity in the area of STEM education at the K-12 and undergraduate levels have been done. To this end, an underlying intellectual principle of the proposal is the evaluation of the impact of this approach on both faculty and students. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:  This project has the potential for serving as a model for incorporating creative thinking processes into education in STEM instructions.</AbstractNarration>

The major objective to achieving this goal was to engage STEM faculty in a summer workshop that introduced them to techniques for creative thinking disciplines and to help them develop modules for incorporation into existing courses.  The faculty workshop allowed participants to explore methods of introducing the creative process into their curriculum. Together, participants and workshop mentors formed an energetic and diverse "creative community." Participants had the opportunity to explore their own creativity, and their students? potential, by drawing on a variety of disciplines in the Arts, Sciences, and Humanities. In highly interactive sessions, participants individually and collaboratively discovered innovative solutions to increase student?s creative potential.  The structure of the faculty workshop allowed participants to build their knowledge and skills to find creative solutions, to assess and communicate what was needed to support creativity in their classrooms, and to identify resources and implement and derive ongoing enhanced learning through the creative process.  Several faculty participants have engaged in a Faculty Interest Group (FIG) centered on delivering creative strategies to their students. They are using tools and methods delivered to them through the workshop. There have been multiple new courses designed and taught based on the workshop content, as well as documented pedagogical changes in STEM teaching at the undergraduate level.  In broader terms, the project enhanced the teaching ofcreative process thinking among University of Southern Maine?s STEM faculty. It helped them develop modules for multiple STEM classes, so as to introduce the creative thinking process to scores of University of Southern Maine undergraduate students in multiple STEM disciplines.  The initial workshop served as a model for incorporating creative thinking process education in STEM instructions across all STEM disciplines. It succeeded and we are now able to introduce concepts and processes to other institutions of higher education, and are currently disseminating information to the private sector through the presentation of workshops similar to those designed for STEM faculty.
