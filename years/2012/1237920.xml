<AbstractNarration>The main objective of this project is to study effective computational methods that will allow the failure and reliability analysis of dams subjected to man-made hazards, such as blast and penetration. This requires the accurate modeling of reservoir/dam failure response, which is not handled satisfactorily by available computational tools. The research approach progresses from the probabilistic modeling of concrete at the length scale of the major material heterogeneities to the formulation of a multi-scale framework for the analysis of large structures. The computational simulation of the dam is then coupled with the simulation of the reservoir water through a novel fluid-structure interaction algorithm. Finally, the developed framework is used to compute the probability of failure associated with projectile penetration and air-blasting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The successful completion of this research will lead to a significant improvement in the computational tools for dam failure analysis available to practitioners. Engineers will be able to assess accurately the probability of failure of existing dams and dam administrators will be able to use these assessments to prioritize investments and resources. In addition, the research will have a significant impact on education and promotion of diversity through the wide range of activities aimed at the involvement of pre-college, undergraduate, and graduate students, especially those belonging to minority and underrepresented groups. This is achieved mainly by the development of an online NSF Virtual Center for Resilient Infrastructures (VCRI) in the context of the virtual reality world ?Second Life? (SL). The VCRI will give unprecedented opportunities for outreach activities, dissemination, and training.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
