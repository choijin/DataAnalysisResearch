<AbstractNarration>This Partnerships for Innovation project focuses on thermal-modification technology to enhance the utility of engineered wood products in order to improve dimensional stability and resistance to biodegradation and weathering.  Service life will also be extended, while at the same time reducing environmental impacts.  This project will advance thermal-modification technology toward the development of advanced, high-performing engineered wood products.  Thermally-modified wood is currently used in a limited set of applications, including solid wood flooring, external cladding, and decking products. This project will advance the platform so that it can be the basis of new, high-volume, and in-demand engineered wood products for markets that are poised to grow quickly in the near future when the demand for engineered wood products increases with the rebound in U.S. residential and commercial construction. The completion and validation of research will also facilitate interactions and information exchange between stakeholders within the forest products industry to enhance opportunities for sustained forest products production and use; and it will contribut to improvement in the knowledge, skills, and capacity of the forest products industry workforce and management. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this project will be job creation, national export earnings, and better homes and buildings from engineered wood products.  This project will advance the scientific understanding of the thermal-modification platform and propel it toward potential applications for new, ultra-high-performing thermally-modified engineered wood products that excel in severe environmental conditions. Ultimately, such products will bolster the critical U.S. forest products industry by increasing U.S. economic competitiveness, increasing the number of jobs (many of them in rural and lesser-populated areas where  the need is particularly great), increasing revenues for manufacturers, and accelerating the export of new products.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Partners at the inception of the project are the Knowledge-Enhancement Partners: University of Minnesota Duluth Natural Resources Research Institute (Duluth, MN); Small businesses: Aspen Research Corporation (Maple Grove, MN); C.S. Industries LLC (Suwanee, GA); Marshall W. Nelson &amp; Associates, Inc. (Eagan, MN); WI Business Innovation Corporation (Spooner, WI); and Large business: Louisiana-Pacific Corporation (Nashville, TN); Other Partners: Public: Aitkin County Economic Development and Forestry (Aitkin, MN); College of Menominee Nation (Keshena, WI); MN Department of Natural Resources (St. Paul, MN); USDA Forest Service Forest Products Laboratory (Madison, WI); WI Department of Agriculture; Trade and Consumer Protection (Madison, WI); and WI Department of Natural Resources (Madison, WI); Private Non-Profit: APA-The Engineered Wood Association (Tacoma, WA); National Association of Home Builders Research Center (Upper Marlboro, MD); Private For-Profit: Arclin Limited (Mississauga, Ontario, CA); and Stora Enso Wood Products Oy Ltd.(Helsinki, Finland).</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project has potential to enhance the competitiveness of the nation's forest products industry because it advanced wood thermal-modification technology toward the development of high-performance and sustainable engineered wood products (EWPs) with improved dimensional stability, resistance to biodeterioration, extended service-life, and reduced environmental impacts.  Specifically, mechanical, physical, and biological durability performance testing has verified that the thermally-modified EWPs, when processed using the correct protocols, can better resist attack by common white rot and brown rot decay fungi and resist expansion and shrinkage due to changes in moisture content, while maintaining some key mechanical properties, such as modulus of elasticity (stiffness).  The Intellectual Merits of this project are:  Validation of research that expanded the bounds of wood thermal-modification technology from solid wood to EWPs. Demonstration of the process technologies, and mechanical, physical, and biological durability performance of new thermally-modified EWPs. Creation of a team and facilitation of interactions and information exchange between forest products industry stakeholders, both public and private, to advance wood thermal-modification technology. Expanding the research by collaborating with Lakehead University (Thunder Bay, Ontario, Canada) and the U.S. Department of Agriculture Forest Service, Forest Products Laboratory.   The Broader Impacts of this project are:  Advancement of discovery and understanding while promoting training and mentoring of four undergraduate and three graduate research assistants in research techniques, data analysis, and reporting. Broadening of research participation by partnering with two graduate students from underrepresented groups. Enhancement of unique pilot-scale wood thermal-modification technology to enable better process control and monitoring of real-time energy-use data, while making the technology available to researchers and practitioners from academia and industry, across the Nation and world. Broadening of research dissemination to enhance understanding by a range of stakeholders by publishing/sharing project results in diverse media sources, including:  (a) two peer-reviewed journal papers, (b) three domestic conference presentations/papers, (c) two international conference presentations/papers, (d) three seminars to undergraduate engineering students, (e) one article in a forest products industry trade journal, and (f) four seminars/webinars presented to both public and private forest products industry stakeholders.
