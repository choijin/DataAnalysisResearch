<AbstractNarration>The Macrofungi Collection Consortium: Unlocking a Biodiversity Resource for Understanding Biotic Interactions, Nutrient Cycling and Human Affairs&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mushrooms and related fungi (macrofungi) play a critical role in the lives of plants and animals, including humans, yet their diversity is underestimated. Understanding this diversity will be critical in analyzing impacts of habitat change, nutrient cycling in ecosystems, and distributions and diversity of host organisms.   Scientists in the U.S. have been studying these fungi for the past 150 years, resulting in a legacy of approximately 1.4 million dried scientific specimens conserved in 35 institutions in 24 states.  These institutions have now joined in an effort to digitize and share online all data associated with macrofungi specimens.  The resulting resource will enable a national census of macrofungi, never before attempted, and will allow researchers to better understand the diversity of these organisms and the relationship between macrofungi and the organisms with which they form intimate relationships.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Organized into clubs across the country, citizen mycologists play an important role in documenting macrofungi diversity, and these enthusiastic individuals are the conduit between professional scientists and the general public for critical information about wild edible and poisonous fungi.  Citizen mycologists will join the collections institutions in this project to help to create the on-line resource.  The project will fund two workshops for high school teachers to promote classroom study of fungi.  University students employed by the project will gain work experience in digitization and formal training about fungi.  Students will share the knowledge they gain through oral and video presentations. This award is made as part of the National Resource for Digitization of Biological Collections through the Advancing Digitization of Biological Collections program and all data resulting from this award will be available through the national resource (iDigBio.org).</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Macrofungi Collection Consortium (MaCC) is a digitization project funded by NSF?s Advancing Digitization of Biodiversity Collection.  Between 2012 and 2015, 38 participating institutions digitized approximately 1,250,000 herbarium specimens of macrofungi, which are those with conspicuous spore-bearing structures, such as polypores, mushrooms and puffballs. These newly digitized data, combined with those from previously digitized specimens have created a database of approximately 2.08 million specimens records which are shared through the MycoPortal.   The MaCC project was succeeded by the Microfungi Collections Consortium (MiCC) that has the goal of digitizing all additional mycological collections held in U.S. Herbaria by 2018.  In addition to the digitized herbarium specimen data, participants also digitized ancillary data that are needed to create meaning herbarium specimens, e.g., descriptions, illustrations, and observational records.  It is a resource for both amateur and professional mycologists. The amateur mycological community is very well established and organized in the U.S. with 80 clubs and 10,200 individual members under the umbrella North American Mycological Association.   Three of the herbaria included in the MaCC were built largely through the efforts of amateur mycologists.  Outreach to the amateur community has been a major component of the Macrofungi digitization project, including numerous tours, lectures and training sessions about how to prepare voucher specimens and how to use the MycoPortal for club or individual projects.  To summarize the contents of the data on macrofungi in the MycoPortal, approximately 73% of the specimens are from North America; 18% are from central America, South America and the Caribbean region; 5% are from Europe, 2% were for each of Northern and Southern and Australasia, and 1% from Africa.  Within North America, the greatest concentrations of specimens are unsurprisingly in states where there is a history of mycology at the states research institutions (e.g., Michigan, California, New York, Florida, North Carolina and Illinois).  The largest family represented in the MycoPortal is Polyporaceae, commonly known as conks, which inhabit living or dead trees and often cause tree mortality. The Polyporaceae are likely over-represented by herbarium specimens these fungi are large and persistent for long periods of time, meaning that many species are encountered more often than others.  In the course of this project, the Principal Investigators and Senior Personnel gave 65 presentations about the project, or using data from the MycoPortal.  This same group gave 93 presentations to citizen groups such as mushroom clubs; gave 45 tours or demonstrations or mushroom walks and led seven workshops, one of these for high school biology teachers to help them incorporate fungi into their curricula.  The MycoPortal is cited in approximately 28 articles as of 15 August 2017.  These include genus or species level treatments as well as some large-scale phylogenetic and ecological studies in native versus invasive range comparisons of macrofungi that form associations with the roots of trees.  Data from the MycoPortal have been used to verify species distributions for field guides of the Rocky Mountain region and northeastern North America. The Macrofungi Collection Consortium was also instrumental in the rehabilitation of the mycological collections of the University of North Carolina Herbarium.  In the course of this project, the Principal Investigators and Senior Personnel gave 65 presentations about the project, or using data from the MycoPortal.  This same group gave 93 presentations to citizen groups such as mushroom clubs, gave 45 tours or demonstrations or mushroom walks and led seven workshops, one of these for high school biology teachers to help them incorporate fungi into their curricula.  More than 280 people worked on this project; 200 of these were paid student interns, many of whom were exposed to fungal biodiversity for the first time.  The MycoPortal has provided the foundation for a Mycoflora of North America, which has never previously been attempted.  The need for an effort to document the phenotypes as well as genotypes of North American fungi was first articulated in 2011, and a workshop of 75 professional and amateur mycologists was convened to explore the topic in 2012.  Many details of the proposed Mycoflora of North America were not explored in depth, but those assembled agreed on the need for collection, sequencing and vouchering of specimens by amateur clubs as well as professionals and students.   Since 2012, at least 14 amateur clubs have embarked on projects to obtain DNA sequences from their collections, and to create voucher specimens.  Clubs make arrangements with laboratories to obtain sequences, and the cost of sequencing comes from club dues.  So far the effort has been largely uncoordinated, but a 2017 reboot of the Mycoflora project promises a more formal collaboration between amateur and professional mycologists that will build upon the data and tools available in the MycoPortal to characterize and distinguish the fungi of North America more effectively.
