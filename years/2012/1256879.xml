<AbstractNarration>Cereals such as rice (Oryza sativa) are staple food for human and animal nutrition. Because cereal growth is limited by nitrogen, the high yields of these crops are currently dependent on fertilizers that are a major on-farm expense and cause significant environmental damages. In view of the increasing demand for higher production of these crops, the development of alternative strategies to enhance crop production while reducing fertilizer use is of high priority. One such strategy is to use rhizobia that form intimate endophytic association with these crops and increase their growth. Rhizobia are soil bacteria that form a very efficient nitrogen-fixing association with legumes. Recent studies have shown that rhizobia hijacked the genetic machinery of legumes involved in symbiosis with mycorrhizal fungi. Similar to legumes, rice forms symbiosis with mycorrhizal fungi and contain the homologues of legume genes necessary for interactions with rhizobia. Preliminary results from the investigators' laboratories indicate that a rhizobial strain utilizes the mycorrhizal symbiotic pathway to colonize rice tissues. The goal of this project is to determine the molecular and cellular mechanisms of both rhizobia and rice that result in this beneficial association as well as to evaluate the potential of rhizobial nitrogen fixation with rice.  This rhizobial-cereal interaction provides a unique opportunity to study the initial relationships and mutual benefits that probably allowed legume nodulation to appear but also, in the long term, to use this system to engineer nitrogen fixation in cereals by following the path of legume evolution. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this project for the education and professional development include the interdisciplinary training for students and postdoctoral fellow that include experience in microbial and plant genetics, molecular biology, microscopy and plant-microbe interactions. Numerous outreach and educational opportunities will be provided for undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral students. The benefits of microbial symbioses will also be emphasized in directed research programs targeting minority undergraduate and K-12 students in both laboratories as well as using the public outreach programs in both campuses of the University of Wisconsin.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>A special group of soil bacteria, called rhizobia, form a symbiosis with legume plants, such as soybean and alfalfa. The rhizobia convert nitrogen in the air into fertilizer for the plant, and the plant feeds sugar to the rhizobia in return. Rhizobia can also interact with non-legume plants, like rice, but they do not make fertilizer for these hosts. The long-term goal of this research is to determine if rhizobia can also increase the growth of non-legumes such as rice. Legume plants recognize the special chemicals the rhizobia produce, called lipo-chitooligosaccharides (LCOs for short) (see <strong>Figure 1</strong>) that are made of a short chain of sugars, called chitin, to which a lipid (fat) has been added. LCOs can also be decorated with other small chemical additions that make them unique. We investigated whether rice also recognizes the LCOs produced by rhizobia. The first step in this effort was to sequence the genome of a rhizobial strain that is known to interact with rice (<em>Rhizobium </em>sp. IRBG74). &nbsp;We discovered that IRBG74 produces a similar type of chemical, called short chitooligosaccharides (COs for short), that lack the lipid but still have the other small chemical additions that make them unique (see <strong>Figure 2</strong>). Previously only certain kinds of symbiotic fungi were known to produce COs. We further demonstrated that IRBG74 can use undecorated COs to attach to the surface of rice roots andcan use COs and LCOs to stimulate rice to grow more roots. Study of the role of COs and LCOs in the interactions between rhizobia and rice roots, led to the determination of the sequential order of biosynthetic pathway for these communication signals. To determine how rice plants respond to the colonization of their roots by rhizobia, we identified several sets of genes that are turned on or off when the plant is exposed to different kinds of COs and LCOs. Many of these genes were involved in helping the plant respond to different kinds of stress (see <strong>Figure 3</strong>). We have also shown that IRBG74 marked with a gene that results in blue and green color, aggregate in large numbers on roots and subsequently enters inside rice roots and survive in inter-cellular spaces (<strong>Figure 4</strong>). Understanding how rhizobia produce these chemicals, what they are used for, and how rice plants respond to them will help us in the future to control the interactions between rice and rhizobia. Eventually, we will be able to influence the rhizobia to produce fertilizer for the rice plants, just like they already do for legume plants.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>As part of this work, six post-doctoral fellows, two doctoral students, and twelve undergraduate students were trained at the University of Wisconsin&ndash;Madison.
