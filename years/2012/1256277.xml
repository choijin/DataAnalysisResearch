<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research Program (SBIR) Phase I project will entail the development of a microfluidic colorimetric analyzer to yield quantitative field measurements out of essential inorganic nutrients (initially nitrite and nitrate, thereafter ammonium and orthophosphate). This analyzer will primarily be used in industrial farms where algae are grown to produce biofuel. Inorganic nutrients affect not only the amount of algae biomass generated, but also its lipid content. Maximizing algae biofuel production requires a series of steps, each associated with an optimal nutrient concentration. The amount of nutrient must be measured on a frequent basis as the timescales associated with algae growth are short. Currently, nutrient concentration data is obtained at rates that are too slow to permit maximization of algae production. This problem is being addressed through the development of a small inexpensive colorimetric analyzer that will perform real-time measurement. The design of this instrument is optimized for prolonged unattended field operations, and minimal maintenance and consumption of supplies. It uses EPA-approved analytical chemistries. These have been selected because they are the least susceptible to interference from other compounds present in the algae bioreactors and/or ponds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project effects US energy policy. The world is gradually running out of fossil oil. Renewable biofuels are increasingly seen as a key element of the US energy future. Algae, a source of oily biomass, are a leading candidate to meet biofuel needs. They can yield more fuel per acre than any other crops, they have the capability to grow in freshwater, as well as saltwater, and they are able to flourish in poor agricultural soil, which will reduce pressure on food prices. Furthermore, algae can grow using wastewater as nutrient feedstock. This reduces the ecological impact of wastewater discharges. Presently, the production of biofuel from algae is cost prohibitive due to high culturing and processing costs. Improving the management of inorganic nutrient levels in ponds and reactors where algae are grown will play a significant role in lowering biofuel production costs, ultimately making biofuels competitive with fossil fuels.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The primary goal of this program was to develop a microfluidic colorimetric analyzer to be used in the field for quantitative monitoring of important inorganic nutrients.  Although the program initially targeted the algae-fuel industry, there was minimal interest in our nitrite analyzer demonstrators.  The program, did however, capture the attention of an equally noticeable target audience, that of the water quality experts, such as oceanographers, environmental scientists, and aquaculture operators, who have expressed  a significant interest in a variant designed to measure and monitor low level nitrate in waste water.  At this juncture in time, though, development of this variant is incomplete.  In progress, is our multipass cell with integrated aspherical and asymmetrical optics; this was developed as part of this program for our nitrate analyzer, but has been adapted to be used in a hydraulic fluid analyzer prototype that is being fabricated for a US-based aerospace company.  This device, which is not a nutrient analyzer, but rather a small solid-particulate optical monitor, uses several of the subsystems developed under this NSF program.  Several prototypes are currently being tested by our customer.  Next-generation units will be delivered in 2016 to a couple of turbine manufacturers.  Ultimately, this optical particle counter is expected to be standard safety monitoring equipment on many large turbines (including turbofans equipping commercial airliners) that use / will use hybrid ceramic bearings.  The use of hybrid ceramic bearing in the design of turbojets and turbofans is expected to generally result in lower fuel consumption.  This continued effort is being funded by the US industry.
