<AbstractNarration>The research objective of this award is to fabricate an artificial photosynthesis device that is capable of receiving and then converting sunlight, CO2 and water into sugars/glucose for the production of biofuels. Additive manufacturing (AM) enhanced by high-resolution heterogeneous material printing technology and multi-function nozzle array will be investigated to design and build the innovative device with multi-layer interconnected channels and micro-porous structures. In the channels, a water-insoluble hydrogel embedded with photosynthesis dark-reaction required compounds will be printed for CO2 fixation. On the top of the device, a layer of triblock polymer film will be created and function as the light reaction mesophyll layer similar to a real leaf. This research will enable manufacturing and deployment of large-scale solar conversion systems that not only mimic the natural process of photosynthesis for the production of biofuels, but also make these reactions independent of the life of nature plants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the results of this research will lead to a new technology for designing and manufacturing an artificial photosynthesis device, which will help realize the vision of affordable bio-based energy manufacturing. Economically viable manufacturing of biofuels will greatly benefit the U.S. economy and energy security, as well as the society and environment in general. In the project, a long-term relationship with nScrypt, Inc. will be extended to encompass development and transfer of new technologies. Two doctoral students and up to six senior design teams will be trained. Three project-based learning modules will be created to strengthen the undergraduate engineering curricula in design, manufacturing and energy engineering. The project will also leverage specially designed outreach workshops for local high school and community college students, including many underrepresented minority students in Philadelphia, PA and Raleigh, NC areas, to showcase AM technology, photosynthesis process and green energy. The research finding and results will be disseminated through seminars, conferences, journal publications and various communication channels.</AbstractNarration>
