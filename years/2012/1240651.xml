<AbstractNarration>Real world data, such as World Wide Web, social networks, corporate knowledge networks, biological networks, semantic networks, etc., can be abstracted in the form of a massive and complex graph, with millions to billions of nodes and edges. With the explosion of such data, there is a pressing need for data mining, analysis, and querying tools to rapidly make sense of and extract knowledge. However, effectively leveraging the resources of modern architectures and mining such large graphs for interesting patterns  remains challenging. At the same time commodity desktop architectures that have processors with multiple cores and graphics processors (with hundreds of stream cores) are opening up significant opportunities for parallel graph analytics and management on the desktop.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This exploratory research seeks to scale up the performance of graph mining and clustering algorithms on modern desktop supercomputers to leverage the power of multi-core systems equipped with graphics processors, and to explore and develop new algorithms for reducing the search space and and the amount of data processed.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ We are currently witnessing a revolutionary change in in the way commodity desktop architectures are being designed and implemented.  Processors with many cores coupled with co-processors or accellerators such as graphics processor units (GPUs), faster memories, solid-state drives (SSDs) have all entered the mainstream commodity market giving rise to the phrase "desktop supercomputing". At the same time the amount of data we are able to collect and store in all walks of human endeavor  -- from sky surveys to high throughput experiments,  and from the world wide web and related technologies to smart health sensors -- is enormous. An increasing number of such datasets are naturally abstracted in structured form (e.g. graphs or networks).  Given these twin trends this exploratory seed grant sought to develop new algorithms that can scale to data with such structure (graphs and networks) on desktop supercomputers leveraging hardware features such as GPUs and solid-state drives. Specifically we have developed:  1. New algorithms for discovering communities within social and behavioral networks and functional modules within biological and health networks that naturally combine structural information with content information. We demonstrated that such algorithms are able to identify patterns that can be utilized by domain experts and that such algorithms can leverage the underlying hardware efficiently.  2. New ways of leveraging solid state drives for supporting hashing -- a key kernel used in many graph and data analytic applications.  Our novel design completely leverages the features of solid-state drives, delivering performance that is commensurate with the technology while also ensuring that the longevity of such devices is maximized.  3. New approaches for supporting sparse-matrix kernels on current and next generation co-processors including GPUs. We have demonstrated the viability of these kernels by adapting them within various applications of graph mining and graph clustering and have shown them to outperform the current state-of-the-art significantly.  In terms of scientific impact this work has already been adopted within the broader research community (via software downloads and citations). Importantly we have taken a first step at supporting high-end algorithms on commodity desktop architectures potentially enabling a broad class of scientists, engineers and small-business owners to leverage such ideas for their respective data analytic needs.  In terms of training and outreach this grant has primarily supported the PhD work of two students (one from an under-represented group) and allowed them to present their work (described above) to their peers in top tier data analytics forums.  The PI has also described elements of this work in various keynote and invited talks both in academic as well as industrial settings across the country and internationally.  In term of technology transfer and industrial collaboration, two of the pieces of work described above were done in collaboration with key industrial affiliates and an initial version of the community discovery work has also been licensed by an industrial partner. The PI and his collaborators intend to build on this work.       Last Modified: 04/02/2014       Submitted by: Srinivasan Parthasarathy]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
