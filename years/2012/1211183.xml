<AbstractNarration>The focus of the proposed research is stability and long-time dynamics of travelling wave solutions  of nonlinear partial differential equations that arise in many areas of science and engineering.  This proposal will develop a systematic analysis of spectral, linearized, and nonlinear stability  and long-time dynamics of spatially periodic traveling structures in a variety of models. In particular, stability of uni-directional and multiply periodic traveling waves with respect to uni-lateral as well as higher-dimensional transverse perturbations will be considered. Furthermore, stability of such  traveling structures to non-localized perturbations inducing global phase shifts will be investigated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main thrust of the project is a study of stability and behavior of traveling waves in many equations  arising, for example, as models of water waves and thin films, and in plasma physics and engineering.  Such solutions travel at constant speed without changing shape, and often form fundamental building  blocks for more complicated solutions of the model equations. Studying their stability to small perturbations (i.e. whether the wave is quickly restored to the orginal wave form) is of practical  importance, since waves that are unstable do not naturally manifest themselves in physical situations,  except possibly as transient phenomena. This proposal aims to provide researchers with practical and  efficient "rules of thumb" to ascertain stability of mathematical solutions arising in physical models. A central component of the proposal is the educational and professional training of undergraduate and graduate students, who will receive interdisciplinary instruction through seminars, conferences, and special topics courses.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ A fundamental strategy in the mathematical study of many real world phenomena is to try to identify coherent patterns that consistently act as organizing centers for the long-time behavior of the system.  In many applications, such long-time behavior is dominated by waveforms that are "almost" periodic, in the sense that their internal wavelength is considerably smaller than the size of the physical domain.  Such waves can be studied away from physical boundaries by idealizing them as waves with perfect spatial periodicity.  However, the capability of periodic waves to carry modulation signals makes their dynamics under perturbations rich in multi-scale phenomena and essentially infinite dimensional.  During this award, the PI developed a majority of his effort to developing a rigorous mathematical theory to predict the modulational stability (at both an approximate "linear" level, and at the true "nonlinear" level) of spatially periodic waves that are capable to carrying multiple modulation signals, as well as to precisely describe the long-time behaviors associated with such stable waves.  After successfully developing such a general theory, the PI and collaborators have applied the theory to the mathematical study of viscous roll-waves, which are a well-observed hydrodynamic instability occurring in inclined thin-film flow.  Using these abstract techniques and methodologies, the PI and collaborators provided the first mathematically rigorous investigation of such viscous roll-waves, proving for the first time the existence of stable roll-waves in the physical models.  Additionally, the PI has developed new techniques to analyze the so-called spectral "modulational stability" of periodic waves in a variety of contexts.  These techniques have been successfully applied to a number of model equations that describe the dynamics of water waves.  This has led to a number of new and interesting results on the predictive value of dispersion-generalized nonlinear dispersive models.  Such models have received much attention from researchers lately, and the work by the PI and collaborators provides new tool and methodologies to produce mathematically rigorous results concerning the dynamics and long-time behavior of periodic waves in such systems.  The training of graduate students was an important aspect of this award.  The techniques and methodologies developed as part of this award led to the publication of a book chapter in the Springer Series "Lecture Notes in Physics", which intend to provide graduate students in mathematics and physics with an accessible account of cutting-edge techniques and methodologies in particular fields of study.  Importantly, this chapter describes how one can use mathematics to make rigorous some of the formal physical theories surrounding the study of slow-modulations of periodic structures, and as such will be useful to researchers in a broad context.  Furthermore, the award allowed for the support of several graduate students at the University of Kansas to conduct research related to this award and to travel to professional conferences to network, stay up-to-date with current research trends in the field, develop new collaborations, and to present their research  to the broader mathematical community.
