<AbstractNarration>Parasitic angiosperms are noxious and persistent pests in farmers' fields and serious constraints to crop productivity. The "witchweeds", members of the genus Striga, are particularly devastating since their primary hosts include the major cereals (maize, sorghum, rice and millet) and grain legumes that are dietary staples worldwide. How parasitic weeds and Striga species in particular recognize their potential hosts and overcome the innate defense systems are not known. Using the interaction of cowpea (Vigna unguiculata), an important food and forage legume, with Striga gesnerioides, this project seeks to identify parasite-derived effectors and virulence proteins that enter host cells, specifically altering their structure and function and suppressing the defense response mechanism at various levels, enabling infection and parasite ingress to occur. Novel, in planta functional screens will be used to identify candidate effectors from Striga that are directly or indirectly recognized by race-specific resistance proteins in cowpea leading to activation of a hypersensitive response at the point of infection and associated downstream defense responses. These functional screens are complemented by comparative transcriptome sequencing in compatible and incompatible host-parasite association and in silico analysis aimed at identifying candidate virulence effectors through race-specific gene expression signatures. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The outcomes of this project will provide novel insights into the mechanisms by which parasitic angiosperms identify and parasitize their hosts and how hosts block such attack. The negative impact of parasitic plants on crop productivity increases globally each year and their potential for affecting domestic agriculture looms larger as the movement of seed resources expands globally. The outcomes of this work will contribute directly to the development of strategies to improve crop security by providing targets for manipulating pest resistance responses of crop plants. In addition these studies provide new educational, research, and training opportunities for US students on the African continent.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Cowpea, Vigna unguiculata L. Walp., is one of the most important food and forage legumes in the semi-arid tropics. While most domesticated forms of cowpea are susceptible to the root parasitic weed Striga gesnerioides, several cultivars have been identified that show race-specific resistance. Cowpea cultivar B301 contains the RSG3-301 gene for resistance to S. gesnerioides races&nbsp; SG3 and SG4, but is susceptible to race SG4z. When challenged by SG3 or SG4, roots of cultivar B301 develop a strong resistance response characterized by a hypersensitive reaction and cell<br />death at the site of parasite attachment. In contrast, no visible response occurs in B301 roots parasitized by SG4z. Gene expression in B301 roots during compatible (susceptible) and incompatible (resistant) interactions with S. gesnerioides races were investigated at early (6 days post-inoculation (dpi)) and late (13 dpi) stages of the resistance response. Genes and pathways involved in signal transduction, programmed cell<br />death and apoptosis, and defense response to biotic and abiotic stress were differentially expressed in the early resistance response; at the later time point, enrichment was primarily for defense-related gene expression, and genes encoding components of lignifications and secondary wall formation. In compatible interactions (B301 &ndash;SG4z), multiple defense pathways were repressed, including those involved in lignin biosynthesis and secondary cell wall modifications, while cellular transport processes for nitrogen and sulfur were increased. We concluded that the dstinct changes in global gene expression profiles occuring in host roots following successful and unsuccessful attempted parasitism by Striga also were influenced by parasite gene expression. Therefore we carried out transcriptome profiling of gene expression in the parasite haustorium&nbsp; during compatible and incompatible responses of resistant (B301) and susceptible (Blackeye) cowpea cultivars with three races of&nbsp;<em>S.</em><em> </em><em>gesneriodies</em>&nbsp;(SG3, SG4 and SG4z).
