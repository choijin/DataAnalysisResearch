<AbstractNarration>Spectrum efficiency refers to the information rate that can be transmitted over a given bandwidth in a specific communication system. It is a measure of how efficiently a limited frequency spectrum is utilized. In this project, innovative spectrum efficient waveform designs are studied towards narrower mainlobe and lower sidelobe in spectrum. It has been recognized that judicious use of properly designed waveforms, coupled with advanced receiver strategies, is fundamental to fully utilizing the capacity of the electromagnetic spectrum. This project seeks innovative approaches on nested and co-prime samplers for spectrum efficiency, and subsequently applies it to wireless networks. Different waveforms designs and diversities are studied based on nested and co-prime samplers. Co-prime samplers are used for Multi-Input Multi-Output communication system. In the application to spectrum efficient wireless networks, nodes exchange information over a common wireless channel. Under different traffic scenarios and different constraints, e.g., bandwidth and signal to noise and interference ratio, the amount of data exchanged among these nodes may vary. A key question then is how the throughput capacity of wireless network improves with the new waveform design schemes and different network setup and how it grows with the number of nodes in the network. This project seeks to help reach the nation's broadband goals and the larger objective of alleviating growing pressure on limited spectrum resources. This project will attract minority and woman students to participate in the project.</AbstractNarration>
