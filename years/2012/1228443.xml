<AbstractNarration>This project is developing new techniques for manipulating sensitive data by exploring two related areas, computing on private keys and computing on authenticated data.  Currently, a private key is an inert object that gives its holder the ability to perform a cryptographic operation on all messages, as may be the case when generating a signature.  The project is exploring a new vision, in which computing on the private key itself creates new restricted private keys that can only perform restricted operations such as, for example, signing only some messages but not others.  In the case of computing on authenticated data -- data for which integrity is important but secrecy is not -- the project is developing new tools to compute on such data and obtain authenticated results.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is committed to the dissemination of research results, education of students, and outreach to industry.   Overall, the proposed project will produce a next generation of technology for managing authenticated and encrypted data while advancing the field of applied cryptography and educating the next generation of researchers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project deepened our understanding of digital signatures, pseudorandom functions and verifiable random functions.   We realized new design techniques that enable these primitives to support more advanced functionalities and be proven secure under weaker number-theoretic assumptions.  One example of a complex system that can benefit from this research is the area of cryptocurrencies.  This project also supported research related to distributed anonymous payments from a practical perspective.  Overall, the project resulted in nine publications in top venues plus a PhD thesis at Johns Hopkins University.   It also provided opportunities for research participation by undergraduates.  We highlight a few results.  HIGHLIGHT 1 First, in Ahn et al. (Journal of Cryptology 2015), we studied computing on authenticated data.  In tandem with recent progress on computing on encrypted data via fully homomorphic encryption, we present a framework for computing on authenticated data via the notion of slightly homomorphic signatures, or P-homomorphic signatures. With such signatures, it is possible for a third party to derive a signature on the object m&prime; from a signature of m as long as P(m,m&prime;)=1 for some predicate P which captures the "authenticatable relationship" between m&prime; and m. Moreover, a derived signature on m&prime; reveals no extra information about the parent m. Our definition is carefully formulated to provide one unified framework for a variety of distinct concepts in this area, including arithmetic, homomorphic, quotable, redactable, transitive signatures, and more. It includes being unable to distinguish a derived signature from a fresh one even when given the original signature. The inability to link derived signatures to their original sources prevents some practical privacy and linking attacks, which is a challenge not satisfied by most prior works. Under this strong definition, we then provide generic constructions for all univariate and closed predicates, and specific efficient constructions for a broad class of natural predicates such as quoting, subsets, weighted sums, averages, and Fourier transforms. To our knowledge, these are the first efficient constructions for these predicates (excluding subsets) that provably satisfy this strong security notion.  HIGHLIGHT 2 Second, in Goyal et al. (Theory of Cryptography Conference 2017), we developed a new generic approach to constructing and proving the security of VRFs.    Verifiable Random Functions (VRFs) as introduced by Micali, Rabin and Vadhan are a special form of Pseudo Random Functions (PRFs) wherein a secret key holder can also prove validity of the function evaluation relative to a statistically binding commitment. Prior works have approached the problem of constructing VRFs by proposing a candidate under specific number-theoretic setting --- mostly in bilinear groups --- and then grapple with the challenges of proving security in the VRF environments.

Instead of tackling the VRF problem as a whole, we demonstrate a simple and generic way of building Verifiable Random Functions from more basic and narrow cryptographic primitives.   We then support our generic approach by giving new constructions of these underlying primitives under different number-theoretic assumptions.  HIGHLIGHT 3 Third, in Chiesa et al. (Eurocrypt 2017), we studied decentralized anonymous micropayment systems.  Micropayments (payments worth a few pennies) have numerous potential applications. A challenge in achieving them is that payment networks charge fees that are high compared to "micro" sums of money.  Wheeler (1996) and Rivest (1997) proposed probabilistic payments as a technique to achieve micropayments: a merchant receives a macro-value payment with a given probability so that, in expectation, he receives a micro-value payment.

We formulate and construct decentralized anonymous micropayment (DAM) schemes, which enable parties with access to a ledger to conduct offline probabilistic payments with one another, directly and privately. Our techniques extend those of Zerocash (2014) with a new privacy-preserving probabilistic payment protocol.       Last Modified: 10/06/2017       Submitted by: Susan Hohenberger]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
