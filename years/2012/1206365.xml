<AbstractNarration>The main goal of Prof. Tolman's research is to investigate the role of group actions in symplectic geometry. She intends to focus  on three related areas. First, she will explore the conditions that force a symplectic action to be Hamiltonian; in particular, she plans to construct a compact six-dimensional symplectic manifold with a non-Hamiltonian symplectic circle action with exactly two fixed points. Second, she will work on classifying symplectic manifolds with ``large" torus actions. More specifically, she will finish her project with Y. Karshon on n-1 dimensional torus actions on 2n dimensional manifolds, analyze Hamiltonian circle actions on six-manifolds, and find applications in both cases -- especially to Fano manifolds. Third, R. Goldin and S. Tolman  will generalize ideas from algebraic combinatorics to the more general symplectic setting of Hamiltonian actions on symplectic manifolds. In addition to these three main areas, she will work with her collaborators on a number of other projects: calculating the cohomology of the symplectic quotients of Hamiltonian loop group actions, and computing the  integer cohomology of symplectic manifolds and their quotients in the finite dimensional case. Taken together, these results will significantly advance our understanding of this field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Consider a physical system,  such as a planet orbiting around a star. We need to keep track of the position and momentum of each object: The set of all possible measurements is called phase space. For the two-body system, the  phase space is twelve dimensional Euclidean space. Even for more complicated systems, the phase space looks locally like Euclidean space. Moreover, the rate of change over time of the momentum of an object is determined by the rate of change of the total energy of the system with respect to the position of that object; the converse also holds. Finally, many physical systems have symmetries.  For example, if we ignore any external gravitational field, the solar system has three-dimensional rotational symmetry. Prof. Tolman studies  a mathematical generalization of phase space, called "symplectic manifolds."  Her research focuses on understanding the role of symmetries on these spaces.  For example, she is studying when symplectic manifolds with symmetry are as well behaved as algebraic varieties, which are the spaces cut out by solutions to polynomial equations. Working with Prof. Karshon, she is trying to describe all symplectic manifolds with extremely large amounts of symmetry.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ With the invaluable support of the NSF,  I have been able to make significant progress in understanding symplectic circle actions.  These systems are important  in many contexts. The most concrete example is that they arise in any physcial system with rotational symmetry.   Another,   way they can arise is as the zero set (in projective space) of a set of complex polynomials that are invariant under a circle action.  The most significant result is that I have solved an open problem, usually called the McDuff conjecture.   Given a symplectic circle action,  one natural question is whether their exists a "moment map".  In the physicial system described above, there is one -- namely, angular momentum.  The moment map is important; for example, if there is a moment map then you can learn a great deal of information from the "fixed points", that is, points that do not move under the rotation.   Frankel proved that, in the algebaric case of the zero set described above, if there are any fixed points then there must be a moment map.  The McDuff conjecture asks whether the analoguos statement is true for any symplectic circle action on closed, connected  symplectic manifold with isolated fixed points.  I answered this question by constructing a symplectic circle action on a closed, connected six dimensional symplectic manifold with 32 isolated fixed points.  One reason this is important is because it shows how much richer and more complicated symplectic manifold are iin general than in the algebraic case.  During this period, I also accomplished a number of other goals.  A postdoc, J. Watts, and I developed the theory of tame circle actions.  We proved that a number of the most important standard theorems in Kaehler geometry also hold in this more general context.   Another postdoc,  Donghoon Jang, and I, published a paper in which we analyze symplectic circle actions with moment maps  on eight-dimensional manifolds with exactly five fixed points, that is, with the fewest possible number of fixed points.  We prove that, in this case, the invariant of the manifold must agree with those of simplest possible example, projective space.  In addition to their intellectual merit, both these projects contributed to their further training.          Last Modified: 07/18/2017       Submitted by: Susan Tolman]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
