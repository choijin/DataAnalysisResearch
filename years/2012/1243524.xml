<AbstractNarration>The overarching research goal of this project is to develop an integrated framework for conserving Central African biodiversity under climate change that is both evolutionarily-informed and grounded in the socioeconomic constraints of the region. Central African rainforests represent one of the most important centers of biological diversity in the world. While efforts have been made to prioritize regions for protection, habitat loss continues at an alarming rate severely limiting the ability of species to respond to climate change. This project unites researchers and students from the U.S., Cameroon, Gabon, United Kingdom, Germany, France and the Netherlands around an innovative research program that seeks to identify meaningful conservation measures to mitigate the effects of habitat loss and climate change. The international team will use multi-disciplinary approaches to: 1) map environmentally-associated genomic and phenotypic variation in a broad range of species and assess how this overlaps with patterns of species richness and protected areas; 2) evaluate how evolutionary adaptation, phenotypic plasticity and landscape connectivity might mediate future threats; and 3) develop an integrated prioritization scheme that ranks candidate areas for protection on their evolutionary potential, connectivity, estimated socioeconomic costs, degree of threat and cultural value. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project involves a broad range of partnerships between U.S., European and African universities, non-governmental organization and governmental agencies. Planned educational activities will promote scientific collaboration and exchange between partners through: 1) undergraduate and graduate educational programs that will partner U.S. and African students and provide cutting-edge training in the biological, environmental and social sciences; 2) annual professional development workshops for early career U.S. and African scientists and advanced graduate students; 3) region-wide research symposia and scientific exchange; 4) bilingual distance-learning programs; and 5) outreach to decision makers through policy workshops. This integrative program aligns well with NSF's Science, Engineering, and Education for Sustainability (SEES) program objectives in developing a workforce of globally engaged young investigators whose coordinated efforts will focus on sustainability science and education. These joint international research and educational efforts will enhance existing collaborations and establish new partnerships that will build a foundation for lasting conservation and sustainability in Central Africa. The project is funded by NSF's Office of International Science and Engineering (OISE).</AbstractNarration>

While efforts have been made to prioritize regions for protection, habitat conversion and deforestation continue at an alarming rate. Forest loss and land use changes are not only affecting populations of species currently inhabiting these regions, but also limiting the ability of future populations to respond to climate change. Previous conservation strategies have used measures such as levels of species richness and species rarity for planning but have rarely incorporated the evolutionary processes that produce and maintain biological diversity.  Our project's goal was to develop an integrated framework for conserving Central African biodiversity under climate change, which was both evolutionary-informed and grounded in the socioeconomic constraints of the region.

Integrating across seven taxa, including birds, mammals, insects, amphibians and plants, results showed:  (1) The main areas in Cameroon and Gabon where the highest intraspecific genomic turnover is found were across the forest-savanna ecotone and elevational gradients along the Cameroon montane line.  (2) The highest species richness was found in South Central Cameroon and highest levels of endemism in the Cameroon mountains.  (3) The highest genomic vulnerability, a measure of how much populations need to evolve to maintain genotype-environment relationships under future climate warming; based on a 2080 scenario using IPCC RCP 4.5.  In some cases, we found that for species to persist, some areas of high genomic vulnerability populations will need to evolve at a rate 300 times faster than they have done since the last glacial maximum 18,000 years ago.   To ensure that our research results were used to inform policy and decision making, we met with over 150 representatives from national governments and non-governmental organizations in the very first year of the project to communicate the goals of project.
