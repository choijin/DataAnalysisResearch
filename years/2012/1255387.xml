<AbstractNarration>Dr. Mario A. Alpuche-Aviles of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Nevada, Reno, is supported by a Career Award from the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry (MSN) program in the NSF Division of Chemistry. The research being conducted involves nanoparticle electron transfer reactions that are of importance in photocatalysis, a process that enables conversion of light into chemical energy. New approaches to their study are being developed with potential application in the design of more efficient energy conversion schemes based on photocatalysis of semiconductor nanoparticles in solution.  The long-term goal of the project is to understand the interdependence between photocatalytic properties of semiconductor nanoparticles and nanoparticle size and shape.  These photocatalytic properties will be determined from interactions between semiconductor nanoparticles and electrodes with diameter of a few micrometers or less. The work includes (1) measuring photoelectrochemical electron transfer rates of individual nanoparticles; (2) correlating the intrinsic nanoparticle activity with nanoparticle structure; (3) developing computer models of the interactions between colloidal nanoparticles and the working electrode.  Subsequent refinements of the methodology will include studies of reactions that hinder efficiency because they compete with the desired photoelectrochemical reactions for energy conversion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Alpuche will encourage students to consider careers in the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields through the development of hands-on activities for K-12 level. This includes outreach to Hispanic population of Nevada with presentations at K-12 schools with large Hispanic populations.</AbstractNarration>
