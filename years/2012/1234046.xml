<AbstractNarration>The Principal Investigator (PI) plans to investigate plasma turbulence in the solar wind, solar corona, and throughout the heliosphere by using spacecraft data and simulations. His research team will study turbulent dissipation processes in order to determine how propagating kinetic Alfven waves (KAWs) cause heating of solar wind protons. These results may also be relevant to the processes that heat the solar corona.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI's team will use data from the Cluster spacecraft to study several important problems in plasma turbulence. These problems include the determination of the specific wavenumbers at which protons are heated by turbulence, the factors determining the form of the magnetic helicity spectrum in the kinetic regime, and whether stochastic heating by a particular KAW spectrum is a viable mechanism for the perpendicular heating of thermal protons in the solar wind. The PI will compare the predictions of theory and simulations for the form of the KAW spectrum in the vicinity of the spectral break and determine how these predictions compare with real solar wind observations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI's team will integrate their research with education by participating in the 'Los Alamos Earth and Space Science Academy' (LAESSA) outreach program, which provides training to New Mexico middle school science teachers. Scientific results will also be disseminated through publications in scientific journals and through presentations at community workshops and meetings.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The investigation of plasma waves and fluctuations in the solar wind help us to understand the plasma physical processes that govern the evolution of the solar wind as it blows outward at supersonic speeds from the sunÃ†s million degree corona to fill the solar system and the heliosphere.  In this project, studies of plasma waves were carried out using a combination of theoretical calculations and the analysis of spacecraft data.  The results of the data analysis show that two distinct types of plasma fluctuations or plasma waves can clearly be identified at kinetic scales.  One type of wave is observed when making measurements along a line perpendicular or at oblique angles to the solar wind magnetic field; these have tentatively been identified as Kinetic Alfven waves propagating almost perpendicular to the magnetic field.  The second type of wave is observed when making measurements along a line parallel to the solar wind magnetic field; these have tentatively been identified as electromagnetic ion cyclotron waves propagating away from the sun along the magnetic field or, alternatively, magnetosonic waves propagating toward from the sun along the magnetic field.  It is not possible to positively identify which one of these two possible kinds of waves is actually being observed because that requires electric field measurements which are not available.  Nevertheless, to explain the observations it is necessary that the waves are propagating primarily in one direction.    Various theoretical studies carried out during this project give us confidence that the physical interpretation of the wave observations just described is correct.  The unidirectional propagation of the parallel propagating waves is likely a consequence of the differential streaming of alpha particles (ionized helium) which often flow away from the sun along the magnetic field at a slightly faster speed than the protons.  Theoretical calculations show that because of the differential streaming of the alpha particles, plasma instabilities preferentially generate waves that propagate unidirectionally.  Moreover, the direction of wave propagation predicted by theory is precisely the direction that is required to explain the observations.
