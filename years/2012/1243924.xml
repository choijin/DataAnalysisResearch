<AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;Nutrient cycling in the environment is carried out by complex microbial communities.  Unraveling the network of organismal interactions that drive carbon and nitrogen cycling in nature is a challenging task given the taxonomic, functional, and biochemical diversity of most natural systems. This project will study a series of environmentally derived freshwater and marine photosynthetic microbial communities that grow using cellulose and dinitrogen as sole sources of carbon and nitrogen, respectively.  These communities contain distinct populations that can degrade nitrogen-poor cellulose, fix atmospheric N2, and harvest light energy through photosynthesis at different light wavelengths under anaerobic conditions. The goal of this research is to generate new insights into the links between community structure, productivity, and organismal interactions that produce stable nutrient-cycling microbial systems by using biochemical, molecular, and model-based analyses.  These environmentally derived consortia can provide insight into how renewable resources such as cellulose, N2, and light can be efficiently converted into cell biomass and other usable products under marine and freshwater conditions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;This research will be conducted at the primarily undergraduate institution, Olin College and the non-profit research institution, Marine Biological Laboratory (MBL). The interaction between these institutions will provide rich opportunities for undergraduate training. Undergraduates will be strongly involved in all cultivation, biochemical, and physiological characterization of consortia at Olin College. They will be exposed to cutting edge techniques in high-throughput sequencing and bioinformatics at the MBL. This will provide valuable experience, encouragement and preparation for graduate programs and for a range of careers in science. The data generated by this research will be brought into the classroom and integrated into curricula to enhance student learning of bioinformatics using authentic data.  Undergraduates will be involved in all aspects of this research, will present results at scientific meetings, and will co-author manuscripts.</AbstractNarration>

The goals of this research were to understand the composition of microbial communities from marine and freshwater environments that carry out the energetically demanding processes of cellulose degradation and nitrogen fixation (Image 1). To study this question, we developed a cultivation system to enrich a series of phototrophic communities that can accomplish these metabolic tasks (Image 2) and analyzed their community composition and metabolic potential using 16S rRNA gene community diversity profiling and metagenomic sequencing.&nbsp; Study of these communities has revealed the microbial types and suites of cellulase and nitrogenase enzymes needed to accomplish this nutrient cycling from marine and freshwater environments. The tractable microbial communities in culture have enabled the study of questions in microbial ecology about the factors that influence microbial community composition.&nbsp; We have also detected novel bacterial types within the cultured communities, and analysis of genomic data in progress will enable hypotheses about the biological function and roles of novel bacteria within the communities.&nbsp;</p> <p>In this research undergraduates from multiple disciplines have been trained in techniques in classical microbiology and methods in bioinformatics and analysis of genomic data.
