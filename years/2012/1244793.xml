<AbstractNarration>This project is to support undergraduate students attending and participating in the Symposium on Undergraduate Research to be held at the Laser Science XXVIII Conference, October 14 - 18, 2012 in Rochester, NY. The symposium will take place on Monday of the conference. Previous years' programs are at http://www.aps.org/units/dls/meetings/symposium/index.cfm. The intellectual merit of this project is to present and disseminate the results of the research work of the participants, mostly from NSF-supported REU programs, and possibly to initiate collaborations among them. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact is to provide the opportunity for these young students to attend a national meeting of this stature and give their first public talks. A secondary benefit arises because collaborations among them are often born in these sessions since very often students in different universities are involved in similar projects. A third impact is to inaugurate the networking among these students that will be so vital to their future careers as professional scientists, and to encourage them to continue along such a career path.</AbstractNarration>

The students heard inspiring remarks and lively discussion from several distinguished guests, including Joe Eberly, Anthony Johnson, Jan Hall, Mike Noel, Paul Corkum, David Williams, and others.

"What I feel I      walked away with, professionally, was a greater sense of what continuing      education (grad school) would be like. It was great to network with the      professors from schools that I would probably not get a chance to visit."    "I just wanted to let you know that      giving a talk at the conference was the best experience of my academic      career. It was absolutely amazing.
