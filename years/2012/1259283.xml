<AbstractNarration>This project provides scholarships to at least 62 talented undergraduate students with financial need in the Computational Science program at the University of South Carolina-Beaufort. The objectives of the project are to generate stimulating educational opportunities for students (particularly women and minorities), to improve their academic performance, to increase retention of students in the Computational Science program, and to ensure the competitiveness of graduates for placement in challenging and highly rewarding jobs that demand advanced technical skills. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project focuses mainly on freshman and sophomore students, with reasonable entry requirements to encourage students to enroll in Computational Science. Students with a high school GPA of 3.0 and above with demonstrated financial need are eligible for the scholarship. With a combination of active mentoring and full scale academic support programs (such as peer and professional tutoring) particularly designed for this program, at least 80% of scholarship recipients are expected to make significant academic progress and graduate within five years. Beginning in their second year of study, many eligible students continuing in the Computational Science program see their source of financial support transition from the funds supplied by this S-STEM program to the South Carolina state-funded and merit-based Legislative Incentive for Future Excellence (LIFE) scholarship. In addition, summer internship programs and entry-level career placement services help enable students to find success as computational scientists, thereby helping to ensure the future of the Nation's scientific leadership, economic competitiveness, and national security. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: Computational Science is a field of applied Computer Science in which computing theories and software techniques are used to serve and advance many diverse fields, including science, engineering, social science and business. The University of South Carolina Beaufort is one of just a handful of institutions in the U.S. that currently offer an undergraduate degree in Computational Science. This scholarship program attracts and retains the best and brightest students, thereby increasing the number and diversity of computational scientists trained to harness the power of high performance computing, and sustaining the Nation's scientific leadership. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The University of South Carolina Beaufort draws its students primarily from the Lowcountry area of South Carolina. Many of its students come from families with low household income; in 2011-2012, 46.5% of USCB students received Pell grants. For the Computational Science program, 66% demonstrated financial need, and among these financial needy students, 70% are from underrepresented groups (African Americans, Hispanics, and Native Hawaiian Pacific Islander). Consequently, this scholarship program provides a unique opportunity for this diverse group of students, allowing them to concentrate on science education and enabling their future.  As one of the few Computational Science undergraduate degree programs in the country, this program also holds promise to contribute to the national understanding of how to best train undergraduates in this area.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This S-STEM project supported 87 talented but financially needy undergraduate students in the Computational Science (CSCI) program at the University of South Carolina Beaufort (USCB) from August 2013 to May 2019.&nbsp; Computational Science is a field of applied Computer Science in which computing theories and software techniques are used to serve and advance many diverse fields, including science, engineering, social science and business. According to the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics (SIAM), the CSCI program at USCB is one of only a handful of undergraduate degrees in Computational Science in the U.S. [1].</p> <p>The project generated stimulating educational opportunities for diverse students, particularly women and minorities. Among those S-STEM students, 23% are female, 30% come from underrepresented groups (African-American, Hispanic, and American Indians/Alaska Natives), and more than 17% are non-traditional students (including students with disabilities, students with family responsibilities, military students and retired veterans, and students who delayed college enrollment after high school).</p> <p>All supported students made excellent academic progress through this project. In average, all S-STEM students have maintained a GPA of 3.4 by the time of this report. More importantly, while national student retention rate in four-year institutions in Physical/Computer/Mathematical Sciences is around 43% [2], we observed a retention rate of approximately 79% for this project, equating to 69 of the 87 USCB CSCI students supported by this project. The remaining 18 students have transferred either to other USCB academic programs (6 students, or approximately 7% of all 87 supported students) or to other institutions (12 students, or approximately 14%). Among those 69 students in the project, 43 of them (or 62%) have graduated from the CSCI program.</p> <p>To ensure the competitiveness of graduates for placement in challenging full-time jobs that are relevant to their degree, 100% of S-STEM students engaged in experiential learning and/or other opportunities enabling practical synthesis and application of knowledge gained from CSCI coursework. This was achieved through 1) capstone course projects, 2) research projects supervised by faculty mentors, 3) external summer research and/or internship programs, and 4) software development projects produced in collaboration with local governments and nonprofit organizations through the USCB student chapter of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM). The combination of strong academic preparation with valuable experiential learning opportunities has generated an amazing 100% job placement rate for our S-STEM graduates, with all graduates working in Computer/Computational Science related fields.</p> <p>In addition to enhancing educational opportunities for students, the S-STEM project also played a critical role in promoting the Computational Science program. Starting with only 7 students in fall 2010, the program has grown steadily, with an enrollment of nearly 100 students in 2018-2019. The growth of the program led to the addition of four new faculty between 2013 and 2019; the growth also led to the creation of a new Department of Computer Science in 2018.</p> <p>The success of the project has also played a key role in the refinement and expansion of the CSCI program course offerings, including the development of two additional degree programs to train students for a greater variety of job opportunities in both research and industry. The new programs include 1) a Master of Science program in Computational Science, which is designed to enable students who already hold a B.S. degree in a science, engineering, or another discipline to gain advanced knowledge and research experience that are needed for them to become successful computer/computational scientists and engineers; and 2) a second Bachelor of Science program (Information Science and Technology, or ISAT) which focuses on information processing, technology implementation and management, and systems security control. Both of these programs will start in fall 2019.</p> <p class="Default">While the CSCI program is still very young, many of our graduates, especially those S-STEM students who have been supported by this project, have recognized the value of their education and have created a donation-based scholarship program targeted at females, minorities, and other underrepresented students seeking degrees offered by the USCB Department of Computer Science. We expect more alumni-led endeavors such as this to help promote the CSCI and ISAT programs at USCB. &nbsp;Our goal is to enable more students to achieve present and future success as computer/computational/ISAT scientists and engineers, which in turn will help to ensure the future of our nation?s scientific leadership, economic competitiveness, and national security.</p> <p class="Default">&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;[1] Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics, <a href="https://www.siam.org/Students-Education/Resources/For-Graduate-Students/Detail/graduate-and-undergraduate-programs-in-computational-science">https://www.siam.org/Students-Education/Resources/For-Graduate-Students/Detail/graduate-and-undergraduate-programs-in-computational-science</a>.</p> <p>[2] National Science Foundation, <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/nsb/sei/edTool/data/college-10.html">https://www.nsf.gov/nsb/sei/edTool/data/college-10.html</a>.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 05/09/2019<br>      Modified by: Yiming&nbsp;Ji</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1259283/1259283_10249442_1557421208974_uscb-ms-csci-banner-homepage-with-uscb-logo--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1259283/1259283_10249442_1557421208974_uscb-ms-csci-banner-homepage-with-uscb-logo--rgov-800width.jpg" title="USCB CSCI Program"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1259283/1259283_10249442_1557421208974_uscb-ms-csci-banner-homepage-with-uscb-logo--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="USCB CSCI Program"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">The first Master of Science program at USCB, allowing students with diverse educational backgrounds to receive advanced training in computing!</div> <div class="imageCredit">University of South Carolina Beaufort</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyright owner is an institution with an existing agreement allowing use by NSF</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Yiming&nbsp;Ji</div> <div class="imageTitle">USCB CSCI Program</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1259283/1259283_10249442_1557420112238_Image1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1259283/1259283_10249442_1557420112238_Image1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Student Success"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1259283/1259283_10249442_1557420112238_Image1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Student Success"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">2019 CSCI Student of the Year Diana Arencibia (class of 2019) received a scholarship to attend the 2018 Richard Tapia Celebration of Diversity in Computing Conference in Orlando and will join Boeing in Charleston, SC as a software engineer starting in May 2019</div> <div class="imageCredit">University of South Carolina Beaufort</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Yiming&nbsp;Ji</div> <div class="imageTitle">Student Success</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1259283/1259283_10249442_1557420424796_Image2--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1259283/1259283_10249442_1557420424796_Image2--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Alumni Gift"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1259283/1259283_10249442_1557420424796_Image2--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Alumni Gift"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">USCB CSCI graduates, now working at a corporation in the financial sector, provided the first alumni gift to the CSCI program and later organized a new donation-based scholarship for females and other underrepresented students in Computational Science at USCB</div> <div class="imageCredit">University of South Carolina Beaufort</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyright owner is an institution with an existing agreement allowing use by NSF</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Yiming&nbsp;Ji</div> <div class="imageTitle">Alumni Gift</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
