<AbstractNarration>Real world data, such as World Wide Web, social networks, corporate knowledge networks, biological networks, semantic networks, etc., can be abstracted in the form of a massive and complex graph, with millions to billions of nodes and edges. With the explosion of such data, there is a pressing need for data mining, analysis, and querying tools to rapidly make sense of and extract knowledge. However, effectively leveraging the resources of modern architectures and mining such large graphs for interesting patterns  remains challenging. At the same time commodity desktop architectures that have processors with multiple cores and graphics processors (with hundreds of stream cores) are opening up significant opportunities for parallel graph analytics and management on the desktop.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This exploratory research seeks to scale up the performance of graph mining and clustering algorithms on modern desktop supercomputers to leverage the power of multi-core systems equipped with graphics processors, and to explore and develop new algorithms for reducing the search space and and the amount of data processed.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    Increasingly, todayÃ†s massive data is in the form of complex graphs or networks. Examples include the physical Internet, the world wide web, social networks, biological networks, semantic networks, and so on. One of the impediments to mining and understanding such networks is the challenge of scalability, having to deal with graphs with millions of nodes and edges. The recent architectural advances in commodity desktops, such as processors with multiple cores (CMPs) and graphics processors (GPUs) with hundred of stream cores, have ushered in the era of personal desktop supercomputers.  The main outcomes of this project include: 1) a deeper understanding on how to leverage GPUs for the hard task of mining graph patterns. Unlike traditional matrix or numeric methods, graph mining is combonatorial in nature and thus harder to implement on GPUs. 2) an effective algorithm for mining graph patterns on GPUs that has very good scalability.  We have successfully demonstrated that we can scale up the performance of graph mining algorithms to operate on large scale data while effectively utilizing the features of modern desktop supercomputers. Our GPU-based graph mining software is available as open-source, and thus can be utilized by researchers in other disciplines such as biology, social science, finance, and so on.
