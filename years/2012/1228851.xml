<AbstractNarration>This proposalwill fund an interdisciplinary team in Mechanical Engineering and Chemistry at Union College to develop an advanced modular engineering testbed. The Union Catalytic Testbed (UCaT), which will consist of a gas mixing system, a catalytic reactor and a gas sensing system, will provide this interdisciplinary group with the capability to undertake experiments in catalytic aerogel material (CAM) performance that are currently not possible, because there are no commercially available instruments or systems that have the required capabilities for the application and are economically feasible for an undergraduate institution. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The unique physical properties of aerogel materials, including high surface area, low density and good thermal stability, offer significant advantages for use as automotive catalysts. The Union College researchers have developed a novel rapid supercritical extraction (RSCE) process for fabricating aerogels, and have demonstrated convincingly that a variety of types of aerogels can be readily fabricated using the RSCE process, that powdered RSCE nickel-alumina aerogels show activity as three-way catalysts (TWCs), and that RSCE aerogels can be cast onto support structures used in current catalytic converter technology. Construction of UCaT will allow the group to significantly extend its research, providing the capability to test the catalytic ability of CAMs under realistic end-use conditions, in order to facilitate the development of CAMs and support parallel fundamental work.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Union Catalytic Aerogel Testbed (UCaT), developed via this MRI Instrument Development Grant, is a highly capable, low cost, benchtop scale system used to test and develop Catalytic Aerogel  Materials (CAMs) for applications in automotive pollution mitigation.  The UCaT can test small samples of CAMs under conditions that mimic those in an actual automotive exhaust system, while being both affordable and safe to operate in an undergraduate research environment.  CAMs have the potential to reduce or eliminate the need for platinum group metals in automotive exhaust treatment catalysts. Reducing or eliminating the use of rare precious metals in automotive pollution catalysis has the potential to transform automotive pollution mitigation. It has economic implications for the nation because a typical automobile catalytic converter contains about $100 of precious metals, adding about $700M/year to the total cost of cars sold in the US. Moreover, it has major environmental and geopolitical implications; mining of those metals is environmentally damaging, and many of the best sources are outside of the US.  By providing a rapid and cost effective way to test new CAM chemistries UCaT is supporting the pursuit of these important goals.  Additionally, since the development was carried out in an undergraduate research setting, the work to develop UCaT has provided an important additional benefit of better preparing undergraduate students from a variety of disciplines (Mechanical Engineering, Chemistry, Electrical and Computer Engineering, and Computer Science) to pursue advanced study and careers in STEM fields.  Twenty five percent of the undergraduate researchers involved in this work are women, twenty percent are from under-represented groups, and nearly half (47%) of those who have graduated after working on this project have chosen to pursue Ph.D. studies in STEM fields.
