<AbstractNarration>In this award, funded by the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms Program of the Division of Chemistry, Professor W. Carl Lineberger of the University of Colorado, together with his postdoctoral and graduate student researchers, will study the transient structures and reactive processes involving reaction intermediates and solvated anions. The experimental techniques include time-resolved photodissociation and photoelectron imaging spectroscopy and negative-ion photoelectron spectroscopy. Important classes of molecular systems that will be investigated include three-member cyclic carbon-nitrogen radicals important in combustion, the OO-OH radical important in determining the atmospheric concentration of OH near the tropopause, and a variety of ion-neutral complexes important in understanding proton transfer. A key component of all of the proposed experiments is the extensive participation of theoretical collaborators that brings state of the art theory, simulation, and experiment together.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While the systems to be investigated have been chosen for their fundamental science implications, they often have important medium-term applications, in fields ranging from atmospheric chemistry to combustion science to anionic polymerization.  This project will also be a vehicle for scientific workforce development by providing students and postdoctoral researchers with a solid foundation across many areas of chemistry. In addition, participants in this research program will make important contributions to the extension of the Colorado Science Education Initiative (SEI) to undergraduate physical chemistry classes at Colorado. Finally, both the research and educational activities described in this proposal provide an essential credibility for the principal investigator in his continuing activities that involve advocacy of research and education for the physical sciences.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[        A generic chemical reaction can be considered to be an encounter between two "reactant" molecules, A and B, that might result in forming two new "product" molecules, C and D, where in this process chemical bonds have been broken, new bonds have been formed, and the shapes and properties of the new product molecules may be very different from those of the reactants. As one "views" this chemical reaction process evolving, there may come a "point of no return" on this reaction pathway, where further progress must lead to the formation of the new product molecules. This transient, key configuration in the reaction is called the "transition state." Understanding the structure and properties of this transition state is key to understanding and possibly controlling the nature of products of chemical reactions. In a Colorado analogy, the transition state can be viewed as something akin to a mountain pass, with the reactants on one side of the pass, and the products on the other. Journeying via the pass is the easiest way to get from one side to the other, and when you are at the pass there exists the greatest range of outcome opportunities with a slight nudge in any of a number of directions.
