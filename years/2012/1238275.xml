<AbstractNarration>Program Director' Recommendation &lt;br/&gt;Planning Grant: I/UCRC for Novel High Voltage Transmission Materials &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1238139 University of Denver; Maciej Kumosa &lt;br/&gt;1238275 Michigan Technological University; Gregory Odegard &lt;br/&gt;1238331 University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign; Iwona Jasiuk &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed Center, comprised of the University of Denver (UD as the lead institution), Michigan Technological University (MTU) and the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC), will focus on improving the design of the next generation High Voltage transmission (HV/T) conductors. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The current designs of high voltage conductors based on steel (for strength) and aluminum (for conduction) strands used in regional grids exhibit several limitations. Primarily, they are limited by their propensity to sag at elevated temperatures. Through extensive collaborations amongst the sites of the proposed Center and with several leading US industries and national laboratories, entirely new classes of HV/T materials systems and structures will be designed for a variety of high energy applications. The interdisciplinary fundamental and applied research performed in the Center will make a major impact on the understanding of the combined effects of mechanical, electrical and environmental high energy fields on traditional metallic materials, novel polymer, metallic and ceramic matrix composites, highly advanced next generation nanocomposites, coatings, and others. The PIs intend to explore new manufacturing technologies in order to improve the aging resistance of traditional low cost materials for HV/T long term applications. Finally,new monitoring, self-repair and self-healing techniques for HV/T structures will be designed as a result of the proposed research activities of the Center. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research will increase the fundamental knowledge of the effects of HV/T fields on the materials leading to major advances in (1) HV transmission engineering, (2) high energy generation and distribution systems, and (3) many other fields of engineering requiring the application of HV/T material systems. It will also create a diverse and interdisciplinary educational, research and business environment for (1) numerous undergraduate and graduate students, including those from underrepresented groups, funded by the research projects of the Center, (2) faculty members from a variety of disciplines, including junior faculty starting their academic careers, (3) utility, aerospace and national lab engineers and designers developing various types of HV/T materials and structures, (4) utility managers supervising HV transmission lines across the country, and many others. The Center will enhance the reputation of the American HV/T manufacturing around the world and, in particular, will improve the level of confidence among the potential users of novel HV/T structures in this country and around the world.</AbstractNarration>
