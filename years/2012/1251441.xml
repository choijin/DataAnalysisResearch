<AbstractNarration>As the Earth's climate warms over the next century, ecosystems throughout the northern hemisphere will be exposed to elevated rates of atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition.  Understanding this complex environmental change lies at the heart of our ability to anticipate the degree to which forests will sequester human-produced carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.  An interdisciplinary team of scientists will investigate the interaction between climate warming and simulated atmospheric N deposition using a long-term, regional-based, field experiment located in a sugar maple-dominated forest ecosystem common over eastern North America.  During the past 18 years, simulated atmospheric nitrogen deposition at rates expected to occur by 2050 have increased tree growth and slowed the decay of dead leaves and roots, increasing the amount of carbon stored in this wide-spread ecosystem.  However, it is uncertain whether carbon storage will attain a higher equilibrium over the long-term as atmospheric nitrogen deposition increases or whether expected warming will counteract this effect.  The proposed research will quantify the amounts of carbon stored in overstory trees, forest floor and soil over the next decade, allowing this team of scientists to test hypotheses regarding the interaction of climate warming and atmospheric nitrogen deposition on ecosystem carbon sequestration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using NSF support, this team will continue conducting the annual Global Change Teachers Institute.  Through lectures and field-based learning, middle and high school teachers will continue to develop an understanding of the causes and ecological impacts of global environmental change, thereby bringing this information into science curricula.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Anthropogenic production of reactive nitrogen has rapidly increased over the last century, with a large portion of it being added to terrestrial ecosystems via atmospheric nitrogen deposition.  This collaborative LTREB project was designed to advance our understanding of how elevated nitrogen deposition affects forest ecosystem carbon storage.  As a part of the work supported by this NSF award, our lab at the University of Idaho investigated the effects of long-term experimental nitrogen deposition on the decomposition of plant debris (leaf litter and fine roots) and aimed to develop a mechanistic understanding of these effects.  We found that experimental nitrogen deposition stimulated early-stage decomposition of leaf litter, while it slowed fine root decomposition.  This slower decomposition of fine roots was estimated to explain 5-51% of the previously documented soil carbon accumulation under experimental nitrogen deposition.  Although previous nitrogen deposition studies have focused on leaf litter, our work suggests that slower fine root decomposition is a major driver of soil organic carbon accumulation under elevated nitrogen deposition.  Our chemical analysis reveals that this slower fine root decomposition can be largely explained by the suppression of degradation of lignin, a chemical class that is highly abundant in fine roots.  Our chemical data suggest that decomposition of chemical classes subject to oxidative degradation, such as lignin and condensed tannins, is generally inhibited by nitrogen enrichment of soil, but whether this inhibition eventually slows mass loss and leads to organic matter accumulation depends on the initial quantities of these chemical classes in litter materials.  Most earth system models do not include nitrogen interactions with soil carbon storage, with a few using nitrogen limitations on decomposition alone to represent nitrogen-carbon coupling.  Our work and other studies from this collaborative LTREB project demonstrated the need for a more comprehensive nitrogen-carbon interaction framework that takes into account the potential suppression of litter decomposition and the accumulation of soil organic carbon in the scenario of continuously increasing atmospheric nitrogen deposition.  For the purpose of disseminating the findings of this project, our lab has been maintaining a project website (http://webpages.uidaho.edu/nitrogen-gradient/) dedicated to sharing our long-term data and publications with members of the scientific community as well as the general public.
