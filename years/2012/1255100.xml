<AbstractNarration>Professor Peter H. Dinolfo from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute is supported by a CAREER award from the Chemical Structure, Dynamics, and Mechanisms B program in the NSF Chemistry Division to study the photo- and electro-chemical properties of molecular donor-acceptor systems at electrode interfaces. The design of multilayer materials for specific electronic, photonic, or electro-optical applications requires an accurate knowledge of the structural-functional relationships of the films and their respective building blocks. Using a new layer-by-layer assembly technique developed in the PI's laboratory, multilayer films comprised of spectrally-tuned organic and inorganic chromophores will be assembled in donor-acceptor configurations on electrode surfaces. Spectroscopic and electrochemical methods will be applied to the modified substrates to elucidate the mechanisms and efficiency of energy and electron transfer processes between chromophore layers. This information will then be correlated with structural data on the multilayer thin films to determine the optimal conditions for creating efficient molecular-based light harvesting arrays for use in p-type dye-sensitized semiconductor solar cells.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Developing adaptable methods to chemically modify electrode and semiconductor surfaces with hierarchical molecular structures and understanding the photophysical processes occurring amongst the molecular constituents is of central importance to the field of artificial photosynthesis. This research will help formulate the design principles necessary to improve the efficiency of next generation molecular based solar cells and artificial photosynthetic devices. The project will also provide training for a diverse group of undergraduate and graduate students in the interdisciplinary field of materials chemistry. Additionally, in an effort to stimulate and encourage young students to consider a career in one of the STEM fields, the PI will organize and run a week-long workshop for local high school students. These students will participate in several hands-on activities in the PI's laboratory at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute that are designed to highlight some of the basic chemical aspects of solar energy conversion and artificial photosynthesis.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The primary challenges to widespread utilization of renewable solar energy are the need for improvement in conversion efficiencies along with the reduction of device cost. Towards this goal, my research group at Rensselaer is developing bio-inspired, nanoscale molecular devices that will allow for the efficient conversion of sunlight into electricity and stored solar energy in the form of chemical fuels. We are using a biomimetic approach in an attempt to replicate the photosynthetic processes found in nature.</p> <p>The main objectives of this CAREER award from the Chemical Structure, Dynamics, and Mechanisms program in the Chemistry division is to study the photo- and electro-chemical properties of molecular donor-acceptor systems at electrode interfaces. Towards this goal, we have developed an efficient and controlled technique to link molecular dyes together in a layered fashion on electrode surfaces. The efficient and inexpensive nature of this surface modification technique makes it amenable to scale-up for future commercialization of solar cells based off of these materials. The design of these multilayer materials for efficient solar light harvesting requires an accurate knowledge of how the molecular structure effects the photo&#8210;physical properties of the films and their respective building blocks. Using this methodology, we have assembled molecular pigments into well-defined multilayer structures on electrode surfaces that mimic the light harvesting complexes found in Nature. We have shown that energy transfer between chromophore layers can be highly efficient, however it is dependent on the molecular groups linking them together. Additionally, we have found that the molecular layers have the ability to control the direction of charge transfer through the film. Selecting molecular chromophores with specific redox levels, we can promote current flow in the desired direction, while inhibiting charge transfer in the opposite direction which would limit energy conversion efficiency. Finally, we have examined how the photocurrent from solar cells fabricated with these multilayer light harvesting is improved through the choice of molecular chromophores and structure of the films.</p> <p>This award has provided support for eight PhD and two MS students at some point during their graduate career. In addition, this research project has involved approximately thirty-two undergraduate Chemistry, Chemical Engineering, Bioinformatics and Molecular Biology, and Electrical Engineering students. In an effort to stimulate and encourage young students to consider a career in one of the STEM fields, we have developed a week-long workshop for local high school students. The invited students participated in several hands-on activities in our research laboratory at Rensselaer that are designed to highlight some of the basic chemical aspects of solar energy conversion and artificial photosynthesis. The workshop has been held every summer since 2012 and has included over sixty junior and senior high school students from Queensbury, NY.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 06/28/2019<br>      Modified by: Peter&nbsp;H&nbsp;Dinolfo</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1255100/1255100_10237432_1561744554486_am-2015-00519n_0005--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1255100/1255100_10237432_1561744554486_am-2015-00519n_0005--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Emission Profiles of BODIPY-Porphyrin Multilayers"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1255100/1255100_10237432_1561744554486_am-2015-00519n_0005--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Emission Profiles of BODIPY-Porphyrin Multilayers"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Emission spectra of six mixed bilayers of ZnTPEP and 9:1 N3BODIPY:N3Mest on quartz excited at the N3BODIPY absorance peak at 530 nm (green solid line).
