<AbstractNarration>1263987/1263785&lt;br/&gt;Li/Masmanidis&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:&lt;br/&gt;This proposal will advance both engineering, through innovative use of nanofabrication techniques and device assembly schemes, and neuroscience, through newly enabled lines of research in which very small groups of cells (~1 to 10) can be optogenetically manipulated and electrically recorded. In the proof-of-concept study proposed here, the probes will be incorporated into the co-PI?s behavioral experiments on the neural mechanisms of reinforcement learning in the nucleus accumbens, an important brain area in the reward processing pathway. Optogenetically tagged neurons will be activated or silenced and recorded with the optoelectrodes during an associative reward learning task, allowing their activity to be perturbed at specific epochs of learning. These experiments will help both demonstrate the operation of the probes, and provide new insight into how information about appetitive stimuli is dynamically encoded in this brain area.  The development of neural probes with unsurpassed photonic and electronic capabilities will have broad impact on how optogenetics and electrophysiology are incorporated into neuroscience experiments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts: &lt;br/&gt;The development of neural probes with unsurpassed photonic and electronic capabilities will have broad impact on how optogenetics and electrophysiology are incorporated into neuroscience experiments. If the development strategy proposed here is successful, the PIs will seek additional funding opportunities to mass-produce these tools at commercial device foundries. This collaborative project will provide a highly interdisciplinary environment for training of graduate students and a postdoctoral scholar. Additionally, the two PIs will use existing university programs to involve high school and undergraduate students in the research effort.The investigators also plan curriculum enhancement as a direc result of this work, and have a planned program of k-12 outreach there are numerous additional educational components, including collaboration between different institutions,a plan for device dissemination in the neuroscience community, K-12 education and outreach and inclusion of high school students in summer lab projects,undergraduate training and research opportunities, graduate training, curriculum development, and interdisciplinary exchange.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The convergence of optogenetic and large-scale neural recording technologies opens enormous opportunities for studying brain function.  However, compared to the widespread use of optogenetics or recordings as standalone methods, the joint use of these techniques in behaving animals is much less well developed.  A simple but poorly scalable solution has been to implant conventional optical fibers together with extracellular microelectrodes.  This project has been aiming to develop a more promising approach that combines microfabricated light emission sources with multielectrode arrays.  The intellectual merit of the research lies in that the team overcame the challenge in how to compactly and scalably integrate optical output and electronic readout structures on the same device.  We took a step toward addressing this issue by using nanofabrication techniques to develop a novel implantable optoelectronic probe. We have developed a multifunctional neuro-probe that contains multiple grating couplers for out-of-plane light emission, monolithically integrated with a microlectrode array on the same silicon substrate. Through the collaborative efforts between University of Minnesota and UCLA, we have demonstrated the device?s operation in vivo by recording cortical activity from awake head-restrained mice.  We have characterized photo-stimulation effects on electrophysiological signals.  We assessed the probe?s ability to both optogenetically stimulate and electrically record neural firing.  This is the first device to rely on nanofabrication techniques to integrate optical stimulation and electrical readout functions on the same structure.  Due to the device miniaturization capabilities inherent to nanofabrication, this optoelectronic probe technology can be further scaled to increase the throughput of manipulating and recording neural dynamics.  The broad impact of the project is that it has demonstrated the feasibility of nanofabricated opto-electronic probe that can realize optogenetic stimulation together with electrical recording and developed the fabrication and integration approaches of such a probe for large-scale usage. The research can impact the neuroscience research community with a new tool of simultaneous neuromodulation and recording. During the project, multiple graduate students have received comprehensive training in nanofabrication and optical characterization skills.
