<AbstractNarration>The University of Massachusetts Amherst is requesting financial support for twelve students from African American, Hispanic, and/or Native American populations who are pursuing doctoral degrees in various science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields at the University of Connecticut (lead institution). The University of Connecticut was selected by the Northeast Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (NELSAMP) to propose a comprehensive highly integrated suite of Bridge to the Doctorate (BD) activities. The principal investigators are proposing the following activities: the development of a Husky STEM Bridge to the Doctorate website,  cohort meetings among BD fellows, professional development in teaching sessions, K-12 mentoring/outreach opportunities, and career preparation.  During the two year project, the principal investigators will administer surveys, which will be conducted to determine the success of the individual and overall strategies of the project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed suite of activities offers several innovative features, including advanced training in professional development, ethics, technology commercialization, teaching pedagogy, and mentorship; and the development of a Web-based tool highlighting possible faculty/project proposals, which prospective BD Fellows may preview before applying to the University of Connecticut. Furthermore, the faculty advisors to be recruited for the BD activities must agree to not only advise the BD Fellows but also to serve as engaged, hands-on mentors; participate in assessment surveys and meetings associated with the BD Activity; provide financial support beyond the two-year BD funding period; and foster their BD Fellow's participation in skills-building workshops and training courses to further polish their academic skills. The BD Activity at the University of Connecticut will demonstrate that a proactive, intensive, results-oriented campaign to recruit, prepare, mentor, train and support doctoral candidates from traditionally underrepresented populations in the STEM areas affords one avenue for resolving social, economic and technological challenges.</AbstractNarration>

One Advisor commented, "My BD fellow expects me to meet with [them], so I do. The same does not apply to my other students. They meet at my request, not vice-versa.

Three Fellows specially mentioned recruiting a family member to UConn, two actively recruited a friend, and another two mentioned easing their friends concerns about UConn as an academic institution.       Concluding Remarks        The BD Activity at UConn has successfully supported 14 minority graduate students from August 2012 to August 2015. Three BD Fellows have completed their MasterÆs degree, completely funded by the BD program. One Fellow ended up leaving the university with their Advisor. And the remaining 10 Fellows are still working on completing their degrees, with one working towards a MasterÆs degree and the other nine towards a PhD. BD Fellows all participated in developing focused plans of study with their academic Advisors, in addition to taking part in a professional development course that touched on a range of topics (including ethics, teaching, communication, innovation and creativity). Fellows were also active in performing K-12 outreach and mentoring. Accor...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
