<AbstractNarration>This project provides a critical environmental upgrade for a living collection of plants used to support scientific research. The upgrade consists of a shade system for temperature control, a modern irrigation system, and a -80 degree C freezer to store living material. Steady growth in users and living collections make this project urgent and it will provide improvements to the efficiency, quality, health, and diversity of the living collection. Living collections of palms and cycads at MBC are a vital research resource used by a growing number of researchers and have contributed to at least 26 NSF-funded projects. The upgrades proposed here will permit successful establishment of wild-origin stocks, improve collection survival, and allow for greatly improved success in stock propagation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Montgomery is located in South Florida in an area rich with research and educational institutions, such as botanic gardens, universities and government agencies. Montgomery closely collaborates with researchers from these institutions, especially with the universities and colleges in Miami-Dade County, which serve many underrepresented minorities. Upgrading Montgomery's living collections propagation equipment will enhance and promote educational opportunities for these university students, as well as for volunteers, the &lt;br/&gt;public, and students in elementary and secondary schools.</AbstractNarration>

The upgrades help with successful establishment of wild collected stocks, improve collection germination and survival, and allow for greatly improved success in stock propagation.
