<AbstractNarration>Advances in the study of cosmic reionization affect many fields, from the thermal evolution of the Lyman-alpha forest to the properties of galaxies over a large range of redshifts.  Because the observational constraints are limited, theoretical modeling and numerical simulation play a relatively larger part in reionization studies than in other areas.  Computational performance at the peta scale is well matched to the needs of a realistic reionization simulation, so that substantial progress can be expected in the next several years.  The present research will culminate in simulations that combine large computational volumes with fully self-consistent physical modeling, providing important insights into reionization itself and into the evolution of galaxies and Lyman-alpha emitters.  The simulation results will be compared with existing approximate numerical and analytical schemes, to test the physical fidelity of customarily adopted approximations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is an excellent vehicle for the professional training of a graduate student, and the results will be useful to a large community of scientists, from pure theorists to observers to experimentalists.  The work will also impact undergraduate education and the general public.  Visualization of such cosmological research stimulates curiosity and that sense of discovery afforded only by the exploration of the universe.  These next-generation simulations will bring a qualitative improvement to three-dimensional visualizations previously developed by this group and used at the Adler Planetarium.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Study of cosmic reionization - the process of ionization of the bulk of cosmic gas by  ultraviolet radiation from galaxies and quasars - has been highlighted by the last decadal survey as one of the most promising areas of astrophysical research in the current decade. Advance in this area significantly affects many other fields of astrophysics, from studies of intergalactic medium and galaxy formation to cosmology.  Because the observational constraints on reionization are limited, theoretical modeling, including numerical simulations, plays a relatively larger part in reionization studies than in many other fields of modern astrophysics. And while the first simulations of reionization were attempted nearly 20 years ago, the major breakthrough in this field is only possible with modern ``peta-scale'' supercomputing platforms.  Taking advantage of this technological progress, we are working on a Cosmic Reionization On Computers (CROC) project that aims, over the course of several years, to produce numerical simulations of reionization that model fully self-consistently all relevant physics, from radiative transfer to gas dynamics and star formation, in cosmologically sufficient simulation volumes with unprecendented spatial and mass resolution.  This grant played a critical part in supporting the inital stage and a significant portion of data analysis for the CROC project. Results of this work have been published in 13 research papers and presented at 8 scientific conferences.  Major scientific findings included the final resolution of the quintessential question of whether reionization proceeds inside-our or outside-in, important predictions for the future observations by the James Webb Space Telescope (a primary NASA mission, to be launched in Oct 2018), physical explanation why reionization excerts no back reacion onto high redshift galaxies (i.e., disproving of the so-called Barkana-Loeb effect), discovery of important corrections to the expected redshifted 21cm signal to be detected with the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array (HERA) radio telescope, and many others.
