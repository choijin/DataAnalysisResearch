<AbstractNarration>1243102&lt;br/&gt;Dan Cooley, Colorado State University&lt;br/&gt;1243333&lt;br/&gt;J. Keith Gilless, University of California-Berkeley&lt;br/&gt;1242957&lt;br/&gt;Richard Smith, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     One of the most important questions in climate science is how extreme weather changes as a result of natural and anthropogenic forcings.  At this project's core is a goal to address three areas that are critical to understanding extreme events, but whose methods are not yet developed enough to answer impact-relevant questions.  First, the investigators advance and develop multivariate statistical methods that can describe and model extreme events that arise from a combination of meteorological factors that may or may not individually be extreme.  Second, the investigators advance spatial downscaling methods to be applicable to studying extreme phenomena that occur at spatial scales not resolved by climate models.  Third, the investigators put the study of detection of changes in extremes and attribution of extreme events on a solid statistical foundation, and apply the spatial and multivariate techniques to this area.  The participants collaborate with social scientists in incorporating the improved methodology into models that analyze the impact of extreme weather events on agricultural production and the forestry sector for specific regions of the US.  They also develop risk assessment measures that take into account possible increases in the frequency of extreme weather events. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Extreme weather can have profound consequences for the well-being of individuals, societies, and natural systems.  This project studies several aspects of weather extremes and how the nature of extreme events is likely to change under an altered climate.  The project develops probability-based measures of risk that take account of the fact that impacts of extreme weather events cannot be predicted with certainty.  Another feature of the project is that high-impact events often arise from a combination of extreme weather conditions.  For example, wildfires may arise from a combination of heat, wind, and lack of moisture; we therefore need methods of analysis that take into account multiple meteorological variables.  Most of the methods being developed rely on large computer programs known as climate models to project future climatic events.  However, climate models often work on time and space scales that are much larger than the high-impact events we are interested in; therefore, data from climate models must be translated to the scales of interest.  The specific focus on extreme events is different from most current research using climate models for the detection and attribution of climate change.  Detecting changes in extreme behavior is essential for risk assessment, as risk-related quantities such as the 100-year flood, fire, burning, and heat indexes are estimated based on data that may no longer be relevant if extreme behavior has changed.  The determination of the impact of such changes at a broad range of socio-economic levels is needed to determine appropriate societal responses to extreme weather events associated with climate change.  In addition to university-based investigators, the project includes Michael Wehner and collaborators at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. who are an intrinsic part of the team.  University-based investigators are funded by NSF while the Department of Energy supports LBNL investigators.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Richard Smith is a professor of statistics and biostatistics whose research includes the application of statistical methods to a number of areas of environmental science, including climate change. Although there is general agreement among climate scientists that global warming is real and humans are primarily responsible for it, the methods that are used to support such statements are still evolving, particularly when considering extreme events. A striking recent example of this was Hurricane Harvey, whose extremely heavy rainfall, which persisted for three days, devastated the Houston area in 2017. Previous papers have argued that the probability of such an extreme event was increased as a result of high sea surface temperatures (SSTs) in the Gulf of Mexico, and that such events are likely to become more frequent as SSTs continue to rise in the future. In one of the papers partly supported by the present grant, Russell et al. (2020) developed a spatial model to show how the probability of extreme rainfall increases with Gulf of Mexico SSTs across the whole region bordering the Gulf, but especially concentrated in the Houston area. Other work supported by the grant addressed the problem of detection and attribution, which is a statistical technique for quantifying the human contribution to global warming. Katzfuss et al. (2017) developed a new Bayesian statistics technique for this problem, and Huang et al. (2020) have also used Bayesian ideas to develop future projections for climate change combining multiple climate models and observations. The intellectual merit of this work lies in the development of new statistical methods that potentially improve on techniques currently used by climate scientists, especially in the area of uncertainty quantification. The broader impacts have included mentoring a number of postdocs while Professor Smith served as Director of the Statistical and Applied Mathematical Sciences Institute (SAMSI); organizing a SAMSI program on mathematical and statistical methods for climate science (2017/18); numerous interactions with climate scientists at the Lawrence Berkeley National Lab, the North Carolina Institute for Climate Studies, and elsewhere; and contributions to the general public's understanding of climate change and especially its implications for extreme events. In addition to the publications from the grant, Professor Smith has interacted widely with statisticians, climate scientists and the general public, including a talk at the American Association for the Advancement of Science annual meeting in 2019, and several talks at the annual Joint Statistical Meetings.
