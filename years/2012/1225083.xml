<AbstractNarration>Objective: &lt;br/&gt;The objective of the 11th International Conference on Infrared Optoelectronics: Materials and Devices is to provide a unique forum for device physicists, and material scientists to assess the main issues in infrared optoelectronics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit: &lt;br/&gt;The Conference will be held on the campus of Northwestern University in Evanston, IL is during September 4-8, 2012. Leading research professionals in industry, academia, and government are scheduled to attend. The intent is to arrive at a far-reaching overview of infrared optoelectronics. One of the major goals of the Conference is to assess the current status and define future research directions in infrared optoelectronics. This will be achieved through presentations and open discussions of the key technical issues. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impact: &lt;br/&gt;It is expected that this Conference will have a significant impact in defining future research in infrared optoelectronics. This Conference will also contribute to the training of participating graduate students and junior faculty through open discussion of the presented topics. A Conference Technical Digest will be disseminated to participants.</AbstractNarration>

As part of this conference a comprehensive website was developed (http://miomd-11.northwestern.edu/ ).  136 publically accessible two-page abstracts were collected and are currently hosted via a searchable list of speakers on our webpage.  A 296 page hard-cover abstract booklet was also assembled and published&mdash;copies were given to all participants, and an electronic copy is available at our website for download.  We are also in the final stages of working with SPIE to publish and extended technical manuscript with full chapters based on some of the key talks given at this conference.  This book will be available for sale through SPIE.       Last Modified: 04/03/2013       Submitted by: Manijeh Razeghi]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
