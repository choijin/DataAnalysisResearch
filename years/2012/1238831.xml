<AbstractNarration>The American Physiological Society (APS) will address critical needs for increased diversity among physiologists conducting integrative organismal systems (IOS) biology research by building an annual cohort of underrepresented (UR) undergraduate students engaged in IOS research working with members of APS' Comparative and Evolutionary Physiology Section (CEPS).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;APS will build on the strengths of its existing programs to create long-term solutions to specific needs for increasing diversity in the IOS field.  The APS IOSP Fellows will conduct research during the summer, present at APS conferences, gain skills through online professional development activities, and become proponents for IOS research via APS' social media outlets and Physiology Understanding Week.  APS expects IOSP Fellows to become active participants in the IOS professional community and will evaluate both short- and long-term impacts of the Fellowship.  The project will increase the number of UR students participating in IOS-related research; develop a professional network of support among UR students and researchers; and increase understanding of, and interest in IOS careers among the target group of students.&lt;br/&gt;APS will also create a resource collection on supporting students with disabilities in the research lab. The collection will be freely available via APS' NSDL digital library, the Archive of Teaching Resources (www.apsarchive.org).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With diversity as a national imperative in STEM fields, this project will create and evaluate resources to improve research hosts' skills in working with UR students from broad backgrounds and with diverse needs and resources for engaging UR undergraduates in research experiences, in professional socialization activities, and as advocates for science to the general public.  This will provide a model for other scientific societies in identifying and addressing specific needs in their ongoing diversity efforts, which will be shared with the community at the PI meeting.</AbstractNarration>

It also aimed to create and evaluate ways to improve research hosts? skills in working with students from broad backgrounds and with diverse needs. Finally, it was to provide a model for other scientific societies in identifying and addressing specific needs in their ongoing diversity efforts. Toward this end, APS recruited students nationwide from disadvantaged backgrounds, individuals from underrepresented racial and ethnic minority groups, and individuals with disabilities to work with researchers in IOS (comparative physiology) mission areas (Fellows (n=36 from 2013-2017) not only completed a summer research experience and professional development activities on their campus, but also interactive, online activities with fellows nationwide, exploring career options, responsible conduct of research, structuring research studies, and developing and presenting research posters.

As a professional society, APS also helped fellows understand how professional societies can help to support and develop their skills and careers, provide a professional network of colleagues for collaboration and mentoring, and serve as an advocate for them as both student and researcher. Some of our main findings include: * For many Fellows, this was their very first research experience. For the majority of the Fellows, it was a positive experience and they gained a variety of skills and knowledge. * Fellows increased their knowledge and understanding of the many hard and soft skills required for a successful research career. Those include:  developing critical research skills, developing and revising a working hypothesis, conducting experiments, analyzing and reporting on their data; writing research summaries in abstract form, completing RCR training, recognizing and responding appropriately to common ethical issues in research and publication; and preparing a scientific poster, presenting data and results orally at the APS annual meeting at Experimental Biology, which was a very important component of the fellowship experience.  * Fellows learned to network effectively with other Fellows as well as program advisory board and committee members (APS members). This enabled Fellows to develop a professional network of support and encouragement among their peers and experienced researchers. * Through career exploration activities, Fellows explored physiology and basic science research education and career options, which strengthened their interest in basic science careers. Overall, the APS IOSP Summer Research Fellowship program accomplished its goals and objectives. The majority of IOSP fellows have gone on to pursue education and careers in scientific or medical fields, thus expanding the potential for a more diverse scientific research workforce.
