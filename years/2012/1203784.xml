<AbstractNarration>The objectives of the proposed research are to quantify the connection between seasonal warming of arctic surface waters and the absorption of solar energy, and additionally to identify the presence and seasonal cycling of materials responsible for this absorption.  Seasonal changes in the attenuation of solar radiation within the sea ice and upper 30m of the water column will be measured at high temporal resolution (hourly) by a new proof of concept buoy system. Temperature and PAR (photosynthetically active radiation) irradiance measurements will be made using optical sensors paired with thermisters within the water column and sea ice. A fluorometer will be used to quantify chlorophyll, colored dissolved organic material (CDOM) and light backscattering within surface waters. These sensors will be used to calculate diffuse attenuation coefficients (Kd) within the ice and water column, and to determine the seasonal cycling of phytoplankton and CDOM under the ice. The relationship between these optical and temperature observations will enable one to constrain the daily water column absorption component of the Arctic heating budget. The ultimate goal of this concept would see a network of these buoys throughout the Arctic, in both ice-covered and open waters. The work plan includes several deployments in multiyear ice, including the Beaufort gyre and the Geomission ice base in early spring. Data at this site will be augmented by additional measurements made whilst at the camp, along with complementary studies by other Geomission projects. Results will be disseminated through collaboration with Science Alliance Live, at Polar Science Weekend, and in curricula at the University of Washington.  Buoy data will also be visualized in near real time on the project website. All data will be submitted within 1 year to CADIS.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The Arctic ice pack has suffered continued thinning and reduction in seasonal extent, resulting in changes to the amount of sunlight penetrating through the ice and into the ocean beneath. These changes are expected to have consequences for the physical and biological environment beneath the ice cover. The amount of sunlight absorbed into the Arctic Ocean determines the magnitude of heating, which in turn directly impacts the rate of sea ice melt. This project proposed to quantify the links between seasonal warming of Arctic surface waters and the absorption of solar energy. To conduct this research, we developed a new proof of concept ice-tethered buoy system that measures temperature and sunlight in the upper 50 m of the Arctic Ocean. The buoy was designed to be robust enough to survive melting out of the ice pack in the summer and refreezing back in to the ice in the fall (<strong>Figure 1</strong>).&nbsp;</p> <p>Four of these so-called &ldquo;WARM&rdquo; (Warming And iRradiance Measurement) systems have been deployed (<strong>Figure 2</strong>). Each was deployed in spring on first-year ice (ice that formed the previous winter). To install a buoy, a hole is drilled through the ice floe and the instrument string is lowered through the hole. The attached surface float was then anchored to the surface of the ice. The ice hole refroze within 24 hours, so that the uppermost sensors were within ice.
