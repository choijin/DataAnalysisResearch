<AbstractNarration>The objective of this project is to help developers in making applications? usage of personal information transparent to mobile phone users, system integrators, and other evaluators. Recent well-publicized mobile privacy incidents have demonstrated all these parties have lost count of what information mobile devices collect, store, and transmit. A successful project would lead to improved privacy and application transparency, and would help prevent future privacy compromises. Project results could be adopted into mobile operating systems and could guide FTC policy on mobile privacy. The project includes close collaboration with industry stakeholders to facilitate dissemination of new ideas. Work will be conducted with graduate and undergraduate students, which will not only provide them with training in research methodology, but also expose them to important ethical questions surrounding privacy issues in mobile applications.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This project will aid developers and nudge them to follow privacy principles by making their usage of personal information transparent. Towards this end, this project will develop guidelines for privacy-aware system APIs that encourage developers to employ privacy-by-design techniques. For example, system APIs designed from a privacy perspective will make it easier to obtain more general information, rather than potentially more sensitive, fine-grained personal information. Through case studies with developers and users, this project is expected to lead to novel insights into the effectiveness of these techniques.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The project highlighted the challenges in designing and implementing effective sensor access disclosures for mobile platforms and smartphones. In particular, the research published in the project, clearly indicated that location access disclosures available at the time on popular smartphone platforms were ineffective. This has considerable implications to smartphone usersÆ privacy and on the lack of informed consent on how apps access usersÆ data.   The project consisted of several major research activities and includes the following intellectual merit among others.  The project designed, implemented and studied how frequently users' location information is accessed by applications during people's everyday lives and how making people aware of this could change their behavior. Towards this end, the project developed a software-based heuristic for 1) building effective disclosures without changing the smartphone platform and for 2) studying behavior changes during people's daily lives. With a four-week deployment, the project showed that because of new effective location access disclosures, participants would, for example, uninstall apps they found accessing their location.  The project designed and studied novel privacy-preserving application programming interfaces (APIs) with the purpose to nudge developers to make better decisions about end-user privacy.  The results of the novel privacy-preserving API design indicate that when presented the option of privacy-preserving APIs with the legacy Android location APIs, both non-Android developers with Java experience and Android developers alike could produce more privacy-preserving code than with the current APIs available.  The project conducted an online study to investigate how people understand location descriptions related to their apps. Some smartphone platforms indicate that apps can have access to "approximate" or "precise" location of the smartphone. The results of the project suggest that most participants considered the "precise" location to mean their exact location and the "approximate" location as a potentially large general area. This mental model of the "approximate" location seems to alley people's privacy concerns related to their apps. However, when shown the ground truth how accurate "approximate" location actually is, twice as many participants did not think "approximate" location offered enough protection, compared to before showing the ground truth. The results of the project indicate that the descriptions of location app permissions might mislead smartphone users about the privacy protections the app is providing.  The project also featured several broader impacts, including the following.  Over 200 hundred media outlets including several well-known and prestigious publications in the United States and around the world featured the project research.  Given the media coverage, the project has likely made an impact on 1) how people manage their privacy on their mobile phones, 2) understanding how current mobile phone security and privacy mechanism are inadequate, and 3) how developers can be encouraged to preserve user privacy.   The project has made publicly available the source code for the major software prototypes and study applications generated in the project.  Finally, the project trained several undergraduate and graduate students in the areas of security and privacy engineering, mobile computing and human-computer interaction. The participated students included students underrepresented in STEM disciplines. The project also presented its results to a NJ high school STEM symposium, attended by around 200 high school students, for the purpose of encouraging opportunities for research and careers in STEM disciplines.
