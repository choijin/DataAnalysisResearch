<AbstractNarration>This fifth annual "2013 Graduate Student mini-Conference in Computational Mathematics" will be held at Clemson University on February 8 and 9, 2013. Topics covered in the conference consist of recent advances in the theory and implementation of numerical methods for partial differential equations, including multiphase flow in porous media, numerical methods for stochastic PDEs, turbulence fluid dynamics, climate simulation and PDE constrained optimization. Aside from one plenary speaker, all talks will be given by graduate students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Approximately twenty graduate students from Clemson, Virginia Tech, the University of Pittsburgh, Auburn University, the University of Tennessee, Florida State University and Emory University will present scientific research talks involving mathematical modeling in science and engineering, and rigorous analysis and efficient implementation of numerical methods for the modeling equations. The goals of the conference are to give graduate students an opportunity to give a professional scientific talk, and to bring graduate students and researchers together to discuss collaborative research projects and to exchange new ideas in many challenging research areas.  The conference organizers strongly encourage participation of under-represented groups.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ A conference was held at Clemson University on February 8-9, 2013, entitled " 5th Annual Graduate Student Mini-conference in Computational  Mathematics".  The participants of the conference were faculty, postdocs, and graduate students from Clemson, Florida State, Virginia Tech, Emory, Pitt, Michigan Tech, South Carolina, Oak Ridge National Lab, and Auburn, and the purpose of the conference was to  1) give graduate students studying computational mathemtics experience giving professional research talks;  2) foster collaboration and sharing of ideas between research groups with overlapping interests in computational mathematics.  The conference consisted of 1 plenary speaker on Friday February 8th  (Prof. Max Gunzburger, Francis Eppes Distinguished Professor of Mathematics at  Florida State University), and 22 shorter talks given on Saturday  February 9th.  Of these 23 speaker, 20 were graduate students, 1 was a postdoc, and 2 were professors.  The Saturday talk by Prof. A.J. Meir gave the audience an interesting perspective on the state of the educating of mathematics majors in universities, and how it can be improved.  For the graduate student talks, each student gave a 15 minute research presentation, including questions, and the faculty made sure each student was asked at least 2 questions.  Hence each of the 20 students got practice giving a professional talk.  The conference website can be found at  http://people.clemson.edu/~siam/conferences/miniconference_2013/about.html  and here the schedule can be found, as well as pictures of the students during their talks.
