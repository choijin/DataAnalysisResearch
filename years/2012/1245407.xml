<AbstractNarration>There is no precedent for math instruction using "wet" labs to engage students in mathematics through data-driven inquiry experiences. In this project, we construct Laboratory Experiences in Mathematical Biology (LEMBs) for undergraduate math classrooms. LEMBs are developed collaboratively at Utah State University (USU)and Colorado College, aimed at sophomore classrooms including both STEM and non-STEM majors. Students manipulate and interact with real-world biological mechanisms, construct their own mathematical descriptions and gain deeper understanding of underlying mathematical relationships. LEMBs are open-ended, inviting student participation and creativity. Student acquisition of modeling and problem-solving skills and the effect of LEMBs on other skills are evaluated using pre/post-tests, think-aloud exercises, and instructor/student interviews. We are creating new knowledge about learners' construction of modeling and problem-solving skills. LEMBs invite student-centered mathematics instruction and expose faculty to alternative pedagogy. We assemble pedagogical materials to facilitate lab-based instruction, including alternate mathematical pathways rooted in the labs, multiple assessment items, and educational vignettes based on classroom observations to illustrate key pedagogical techniques. LEMBs and instructor support materials are available to faculty nationwide via Open Access publication through USU's Digital Commons. Presentations about LEMBs are made at conferences, and articles are submitted to research and education journals.</AbstractNarration>

Post-secondary education depends largely on lectures and book homework problems. Real-world applications appear as contrived story problems with `canned? data. This does a poor job of involving higher levels of student math cognition, particularly related to skills valued by STEM employers, including abilities to:   Develop models and adapt mathematical techniques to novel situations,  Draw meaning from data,  Think critically and creatively about quantitative problems,  Use computational tools to provide timely answers,  Work effectively in teams, and  Communicate results clearly and concisely.     The learning gap is predominant in freshman/sophomore math classes required of STEM majors, calculus through linear algebra and ordinary differential equations (ODE), which are often terminal math classes for engineers, physicists, and STEM teachers.  When students are confronted with authentic, open-ended labs, requiring creative effort and teamwork in the context of instructor scaffolding, higher-level learning outcomes are multiplied. However, labs in collegiate math classes are problematic because:   Actual data collection is required for students to interact with mechanisms and engage the full spectrum of math cognition.  Infrastructure for labs in math classes does not exist.  Lab subject matter is biased toward/away from differing majors in math classes     LEMBs address these difficulties by:   Creating data collection projects which do not require specialized infrastructure.  Using biological mechanisms, about which students have an intuitive understanding but little prior experience.  Adapting biomath modeling, which is intrinsically open-ended because few generally-accepted mathematical models exist for biology.     Six LEMBs span a spectrum of biological mechanisms:     Yeast Lab: Yeast reproduce in a capped flask, generating carbon dioxide which is trapped in an inverted jar. Students engage in model competition with the resulting data.  Stream Lab: Dead leaves float down a small stream. The number of leaves passing recording stations along the stream are tallied and students are asked to manipulate models to answer questions in aquatic biology.

Students across many disciplines gained experience in how mathematics can be used to address science and engineering questions. We abstracted several lab design principles to help accomplish this, summarized by the PAVE framework:   Promote discovery: Labs are open-ended with opportunity to reason inductively, explore concepts and relationships, and discover connections.  Authentic: Driven by real data, ideally collected by students, labs require models and techniques used by applied mathematicians and scientists.  Visible success: Mathematical plausibility is visualized by model comparisons with data.  Engaging: Labs have an accessible, original, scientific question about natural phenomenon fitting into a broader story line.     The LEMBs also gave post-secondary math teachers an opportunity to review/refresh their pedagogy more generally. Effective teachers of LEMBs used pedagogical practices which maintained high levels of cognitive demand, including:   Scaffold student thinking: Ask questions and minimize direct instruction so students can work and think themselves.  Sustained press for justification: When students make observations and discoveries, encourage mechanistic, mathematical or deductive explanations.  Sufficient time to explore: Allow time for data gathering, small group discussion and whole-class reflection on experiment and results.  Build on prior knowledge: Require students to use, adapt and expand previous knowledge.  Students have means to monitor their own progress: Clear lab instructions, rubrics for evaluation and comparison with personally-collected data.
