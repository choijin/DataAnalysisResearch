<AbstractNarration>1258940  &lt;br/&gt;Kelley&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This EAR/Instrumentation and Facilities grant supports acquisition of of a Fourier Transform InfraRed (FTIR) spectrometer and petrographic microscope for in situ, non-destructive analysis of volatile and organic species in natural glasses, minerals, and rocks at microscopic spatial scales. This instrument will complement existing micro-analytical tools at the Graduate School of Oceanography (GSO), University of Rhode Island (URI) and support specific studies including 1) investigations of the role of volatiles (H2O and CO2) in plate tectonic cycles and mantle melting, 2) study of the behavior and fluxes of carbon in the Earth?s upper mantle, 3) research on magma/ice/meltwater interactions at glaciated stratovolcanoes, 4) studies of the role of volatiles in submarine explosive volcanism, and (5) investigations of the interplay of biological and geological processes in Earth?s nearsurface environments.  The instrument will serve graduate students investigations at URI-GSO and the PIs plan outreach activities to expose regional Rhode Island science teachers with tools of modern geoscience research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;***</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This award provided funds for the purchase of a Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectrometer, which is a versatile scientific instrument for the analysis if infrared-active bonds in natural or synthetic materials. In our lab, we primarily use this instrument to analyze natural glasses created during volcanic eruptions. With the FTIR, we can determine the dissolved gas content of the glass (e.g., H2O, CO2), which is important for assessing how gas-rich a magma was before it erupted, how the gas content relates to volcanic eruption style, and how the gas content relates to deeper processes like those that form magma in the Earth&rsquo;s interior. We purchased the FTIR instrument in fall of 2013, and have since tested our analysis methods and have determined that we produce data of comparable quality to other established FTIR labs in the US. We are currently exploring other applications of the FTIR system that would allow us to simplify our sample preparation, and those tests are still ongoing.
