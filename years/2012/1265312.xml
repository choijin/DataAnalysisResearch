<AbstractNarration>This will support student and young researcher travel to the AGU Chapman Conference on Fundamental Properties of Magnetotails. Chapman Conferences are topical meetings sponsored by the American Geophysical Union.  The meeting will be held in Reykjavik, Iceland March 10-15, 2013. The sessions will last 5 days. Three main questions will be considered: (1) How to magnetotails form? (2) Once energy and mass enter the magnetotail what modes operate? (3) How do magnetotails affect the inner magnetospheres and ionospheres? The meeting will consider the terrestrial and planetary (Mercury, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune) magnetotails.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[AGU Chapman Conference on Fundamental Properties and Processes of Magnetotails, March 10-15, 2013, Reykjavik, Iceland  Spacecraft observations have established that all magnetized planets in our  solar system interact strongly with the solar wind and possess well-developed  magnetotails. Magnetotails are the site for many dynamic processes critical to  the circulation of mass, energy and magnetic flux. The great differences in  solar wind conditions, planetary rotation rates, ionospheric conductivity, and  physical dimensions from MercuryÆs small magnetosphere to the giant  magnetospheres of Jupiter and Saturn provide an outstanding opportunity to  extend our understanding of the influence of these factors on these basic  processes.   In recent years there has been an explosion of observations from  spacecraft missions, such as MESSENGER, Geotail, Cluster, THEMIS, Galileo, New Horizons, Cassini, and ARTEMIS to name but a few. In addition, there have been tremendous advances in the capabilities of simulations to allow modeling of many of the relevant processes.      This conference  provided a forum in which various communities came together and discuss recent achievements of observational, theoretical, and  modeling studies with the objective to develop a deeper understanding of  fundamental properties and processes of planetary magnetotails through a  comparative examination. We will have presentations to compare and contrast knowledge from our best-sampled environment, the EarthÆs magnetotail, to the less explored magnetotails of Saturn and Jupiter, and to the least explored magnetotails of Mercury, Uranus, and Neptune.  Seventy-eight individuals attended the conference including 11 graduate students.        Last Modified: 06/13/2014       Submitted by: Brenda L Weaver]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
