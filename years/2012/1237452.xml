<AbstractNarration>This is a RAPID project to complete the high resolution scanning of a juvenile orca skeleton for inclusion in the Virtual Zooarchaeology of the Arctic Project collection (VZAP), a project that is currently supported by the Arctic Social Sciences Program.  VZAP is a "virtual, interactive, osteological reference collection for the study of northern vertebrates."   As the PI explains, full orca skeletons are very rare and this is a unique opportunity to add a juvenile skeleton to the VZAP collection.  The reason for the RAPID is that the Sitka Sound Science Center, the institutions who owns the skeleton, is currently in the process of rearticulating the orca skeleton to put on display in their museum.  In order to scan the skeleton it must be disarticulated and because the Center is doing this as a community project they cannot wait before continuing the articulation project, which will take place March 17th-24th,the week of March 11th offers the last opportunity to scan these bones.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This project used advanced 3D scanning technologies to capture the skeleton of an Orca whale that was being processed for display in the Sitka Sound Science Center. This juvenile orca was only the second complete scan of an orca ever done, the first being completed by our team the previous year in Port Townsend, Washington. This was an opportunistic project that fit perfectly with the greater goals of the NSF funded Virtual Zooarchaeology of the Arctic Project and added to the growing database of northern mammals, birds, and fish that have been scanned and made available in an on-line format. The team was in residence at the Sitka Sound Science Center from March 11th through March, 17<sup>th</sup> 2012. They scanned 131 bones from this whale and took 786 digital images.

Second, this project&rsquo;s goal is to provide these scans and data to the world by serving the scans in an&nbsp;on-line format, making the science accessible to the world.
