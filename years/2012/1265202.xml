<AbstractNarration>Technological advances make it possible to collect and store large data with relatively low costs. As a result, scientific studies in a wide range of fields routinely generate a massive amount of data. Oftentimes, our ability to obtain measurements outpaces our ability to derive useful information from them. These pressing challenges serve as the ultimate motivation for the proposed research. In particular, this collaborative proposal presents novel research plans on the development of statistical theory and methodologies as well as computational techniques for a host of problems involving large matrices ranging from covariance matrices, volatility matrices, density matrices to relational matrices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The past few years have witnessed an explosion of data as a result of scientific and technological advances. As data storage cost continues to fall, the focal point on these big data has been transitioning inevitably from data management towards deriving actionable insights from them. There is a pressing need to respond to these challenges and understand the profound impact of large data on scientific research and knowledge discovery. The proposed research project deals with emerging problems that arise naturally at the frontier of a multitude of scientific and technological fields such as systems biology, high-frequency finance, and quantum computing among others. As a consequence, the proposed research effort will not only push forward the state-of-the-art of statistical understanding of large matrices, but also facilitate the advancement of various scientific fields and their embracement of the digital revolution.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ With the recent advances in science and technology, large datasets are becoming ubiquitous. How to effectively extract information for such data is the ultimate goal of the proposed project. Towards this goal, the PI has engaged in the following research activities: Efficient quantum state tomography. The PI, along with his collaborators, has studied fundamental statistical performance limit for estimating a large sparse density matrix. They have also developed sparse regularization techniques for efficient estimate of such density matrices.  Inferences of covariance matrices in the presence of auxiliary information. Covariance matrix estimation plays a central role in multivariate data analysis. The problem of estimating a large covariance matrix has therefore attracted considerable amount of interests in recent years. The PI, along with his collaborators, has developed several novel methods for such purposes and studied the theoretical properties of these methods along with the fundamental limitation in estimating large covariance matrices.  Tensor completion via nuclear norm minimization. More and more often in practice, data can be formatted into higher order tensors. The large size of such data naturally brings about the task of tensor completion -- how to recover a tensor from observerations on a subset of its entries. The PI, along with his collaborators, obtained sharp sample size requirement for higher order tensor via tensor nuclear norm minimization.  The aforementioned methodological and theoretical research has also resulted in better understanding of problems from biology and medicine, finance, and engineering.  In addition, the PI has trained multiple PhD and postdoctoral students to work on problems related to the current project.
