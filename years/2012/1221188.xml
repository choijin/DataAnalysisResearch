<AbstractNarration>City College of New York (CUNY) is conducting a 3-year exploratory project to develop and test curricular resources built around handheld mobile technology to study how these materials foster urban middle school student interest and engagement with local biodiversity and the patterns of evolution. Using Leafsnap, an iPhone application, the project allows students to use pattern recognition software to readily identify various species of plants. The project aims to develop curricular resources for middle school students built around the Leafsnap app through a co-design process; to pilot test curricular resources in the classrooms of three New York middle school teachers; to develop and revise assessment tools to measure student outcomes; and to field-test curricular resources in the classrooms of ten New York middle school teachers and analyze results to determine how the Leafsnap app affects urban middle school student learning of biodiversity and the patterns of evolution. The results will be used to modify curriculum and disseminate it online with the Leafsnap app.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the project's first year, the curricular resources in two middle schools in East Harlem will be used. In the second year, the resources will be used in the classrooms of ten New York City (NYC) public middle school teachers. In the third year, these resources will be integrated into a life science for middle school teachers course as part of CUNY's graduate program in secondary science education, a program specifically designed to prepare teacher candidates for careers in NYC public middle schools. Also, in the project's third year, the curricular resources will be disseminated through the Leafsnap website to a wider online audience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project advances understanding of underrepresented urban middle school student learning of local biodiversity in a historical evolutionary context by addressing the three major dimensions of the new Framework for K-12 Science Learning: core science content, the practice of science, and concepts that crosscut all scientific disciplines. Pre- and post-treatment clinical interviews with students will be conducted to provide qualitative insights into how use of the Leafsnap curriculum impacts students' understanding and motivation for identifying and organizing tree diversity.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p><strong>Overview</strong>: The City College of New York developed and tested a four-week curriculum designed to teach middle school urban students about common ancestry through observation of the street trees that they see daily. Kids walk by trees and&nbsp;other plants every day and many cannot identify a maple or an oak. This curriculum uses Leafsnap (<a href="http://www.leafsnap.com/">www.leafsnap.com</a>), a cutting edge iPhone tree identification app to help students through careful observation learn about the role of common ancestry in the evolution of familiar street trees The curriculum is available for download at <a href="https://www.ccny.cuny.edu/education/unifying_life_site">https://www.ccny.cuny.edu/education/unifying_life_site</a>.</p> <p><strong>Intellectual Merit: </strong>The curriculum was piloted and then field-tested in the New York City public middle-school classrooms of 15 teachers (3 teachers in the piloting year &amp; 12 teachers in the field-testing year). Designed to follow tree life cycles, the curriculum was implemented in two parts: A fall portion focused on fruits, tree identification, grouping and common ancestry and a spring portion focused on flowers, grouping, and common ancestry. Students completed written assessments at three time points: pre-Fall, post-Fall and post-Spring implementation. Assessments were designed and validated during a pilot the previous year. Nineteen students were interviewed at the same three points. These interviews were used to further validate assessment interpretation. We used the assessments to address the following research question: &ldquo;How does the Unifying Life curriculum improve urban middle-school student understanding of 1) how to identify trees, 2) how to group trees by relatedness and 3 ) what it means to be related?&rdquo; Grounded theory was used to develop levels of understanding of these three dimensions of the research question (identification, grouping &amp; the evolutionary meaning of relatedness) and create partial-credit scoring rubrics based on these levels. Student proficiency was calculated for each dimension as percentage of points possible. Results are from 308 students who took all three assessments and a comparison group of 265 demographically similar students who took the assessment at the end of the school year.</p> <p>Analysis shows growth in students thinking about the three major dimensions of learning, identifying, grouping and relatedness, as compared to their pre-Fall performance and as compared to the Comparison group whose teachers&rsquo; did not implement the curriculum. Comparison students performed similarly on assessments as intervention students prior to experiencing the Unifying Life curriculum. &nbsp;Prior to implementation, more students used uninformative characteristics like location, size and the animals that live on a tree to identify trees. With instruction, students progressed to using characteristics like leaf edge and arrangement and fruits to identify. Students retained this learning from fall to spring without additional instruction on identification. For grouping by relatedness, students with instruction improved their ability to recognize the importance of fruits over leaves. Finally, many students moved from understanding relatedness as a synonym for &ldquo;being similar&rdquo; to an awareness that relatedness is based on shared ancestry. This significant connection was directly related to their scientific observation of the street trees.</p> <p><strong>Broader Impacts: </strong>The focus of these modules on street trees personally connected urban New York City students to environmental issues and ecological principles. In total, 15 New York City public middle school teachers were trained to use the <em>Unifying Life</em> resources through in-person professional development. The <em>Unifying Life</em> materials are available in modifiable formats to allow teachers to organize curricular resources to best advance their learning goals. This curriculum has been adapted and integrated into an ongoing life science course for pre &ndash;service elementary school teachers at the City College of New York. The curriculum is available online for national use and was described and disseminated in <em>Science Scope</em>, a practitioner journal for middle school science teachers. In total, this project supported in some capacity two graduate students and one post-doctoral fellow.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 09/06/2016<br>      Modified by: Yael&nbsp;Wyner</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1221188/1221188_10188922_1473195961756_Leafsnap05edited--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1221188/1221188_10188922_1473195961756_Leafsnap05edited--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Middle School Students Using Leafsnap"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1221188/1221188_10188922_1473195961756_Leafsnap05edited--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Middle School Students Using Leafsnap"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">New York City middle school students using Leafsnap to identify street trees</div> <div class="imageCredit">Yael Wyner</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Yael&nbsp;Wyner</div> <div class="imageTitle">Middle School Students Using Leafsnap</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1221188/1221188_10188922_1473196328099_Slide1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1221188/1221188_10188922_1473196328099_Slide1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Wordle of Tree Names Used By Students"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1221188/1221188_10188922_1473196328099_Slide1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Wordle of Tree Names Used By Students"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Wordle of responses to ?What are the names of the trees that live on the block in front of your school??
