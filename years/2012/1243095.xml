<AbstractNarration>Within the next three decades, climate variability, climate change and global development trends could have varied and profound effects on human well-being, especially in the developing world. Understanding how human and earth system trajectories will interact is essential to making better decisions that can reduce negative consequences for society and ecosystems. Research related to climate impacts has traditionally been separated into a number of poorly coordinated tasks, with independent models and research groups developing a) socio-economic development pathways, b) emissions and land use scenarios, c) land cover projections, d) climate simulations, and e) impact assessments. This disjointed approach has led to inconsistencies in assumptions across different components of the problem, lack of incorporation of feedbacks, unmanaged uncertainty propagation, and introduction of errors when upscaling or downscaling information across components.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To address these issues, better approaches to impact assessment are required that provide richer, higher resolution, and more internally consistent information about future societal and earth system conditions, and that link models of human and earth systems more effectively. The central objective of this proposal is to improve understanding of the joint consequences of socio-economic development and regional climate change by developing and applying tools to better integrate human and earth system models. This objective will be pursued by focusing on impacts in three key systems - urban areas, agriculture, and forests - in three regional case studies in rapidly developing countries - China, India, and Brazil. The project will develop an integrated suite of community tools for linking the most relevant type of global human system model, integrated assessment models (IAMs), with the Community Earth System Model (CESM), developed and validated through broad-based scientific collaboration and community support over the past 15 years. It will employ these tools to link the CESM with one IAM, the integrated Population-Economy-Technology-Science (iPETS) model, and carry out end-to-end impact assessments for our case study regions, from socio-economic scenario development through earth system analysis to impact and adaptation assessment. These assessments will serve as a proof-of-concept for this new modeling framework as well as produce valuable assessment information. Importantly, the research framework will be applicable in other human systems, in other regions, and with other IAMs than those employed here, to contribute to an even broader understanding of the human consequences of climate change.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project was a collaboration between the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR), the University of Illinois, Arizona State University, and the University of Kansas.  The central objective of this project was to improve understanding of the joint consequences of socio-economic development and regional climate change by developing and applying tools to better integrate human and earth system models. The project pursued this objective by focusing on impacts in two key systems, urban areas and agriculture. The project developed an integrated suite of community tools for linking integrated assessment models with the Community Earth System Model (CESM), called the Toolbox for Human-Earth System Integration and Scaling (THESIS).  CESM is a fully-coupled, community, global climate model that provides state-of-the-art computer simulations of the Earth's past, present, and future climate states.  It includes a state of the art land surface model [the Community Land Model (CLM)] that is the primary interface for the tools and analysis techniques developed by the project.  The THESIS tools were employed to link CESM with one integrated assessment model, integrated Population-Economy-Technology-Science (iPETS), and carry out end-to-end impact assessments, from socio-economic scenario development through earth system analysis to impact and adaptation assessment.  The project developed a number of urban-related THESIS tools; one that characterizes the properties of urban areas and allows for the development and testing of future urban scenarios, another that spatially projects future population density, and another tool to determine population exposure to climate hazards.  The urban tools were used to assess the intensity, duration, and frequency of heat waves in urban areas for two alternative future climate pathways.  We found that the lower emission pathway led to a 50% reduction in urban heat waves.  Related health-based statistical tools were used to project the frequency of high-mortality heat waves in 82 U.S. communities under different climate, population, and adaptation scenarios. The results suggested that following the lower emission pathway could substantially decrease exposure to high-mortality heat waves and that consideration of adaptation assumptions is critical when projecting health impacts of heat under climate change scenarios.  We also combined these results with two alternative population and urbanization outcomes to project future exposure of populations to heat extremes globally.  We found that climate change is a stronger determinant of exposure than demographic change in these scenarios; with a global reduction in exposure of over 50% under a lower emissions pathway, while a slower population growth pathway leads to roughly 30% less exposure.  The project developed three THESIS tools related to agriculture; a tool that projects the global spatial distribution of cropland and pasture given aggregate regional land use outcomes, an agricultural yield tool that provides the regionally aggregated effect of climate change on crop yields based on projected spatial land use and CLM outcomes, and a CLM Land Use Input Data tool that ingests output from other related tools and generates transient land use and land cover change input data (changes in land use/cover over time) for use by CLM in CESM simulations.  The agriculture tools were used to assess impacts on crop yields for two alternative future climate scenarios.  We project declining yields for C3 crops (e.g., wheat) without fertilization by carbon dioxide (present day CO2) and declining yields for C4 crops (e.g., soybeans) without irrigation under both future scenarios.  C3 yields increase with CO2 fertilization and C4 yields increase with irrigation. We also performed impacts work linking iPETS with CLM and CESM in order to evaluate the effect of climate change impacts on crop yields in the linked socioeconomic-biophysical system.  Results showed that economic consequences of impacts on yield depend sensitively on whether the effect of CO2 fertilization of crop growth was included and on the socioeconomic scenario that was assumed.  A second impact study evaluated the difference in global biophysical and economic impacts related to agriculture between 1.5&deg;C and 2&deg;C global warming scenarios (as motivated by the Paris Agreement).  We found that given uncertainties in climate, crops, and economics, even the sign of agricultural impacts between the two scenarios was uncertain. Under some assumptions 1.5&deg;C implies yield and economic benefits relative to 2&deg;C, while under others it implies costs.  The results from this project benefit society more broadly by informing important decisions regarding the most effective response options for coping with anticipated impacts of climate change and variability on urban populations and agricultural systems. The modeling architecture and scientific knowledge generated in this project surpasses the capability of existing studies on future climate change and its impacts and response options. The THESIS toolset and its enhancement to the CESM model is part of the permanent infrastructure available to the research community and can potentially be used in the future as an integrated system tool for policy and decision making.
