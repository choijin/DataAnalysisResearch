<AbstractNarration>1250661&lt;br/&gt;Ma&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nanoparticles show great promise in delivering anticancer drugs more specifically to tumors, thereby reducing the toxic side effects to normal tissues. The passive accumulation of nanoparticles in tumors is due to the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect, caused by the leaky nature of the tumor vasculature and the lack of lymphatic drainage in tumors. The EPR effect is the key to the success of nanoparticle-based drug delivery. The objective of the proposed research is to understand the flow dynamics of nanoparticles in stimulated blood flows and the consequent EPR and margination effects. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To achieve this objective, the PI will construct novel microfluidic devices that mimic blood bifurcation and leaky tumor blood vessels. The trajectory of nanoparticles in stimulated blood flows will then be characterized. Explorations include effects of flow geometry, particle size, and suspending medium rheology on particle margination. The proposed research will strengthen our fundamental understanding of the EPR effect - the hallmark of passive targeted delivery of anticancer drugs. The success of the proposed research will also have far-reaching implications on the rational design of nanoparticles to allow more specific delivery of anticancer drug into tumors, thereby increasing patient comfort during cancer treatment and fulfilling a societal need.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The objective of this project is to understand the distribution of particles in blood flow, thereby guiding the rational design of drug-carrying particles for cancer therapy. Tumor sites are usually characterized by leaky blood vessels. Of particular interest is how to increase the concentration of drug-carrying particles near the blood vessel walls so that these particles will have a higher chance of diffusing into the tumor sites. More targeted delivery into the tumor sites will further limit damage to healthy tissues as chemotherapy drugs kill cancerous as well as healthy cells. In this study, flow devices with small channels that mimic blood vessels were constructed, and particles of three different sizes (0.53, 0.84 and 2.11 microns) were studied using physiologically relevant flow rates. Our studies showed that particle size, flow rates, and the presence of red blood cells all affected the concentration of particles near the channel wall. When suspended in water, particles did not accumulate near the channel wall. Conversely, when suspended in blood, all three sizes of particles accumulated near the wall, although the degree of accumulation varied. The larger the particle size, the higher the propensity the particles migrated towards the wall. Likewise, the higher the flow rate, the higher the concentration of particles found near the wall. These experimental observations suggested the migration of particles near the channel wall is driven by the collisions between particles and red blood cells, validating several recent theoretical studies. Seven undergraduate students, including four female engineering students, and three underrepresented high school students, were involved in this project. Through active participation, they have acquired experimental skills in device fabrication and particle tracking and have also become well versed in fluid dynamics.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 11/30/2015<br>      Modified by: Anson&nbsp;Ma</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
