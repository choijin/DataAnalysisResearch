<AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit:  The PIs will utilize natural stable isotopes of carbon, nitrogen and oxygen to define the trophic position of sea otters and how it has varied from pre-historic (5000BP) to historic (last 300 years) times in the Kodiak and eastern Aleutian regions of Alaska. Stable isotope data from known prey species in each area will be analyzed to construct an isotopic food web to compare with changes in sea otter bone isotope ratios over time. Prehistoric data will come from faunal remains in middens.  Oxygen and carbon stable isotope data from archaeological and modern shells and paleo-proxy data from marine sediment cores will be used to evaluate changes in environment that may have affected nearshore ecosystems.  These data will be used to evaluate mechanistic explanations for the dramatic recent changes in sea otter trophic position and abundance.  One of the extant populations that will be studied is declining, while the other is doing well.  Understanding the mechanisms behind these divergent modern trajectories is of fundamental ecological as well as management interest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:  The broader impacts of this project are founded in interdisciplinary research, conservation and management. This will be the first single-system, multiple-geographic, comparison of isotopic records of a keystone species that spans thousands of years. This study will promote interdisciplinary research, collaboration, and education across two universities, a museum, and local schools. Included in this project is an outreach program devised in conjunction with the local museum to provide youth education, participation in an ongoing lecture series for adults, and information on the project and results for the museum's library, which is accessed by both&lt;br/&gt;locals and visitors. Lastly, results of this study will benefit the long-term conservation and management of sea otters, nearshore marine ecosystems, and fisheries.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><h3>This project has further developed the use of stable isotopes to tie past and present ecosystems together. Scholars have argued that conventional ecological data are inadequate to measure the ecological impacts of human activities because most observations are too recent to encompass natural cycles of environmental variation. In looking beyond the past few decades, this project is evaluating the trophic position of sea otters, a species highly impacted by human fur exploitation and subsequent reintroduction, into the deeper past. Using paleoecological, archeological and historical data provides the only means for extending ecological records far enough back in time to document the characteristic variability of marine ecosystems, the impact ifand environmental change over evolutionarily- and ecologically-relevant timescales. We are quantifying the trophic position of sea otters, a top predator, over thousands of years in and around Kodiak Island and comparing that to the trophic positions of sea otters in the Sanak archipelago over the same time periods. This type of project, utilizing paleoecological, paleoclimate and archaeological data is still new and therefore pushed the development of interdisciplinary, truly long-term research.</h3> <p>We have sampled, cataloged and measured upwards of 3500 specimens of 40 intertidal species from 6 sites around Kodiak Island. 670 of those were prepared and analyzed for carbon and nitrogen stable isotope analysis. In general, stable isotopic variations between organisms reflect different feeding strategies and habitats, and relate to the isotopic composition at the base of a food web. For example, primary producers (plants) in marine environments, such as phytoplankton, algae and sea grasses, all fractionate carbon differently during photosynthesis so the carbon isotope ratio (&delta;<sup>13</sup>C) is often a measure of which plants are found at the base of the food chain. The same principle holds for terrestrial ecosystems. There will be a difference in the &delta;<sup>13</sup>C of organisms that feed on phytoplankton and those that feed on kelp. In a marine food web &delta;<sup>13</sup>C increases about 2&permil; from primary producers to grazers and then 0.5 -1&permil; per trophic level (or step up the food chain). Changes in nitrogen isotope ratios (&delta;<sup>15</sup>N) are larger for every step up the food chain. It increases about 3&permil; per trophic level so it is most helpful in placing an organism into its proper place in the food web.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>This project was the first funded for a female early career scholar as a PI. The project was crucial in the PI&rsquo;s development; including the first opportunity for her to be the primary person to organize two lengthy field season in remote locations. The PI and her collaborators were able to develop contacts and promote science within the Native community of Kodiak and among the broader Kodiak community. In the course of this project, four female undergraduates and one female graduate student in the STEM disciplines were trained in laboratory procedures in general and specifically in preparation of samples for isotope analysis. This was a first-time opportunity for the undergraduates to work regularly in a laboratory setting. This training also aided the graduate student in completing isotope analyses for her thesis that she would not have otherwise had the training to complete.</p> <h3>Through participation in &ldquo;Dig Afognak&rdquo; (a culture camp run by the Native Village of Afognak), in 2012 and 2013 senior research personnel gained the opportunity to interact with grade-school age children, promoting science in general and specifically scientific collection methods and teaching about Kodiak&rsquo;s intertidal ecosystem. This was in conjunction with the Adventure EARTH week of Dig Afognak. While there they often discussed their project, intertidal ecology, and the use of stable isotopes with elders and others from the community who had volunteered to chaperone and teach the campers. The PI spoke at the Alutiiq Museum&rsquo;s evening lecture series in October 2012, discussing the project and accomplishments during the summer field season. The Alutiiq Museum also published a short article about the project in May 2013, aimed for a general audiences, in its newsletter authored by project personnel. The project PI participated in a stable isotope demonstration for high school and grade school science teachers in rural Alaska in order for them to learn about stable isotope techniques and what types of information can be derived from isotope data that is relevant to students in rural Alaska. The sea otter project was highlighted, using past and present sea otter food web data to demonstrate the use of stable isotope in ecology and paleoecology. The outreach event was jointly organized by the University of Alaska Corporative Extension Service (CES), the Center for Ocean Science Education Excellence (COSEE) and the Alaska Stable Isotope Facility. Data from this project was presented at three professional meetings and at the Sitka WhaleFest in 2015.</h3><br> <p>            Last Modified: 09/30/2016<br>      Modified by: Nicole&nbsp;Misarti</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1264306/1264306_10153316_1475209269950_quantifyingtheintertidal--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1264306/1264306_10153316_1475209269950_quantifyingtheintertidal--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Quantifying the Intertidal"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1264306/1264306_10153316_1475209269950_quantifyingtheintertidal--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Quantifying the Intertidal"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Quantifying the Intertidal</div> <div class="imageCredit">Spencer Wood</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Nicole&nbsp;Misarti</div> <div class="imageTitle">Quantifying the Intertidal</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1264306/1264306_10153316_1475209362238_commutingtowork--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1264306/1264306_10153316_1475209362238_commutingtowork--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Commuting to Work"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1264306/1264306_10153316_1475209362238_commutingtowork--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Commuting to Work"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Kayaking out to Crag Point for a gorgeous day of work</div> <div class="imageCredit">Spencer Wood</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Nicole&nbsp;Misarti</div> <div class="imageTitle">Commuting to Work</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1264306/1264306_10153316_1475209468420_kayaksCragPoint--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1264306/1264306_10153316_1475209468420_kayaksCragPoint--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Crag Point"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1264306/1264306_10153316_1475209468420_kayaksCragPoint--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Crag Point"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Low tide at Crag Point</div> <div class="imageCredit">Nicole Misarti</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Nicole&nbsp;Misarti</div> <div class="imageTitle">Crag Point</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1264306/1264306_10153316_1475209608702_SpencerWood--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1264306/1264306_10153316_1475209608702_SpencerWood--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Taking in the Low Tide"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1264306/1264306_10153316_1475209608702_SpencerWood--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Taking in the Low Tide"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Spencer Wood takes a break to admire low tide at Chiniak</div> <div class="imageCredit">Nicole Misarti</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Nicole&nbsp;Misarti</div> <div class="imageTitle">Taking in the Low Tide</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
