<AbstractNarration>_____________________________________________________________________________&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How is the diversity of the human experience reflected in the brain/mind? What is universal about the brain and mind, and what depends on the particulars of people's physical and social experiences? This project explores how the actions we perform with our bodies shape the neural processing of emotion. It asks whether right- and left-handers, who perform many actions differently, use correspondingly different areas of the brain to process one of the most basic components of human emotion: affective motivation (our predisposition to approach or avoid physical or social stimuli).  The research team, led by Dr. Daniel Casasanto at the University of Chicago, will use a combination of behavioral tasks, brain imaging, and neural stimulation to test the hypothesis that the way people use their hands to perform approach-related actions and avoidance-related actions may determine how approach- and avoidance-related emotions are represented in the brain. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are important clinical implications of this basic research. FDA-approved neural therapies are currently in use to treat depression and anxiety disorders. These treatments are based on a one-size-fits-all model of the brain and mind. If the way we use our hands influences how emotions are distributed across the cerebral hemispheres, this may signal that treatments that are beneficial for right-handers may be detrimental for left-handers. Tailoring neural therapies to the specifics of patients' interactions with the world may be crucial for developing safe, effective treatments for common mental health issues.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Summary:  This project, led by Dr. Daniel Casasanto, advanced our understanding of two basic components of human emotion: motivation and valence.  Motivation is the predisposition to approach or avoid physical or social stimuli. According to more than a hundred studies, the left cerebral hemisphere supports approach-related emotions like happiness, whereas the right cerebral hemisphere supports avoidance-related emotions like fear. Although this "textbook" pattern has been observed many times, it was not predicted, and has remained unexplained.  Our studies challenge the textbook model of motivation in the cerebral cortex, positing instead that the neural organization of approach and avoidance motivation should follow the organization of neural circuits that control the dominant hand (typically used for performing approach-related actions) and the non-dominant hand (typically used for performing avoidance-related actions). Using a non-invasive brain stimulation technique called transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), we showed that strong right-handers have approach motivation lateralized to the left cerebral hemisphere (which controls the right hand), but strong left-handers have approach motivation lateralized to the right hemisphere (which controls the left hand). Ambidextrous individuals have approach motivation distributed over both hemispheres. The cerebral organization of approach motivation follows the organization of individuals? motor systems.  Valence, another basic aspect of emotion, is the positive or negative emotional "charge" associated with objects or ideas. In 2009, Casasanto discovered that, unconsciously, people associate positive valence with their dominant side of space and negative valence with their non-dominant side. This implicit association affects their thoughts, feelings, and decisions. Here we explored the motoric basis of this association between valence and space, as well as some of its real-world consequences.  To understand how handedness-based space-valence associations are formed, we manipulated how fluently people could act with their dominant and non-dominant hands. Temporarily changing people?s motor fluency &ndash; by having them perform a fine motor task while wearing a bulky ski glove on one hand or the other &ndash; changed which sides of space they associated with "good" and "bad." When right-handers wore the glove on their dominant (right) hand, which made them temporarily more fluent with the left hand, they showed the same association between "good" and "left" as natural left-handers. Similar results were found when we asked right-handers to watch another person performing the ski-glove motor task, or to vividly imagine performing the task without actually wearing the glove or moving any objects. These results demonstrate a causal role for motor fluency &ndash; whether experienced, observed, or imagined &ndash; in determining how people use space to conceptualize positive and negative emotional valence.   Intellectual Merit:  Our studies on both motivation and valence support Casasanto?s theory of bodily relativity, according to which people with different kinds of bodies think differently in predictable ways, and have corresponding differences in the neural organization of basic cognitive functions.  Our studies on motivation also support a new theory of motivation in the cerebral cortex called the sword and shield hypothesis, and provide an alternative explanation for hundreds of data sets previously interpreted as showing that motivation is lateralized to the left hemisphere: a conclusion based on a pervasive sampling bias, testing only right-handers. The left hemisphere is not specialized for approach motivation. Instead, the neural organization of motivation follows the organization of motor control for the dominant and non-dominant hands, which are typically used for performing approach- and avoidance-related actions, respectively.  Both sets of studies reveal previously hidden links between action and emotion.  Broader Impacts:  Our studies of motivation may have urgent public health implications. Neural therapies for depression and anxiety are predicated on the "textbook" model of motivation in the brain. In an effort to increase approach-related emotions like happiness, clinicians use magnetism to stimulate the left cerebral hemisphere.
