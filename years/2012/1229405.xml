<AbstractNarration>This Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) award supports the development of a nano-CT-based elastography system that will permit three-dimensional (3-D) reconstruction of deeply embedded local details of a deformation field with sub-micron resolution and the associated characterization of images to generate anisotropic modulus elastograms. With the integration of a nano-CT adaptive compression wave generator, the system can unveil a significant amount of hidden information regarding the localized deformation and mechanical distribution within materials. The unique combination of milimeter-scale penetration length with sub-micron resolution offered by nano-CT makes it an ideal tool for noninvasive 3-D mechanical deformation imaging. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the development for the elastography system will enhance the overall capabilities for micro-/nano-systems development and materials characterization. Furthermore, the proposed development will enable exciting educational activities both at the undergraduate and graduate level, in all five engineering departments at UC Irvine. This interdisciplinary nature of the project will also help attract and retain students from underrepresented groups and expose them to the state-of-the-art research. The project will disseminate its findings broadly through submission of publications, presentations in conferences, and non-technical publications through the internet.</AbstractNarration>
