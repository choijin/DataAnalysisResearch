<AbstractNarration>The main objective of the present proposal is to develop a new model for multiscale analysis of solids, the quasi-atomistic model, which plays a transitional role between the atomistic and continuum models. In addition, the PIs propose to develop an energy-based procedure to couple fully atomistic descriptions and continuum descriptions in a seamless way, which allows for systematic coarse-graining with controllable error. A second objective is the analysis of the proposed methodology, including consistency, stability and convergence. Inconsistency, known as ghost force in this context, can be systematically removed even in the case of interfaces with corners. Another component of the project is to combine the principles of the multigrid method and multi-resolution analysis for the efficient implementation. This will be done by constructing multilevel grids by multi-resolution analysis and solving nonlinear minimization problems with multigrid methods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Molecular mechanics is a common approach to modeling the behavior of matter, where atoms are treated as the essential degrees of freedom and a potential function is used to describe the interactive effects between atoms. Equilibrium structures can be computed by minimizing the potential energy with respect to the position of the atoms. Other information about the system, such as the vibrational spectrum, thermodynamic properties, equations of state, and reaction rates, can also be computed. Extensive applications of molecular mechanics modeling can be found in materials science, chemistry and biology. The proposed work will mainly focus on solids, with generalizations to soft matter and biological systems, and conduct mathematical, numerical and applicative studies of the proposed methodology.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In this project the PIs proposed the quasiatomistic description to couple fully  atomistic description and continuum descriptions in a seamless way. For problems without scale separation, the multigrid method we designed seems to be  the first method with explicit examples to show its efficiency as a  general multiscale approach. For problems with localized defects, the coupling method we desgined is free of ghost  forces. The purpose of introducing extended Galerkin basis is to  further reduce the error around the interface between the continuum  model and the atiomistic model. This is a approach for the first time designed to reduce the error even  for a method without ghostforces.  Compared with existing methods based on coarse-graining models: linear  elasticity, Cauchy-Born elasticity, and constrained  Cauchy-Born elasticity, the quasiatomistic description allows  representation on a hierarchical family of levels with accuracy.  Therefore, in the framework of quasiatomistic description, the multigrid  method seems to work in general with optimal complexity. The  quasiatomistic description and corresponding multigrid method can be  applied not only for solids, but also for polymers and biomolecules.  The coupling method we developed in the framework of the quasiatomistic  description is free of ghost forces. The same as other methods in the  literature, the error at the interface between the atomistic and  atomistic regions is large. The idea of using extented basis locally  around the interface not only reduce the error dramatically but  also maintain the computational efficiency. This will be a general idea  for improving the accuracy of other multiscale methods.  The project provided training and professional development for   undergraduate students to understand the working mechanism of multigrid   methods for nonlinear, nonconvex problems, and programme fast   algorithms. Ms. Maria Trujillo has joined school of mathematics, Georgia   Tech to continue her master study.  Three papers were published in peer-reviewed journals, including:  1.  A constrained Cauchy-Born elasticity accelerated multigrid method  for nanoindentation, Commun. Comput. Phys., 15(2014), 470-486.  2. An atomistic/continuum coupling method using enriched bases, Multiscale Model. Simul., 13(2015), 766-789.  3. Analysis of the divide-and-conquer method for electronic structure calculations, Math. Comp., 85(2016), 2919-2938.  One paper was submitted and is currently under review:  An efficient multigrid strategy for large-scale molecular mechanics optimization.
