<AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;03 July 2012&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number:  1219438&lt;br/&gt;Institution:  Scripps Institute of Oceanography&lt;br/&gt;PI:   B. Appelgate&lt;br/&gt;Co-PI:  Z. Kelety&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal requests Shipboard Scientific Support items for the vessels operated by Scripps Institute of Oceanography (SIO) namely; the R/V ROGER REVELLE, MELVILLE, NEW HORIZON, and ROBERT G. SRPOUL.  Requests include: (1) a new fire detection system for NEW HORIZON, (2) a new oily water separator and reverse osmosis water maker for SPROUL, and (3) new hanging blocks and a closed circuit television system for the REVELLE.  This award also includes computerized stability program up-grades for all vessels in the Academic Fleet.  All items requested will enhance safety, bring the vessels into current regulatory compliance, or provide greatly improved science support capabilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:   SIO vessels support federally-funded scientific research throughout the world?s oceans and routinely expose graduate and undergraduate students to seagoing oceanography.  SIO participates in a large number of outreach programs including open house events, student tours, and hosting of government officials, dignitaries, and science communities while in foreign ports.      &lt;br/&gt;All told, Scripps vessels are scheduled to complete nearly 470 NSF sponsored days in 2012.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Scripps Institution of Oceanography OCE-01219438  Outcomes Report  The Scripps Institution of Oceanography was funded for multiple items under this grant.  This item funded a replacement fire detection system onboard research vessel New Horizon. An upgraded addressable fire alarm control panel increased the safety of the vessel. This item funded a replacement oily water separator onboard research vessel New Horizon. Oily water separators protect the ocean environment by stripping oil residue from bilge water.  The new separator works correctly, is fully calibrated, and is United States Coast Guard approved. This item funded the installation of a reverse osmosis water maker system onboard research vessel New Horizon.  A 1200 gallon per day reverse osmosis unit was installed on New Horizon.  The unit has proven to be reliable, makes the rated amount of freshwater, and is an excellent back-up to the shipÃ†s evaporator.  This item funded overboarding blocks for research vessel Roger Revelle:  Two oceanographic cable overboarding blocks were purchased and are in service onboard Roger Revelle. The blocks provide for safe deployment of science instruments and increase the life of expensive oceanographic cable. This item funded an upgrade to the close circuit television (CCTV) onboard research vessel Roger Revelle.  Seven compact marine grade pan tilt and zoom cameras were installed on Roger Revelle.  Joystick control and camera recording software increase the interoperability and usefulness of the system. The CCTV system provides higher situational awareness of ongoing science operations ship wide and increases the shipÃ†s security posture. The shipÃ†s crew is very satisfied with the replacement.  This item funded a University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System group purchase for a shipboard stability program upgrade. The upgraded program permits running the stability program on recent Windows operating systems.  The stability program ensures many research vessels are properly ballasted for changing loading conditions. This item funded the acquisition of modern overboarding blocks. These blocks ensure Scripps Institution of Oceanography ships operate within appropriate safety limits during over-the-side deployments of science mission equipment and instrumentation.  Additionally, the use of these large diameter blocks extends the life of expensive oceanographic cable. This item funded engineering services from oceanographic machinery manufacturer for loading analysis. This analysis will ensure Scripps Institution of Oceanography ships can operate within appropriate safety limits during over-the side deployments of science mission equipment and instrumentation.   This item funded replacement science support uninterruptible power supply (UPS) for research vessel Roger Revelle. This UPS provides clean electric power to all of the shipÃ†s laboratories. Scientists have increased confidence that their expensive equipment and valuable science data collection efforts are supported by the most up-to-date and reliable power supplies.       Intellectual merit.  At SIO, the observation, measurement, and collection of samples and data are accomplished at sea on a global scale by operations aboard seagoing research vessels.  Shipboard research, such as that provided by SIO-operated vessels supported by NSF, offers the transformative potential to understand societal relevant issues, such as global change and the health of ocean ecosystems, on which human well-being may ultimately depend.     This award supported upgrades to the operation of the research vessel (R/V) Roger Revelle, Melville, New Horizon and Robert Gordon Sproul.  Each scientific program assigned aboard these ships was individually selected through peer review processes, and was directed by its own Principal Investigator with unique objectives, outcomes and intellectual merit.     Broader impacts.  The spectrum of research projects enabled by these improvements to NSF-supported res...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
