<AbstractNarration>This project will result in a novel system called SOCRATES that will help transform social media research for scholars working in diverse fields by building a community of researchers and practitioners around various issues of data-intensive research. Social media services such as Twitter and Facebook, used by millions of people worldwide, expose vast amounts of data about people's beliefs, ideas, opinions, behaviors, and activities. At the same time, the sheer scale and volume of the data make them extremely difficult for scholars to study effectively. SOCRATES will address this issue by incorporating a set of socio-computational tools that will allow researchers from multiple fields to collect large-scale social media data; explore and visualize the resulting content items, and analyze the collected content. A community- and human-centered approach to developing the new system will ensure that SOCRATES matches researchers' work practices and mental models, is easy to use, and produces outcomes that significantly contribute to the researchers' goals, especially in solving multi-disciplinary problems. Importantly, the SOCRATES system will employ a social-computational approach--crowdsourcing--to handle some of the challenges of social media research. Thus, the project will take advantage of the intelligence of both computers and people to study online social activities. SOCRATES proposes to use the labor of humans to assist in the collection of data (e.g., by refining and filtering information collected by an automatic crawler); to help explore the data and generate insights (e.g., by allowing the public to view and comment on visualizations of the collected data); and to analyze and annotate the data (e.g., by creating a controlled environment where coders can annotate content items with high reliability). As a result, SOCRATES will provide a first-of-its-kind, end-to-end environment where social media can be studied effectively, with high validity, and at immense scale.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This collaborative project with Rutgers University was the first step in the development of the SOcial and CRowdsourced AcTivities Extraction System (SOCRATES), a robust, highly usable social-computational platform for researchers and educators to track, capture, visualize, explore, and analyze social media data.  The feedback from a workshop held in 2014 under this grant generated the requirements for the SOCRATES framework. This workshop helped build a community of researchers who currently use or could benefit from using tools like SOCRATES to conduct social media research.  At Stevens Institute of Technology, this project resulted in five conference papers, two journal articles, and one dissertation. The work reported in these publications focused on better understanding how people perceive and spread information on social media using the SOCRATES framework.  One conference paper was nominated for a best paper award, and the dissertation received the outstanding dissertation award for 2015 from the Howe School of Business at Stevens Institute of Technology. These papers receiving recognition focused on reducing the spread of inaccurate information on social media.  In addition to these scholarly activities, there were two main educational activities using SOCRATES at Stevens Institute of Technology.  First, SOCRATES was introduced to students in an MBA course on social media analytics at Stevens Institute of Technology, in which they collected and analyzed social media using SOCRATES for their course projects. Students found SOCRATES user friendly.  Second, a  Ph.D. student from Stevens Institute of Technology introduced SOCRATES to eight high school students and their teacher through guiding their project on collecting and analyzing social media data. The Ph.D. student mentored four high school students and their teacher in 2014 and four other high school students and their teacher in 2015. The projects with high school students focused on visualizing the spread of information on social media, and the results were presented by the high school students as posters at conferences.  The project outcome suggests that SOCRATES can be useful for not only seasoned social media researchers in diverse fields but also students, businesses, and general public who are interested in extracting intelligence from social media.
