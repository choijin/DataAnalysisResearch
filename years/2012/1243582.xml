<AbstractNarration>The project is integrating two geodetic technologies--Global Positioning Systems (GPS) and Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR)--into the undergraduate geoscience curriculum by 1) creating a new upper-level applications course at the University of Houston, 2) augmenting an existing field-methods course at the Yellowstone Bighorn Research Association field camp with GPS and LiDAR applications, and 3) conducting professional-development workshops for college faculty to incorporate GPS and LiDAR into their own courses at different levels of the curriculum. The pedagogical approach scaffolds inquiry-based cases and uses freely available online software to overcome complex data-processing challenges, allowing students to focus on applications and problem-solving. Project assessment is addressing the efficacy of the curriculum on undergraduate learning of high-precision GPS and LiDAR methodologies, the extent to which GPS and LiDAR integration augments geoscience problem solving more broadly, and effective strategies for faculty development to incorporate GPS and LiDAR into other undergradaute geoscience courses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of the project lies in its infusion of cutting-edge high-precision technologies, increasingly used by geoscience professionals, into the undergraduate curriculum for application to a host of compelling geoscience topics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts include professional development and dissemination of four modules which, together with the underlying strategies, enable use at other institutions and/or levels of the curriculum. The project also uses GPS and LiDAR to increase engagement and impart workforce-relevant skills to geoscience majors, including a high proportion of students from underrepresented minorities at the University of Houston.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The University of Houston received an award from NSF in 2014 to develop an educational project entitled &ldquo;Integrating GPS and LiDAR into Undergraduate Geoscience Education&rdquo; (DUE-1243582). This project was funded by NSF through the International Research Experiences for Students (IRES) program. Funded by the NSF grant, the PI has developed a new course, GEOL4332/6323 Geoscience Applications of GPS and LiDAR, for geoscience majors at both graduate and undergraduate levels. GEOL4332 is a three-credit hour undergraduate course targeting junior and senior geoscience majors. It is designed as a research-intensive course focusing on GPS/LiDAR utilization for real-world science problems. The PI offered this course in each spring semester since 2014. The new course has been successfully institutionalized at the University of Houston and will be offered in each spring for UH students in earth sciences, surveying engineering, and civil engineering. The PI also enhanced the UH Geophysics Field Camp (GEOL4355) by implementing GPS and LiDAR into the field course. The UH Geophysics Field Camp is a core course for UH geophysics majors and it is designed to provide practical experience for geoscience majors in geophysical field acquisition techniques. &nbsp;In collaboration with UNAVCO, this project also hosted a one-day educational workshop, Hooking undergraduates into geophysics data and methods (GPS, Lidar, InSAR, SfM photogrammetry) through societally important issues, in San Francisco, CA (December 11, 2016). This workshop aimed to introduce GPS and LiDAR to geoscience instructors who have interests in integrating GPS and LiDAR into their courses. Twenty six geoscience instructors from universities nationwide attended this workshop. One of the major goals of this workshop was to promote the transformation of GPS/LiDAR education to other institutes.
