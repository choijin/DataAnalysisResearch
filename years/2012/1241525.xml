<AbstractNarration>This project aims to expand the existing CyberCorps(R): Scholarship for Service (SFS) program at Florida State University (FSU) to new MS Computer Criminology degree program. Most professionals who enter the cybersecurity field have only training in technical aspects with the common educational background being Computer Science (CS). While such skills are crucial, there is also a need to have a broader understanding of the threat model for cyber applications particularly when the adversary can be an insider. Criminology studies the extent, causes and nature of criminal behavior in the individual, society or nation-state. Understanding the motivation for criminal behavior leads to better methods for the prevention of cybercrime and, when complemented with the appropriate CS technical skills will provide assurance in a much more realistic threat model. Thus, CS and Criminology provide complementary knowledge skills. FSU has created a new MS Computer Criminology degree program to meet these needs. Another key aspect of this project is to increase female and minority participation in cybersecurity attracting students that would have normally majored in criminology or related majors.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The proposed project has an important mission of preparing cybersecurity professionals for positions in agencies of the Federal, state, local and tribal government. Using knowledge and skills obtained in the program, the graduates are well prepared to meet challenges of protecting the information and infrastructure resources of our Nation.</AbstractNarration>
