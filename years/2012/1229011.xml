<AbstractNarration>This NSF award to the University of Southern California funds U.S. researchers participating in a project competitively selected by the G8 Research Councils Initiative "Interdisciplinary Program on Material Efficiency - A first step towards sustainable manufacturing". This is a pilot collaboration among the U.S. National Science Foundation, the Canadian National Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC), the French Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR), the German Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG), the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS), the Russian Foundation for Basic Research (RFBR),and the United Kingdom Research Councils (RCUK), supporting collaborative research projects selected on a competitive basis that are comprised of researchers from at least three of the partner countries. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Composite parts for aerospace structures are presently manufactured using autoclaves, large heated pressure vessels used to cure laminates consisting of fiber layers partly impregnated with polymer films, called prepregs. Autoclaves are highly effective in producing high-performance laminates with high fiber loadings and low defect content, but they consume large amounts of energy and nitrogen gas. A new class of vacuum bag only (VBO) prepregs was recently introduced to eliminate the need for autoclaves during manufacture. Work at the composite centers at the University of Southern California (USC) and McGill University has begun to develop fundamental understanding of processes inherent to VBO prepreg processing, suggesting the broad utility of this new class of materials. While these developments have great potential for expanding the use of composite materials and VBO prepregs in particular, key technical challenges must be addressed to realize widespread acceptance and use. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This interdisciplinary project with the United States, Canada, Germany and the United Kingdom focuses on (1) developing fundamental understanding of the effects of manufacturing process parameters on defects in composites produced with VBO prepregs, (2) improving material efficiency by reducing material waste in the automated manufacture of composite parts, (3) accelerating insertion of VBO materials technology through simulation and validation of VBO composite performance, and (4) improving sustainability by advancing recycling technology and developing and demonstrating energy-efficient smart tooling concepts. These objectives require an approach that combines expertise in process simulation, automated manufacturing, materials qualification and acceptance, and fundamental polymer science and technology. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed work will leverage the expertise of researchers at major academic composite centers in four G8 countries.  Project personnel will be trained in state-of-the art tools for design, manufacture and re-use of next-generation composites. Postdoctoral researchers, graduate students, and undergraduate students will be involved in the completion of this work. The project will involve participating students and early-career researchers in a coordinated effort to address scientific issues of global importance through international collaboration.</AbstractNarration>
