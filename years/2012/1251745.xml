<AbstractNarration>Children's television viewing often involves extended experiences with familiar characters. Unlike any previous technological age, these characters are now present in many different kinds of media, including television programs and advertisements, computer games, and mobile Apps. In addition to entertaining and teaching viewers, these characters also sell to children, including unhealthy foods that have been linked to the childhood obesity crisis that plagues our nation. While characters such as these have been used as marketing tools for many years, little is known about the extent to which this marketing is effective, or the specific conditions under which children are susceptible to its influence. The investigators will test their theory that the existence of one-sided, emotionally-tinged friendships that children form with media characters--known as parasocial relationships--are central to their influence. The researchers will develop and validate an assessment scale for measuring the strength of parasocial relationships and use it to determine what factors influence relationship magnitude and predict the likelihood of media character influences on children's preferences. The investigators will use an experimental method in which children interact with a novel media character to explore the dynamics of how parasocial relationships form and under what circumstances they lead to strong influence. They will characterize the extent to which this process varies between 3 and 8 years of age. Structural equation modeling will be used to calculate the effect magnitude of different factors on parasocial relationships and character motivation.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Without research about the underlying reasons for the obesity crisis, the future of our children is in peril. US children are now expected to have shorter life spans than their parents. Media characters may be playing an unhidden role in this epidemic. However, these same characters may also be able to change children's food choices and eating patterns by promoting healthier foods. The knowledge that will be gained from this project can help scientists understand the important role that media characters are playing in the childhood obesity crisis. This information can then be used to help parents make healthy decisions for their children in supermarkets and restaurants, to help businesses use their media characters more wisely, and to inform legislators about the kinds of policies that can improve the health and well being of future generations.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Children?s media have historically been rooted in characters&mdash;from Captain Kangaroo and Howdy Doody to Elmo and SpongeBob SquarePants. Unlike any previous technological age, however, characters now travel across different kinds of media platforms, including television programs and advertisements, computer games, videogames, and mobile apps on smart phones and tablets like the iPad. These characters also sell to children, including unhealthy foods and beverages that have been linked to the childhood obesity crisis that is plaguing our nation. The overarching goal of this research project was to examine the kinds of foods and beverages that media characters sell to children, how children?s relationships with those characters influence children?s food choices and eating patterns, and how those characters could "sell" healthier rather than unhealthy foods and beverages to children. We documented the pervasive reach of media characters as marketers to children, from children's homes where they view television advertisements and visit online websites, to the grocery stores where characters are on the boxes of foods and drinks, to the mobile apps with characters that travel with children everywhere they go. These branded characters influenced children's food preferences, their food selections, their food requests, and their parents purchases of foods and drinks. Most of the foods and drinks endorsed by media characters were unhealthy, potentially leading to health risks such as obesity. Nevertheless, apps that taught children to eat healthy foods successfully conveyed their lessons through games.  The implication of this research program is that these unhidden persuaders can lead to unhealthy outcomes, but have hidden and underutilzed potential to improve the health of our nation, including that of our youngest citizens.
