<AbstractNarration>The Chemical Catalysis Program of the NSF Division of Chemistry supports the research efforts of Professor David M. Jenkins of the University of Tennessee at Knoxville (UTK) to explore new aziridination reactions using organic azides (both aryl and alkyl variants) as the nitrene source and alkenes as the carbon source.  This innovative reaction involves novel transition metal complexes supported by strong sigma-donor macrocyclic tetra-N-heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) as auxiliary ligands which act as homogeneous azirdination catalysts.  The research is accomplished in four steps:  ligation of tetracarbenes to first and second row transition metals (especially iron), catalytic studies of aziridination reactions between organic azides and alkenes, mechanistic studies of the reaction through probes of intermediates (i.e., metal imide complexes), and expansion of substrate scope to make the reactions relevant to industrial, pharmaceutical, and biological applications.  The broader impacts of this work include providing opportunities for pre-college scholars from Central High School (CHS), an economically-disadvantaged high school in Knoxville, TN, to perform research at the UTK.  With the assistance of high school teachers at CHS and collaborators in the Knox County School District, new Advanced Placement (AP) laboratories that match Professor Jenkins's research interests are being developed within the guidelines of the AP Chemistry curriculum.  The laboratory capabilities at CHS are being upgraded in order to support the new experiments.  Finally, in addition to the typical technical presentations and publications, these research results are being disseminated though the Pre-Game Showcase at UTK football games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Aziridine compounds are found in natural products, such as mitomycins and azinomycins, that have antitumor and antibiotic properties crucial to the development of new pharmaceutical products.  Despite the myriad of uses, the synthesis of aziridine compounds has been wasteful and expensive due to the need for additional reagents that are not fully used in the final products.   This CAREER project utilizes less expensive metal-based catalytic processes to avoid the need for expensive reagents.  The improved reactions are expected to have impact in biology and synthetic organic chemistry, particularly in the preparation of new medicines.  In his work with teachers and administrators at Central High School in Knoxville, Tennessee, Professor Jenkins stresses the use of sustainable processes in the development of new laboratories for the Advanced Placement (AP) Chemistry courses.  Professor Jenkins publishes his work in technical journals but also disseminates his group's results in non-traditional forums, such as the Pre-Game Showcase at the University of Tennessee Knoxville football games.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[             The goal of this research grant was to develop improved sustainable catalysts for the aziridination reaction.  One aspect of the research that focused on sustainability was substituting first-row transition metals, such as iron, for rarer second-row transition metals, such as ruthenium.  The aziridination reaction that we studied was the formation of a three-membered ring containing two carbons and one nitrogen that was formed through the reaction of an alkene and an organic azide.  The aziridine is a strained ring that is frequently employed in organic synthesis and it found in some natural products.  The reagent choice was the second area of sustainability since these improve atom economy by having fewer waste atoms.               Our research focused on developing macrocyclic N-heterocyclic carbenes as auxiliary ligands for homogenous catalysis with first-row transition metals, namely iron and chromium.  Our published research results showed several key developments for catalytic aziridination.  First, stronger donor ligands led to the first effective use of aliphatic azides instead of just aryl azides.  Aliphatic azides are critical for forming complex ring systems seen in natural products.  Second, we prepared the first chromium catalyst for aziridination, which was effective with a variety of protic functional groups.  Protic functional groups, like alcohols, are critical for developing drugs with aziridines.  Third, we developed a careful study of the mechanism of the catalytic reaction, with both theory and experiments, which had only been investigated briefly previously.  Unlike previous systems, the rate determining step was the addition of alkene to iron imide.              In addition to our direct studies on catalysis, we had two other main sources of publications.  First, we also studied high valent iron chemistry since this is part of the catalytic cycle.  We published two key highlights in this area.  First, we synthesized an iron(IV) tetrazene complex and second, we formed a series of iron(IV) imide complexes.  These imide complexes are highly relevant to the catalytic cycle.  Second, In addition to our original research, our expertise on this catalytic cycle allowed for us to write critical commentary about the reaction.  We published a technical encyclopedia article and a review on sustainable oxidation catalysis with iron.              In addition to the scientific research, the grant also supported several broader societal impacts.  The funding supported multiple graduate students and postdocs over the five year period.  It also supported a local high school teacher to develop six new AP chemistry labs that were implemented in Knox County, Tennessee.  The PI also provided community presentations of the research in east Tennessee, highlighted by a Pre-Game showcase for a large audience of alumni before the University of Tennessee football game against the University of Kentucky in 2014.
