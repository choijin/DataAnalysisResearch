<AbstractNarration>This CAREER project merges state-of-the art research in the fields of cloud physics, aerosol science and climate change with novel instructional tools, community education and outreach, and improvement of undergraduate and graduate education initiatives in meteorology.  Insufficient knowledge of aerosol effects on clouds and precipitation (via cloud modification) causes a large uncertainty in quantification of the overall climatic effects of aerosols and results in poor predictions on global climate models. These needs will be addressed through the analysis of aerosol-cloud interactions via three innovative research themes: (i) Remote sensing studies on the impact of aerosols on clouds and precipitation via the direct, indirect and semi-direct effects using A-Train Satellite data sets; (ii) Observational studies on mixing processes with investigations into aerosol-cloud interactions based on cloud size, lifetime and aerosol type and surface characteristics; and (iii) Model Evaluation of cloud-aerosol interactions using collocated A-Train Satellite observations to identify inconsistencies between observations and global climate models to guide future development and improvement in global climate models.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By utilizing three distinctly different data types this project allows for the analysis of aerosol-cloud interactions on a variety of spatial (individual clouds to global scale) and temporal scales (micro-seconds in cloud to yearly means). The variety of platforms used for this study will also provide graduate student researchers with an exceptionally broad background and varied skill set.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research described above is closely intertwined with the education goals of this project. State-of-the-art research on clouds, aerosols and climate will be integrated into undergraduate courses to increase the overall scientific literacy of a "hot" media topic. The adoption of group class activities utilizing multi-media teaching techniques (i.e. YouTube and Podcasts) will encourage students to identify connections between the "real world" current weather events and climate issues with course material. Additionally, an innovative undergraduate-graduate student mentoring program will guide undergraduates while simultaneously developing supervising and mentoring skills in graduate students as they embark on the research outlined above. The research program will also foster collaborations between the University of Hawaii and NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory by providing graduate and undergraduate students the opportunity to intern and work with elite scientists at a renowned research facility. To broadly impact the community the PI will organize an annual Expanding Your Horizon (EYH) conference in Hawaii (the first for that state). The PI will recruit local Hawaiian women scientists and industry leaders with the goal of educating and attracting young women to the STEM fields. As part of the EYH conference the PI will sponsor hands-on workshops using data collected through the described research efforts.</AbstractNarration>

Four students completed Plan A Masters theses.&nbsp; Alyssa Sockol&rsquo;s thesis &ldquo;Inter-comparison of CMIP5 Model Representations and Satellite Observations of Cloud-Aerosol Interactions&rdquo; resulted in a publication in the journal Earth and Space Science entitled &ldquo;Inter-comparison of CMIP5 Model and Satellite Observations of Cloud-Aerosol Interactions.&rdquo; Her work allows us to better understand how climate models represent clouds, aerosols and their interactions by comparing them to a long-term record of clouds and aerosols from satellites.&nbsp; A second student, Christopher Goodman, completed a Plan A Masters Thesis &ldquo;Meteorological Impacts on Commercial Aviation&rdquo; which resulted in two publications in the Journal of Applied Meteorology and Climatology. The first was entitled &ldquo;Climate Impacts on Density Altitude and Aviation Operations&rdquo; and the second was &ldquo;Meteorological Impacts on Commercial Aviation Delays and Cancellations in the Continental US.&rdquo; This work is especially relevant to the general public because it will help inform aviation professionals (airlines, airports, and safety managers) to improve airport operations. A third student, Ashley Heikkila, completed a Plan A Thesis <em>&ldquo;</em><em>Characterization of Marine Stratocumulus Clouds and Aerosol-Cloud Interactions During ORACLES.&rdquo; Her work allowed her go on a field project in two countries in Africa to learn about aerosol-cloud interactions.&nbsp; A fourth student, Jessica Gartzke, completed a Plan A Thesis &ldquo;The Relationships between drought severity, precipitation and aerosol in California during the 2012-2014 drought.&rdquo; This work is relevant to the general public because it deals with fires and it related to impacts in precipitation and air quality of folks living in the drought stricken regions. If we understand how past droughts affect precipitation and air quality we can be more prepared during future droughts. A fifth student, Kayla Yamamoto, completed a Plan A Thesis &ldquo;Aerosol-Cloud Interactions from Hawaii&rsquo;s Kilauea Volcano.&rdquo; Her work is very relevant to the communities of Hawaii Island. Changes to cloud properties impact precipitation and visibility. Finally, the sixth student, Dillon Dodson, completed a Plan A Masters Thesis &ldquo;Turbulence and Droplet Clustering in Shallow Cumulus: The Effects of Aerosols and Cloud Height&rdquo; which resulted in a publication in the journal Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics entitled &ldquo;</em>Droplet Clustering in Shallow Cumuli: The Effects of In-Cloud Location and Aerosol Number Concentration.&rdquo; This student continued on to work on a PhD, expanding his Masters work to stratocumulus clouds. During this award he passed his qualifying exam and is preparing his first PhD publication for submission this fall to Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;The student trained during this project also participated in many professional conferences such as the annual American Geophysical Union conference, the annual American Meteorological Society&rsquo;s (AMS) conference, the AMS Conference on Cloud Phyics, the International Conference on Clouds and Precipitation, and Asia Oceania Geosciences Society conference. These were invaluable experiences for them professionally and personally, allowing them to present their science while also networking for their future careers.</p> <p>&nbsp;By the end of this project all of the main science goals were successful with publications produced, as of now 4 in number are fully published. Additional papers will be ready to submit by the end of 2019 and in early 2020. The anticipated total number of papers from this award is 10.</p> <p>The educational goal were also successful.&nbsp; The PI created an entire STEM conference for 6-8<sup>th</sup> grade girls from scratch.&nbsp; The conference has served over 500 local young women, and many students of Native Hawaiian and Pacific Island ancestry. The conference has become part of the annual activities for many young women and their families with them looking forward to the opportunity to do hands-on science with local women working in STEM fields. They also enjoy hearing about career options in STEM and &ldquo;seeing themselves&rdquo; as scientists through their interaction with the workshop leaders and mentors. At the University of Hawaii at Manoa, hundreds of undergraduate students have benefited from the PIs interactive teaching techniques, blogging, podcasting, and flipping the classroom methods. The courses she has developed for undergraduates stresses intuitive learning and connecting science to society and finding ways to personalize the science being taught to students personal experiences.&nbsp; For graduate students, the PI stressed skills development and provided solid coding and data analysis skills training while also teaching the science of satellite remote sensing. Finally, the mentoring program developed in the department is going strong with undergraduate and graduate student working with faculty to support each other.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 08/08/2019<br>      Modified by: Jennifer&nbsp;Small Griswold</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1255649/1255649_10240486_1565293541907_EYH_Hawaii_Career_Panel--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1255649/1255649_10240486_1565293541907_EYH_Hawaii_Career_Panel--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Expanding Your Horizons - Hawaii - Career Panel"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1255649/1255649_10240486_1565293541907_EYH_Hawaii_Career_Panel--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Expanding Your Horizons - Hawaii - Career Panel"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Photo taken during the 2018 Expanding Your Horizons - Hawaii Career Panel</div> <div class="imageCredit">Jennifer D.
