<AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit: Prairie pothole lakes (PPLs also referred to as wetlands) are important hydrologic features in the glacial till of the Upper Midwest. The hydrology and climate of the region coupled with the composition of the till have developed water chemistries unique to PPLs, including extremely high  levels of sulfate. Results of a pilot project funded by NSF showed that sulfate undergoes reduction in the sediments to produce reduced sulfur species in the mM levels. Our data demonstrated that unaltered PPL pore waters sampled from lakes P1 and P8 in the Cottonwood Lakes Area abiotically and rapidly degraded chloroacetanilide and nitroaromatic pesticides (which are heavily used in row crop agriculture in the region). Additionally, we found dissolved organic matter levels in the 100s of mg/L-C in the pore waters, which are among the highest measured for lacustrine systems. This proposal expands upon our previous work to understand the linkages between hydrology, the evolution of the unique biogeochemical composition of PPL pore waters, and its ability to attenuate agricultural pesticides. We hypothesize that changes in the local hydrology in response to drought, evapotranspiration, and precipitation can influence the composition and abundance of chemical species capable of attenuating pesticides. Our specific hypotheses are: 1). During periods of drought, evapotranspiration is an important driver of groundwater flow out of PPLs; 2). Extensive precipitation creates water table mounds that can reverse hydraulic gradients and cause groundwater to flow back into wetlands; 3). The biogeochemical composition of PPLs is influenced by these local and seasonally varying hydrologic processes; 4). Overland flow is capable of transporting both pesticides and other chemical constituents to PPLs; and 5). PPL pore water constituents are capable of attenuating other classes of commonly used pesticides beyond those studied in the pilot project. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Prairie pothole lakes are a critical hydrological and ecological feature of national and international importance (e.g., groundwater recharge, habitats for waterfowl and other fauna, etc.). Their unique water chemistry makes them an important means for mitigating the effects of pesticides used in this extensively farmed region. Our research could influence how these lakes are managed in the future, especially with respect to the intractable problem of nonpoint source agricultural pollution. The proposed research will support three graduate students who will be responsible for conducting the research and aiding our USGS colleagues. The students will coordinate research and sampling events between the collaborating universities and the USGS laboratories. Research results will be broadly disseminated through conferences, journal publications, and informal town hall meetings with local stakeholders. Outreach to high school students from underrepresented groups in science and engineering will occur through activities oriented non-residential summer camps. Further, we propose to recruit a high school teacher to accompany us on our sampling trips and share these experiences through electronic journals and in his/her classroom. This outreach initiative is based upon the NSF funded ARCUS TREC model.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project examines how the hydrology and biogeochemistry of wetlands and lakes in the prairie pothole region (PPR) influences their potential to degrade common pesticides.  These substances are heavily used by farmers in this part of the country and as such are found in runoff and surface water bodies.  The first stage of this research involved identifying and quantifying the naturally occurring chemicals (NOCs) present in PPR wetland sediments responsible for pesticide degradation.  We collected sediments in cores from lakes and wetlands along a topographical gradient that followed the regional hydrology of the region.  At higher elevations the water in these water bodies are fresher and contain different and fewer reactive naturally occurring chemicals, while those in low lying areas have different and significantly more substances that can naturally degrade pesticides.    The first stage of our research project involved the development of electrodes capable of quickly identifying and measuring NOCs in sediments.  The development of these electrodes is important as it allows us to conduct the measurements without disturbing the sediments.  We successfully developed these electrodes and were able to demonstrate that they worked in the field for the detection and identification of the important NOCs responsible for pesticide degradation.    The next stage of our research focused on studying one important and poorly understood NOC, dissolved organic matter (DOM).  DOM is believed to catalyze a number of important environmental reactions including the degradation of pesticides.  We studied the newest technologies for isolating DOM from the other NOCs present in sediments.  We also studied the chemical properties of DOM that are believed to be responsible for pesticide degradation, and tested it using the pesticides, chlorpyrifos and chlorpyrifos-methyl.  We found that while DOM is abundant and important the presence of high levels of sulfur in the sediments primarily drives pesticide degradation reactions.   The last aspect of our research involves studying the potential for NOCs to receive and donate electrons, a process known as oxidation-reduction or simply "redox".  These reactions are important in all wetland sediment and determine the type and amount of reactive NOCs formed.  Through the application of specially designed electrodes coupled with chemicals capable of sensing the redox properties of NOCs we were able to manipulate the redox properties of important NOCs e.g., DOM and sulfur to determine how they are able to degrade pesticides.   In summary our research demonstrated that prairie pothole lakes and wetlands are able to effectively and rapidly degrade harmful pesticides, a property of these water bodies that was not identified prior to our research.   As such we identified an ecosystem service for PPR wetlands and lakes that is as important as providing critical habitat for waterfowl and other species.  Given the intensive degree of agriculture in the region and the associated pesticides used to support these crops, PPR water bodies play a critical role in insuring good water quality and habitat protection.
