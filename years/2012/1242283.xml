<AbstractNarration>A one day workshop on "Research Directions in the &lt;br/&gt;Principles of Parallel Computing" is scheduled on June 28, 2012 at &lt;br/&gt;Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) in Pittsburgh, PA.  The workshop will &lt;br/&gt;bring together researchers from academia and industry to inform, &lt;br/&gt;discuss, and initiate collaborations on understanding the key research &lt;br/&gt;challenges in the foundations of parallel computing, and directions to &lt;br/&gt;possibly address these challenges.  The emphasis of the workshop is on &lt;br/&gt;theoretical approaches to parallel computation and how to bridge these &lt;br/&gt;approaches with practice.  It will be held the day after the ACM &lt;br/&gt;Symposium on Parallelism in Algorithms and Architectures (SPAA), which &lt;br/&gt;is to be held June 25-27, 2012 also at CMU. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The workshop will address several issues described in NSF's Advanced &lt;br/&gt;Computing Infrastructure Strategic Plan including, but not limited to, &lt;br/&gt;computational models, programming languages, rethinking the canonical &lt;br/&gt;computing "stack" and new algorithmic paradigms.  The workshop will &lt;br/&gt;consist of approximately 20 invited speakers who will be asked to &lt;br/&gt;present their thoughts on "what are three big research challenges in &lt;br/&gt;the principles of parallel computing".  Attendance to the workshop is &lt;br/&gt;open to all students, faculty and industry researchers at no charge (as &lt;br/&gt;space permits).  The output of the workshop will be a public report &lt;br/&gt;documenting the discussions.  It is hoped this report and other &lt;br/&gt;interactions at the workshop will have broad impact on future &lt;br/&gt;directions of research in the theory and practice of parallel &lt;br/&gt;computation.</AbstractNarration>
