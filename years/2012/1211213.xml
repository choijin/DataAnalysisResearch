<AbstractNarration>This is part of a collaborative project with three universities to conduct a detailed study of circumstellar gas around rapidly rotating A-type dwarf stars. An A-type main-sequence star is burning hydrogen and ais distinguished by having spectra showing strong hydrogen absoprtion lines.  Some of these A type stars also have low metal abundances in their surface layers and are sometimes referred to as "Lambda Boo" stars, after lambda Bootis, the first one to show these features.  This project will focus on observing the gas emission in order to constrain models of accretion from disk to the star and to better understand planetary formation and evolution models.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will have broader impacts of contributing to knowledge of stellar and planetary system evolution.  These institutions will also add a significant undergraduate educational component, involving students in the data acquisition, reduction, analysis, and publication of results.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Lambda Boo stars have a very peculiar mix of the chemical elements, with most elements being much less abundant than seen in the Sun, but with solar-like Carbon, Nitrogen, Oxygen, and Sulfur abundances.  The origin of this abundance pattern is still unknown.  This team of investigators from three undergraduate institutions, along with their students, carried out detailed studies of the Lambda Boo phenomenon.  Using new and archival observations, atmospheric models, and spectrum synthesis codes, they (1) critically evaluated all the criteria that had previously been used to identify Lambda Boo candidates; (2) published a new catalog of Lambda Boo stars;  (3) developed a set new quantitative diagnostics to unambiguously identify Lambda Boo stars using both observed and synthetic ultraviolet and optical spectra; (4) identified candidate Lambda Boo stars by cross-correlating existing photometric catalogs to discover new metal- weak A-type stars in an unbiased way; (5) observed those candidates with medium- resolution spectroscopy to identify the bona-fide Lambda Boo stars; (6) determined the basic stellar parameters and performed detailed abundance analyses for newly-confirmed Lambda Boo stars.    With these results, it should now be possible to discriminate between current theories explaining the Lambda Boo phenomenon and to gain valuable insights into planet formation around A-type stars.  In addition to enhancing their astrophysics education, the undergraduate students involved in this research project have developed valuable professional skills such as oral and written communication, planning, management, and the ability to function as part of a team.
