<AbstractNarration>The main objective of the proposed research is to generalize the classical theory of theta functions for Abelian varieties to polarized Calabi-Yau varieties, both open (i.e. log) and compact, more precisely: to give a canonical basis for the vector space of global sections, and a formula for the structure constants for the multiplication rule in the coordinate ring, expressed in the canonical basis, determined by counts of rational curves on the mirror. The existence of such generalized theta functions points to the existence of geometrically meaningful compactification of the moduli space, vastly generalizing the Mumford-Namikawa-Alexeev-Olsson compactificaton of A_{g,d}, and the Gelfand-Kapranov-Zelevinski-Alexeev-Olsson theory of the secondary polytope, and at the same time suggests a synthetic construction of the mirror as Proj of the canonically described ring.  The proposal includes a detailed scheme for carrying this out in dimension two, and for cluster varieties of all dimensions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main proposal is that a broad class of geometric objects, so called Calabi-Yau varieties, come with a natural system of coordinates. Informally: If you live on a Calabi-Yau variety, there should be natural, intrinsic quantities in your world, whose values determine your precise position. As these geometric objects play a fundamental role in diverse areas of mathematics, these intrinsic quantities should play a similar fundamental role. More broadly, string theory models suggest that WE live on a Calabi-Yau, and thus the proposal suggests there are such fundamental quantities, not yet understood, in our world.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Mathematicians and scientists use coordiante systems all the   time --- a system of addresses for specifying a point in space.  The  same object will usually admit infinitely many different coordinate  systems: Consider the surface of a flat table that extends  infinitely in all directions. To give a coordinate system  we draw a grid on the table. There are infinitely many different grid  systems we could draw . E.g.  take one system, and now rotate it  a bit, you get an entirely different one, there is no apparant   advantage of one over the other. What this means is that there  is no such thing as the "absolute address" of a point on the object,  E.g. there is so intrinsic  origin, or (0,0) point on our infinite table. You  can make any point (0,0) by adjusting the coordinate system.  The reason  is that the table top is completely symmetric. No one point can be  intrinsically distinguished from any other point; all the points   look the same.     The surprising  idea behind the proposal is that for a very important class of geometric  objects, so called Calabi-Yau manifolds,  the situation is exactly  the opposite of this infinite table: These objects actually come with  an intrinsic coordinate system, what the researchers call Theta Functions.  These objects are thus completely asymmetric, any two points can be  intrinsically distinguished, any two points "look different".  The idea is important because Calabi-Yaus,  and thus these intrinsic Theta functions, come up in diverse areas of  mathematics. They are potentially even interesting to physicists, because  in the string theory model, our universe itself is one of these Calabi-Yaus,  and so our world may have these as yet undiscovered and exploited  intrinsic coordinates.
