<AbstractNarration>This research aims to build a comprehensive theory of pathways to recovery following a disaster by linking pre-disaster measures of causal conditions to recovery outcomes.  Despite efforts to improve community resilience to disasters, the number and economic impact of disasters has increased each year over the past 25 years.  At the same time, little cross-case comparative research has been completed to uncover what conditions enable a community to recover after a disaster.  Understanding the causal conditions that lead to recovery is, however, fundamental to improving a community's ability to recover after a disaster.  This research seeks to transform our understanding of recovery by analyzing comparative cases using a multi-method approach.  This will enable us to determine what pre-disaster factors and recovery strategies, combined or in isolation, lead to successful post-disaster recovery.   Specifically, this research will (1) identify recovery indicators and important causal conditions for community recovery across multiple disciplines (2) measure causal conditions and recovery indicators for villages in India impacted by the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami; and (3) analyze the pathways of causal conditions that led to recovery in the case study communities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results of this study will allow community planners to prioritize and focus their efforts on the causal factors that best strengthen the community's ability to recover from a disaster.  It will also contribute to the development of a disaster recovery framework that can be expanded through future research.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Why it was important   Recent disasters have highlighted the need to better understand why communities recover differently from the same disaster.  Disasters not only devastate physical infrastructure, but also disrupt local economies and social structures. Previous studies have clearly demonstrated that there is wide variation in how well different communities recover after a disaster, with some achieving greater resilience while others become more vulnerable. To help aid community recovery following a disaster, this research first identified a set of indicators for measuring recovery, along with conditions hypothesized to influence disaster recovery, through a literature review and ratings of importance by an expert panel.  This research then analyzed what pre-disaster community conditions and post-disaster actions led to different recovery outcomes, or combinations of recovery outcomes, including risk reduction, infrastructure recovery, social recovery, and economic recovery. By doing so, the research helped to determine what combinations of pre-disaster community factors and post-disaster recovery strategies led to successful recovery, allowing agencies to better target their recovery efforts based upon community conditions.   Research method  To analyze conditions associated with recovery, the research team first determined conditions that influenced recovery and ways to measure recovery through a content analysis of literature, followed by ratings of importance by an expert panel to reach consensus.  The research team then selected twenty-six communities for study that displayed variation in recovery outcomes. Data on each community was collected through interviews, site visits, and collected documentation and analyzed to assess and calibrate pre-disaster conditions, post-disaster recovery strategies, and recovery outcomes.  Using a novel research method, fuzzy set Qualitative Comparative Analysis (fsQCA), the research team performed a cross-case comparative analysis to determine the necessity and sufficiency of various conditions, as well as combinations of causal conditions (recovery pathways), associated with economic, infrastructural, social and risk reduction outcomes. These recovery outcomes were analyzed individually (e.g., only social recovery) and in combination (e.g., social and infrastructural recovery) to determine pathways to different types of recovery.   What we found  We found that both pre- and post&shy;- disaster conditions were important for achieving recovery.  While nearly all communities achieved recovery in at least one area, very few achieved successful recovery in all four areas (infrastructure, economic, social and risk reduction).   Within communities in India, the most necessary conditions to achieve economic recovery were low social vulnerability (assessed based on caste, education and income) and strong access to government resources (as measured by the presence of a village council, presence of elected officials in the community, and good responsiveness by officials to pre&shy;-tsunami infrastructural needs). The pathway analysis demonstrated that socially vulnerable communities could achieve economic recovery if there was sufficient pre-&shy;tsunami economic diversity, which was multiple sources of employment. In communities with a single&shy; sector economy it was important to have a locally embedded recovery agency that had the local knowledge to ensure appropriate livelihood interventions.   Good coordination among reconstruction agencies and good access to government resources were necessary for infrastructural recovery. High quality pre&shy;tsunami infrastructure was sufficient, but not necessary. Oversight by the implementing agency was also important for recovery, largely due to corruption problems that arose when the agency did not oversee the contractors. Finally, community participation was not necessary for successful infrastructure recovery, but  could counteract the negative ...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
