<AbstractNarration>Our understanding of why people come together to create social networks is evolving as social media grow in complexity and popularity. Of particular interest is understanding how social networks emerge and are enacted across geography, culture and over time ? especially when they are generated by a polarizing event such as global climate change. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project, 3dWomen, will study the emergence and enactment of a network among women that has coalesced around the World Congress on Sustainable Development (CSD) that meets every ten years (1992, 2002, and will convene again in June 2012).  The 3dWomen project takes advantage of a unique opportunity for three dimensional research on the emergence of this network across time (three decades), space (global networks) and culture.  This in-depth and multidimensional research is only possible because, in response to the great sense of urgency to address the global climate crisis, the women?s caucus which will reconvene in 2012 will bring together the women from the CSD events in 1992, 2002 and 2012.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our analysis - based on interviews, archival data and social network analysis - will allow us to elucidate how different networking mechanisms at and between the CSD events, contribute to women persisting to engage in networks on specialized fields such as sustainability, science and climate change.</AbstractNarration>

Ten years later, those nations gathered again to report the progress and challenges of the agenda set ten years earlier and to define new goals. This year, at the 20th anniversary of that gathering in Rio, nations will ask again if the goals of sustainable development have been achieved (UNESC 2010). Twenty years ago, the Internet was surfacing as a major communication tool, ten years ago, cellphones and portable computers dominated the markets and today social media eclipse all other forms of communication and social action.  How will these new tools get incorporated into affecting the societal changes needed to address the sustainable development challenge?  External events, as demonstrated by the Arab Spring uprisings, can be fueled through social media but what are the actual mechanisms that help some social networks persist and mobilize into action and how can those mechanisms be used for understanding changing societal behavior across a global scale. The power of social urgency networked to produce societal behavioral change has never been tested and yet the recent ability to network across great geographic and cultural distance suggests this could be done. THis project explored the power of social networking using the decadal event of the upcoming United Nations Convention on Sustainable Development (CSD).  In addition, given our current network project Global Women Scholars Network (NSF 11-40182) that looks at how women network in relation to science careers and particularly how underrepresented women may have different types of networks, this project focused on women in the field of sustainability and climate change (where women are still under represented as scientists, policy makers, professionals. There were three core research questions addressed: (1) what roles do relationships (depth and breadth of social connections) play in leverage successful networks? (2) how do network ties (who knows who) play a role in the strength and growth of social action; (3) what elements of pre-social media networks augment or accelerate post- social media networks and what elements can make those same networks go viral?    Social networking in women associated with the sustainability movement appears quite strong where women often are united as a social group even when organziation goals or funding are not associated with women's issues.  Female leaders also represented critical nodes, where social networks often revolved around central figures, well known aceross the various organizations.  Women associated with women advoacy issues as a network and inidcated linkages among individual leaderships even when organizational goals varied.     This study demonstrated the power of social networks in the susteainability fields and raises the question on how social networks may work for the retention of other underrepresented groups in field such as conservation and ecology--disciplines associated with sustainability.  Future work on social networks and underrepresented minorities in the sciences is planned.          Last Modified: 08/17/2015       Submitted by: Gillian Bowser]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
