<AbstractNarration>Natural landscapes are being converted to urban areas at an accelerating pace, leading to concerns regarding the ability of wild populations to persist in cities. A major factor associated with urbanization is increased human-generated or anthropogenic noise, which is intense, low frequency sound originating from traffic and residential and industrial machinery. For animals that communicate with vocalizations, such as songbirds, increasing anthropogenic noise is problematic: noise overlaps vocal signals and changes how signals are transmitted through the environment, which may affect the ability of males to establish breeding territories and attract mates. Some songbirds respond to noise by flexibly changing their vocal signals, calling louder or at higher frequencies. What is not known is whether songbirds have other ways in addition to signal adjustments to minimize the negative effects of noise on vocal signaling. Through a unique collaboration between a behavioral ecologist and a noise engineer, the research will explore whether males make decisions about where to establish breeding territories, where to sing within them, and how to adjust song, all based on variation in anthropogenic noise. To answer these questions, the research will use "noise mapping" to visualize noise over time and space, and behavioral observations and noise introduction experiments to document songbird responses to noise. The detailed study of noise variation will generate new insights regarding how animals respond to noise, as it simultaneously considers multiple potential solutions to the challenge of vocal signaling in noise. The research will provide valuable interdisciplinary training for high school, undergraduate and graduate students studying ecology and engineering, public outreach through sound walks in natural and urban landscapes, and information that will improve design and value of urban parks and forests for wildlife.</AbstractNarration>

We addressed this question by examining whether male songbirds change how they sing in relation to temporal and spatial variation in human-generated or anthropogenic noise. Anthropogenic noise may overlap or mask birdsong, which may make establishing and defending breeding territories and attracting mates more difficult, thereby decreasing fitness. But if males can change how their sing to minimize masking or change where they sing from to avoid elevated noise levels, they may be able to overcome these challenges and breed successfully.</p> <p>To understand songbird responses to noise, we examined the extent to which noise varied over time and space. We developed a new noise mapping approach, which showed that sound pressure levels varied considerably over an area that approximates the size of breeding territories of many songbirds as well as the home ranges of many other small-bodied vertebrates. In prairie, forest, and urban ecosystems, sound pressure levels over a 60x60m area could differ by as much a 17 dBA, a difference that a human would perceive as about three times as loud at the low end compared to the high end of these levels. To map sound, we positioned up to 28 microphones within the sampling area to record sound pressure levels and then during mapping, we dropped input from microphones to determine the minimum number of microphones needed to accurately capture noise variation. As few as 4-8 microphones captured the variation, meaning that our noise mapping approach is a cost-effective method for understanding and visualizing how noise varies over time and space. Next, we developed an approach to distinguish between continuous and intermittent noise; these types of noise affect wildlife and humans differently, yet average noise levels are typically reported. Adapting a concept from hydrology, we produced decibel duration curves, which illustrate the frequency and magnitude of sound pressure levels over time. Across an urban study site, continuous sound pressure levels varied from 40 to more than 70 dB. Intermittent noise could be as high as 90 dB, but occurred less than 10% of the time at most locations. Continuous noise was mostly generated by buildings, whereas traffic contributed to intermittent noise. Both noise mapping and decibel duration curves permit us to better understand and visualize variation in noise within and across sites, with important implications for studying the extent to which both wildlife and humans are exposed to potentially damaging levels of noise.</p> <p>With knowledge that noise varies significantly over time and space, we then used a combination of observational and experimental approaches focusing on two common songbirds to test whether males alter the structure of their songs, select singing perches, and select habitat based on variation in noise.

Chipping sparrows also were influenced by the built environment, as the presence of sound reflective buildings and pavement also affected song structure. Finally, our work suggested that noise affects where males sing from: by experimentally introducing noise at the places male sparrows preferred to sing, we shifted males to less preferred perches and altered how they used space in noise. Our work on house wrens has found different patterns of responses to noise. Male house wrens preferentially settled in more urban than rural areas, which suggests that noise could have a more limited effect on song. Playback experiments, in which we introduced noise to singing males, showed that only males that had already attracted a mate changed how they sang in noise. An observational study on the onset of daily singing found that social factors, in particular, the number of neighboring males in area, had a stronger influence on when males began to sing each morning than did either light or noise.
