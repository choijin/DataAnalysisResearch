<AbstractNarration>This project aims at increasing the number of undergraduate students studying information assurance and pursuing careers in the field. The project is led by Pace University and collaborates with four partner colleges: State University of New York - Rockland Community College, State University of New York - Westchester Community College, City University of New York - New York City College of Technology, and City University of New York - Borough of Manhattan Community College, of which the latter two are minority serving institutions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A set of activities designed for both faculty and students fosters collaboration among the participating institutions, attracts students to study information assurance, and provides faculty with development opportunities in the information assurance area. These activities include student information assurance workshops, collaborative student/faculty research teams, a community college/university faculty collaborative working group and faculty development workshops.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is expanding the information assurance student pipeline at Pace University through outreach to community colleges. In addition, this partnership is establishing, implementing and evaluating the infrastructure needed for such pathways, and thus is providing a reference model which can be adopted by other schools. The overall impact of the project is to produce more and better prepared information assurance professionals.</AbstractNarration>
