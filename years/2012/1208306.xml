<AbstractNarration>Darwin's theory of evolution explained that millions of species are related, and dealt biologists and paleontologists the enormous challenge of discovering the branching pattern of the Tree of Life. Work on this great challenge is producing a map of species-relatedness through Earth history, and answering questions such as "what is the closest relative of a species?" and "what species make important products?" To do this scientists draw on all heritable features, including genotypes (e.g., DNA) and phenotypes (e.g., anatomy). Studying phenotypes, however, has remained complicated and slow, because it has not been revolutionized by computer science and engineering innovations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     A team of biologists, computer scientists, and paleontologists will extend and adapt methods from computer vision, machine learning, crowd-sourcing and natural language processing to enable rapid and automated study of phenotypes for the Tree of Life on a vast scale. The three-year goal is to release large phenomic datasets built using new methods, and to provide the public and scientific community with tools for future work. Planned is the training of teachers and students (kindergarten - postdoctoral levels) and the engagement of "citizen scien-tists." Enormous phenomic datasets, many with images, will fill an important public interest in biodiversity and the fossil record.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The major goal of this collaborative project that involved researchers at 11 institutions throughout the United States was to advance the pace at which phenotypic data could be collected by developing new tools in crowd sourcing, computer vision, and natural language processing.  Our team involved computer scientists as well as biologists and paleontologists who guided the development of the tools and acted as "data providers."  For our part as data providers at the American Museum of Natural History (AMNH), we drew on an existing resource at the museum &ndash; our specimen collections &ndash; and developed a "virtual museum" of images of bat skulls in three standard views that we made available for both the crowd sourcing and computer vision groups.  The photos were taken especially for this project and are currently available via the website MorphoBank as project 828.  These photos are available to the public for use and are Creative Commons licensed by-nc-sa for non-commercial use.   Why bats?  With more than 1200 species, bats represent roughly one quarter of all mammalian species and are they are exceptionally diverse &ndash; from their social behavior (solitary or gregarious) to their diets (blood feeders, fruit specialists, insect eaters, fish eaters, and more).  Our research group at the AMNH has been working to resolve bat phylogenetics and understand their evolutionary history.  The AMNH has one of the premiere bat collections in the world, but this resource is largely hidden from public view.  We sought to draw upon this extensive collection and make some of it accessible to the public in a way that was not possible until recently.  We developed a collection of images and phenotypic characters organized like a spreadsheet in rows (species) and columns (characters) with labelled images in each cell.  This data matrix is publicly available on the MorphoBank website as project 828 (http://morphobank.org/index.php/Projects/ProjectOverview/project_id/828).  The characters are features like overall skull shape, or the presence of holes (foramina) though specific bones.  Our data matrix included 34 bat species and more than 200 characters.  All characters were scored by experts and used in the crowd sourcing and computer vision research projects.  Crowd Sourcing Research: The AMNH team of data providers developed data matrices for the use of the crowd sourcing team (MorphoBank project 2315), translated the data matrix into lay person?s terms, and provided extensive feedback as the web application was developed.  The Evolution Project website is now live, allowing citizen scientists to expedite the collection of phenotypic data by matching images.  In experiments, undergraduate students were able to correctly identify the same state an expert identified more than 80% of the time.  Based on the research of the entire crowd sourcing team, we anticipate that citizen scientists will be able to make important and effective contributions to scientific research by increasing the pace of phenotypic data collection.    Computer Vision Research: The AMNH team of data providers developed special annotated matrices in MorphoBank for the use of the computer vision team (available on MorphoBank as projects 1226 and 2204), and provided extensive feedback on the software the computer vision team produced (available on GitHub at github.com/Avatol).  Using the bat skull images and matrices that our team provided, the computer vision team developed a part scoring model capable of successfully locating and identifying teeth in multiple species of bats roughly 90% of the time.   This research award to the American Museum of Natural History trained two postdoctoral students.       Last Modified: 08/18/2016       Submitted by: Andrea Cirranello]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
