<AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator: Vu, Van    &lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: DMS - 0901216 &lt;br/&gt;Institution: Rutgers University New Brunswick&lt;br/&gt;Title: Random Graphs, Random Matrices and Subset sums&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI is going to work on several basic problems concerning random graphs and random matrices. For example, as far as random graphs are concerned, he will be focusing on the problem of finding sharp thresholds for the existence of factors in random graphs and hypergraphs, a special case of which is  the sharp version of Shamir's conjecture on perfect matching in random hypergraphs. He will also study expansion in random lifts and the sandwiching conjecture concerning Erd\"os-R\'enyi random graphs and random regular graphs. For random matrices, he proposes to study many problems concerning random Bernoulli matrices, such as probability of singularity, distributions of determinants and permanents, and properties of eigenvalues and eigenvectors. Several of these problems have strong connection to problems in theoretical computer science. The PI will also continue his study of structural theorems in additive combinatorics, in particular those which have strong links to other fields, such as number theory and probability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For a long time, randomness has been used by scientists to model huge and difficult structures that occur in nature. One famous example is Wigner's use of the spectra of random matrices to model energy levels of atoms.  Another is the use of random graphs to model real life graphs such as the Internet. The PI plan is to make a systematic study of random matrices and random graphs, together with some problems in number theory, which, quite surprisingly, have turned out to be related. He strongly  believes  that a systematic study of the proposed problems will eventually lead to the developments of new ideas and tools, which can be useful in many other topics, and to a deeper understanding of the relations between various fields of mathematics.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  The focus of my research has been Additive and Probabilistic Combinatorics, together with the relations betweenthem and other fields of mathematics.  The key idea in these research areas is to use combinatorial tools to tackle classical problems in number theory and probability. In this project, we have achieved considerable success.      In the last 5 years, I have been developing a theory for anti-concentration inequalities. The goal of this is to bound the probability that a random variable taking values in a small interval, with representative examples being the classical theorems of Berry-Esseen, Littlewood-Offord and Kolmogorov-Rogozin. With Terence Tao and other co-authors, we have considerably strengthened these classical results, with a completely new viewpoint and    method, using combinatorial ideas. This development has led to a considerable set of new results  with various  applications  in many areas of mathematics, and also opened several new lines of research.   The study of anti-concentration inequalities is  related to the study of subsetsums in number theory.  In this area, I and coauthors have settled several  long standing questions. For example, we gave a near optimal  answer for a question of Erd\"os (from 1982) on a density of square-free sets (sets where no subset sums up to a square),    I have also been working heavily on random matrices,   with focus on the  Bernoulli model,  where the entries  are iid  sign random variables.  I study the distributions of the eigenvalues (both global and local) and eigenvectors.  In particular, we managed to compute the limiting distribution of each individual eigenvalue (or the joint distribution of several eigenvalues)  of random symmetric (or hermitian) matrices under  rather general assumptions, making significant progress on some  central questions in random matrix theory such as Mehta's conjecture, dated back to the 1960s.    For non-symmetric matrices, we have settled an open question (raised by Golstein-von Neumann, Edelman, and Spielman-Teng in different contexts )   concerning the distribution of the least singular value,  a quantity which plays an essential role in numerical analysis.  For the non-symmetric model, we have determined the limiting distribution of  the determinant, finishing  another long-standing question.      The studies of random matrices not only answer long standing and basic open questions in the field, but also provide a number of new tools, which appear useful in applications in big data analysis. One example is the use of the perturbation method in finding clusters in a large, random like, networks.                 Last Modified: 07/11/2015       Submitted by: Van Vu]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
