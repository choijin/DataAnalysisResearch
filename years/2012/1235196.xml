<AbstractNarration>This project will pursue research towards an advanced framework for nonlinear stability analysis of thin-walled structures taking into account the uncertainty associated with geometric imperfections. Thin-walled structures most commonly fail in buckling failure mode. Whether this buckling is benign or catastrophic depends, to a great extent, on the details of the structure, most importantly its geometric imperfections.   The research aims at providing a leap towards uncertainty quantification and model validation in the analysis of thin-walled structures by devising a probabilistic paradigm that uses advanced uncertainty quantification techniques along with novel structural analysis methods. Methodologies for the characterization and representation of geometric uncertainties as well as probabilistic imperfection sensitivity analysis frameworks are proposed that have the potential to pave the way for a fully stochastic nonlinear analysis of thin-walled structures. The proposed techniques are complemented by experimental measurements of imperfections with high accuracy, and testing of imperfect members.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the results of this research will transform how geometric imperfections are handled in advanced analysis-based design of thin-walled structures. Because of the very general and mathematics-driven nature of the stochastic approaches adopted in this project, the methodologies developed will be applicable to a wide variety of problems and will have potential impact across all science and engineering disciplines. Alongside graduate student mentoring, undergraduate research will be a focus of the efforts at both University of Massachusetts Dartmouth (UMD) and Johns Hopkins University (JHU). The involved undergraduates will be asked to share their experience with students at local high schools and a community college as well as students attending Freshman Summer Institute at UMD, in hopes that their success will be emulated by others. Also, in collaboration with programs that specifically target underrepresented groups, qualified students are invited to participate in research at both universities. In addition to academic dissemination through conferences and papers and providing all developed work as open source, the PIs will capitalize on their involvement in engineering committees (e.g. AISC, AISI etc.) to disseminate the findings outside of the academic community.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Structures: buildings, bridges, towers, tanks, etc. form the backbone of the physical infrastructure that society relies upon. Structures use large quantities of physical resources, so it is highly desirable to minimize materials in structural applications &ndash; a natural result of this desire is the creation of thin-walled structures. The use of "thin walls" results in more complex behavior that must be understood and predicted by the design engineer. For civil engineering structural design, in the past, prescriptive rules and broad safety factors were applied to such thin-walled structures resulting in successful but still relatively inefficient designs. Today, models and analysis are used with greater sophistication, but challenges have still arisen. In particular, the strength of thin-walled structures is sensitive to small changes in geometry (waviness in plates, out-of-straightness in members, etc.), known as geometric imperfections. A great variety of potential geometric imperfections exist, and the sensitivity to particular imperfections is widely varying in thin-walled structures.  To fully reap the benefits of thin-walled structures a more probabilistic approach is needed for analysis and strength prediction, and this requires a sophisticated understanding and characterization of the imperfections that impact their design. These tasks were the focus of this project. Thin-walled cold-formed steel members (thickness ~ 1mm, plate widths from 10 to 500 mm, lengths from 1 to 3 m) were used as the initial archetypes for study. A laser-based scanning rig was constructed such that full 3D models could be re-created from 1000?s of measurement points on cold-formed steel members. The measurements provide complete statistics on all dimensions of the member, and field information, e.g., on the waviness of the plates that make up the members. The measurements provide complete realizations of the actual geometric imperfections. The results have been shared with industry and are today forming the basis for improved engineering guidelines on modeling cold-formed steel members.
