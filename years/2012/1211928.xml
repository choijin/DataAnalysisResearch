<AbstractNarration>Carmona&lt;br/&gt;DMS-1211928&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The mathematical core of the project is the study of approximate equilibriums for stochastic differential games with a large number of players.  The first challenge is to initiate the probabilistic approach to the mean-field game paradigm originally advocated by Lasry and Lions.  As a natural extension, the investigator develops the theoretical and practical tools needed for the optimal control of stochastic differential equations of McKean-Vlasov type, a problem that has not been studied despite the importance of its applications to the understanding of the behavior of large populations.  The investigator develops a form of the Pontryagin maximum principle appropriate for these mean-field dynamics, derives the systems of mean-field Forward-Backward Stochastic Differential Equations arising from specifically crafted adjoint processes, and provides existence results for these new types of equations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The project is motivated by the dramatic societal impacts of changes in the production and prices of commodities observed in the last few years.  The increase in the number of institutions investing in commodities has changed the behavior of the prices of these commodities, and their relationships among themselves and with equity prices.  Moreover, the use of market mechanisms to curb emissions of greenhouse gases in the hope of controlling climate change has also affected some of these markets.  The investigator focuses on new theoretical problems motivated by the energy and emissions markets, and aims at the development of tools to help risk managers, regulators, and policy makers handle the challenges of these new markets.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The motivation for the research program covered by the proposal was rooted in the following three basic facts:  1) dramatic changes in the production of commodities have been observed in the last few years;  2) prices of these commodities have become a source of concern because of their wild fluctuations and the increased dependencies among themselves;  3) the production of energy and agricultural commodities proved to be tightly connected to climate change and regulation attempts to curb emissions of Green House Gases (GHGs).  As a result, these facts were the starting points of several research articles and a couple of book chapters devoted by the PI to structural models for the valuation of energy commodities and assets, and an evidence based introduction to the financialization of commodities.  Regulation issues are central to the mathematical models used to describe the modern commodity markets, especially since the introduction of market mechanisms to control GHG emissions. Accordingly, the PI developed material for an undergraduate course on the mathematics of commodity and energy markets. This course is taught at Princeton. It is attended by students from the Princeton Environmental Institute (PEI), the department of Operations Research and Financial Engineering (ORFE), the Bendheim Center for Finance (BCF) and the Woodrow Wilson School (WWS) of Public Policy and International Affairs.  Regulation and policy design need to take into account the behavior of large populations of agents minimizing their own costs and maximizing their profits. The mathematical challenge is to understand how a large population of rational agents optimizing their own selfish bottom lines can coexist in a stable global economy. Motivated by the applications described above, the core of the proposal was the study of equilibria for stochastic differential games with a large number of participants.  In preparation for this type of research (for which little or no textbook exist), the PI taught a graduate course and wrote lecture notes which were published as a book by the Society of Industrial and Applied Mathematics (SIAM) on the theory of Forward Backward Stochastic Differential Equations (FBSDEs) and its applications to stochastic control and stochastic differential games.  The search for equilibria of large systems of interacting agents is the purpose of the theory of mean field games as introduced around 2005 by a couple of mathematicians in Paris and three electrical engineers in Canada.  The first challenge identified in the proposal was to put on a firm ground the approach to mean field games originally advocated by Lasry and Lions in 2006. In a series of original papers written in collaboration with F. Delarue and a couple of PhD students, the PI introduced and developed what is now known as the probabilistic approach to mean field games.  Beyond mentoring postdocs, and advising graduate and undergraduate students at Princeton University, the PI promoted education in probability and research in applications of stochastic analysis through a large number of invited lectures and the organization of conferences, summer schools and long programs in NSF institutes.
