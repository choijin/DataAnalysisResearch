<AbstractNarration>This action funds Marcus Welker of Dartmouth College to conduct a research project, entitled "Restoration of Lake Champlain Atlantic salmon: A study of river and hatchery amino acids," during the summer of 2012 at Hokkaido University in Sapporo, Japan. The host scientist is Dr. Hiroshi Ueda.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Intellectual Merit of the research project is to understand the spatial and temporal variability of amino acids in river and hatchery waters - two key pieces of the Lake Champlain Atlantic salmon restoration systems. Amino acids are one of the key odorants responsible for the migratory and homing abilities of salmonids, however due to their economic and water quality insignificance, very little research has been conducted on their presence and concentrations in salmon streams.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.  These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.</AbstractNarration>
