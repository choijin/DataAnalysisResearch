<AbstractNarration>The Antarctic Automatic Weather Station (AAWS) network, first commenced in 1978, is the most extensive ground meteorological network in the Antarctic, approaching its 30th year at several of its installations. Its prime focus as a long term observational record is to measure the near surface weather and climatology of the Antarctic atmosphere. AWS sites measure air-temperature, pressure, wind speed and direction at a nominal surface height of 3m. Other parameters such as relative humidity and snow accumulation may also be measured. Observational data from the AWS are collected via the DCS Argos system aboard either NOAA or MetOp polar orbiting satellites and thus made available in near real time to operational and synoptic weather forecasters. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The surface observations from the AAWS network are important records for recent climate change and meteorological processes. The surface observations from the AAWS network are also used operationally, and in the planning of field work. The surface observations from the AAWS network have been used to check on satellite and remote sensing observations.</AbstractNarration>

Several AWS sites have been removed that are no longer a part of any current research efforts, or no longer used by forecast operations. Additionally, the first climatology study of the Ross Ice Shelf was compiled using exclusively AWS observations.&nbsp; Findings from the study found statistically significant, albeit slight, warming at one AWS site on the western side of the ice shelf (an increase of +0.09+/-0.06&deg;C or +0.16+/-0.11&deg;F over 28 years) and one site that had one of the coldest potential temperature observations ever made (209.3K or -82.9&deg;F). Several other studies have utilized the AWS observations by those involved in the project as well as those outside the project.&nbsp; Some examples include verification of numerical model reanalysis, characterizing the annual state of the Antarctic climate, and study of extreme wind events in the Ross Island region.

This dataset has been used in comparison with numerical weather prediction models to determine areas of improvement as well as areas of model strength. It has also been used to study characteristics of&nbsp;the modern-day boundary layer climate and sensible and latent heat fluxes, contributing to further understanding the weather regimes in this area.</p> <p>For these observations to be of value for science investigations, quality control of the observations is conducted on an on-going basis.

Our scientific work has been both published in peer-reviewed journals as well as presented at regional, national and international scientific conferences and workshops.  Educational outreach is an important aspect of this project.  Several hundred students tour the University of Wisconsin-Madison, home of the AWS project, and dozens of classrooms have been visited over the life of the project.  Outreach to the public has also included speaking to service organizations, having a display booth at local and regional events (e.g., Wisconsin State Fair, local severe weather seminars, etc.), and reaching out to the larger audience via our blog and social media presence. Also, a presentation has been given on this project and aired over the local public television station network across Wisconsin.
