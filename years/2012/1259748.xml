<AbstractNarration>This project is continuing the successful S-STEM scholarship program at the university that is increasing the number of students pursuing a computer science major by offering substantial scholarship support. The program places special emphasis on recruiting and retaining underrepresented groups such as women and Hispanics, building on the infrastructure already in place at the university. It also builds on the work of the Department of Computing Sciences that has involved faculty members and students in international conferences, internships, and exchanges. The project integrates the significant academic and financial student support at the university with NSF support for outstanding, financially needy students. It continues the professional development seminar for its participants (and any other majors who want to participate), incorporates aspects of Team Work in Several Time Zones (TWISTZ), and addresses the role and power of computing in the global marketplace. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The project integrates the professional development seminar with the offering of sixteen $8000 NSF-funded scholarships per year to full-time undergraduate computer science majors who have demonstrated financial need and strong academic records. The seminar uses state-of-the-art programs and peer effects to encourage all S-STEM scholars to develop good study habits, to learn how to survey the ongoing advancement of computer science, and to develop critical thinking skills. In addition to career counseling, scholars are being encouraged to participate in funded undergraduate research projects whose project teams are spread across time zones and address needs beyond the U. S. borders. Of particular interest are projects associated with Ethicomp, the international computing ethics community, and the virtual reality tours that the department has created for the Vatican Museum. The university has been ranked by US News and World Reports as the number one regional university in the North for almost two decades.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The project is developing a culture that can attract, nurture, and support underrepresented students through its connection with the Multicultural Affairs Office at the university. It includes vital cross-cultural aspects into the world view of computing for students. Over the course of the project, about 20 undergraduates are receiving financial and academic support to become strong computer science graduates. Another 40 students participate in the enrichment seminar and international experiences.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project had the goal of producing well-educated computer science majors from diverse backgrounds, by (1) providing scholarship support to students with demonstrated financial need; (2) developing and delivering a weekly enrichment seminar for both scholarship recipients and computer science majors in general; (3) providing travel support to scholarship recipients for attending conferences to present papers/posters and to listen to senior members of the computing disciplines discuss their work.    The seminar provided peer support, faculty mentoring, and computer science exploration activities, including a "creative thinking in computing" activity.  In this activity, students were asked to create a grant proposal, a scholarship application, a contest entry, or some other document that requires them to think deeply about some aspect of computing and their role in it.  Examples of projects that students developed include: summer internships at SAP, Vanguard, and Lockheed, leadership of an elementary school project to bring computing expertise to an inner city Philadelphia school, and participation in "women in computing" conferences. An innovation of the seminar was to include students from freshmen through senior year in the same meeting period to help youger students learn from the self-reported experiences of older students in their efforts to get internships, apply for jobs, or handle demands of various courses on the way to graduating.  The project had the following outcomes:   44 students were funded from Spring 2013 through Spring 2017, divided by graduating class as follows. Only two of the 44 students transferred out of computer science. The remainder have either graduated with a computer science major or on track to graduate in a near-future class. Class of ?13: 5; Class of ?14: 6; Class of ?15: 4; Class of ?16: 6; Class of ?17: 5; Class of ?18: 6; Class of ?19: 3; Class of ?20: 7. 13 of the 44 scholarship recipients were women. 11 students chose to study abroad As of last report (includes the classes of 2014-2017), 23 funded students report employment at 20 major national firms.
