<AbstractNarration>This project is increasing grade 4-8 student learning of science concepts, as well as mathematical concepts related to data analysis and measurement, by using an engineering design-based approach to teacher professional development and curricular development. The partnership involves the University of Minnesota's Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics Education Center and the Center for Compact and Efficient Fluid Power (CCEFP), the Saint Paul Public Schools, the North Saint Paul-Maplewood-Oakdale School District, and the South Washington County Schools. These three school districts are contiguous, and represent schools that are inner city, urban, and suburban. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is helping 200 teachers develop engineering design curricular units for each of the major science topic areas within the Minnesota State Academic Science Standards for grades 4-8 with a focus on vertical alignment and transition from upper elementary to middle-level, impacting 15,000 students over the life of the grant. The partnership is using summer professional development and curriculum writing workshops, paired with a cognitive coaching model, to allow teachers to design engineering design-based curricular units focused on science concepts, meaningful data analysis, and measurement. These curricular units are going through an extensive design research cycle to ensure a quality product and then will be submitted to TeachEngineering (teachengineering.org), an online peer-reviewed digital library, for use across the United States and beyond. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Measurable outcomes of the EngrTEAMS project are to:&lt;br/&gt;     - Increase student mastery of grade-level standards in science and data analysis/measurement.&lt;br/&gt;     - Increase student understanding of engineering and engineering design. &lt;br/&gt;     - Promote a coherent transition between intermediate and middle school science learning through aligning the curricula for developmentally appropriate learning of concepts and aligning the pedagogies for research-based learning opportunities for students.&lt;br/&gt;     - Develop a more effective and sustainable coaching model to support teachers in science classrooms.&lt;br/&gt;     - Promote curricular design that allows content to be taught more meaningfully in the same or less time as more standard ways of approaching the teaching of science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is advancing understanding about engineering design-based pedagogies and cognitive coaching models in science and the impacts of those on 4th-8th grade students' achievement in mathematics, science and critical thinking abilities. It is enhancing the student learning in and attitudes towards STEM fields. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project partners' student population is diverse. Many of the Saint Paul School District's students come from immigrant or refugee families and 45% live in homes in which English is not the first language spoken. Because the teachers who teach in high-needs schools will implement the curriculum modules, this project is documenting the learning outcomes of underrepresented populations when presented with curriculum modules. The research findings are providing directions for designing effective curriculum and learning of STEM. The dissemination of the curriculum modules on peer-reviewed websites and the findings of the research studies are informing practitioners, administrators, researchers, and policy makers who aim to improve student achievement and interest in STEM careers.</AbstractNarration>

The partner school districts were chosen because they are contiguous and represent schools that are inner city, urban, and suburban. Over the course of the project, other school districts were added at the level of participant entities, including Minneapolis Public Schools. A sixth partner is the ECSU/GRO Leadership Council, who provided research-based professional development and technical assistance and management. This group is made up of the leadership from two organizations: the Metro Educational Cooperative Service Unit and the Grants and Research Office of Intermediate District 287 and Northeast Metro 916. Together these partners explored the overarching research question: <em>What are the effects of engineering design pedagogies and curricula combined with a coaching model on student learning in science, data analysis, measurement, and critical thinking?</em></p> <p>This project partnered with approximately 125 teachers over 5 years to develop engineering design-based STEM integration curricular units that included physical, earth, and life sciences as well as measurement and data analysis for grades 4-8. &nbsp;The curriculum development was created in 2 phases. For the first 3 years, project teachers, called EngrTEAMS Fellows, worked in teams with support from coaches to develop first drafts of the curricula. The did this through intensive summer professional development with year long coaching. Through this, approximately 50 units were drafted and implemented in the Fellows classrooms. Thirteen of these units were then identified for further study and editing.

In particular, there was a strong research focus on student learning through design with evidence-based reasoning, teacher coaching, and curriculum development. Findings from each area include: (1) The EngrTEAMS curricular model supported students use of unit-based STEM content and beyond as they worked to use evidence to justify their design ideas and design decisions. Students employed a variety of modes of thinking as they engaged in design conversations in integrated STEM units. While students planned their initial design, they employed cognitive memory, divergent thinking, and evaluative thinking. As the engineering integration was made more explicit and students encouraged to justify their design solutions, they were involved in more productive and academic discussions.&nbsp; (2) The on-going support of teachers following the summer professional development was critical to teachers' development of STEM pedagogical design capacity. Coaches played a critical role in this work through the use of protocols that supported teacher reflection on their implementation of STEM. (3). Facets of the curricular units that made them successful were high-quality context, engineering challenge, science integration, instructional/pedagogical strategies, teamwork, assessment, and organization. Furthermore, units that integrated the engineering right from the beginning and continued to tie back to the challenge throughout the unit had better results with student engagement and learning, as well as teacher satisfaction.</p> <p><strong>Intellectual Merit: </strong>This project advanced understanding about engineering design-based pedagogies and coaching models in science and the impacts of those on 4<sup>th</sup>-8<sup>th</sup> grade students' learning. The longer term professional development strategies employed by the EngrTEAMS project had great impact on teachers in the classroom and ultimately their students.
