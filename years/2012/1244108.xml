<AbstractNarration>Oxygen-producing photosynthetic bacteria, known as cyanobacteria, have many properties that make them excellent candidates for the production of green fuels and chemicals. They require few nutrient inputs, can grow in water that is of poor quality for drinking or farming, and can easily be manipulated through genetic engineering. The cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus PCC7942 has already been successfully engineered to produce a number of useful chemicals such as alcohols and oils. However, first generation strategies to genetically engineer cyanobacteria resulted in only modest chemical production rates, and did not consider how these rates would be affected by growing bacteria outdoors in a day/night cycle. More effective engineering of cyanobacteria for industrial purposes requires basic research that addresses how these bacteria integrate information related to conditions in the external environment and timing programs inside their cells to make decisions on when to run various aspects of their metabolism. This project will utilize Synechococcus elongatus PCC7942 as a model to address three questions: (1) When Synechococcus transitions from being in light to darkness, is there a specific signaling pathway that detects this change and alters the organism's gene expression and metabolism? (2) Does the internal circadian clock of Synechococcus influence the decision of whether to use carbon immediately for growth or to store it for later use? and (3) How does the cell integrate external environmental signals and internal circadian clock information to subsequently exert control over metabolism? Better understanding of these signaling networks will both expand basic understanding of how cyanobacteria control their metabolism and facilitate more effective genetic engineering efforts that take into account how the bacteria will respond to modifications and external environmental conditions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will answer basic scientific questions about when and how carbon is utilized and stored in a model cyanobacterial system; such information has been essential in the successful engineering of non-photosynthetic bacteria such as Escherichia coli. In doing so this project will enable the engineering of photosynthetic microorganisms to produce fuel and industrial chemicals, decreasing dependence on petroleum for these products. Success in the biofuels arena will improve environmental sustainability through the development of carbon neutral fuels, and produce a new domestic fuel source that will strengthen economic and homeland security. This project will generate genetic tools, strains, and network map data that will be made available to the biofuels research community. Further, many of these tools and strains will be of interest to biotechnology companies for direct commercialization. The project will directly train two doctoral graduate students and a number of undergraduate students in systems biology, a growing field with a need for trained personnel. In turn the doctoral students will utilize knowledge and actual data gleaned from this project as a teaching tool in a local bioenergy certificate program known as EDGE (Educating and Developing workers for the Green Economy). Graduates of this program have actively and successfully contributed to the growing green biotechnology industry of San Diego.</AbstractNarration>

This understanding is important because the ability to use light-driven organisms to create useful products, such as replacements for petroleum-based chemicals, requires knowing how and when the reactions occur that build them. This research project used a cyanobacterium, or blue-green alga, that many labs and companies are testing as a potential source of &ldquo;green&rdquo; chemicals. Most experiments conducted previously to understand the circadian clock in this organism, called <em>Synechococcus elongatus</em>, have grown the cells only in continuous light; this approach helps to separate changes in cell function that are controlled by the clock from those that are turned on and off by the light. However, to take advantage of natural solar energy for photosynthesis, cells are likely to be grown outdoors, where their metabolism in day-night conditions would be influenced both by the cells&rsquo; internal circadian clock and external cues of light and darkness. In addition, past work has focused on the activity of genes, and has not examined changes in chemicals in the cell, which provide a more direct measure of the reactions that make them. This work compared the unaltered microbe and mutants that have defective clocks to determine how chemicals change in the cells over time in a day-night cycle. Experiments showed that energy is stored in cells with a repeating daily pattern, and that the circadian clock can cause this pattern even in continuous light. A day-night cycle can also generate the pattern without a clock. However, only when both the clock and the day-night cycle are present does energy storage and use occur at the right times of day. In the absence of the clock the cells continue night-time metabolism when they enter the light, which causes them to start storing energy right away when they should be using their surplus of light-driven energy to build complex chemicals necessary for their well-being. The work also showed that a particular set of chemical reactions is needed to enable the cells to survive a period of darkness. That set of reactions generates a chemical that can rescue the cell from a harmful oxidation process, akin to rusting, which causes cellular damage. These experiments explained why some mutants that lack specific parts related to the clock live well in continuous light, when photosynthesis can manufacture this anti-oxidant, but die in a day-night cycle. Within a few hours of darkness, they succumb to oxidative damage. The data pointed to genes that are important to consider when engineering cells to make a desired product. A new approach enabled the monitoring of hundreds of thousands of different cells, each missing a different gene, to determine which genes are absolutely essential for the cell to survive. This knowledge facilitated an improved computer simulation of metabolism, publicly available to scientists in industry and universities, which can be used to guide predictions about how to engineer the cells to make different products, and that may aid research on plants and algae as well.

This molecule was recently discovered in some other bacteria, including bacteria that cause disease. However, in other species, the synthesis of the molecule is essential for the cells to live, which means it is not possible to study the effect of loss of cyclic di-AMP to understand its role.
