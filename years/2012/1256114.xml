<AbstractNarration>The proper regulation of gene expression is critical for the normal development and function of the nervous system. "Chromatin remodeling", or the alteration of DNA structure, is a key step in gene regulation and is an important process in nervous system development and function. In mammals, the amino acid glutamate mediates the majority of signaling in the nervous system, and regulates processes that underlie learning, memory, and neurodegeneration. Factors that control the development and function of glutamatergic neurons (neurons that use glutamate) are of considerable and broad interest. Yet, these factors are largely unknown. The objective of this project is to better understand the function of the chromatin remodeling protein Kismet in the development and function of glutamatergic neurons. This proposal will utilize both genetics and molecular biology to accomplish this goal. This project will determine which signals activate Kismet, and subsequently, which genes Kismet activates in glutamatergic neurons to regulate their function. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this project are manifold. First, though these studies are particular to Kismet function in glutamatergic neurons, the results from this research will help us understand how chromatin remodeling factors regulate the function of other cells as well. Second, this project will provide research opportunities for undergraduate students to perform directed research in the Marenda laboratory. Third, this award will support a hybrid class for undergraduate students that will addresses a significant problem in multiple universities: accommodating the large number of undergraduate students who want to participate in undergraduate research, but can not due to limited faculty to student ratios. Importantly, the outcome of this hybrid class is assessed through pre- and post-class surveys. Therefore, this project not only addresses important questions in neural development, but also addresses important concerns in science education and training.</AbstractNarration>
