<AbstractNarration>This EAGER WIDER project, Championing Educational Change through Assessment for the Next Generation of Engineers' Success (CHANGES), is engaged in a comprehensive evaluation of the extent of implementation of evidence-based instructional practices and the factors that influence them in the Fulton Engineering Schools at Arizona State University (ASU). A web-enabled assessment framework and other processes are being utilized to generate information that will inform planning and provide input data for a project that will focus on facilitating systemic change. A major emphasis is on courses and faculty teaching them for lower division students.  The primary focus is on core engineering, and general education and foundational courses in mathematics, chemistry and physics.  Remaining engineering faculty are being included along with an upper division course they teach. The interactions among and between faculty in the project are intended to initiate a dialogue about reform and could act as a catalyst and a way increasing buy-in for systemic change. The data, evaluation, and recommendations from this project will be used to plan for reform.</AbstractNarration>

Chief among these is concern about students&rsquo; sense of belonging in that: 1) students make connections with faculty in their chosen field; and 2) students make connections with other students. STEM coursework has been shown to turn off students because faculty seem unresponsive and uncaring for freshmen as individuals. Large class sizes and course assignment practices contribute to this phenomenon. Students more often receive poor grades in STEM courses in their first two years than other fields, and they tend to drop out of engineering at a higher rate than other majors. Student learning and enculturation was related to <em>evidence-based practices</em> with factors at multiple levels.</p> <p>As such, these multi-level factors need to work in concert to support students&rsquo; continuing success and engagement in engineering as a discipline. Specifically, we studied the impact of these factors and their interactions, as related to <em>evidence-based-practices</em>,<em> </em>that occur in a system with influencing effects occurring with five factors. The factors include: 1) Faculty Beliefs and Attitudes; 2) Classroom Effects; 3) Co-curricular Experiences; 4) Departmental Culture; and 5) Interdepartmental Coordination and Interaction. Our goal was to understand the effect of each variable's possible interaction on the others <em>towards the improvement of the system and its impact</em><strong> </strong>on student motivation, achievement, and retention. Thus, the impact on student success of future innovative interventions with any factor could be tracked by the system.</p> <p>From this research, we discovered that 85% of all freshmen that left engineering did so within the first two years, meaning that the effect of student interventions can be evaluated after only two years rather than four. We also found that specific evidence-based retention interventions that increased the two-year retention and retention rate from 50% and a 1.1% rate in 2007 to 58% and a 1.9% rate in 2011. The interventions included a three-day freshman camp, opening a tutoring center, Initiating undergraduate peer teaching assistants for lower level classes, and starting an undergraduate research initiative. These actions helped foster student-student and student-faculty interactions and also supported student learning. In terms of classroom performance, we found that a major factor in retention was the grade a student receives in their first math course can determine whether or not the student continues in engineering. An A or a B in a student's first math course, regardless of course level, was found to be 6.5 times more likely to continue in engineering than a student receiving a C, D, E, or W. Thus, there needs to be discussion between engineering and math instructors to develop more effective teaching strategies for lower level math courses.</p> <p>Another important outcome was quantitative evaluation of the impact of instructor beliefs and classroom practice on student achievement. Emergent theme (ET) analysis of a guided interview and the Approaches to Teaching Inventory (ATI) were used to measure instructors&rsquo; extent of student-focused vs. teacher-focused beliefs. Then, the Reformed Teaching Observational Protocol (RTOP) was used to measure the extent of student-focused instruction observable in their classrooms. Social network analysis (SNA) was used to determine the social connectivity of faculty within and between disciplines. It was found that faculty who were better socially connected to one another implemented EBIP at higher rates as shown from higher RTOP scores. The instructors with higher RTOP scores had ATI and interview results that were more student-focused than instructor-focused. They also had significantly lower student failure rates (grades of D or E) and their students showed higher achievement with higher ratios of A, B and C to D and E. Overall, this study demonstrated that increased EBIP increased student achievement while retention can be increased through student-student and student-faculty interactions with increased EBIP and student support experiences. Thus, there is need for professional development for instructors that incorporate social connectivity and EBIP training to support positive student learning outcomes and better retention. This is being done with a new NSF IUSE faculty development project that will be training 84 engineering instructors in seven disciplines over the next four years.&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 12/01/2016<br>      Modified by: Stephen&nbsp;J&nbsp;Krause</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
