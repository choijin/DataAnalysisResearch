<AbstractNarration>This CPS Frontiers project addresses highly dynamic Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs), understood as systems where a computing delay of a few milliseconds or an incorrectly computed response to a disturbance can lead to catastrophic consequences.  Such is the case of cars losing traction when cornering at high speed, unmanned air vehicles performing critical maneuvers such as landing, or disaster and rescue response bipedal robots rushing through the rubble to collect information or save human lives.  The preceding examples currently share a common element: the design of their control software is made possible by extensive experience, laborious testing and fine tuning of parameters, and yet, the resulting closed-loop system has no formal guarantees of meeting specifications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The vision of the project is to provide a methodology that allows for complex and dynamic CPSs to meet real-world requirements in an efficient and robust way through the formal synthesis of control software. The research is developing a formal framework for correct-by-construction control software synthesis for highly dynamic CPSs with broad applications to automotive safety systems, prostheses, exoskeletons, aerospace systems, manufacturing, and legged robotics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The design methodology developed here will improve the competitiveness of segments of industry that require a tight integration between hardware and highly advanced control software such as: automotive (dynamic stability and control), aerospace (UAVs), medical (prosthetics, orthotics, and exoskeleton design) and robotics (legged locomotion). To enhance the impact of these efforts, the PIs are developing interdisciplinary teaching materials to be made freely available and disseminating their work to a broad audience.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This CPS Frontiers project addressed highly dynamic Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs), understood as systems where a computing delay of a few milliseconds or an incorrectly computed response to a disturbance could lead to catastrophic consequences. We found inspiration in challenging problems arising in bipedal locomotion and automotive driver assist systems where the design of their control software had relied extensively on experience, laborious testing, and fine tuning of parameters, and for which the resulting closed-loop systems had no formal guarantees of meeting safety specifications.  The vision of the project was to develop new methodologies that allow for complex and dynamic CPSs to meet real-world requirements in an efficient and robust way through the formal synthesis of control software. The research developed the following new tools for formal correct-by-construction control software synthesis:  ?     Three forms of control barrier functions (reciprocal, zeroing, and polygonal) that when married with an online quadratic program provide safety guarantees always, while meeting performance objectives when they did not conflict with safety. These methods are compatible with legacy software.  ?     Three methods for addressing modularity and composition of control specifications: passivity indices, ranking functions, and robust invariance.   ?     Three new methods for attacking the so-called "curse of Dimensionality" in correct by construction control methods: A new temporal logic based on counting specifications, that is, control problems that must keep track of the number of agents that are attending to a plurality of tasks; satisfiability modulo convex optimization which treats specifications of large size that can be cast as a disjunction of convex constraints; and a theoretically sound manner to combine tools from machine learning with trajectory optimization.  ?     Two methods were developed for designing controllers on the basis of data. One focused on system identification. It uses both additive and multiplicative uncertainty models and formulates a robust optimization method to choose a model that is the least conservative for the design of correct-by-construction controllers. A second method designs a model-free controller for which it is possible to formally prove the existence of a sufficiently high sampling rate ensuring that controllers solving output regulation and tracking problems for the approximate linear model also solve the same problems for the true and unknown nonlinear model.   ?     The theoretical results were complemented with numerical tools and many concrete examples.      Broader Impacts  The design methodologies developed herein improve the competitiveness of segments of industry that require a tight integration between hardware and highly advanced control software such as: automotive (dynamic stability and control), aerospace (UAVs), medical (prosthetics, orthotics, and exoskeleton design) and robotics (legged locomotion). The PIs collaborated with colleagues at Ford Motor Company, Toyota Motor Company, Magna Corporation, Eaton Corporation, and Wandercraft to ensure the results were well grounded in engineering practice.   The PIs created a website (https://www.dyncps.org/)  where the public can freely access the results of this work. In fact, all of the results from this project have been developed in an open-source environment. Specifically, all IP has been placed in the public domain: none of it is protected by patents.  In the course of this work, the PIs trained 19 PhD students and five post-docs.                 Last Modified: 05/03/2018       Submitted by: Paulo Tabuada]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
