<AbstractNarration>Internet Scout, a research center at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, worked with the ATE community to create ATE Central (atecentral.net). The resulting web portal and set of tools, services, and publications are designed to support the community and showcase the depth and breadth of the ATE program. ATE Central includes a large searchable collection of ATE-created curricula, learning objects, web sites, and media, a comprehensive database of project and center information, and services and tools that leverage this data to serve and promote the ATE community. To further the overall goals and objectives of ATE Central, this proposal aims to develop additional innovative tools, services, and solutions in response to needs articulated by the community. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Innovative mobile apps and widgets are helping organize and disseminate information about valuable ATE deliverables and the projects and centers. The Community College Listing Service is helping build a comprehensive list of community college programs in ATE programmatic areas allowing projects and centers more complete data for their web sites and ATE users an easy path to finding programs and collaborators. Sustainability support is helping projects and centers define, plan, and manage which deliverables and components should be carried forward after NSF funding. The Audience Technology Survey is creating a unique service, aggregating mailing lists from projects and centers to survey end users from across the community to build a deeper understanding of their use of technology and social media. ATE Central's portal, services, and tools form an integrated, creative approach to supporting the ATE community and amplifying the impacts of the ATE program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ATE Central 2.0 is continuing to use digital library standards and procedures to compile, normalize, and disseminate metadata about the ATE projects and centers and the resources they collect and develop, broadening the impact of their work and disseminating metadata to organizations like the STEM Exchange, OAIster, the DPLA, and others in the digital library and education communities. The collective work of the ATE program, and ATE Central 2.0, is impacting a diverse set of users - from students and faculty to industry partners. Utilizing a variety of pathways (from conferences to social media to webinars) for outreach combined with a commitment to Universal Design, ATE 2.0 is broadening access to valuable ATE data and deliverables for all users, including those with disabilities.</AbstractNarration>

With an emphasis on partnerships between academic institutions and industry, the program promotes improvement in the education of science and engineering technicians at undergraduate and secondary institutions. The ATE program supports curriculum development, professional development for educators, and career pathways, along with other activities.</p> <p>ATE Central (http://atecentral.net), initially funded in 2008 in response to expressed ATE community needs, acts as an information hub, support center, and archive for the ATE community, helping amplify and support the work of grantees. Over its five-year tenure, the&nbsp;<em>ATE Central 2.0&nbsp;</em>project focused on&nbsp;fostering collaboration and the sharing of best practices within and beyond the community,&nbsp;disseminated and sustained valuable grantee deliverables, and provided a range of tools and services created with community input to support ATE project and center efforts.&nbsp;</p> <p>The project encouraged and supported collaboration via the ATE Central portal and information hub, an active events calendar, the ATE Impacts blog, and other services. Ongoing dissemination and outreach efforts connected hundreds of thousands of users with ATE resources, and included content delivery via the project's website, multiple annual webinars, conferences, workshops, and the&nbsp;<em>ATE Central Connection&nbsp;</em>newsletter, which provides the latest information about new ATE events and resources, and has been published every month since April of 2009 (113 issues as of September 2018). ATE Central's site and publications act as pathways to learn more about ATE activities and deliverables.&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, the ATE Events calendar highlighted 1,611 events shared by ATE grantees - more than one new event per business day of the five-year project. &nbsp;</p> <p>Over the life of the project, the ATE Central team worked on several underlying components, including collection development and archiving of ATE project and center deliverables, as well as development of, and outreach around, new project tools and services. These include an online fact sheet, which draws on live underlying collection metadata to highlight in real time the outputs and impacts of the ATE community, and a&nbsp;&nbsp;microsite service that helps ATE community members create a simple web site, allowing them to put information online immediately, showcasing their resources and materials and support collaborations with colleagues and those outside of ATE.&nbsp;&nbsp;With support from ATE Central, a higher percentage of ATE projects now have a website and the ability to utilize the web as a dissemination and collaboration support mechanism.&nbsp;</p> <p>As ATE projects or centers come to the end of their funding, it is important that the ongoing impact of their work continues. ATE Central's services enable perpetual access and long-term sustainability for ATE resources, helping to ensure they do not disappear after funding ends by providing archiving services and support to ATE projects and centers as they plan for long term data management.&nbsp;&nbsp;When this phase of the project began there were 106 resources archived; by the end of this phase that number had increased by 650% to 697.&nbsp;&nbsp;(A "resource" in this context could be one page of material or hundreds of pages, as in a semester long course.)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In tandem with archiving, sustainability workshops and webinars supported ATE PIs and staff as they decided how to best sustain the valuable deliverables, event outcomes, and materials created during their funding cycle and encouraged them to think proactively about the long term impacts of their project or center.</p> <p>The project received supplemental funding in 2013 to create a publication highlighting the ATE program's impact over its first twenty years.&nbsp;&nbsp;The result was&nbsp;<em>ATE@20: Two Decades of Advancing Technological Education.&nbsp;</em>The book was disseminated to a variety of stakeholders including state and federal officials, ATE industry partners, higher-ed and high-school educators and administrators, as well as students, parents, and other interested parties.&nbsp;</p> <p>Robust collaborations were central to the success of the project with a variety of partners including the American Association of Community Colleges, EvaluATE, Ithaka S&amp;R, BlueSky to BluePrint, Big Duck, Pellet Media, Mentor Connect and Mentor Links, FLATE, and Luka Partners along with many grantees and staff from the ATE community.</p> <p>In its role as an information and dissemination hub for the ATE community, ATE Central provides access to, and archives, valuable ATE resources and deliverables, as well as supporting grantees and their work through a variety of services and tools. In this round of funding, ATE Central 2.0 continued to build on the work done under the original project, adding an array of new services and tools designed to amplify the impact of the ATE program and sustaining and supporting the work of hundreds of ATE projects and centers.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 12/07/2018<br>      Modified by: Rachael&nbsp;Bower</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1261744/1261744_10237053_1544195806840_ATECentralHomePage--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1261744/1261744_10237053_1544195806840_ATECentralHomePage--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Home Page of ATE Central Website"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1261744/1261744_10237053_1544195806840_ATECentralHomePage--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Home Page of ATE Central Website"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">ATE Central (http://atecentral.net), initially funded in 2008 in response to expressed ATE community needs, acts as an information hub, support center, and archive for the ATE community, helping amplify and support the work of grantees.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Edward Almasy</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Creative Commons</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Rachael&nbsp;Bower</div> <div class="imageTitle">Home Page of ATE Central Website</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1261744/1261744_10237053_1544196027802_ATECentralFactSheet--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1261744/1261744_10237053_1544196027802_ATECentralFactSheet--rgov-800width.jpg" title="ATE Fact Sheet"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1261744/1261744_10237053_1544196027802_ATECentralFactSheet--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="ATE Fact Sheet"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">This online fact sheet draws on live underlying collection metadata from the ATE Central portal to highlight in real time the outputs and impacts of the ATE community</div> <div class="imageCredit">Edward Almasy</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Creative Commons</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Rachael&nbsp;Bower</div> <div class="imageTitle">ATE Fact Sheet</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1261744/1261744_10237053_1544196396419_ATE@20BookCover--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1261744/1261744_10237053_1544196396419_ATE@20BookCover--rgov-800width.jpg" title="ATE@20 Book Cover"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1261744/1261744_10237053_1544196396419_ATE@20BookCover--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="ATE@20 Book Cover"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">The project received supplemental funding in 2013 to create a publication highlighting the ATE program?s impact over its first twenty years.

The project received supplemental funding in 2013 to create a publication highlighting the ATE program's impact over its first twenty years.  The result was ATE@20: Two Decades of Advancing Technological Education. The book was disseminated to a variety of stakeholders including state and federal officials, ATE industry partners, higher-ed and high-school educators and administrators, as well as students, parents, and other interested parties.   Robust collaborations were central to the success of the project with a variety of partners including the American Association of Community Colleges, EvaluATE, Ithaka S&amp;R, BlueSky to BluePrint, Big Duck, Pellet Media, Mentor Connect and Mentor Links, FLATE, and Luka Partners along with many grantees and staff from the ATE community.
