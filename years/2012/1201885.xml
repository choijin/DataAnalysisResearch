<AbstractNarration>The objective of the research is to investigate and promote the use of pico-liter scale droplets for encapsulation and monitoring of bacterial growth, mammalian cell growth, and PCR reactions. The approach is to ascertain both experimentally and numerically, the device design, mechanisms of encapsulation, and biological reactions inside the droplets. The research is expected to result in increased understanding of the fundamental mechanisms as well as realization of practical devices for point-of-care diagnostics and screening applications.&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merits of the proposed work include the development of novel numerical techniques for simulation of the cell encapsulation process, obtaining fundamental insight into the process of cell encapsulation in the droplets of cell media or buffer, examining the effect of ionic liquid medium on the cells, a systematic experiment and simulation approach to design the devices for optical capture, and whether single cell reactions can be interrogated inside these droplets.&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of the proposed work is that a further understanding of the mechanism of cell encapsulation process in micro-channels will directly guide the use of droplets as reaction vessels for cells and molecules in biochemical applications. Thus, the proposed study can serves as generic platform that allows the biological activities to be monitored in real time using electrical means resulting in compact devices. The devices would be used to demonstrate fundamentals of microfluidics and bioassays to high school students in science fairs at OSU and as part of a microfluidic module in a 2 week long summer school at UIUC.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In all bio-related areas, such as biology, biological engineering, biomedical engineering and pharmaceutics, monitoring the behavior of a cell is important to understand cell growth and response in relation to its environment.  The observation of the response of a cancer cell when it is exposed to a drug candidate is a good example in cancer drug screening.  In traditional cell-based research using  cell populations over 100,000, the response of an individual cell was concealed by ensemble averaging of the responses from the massive number of cells.  Thus, technologies to manipulate and monitor cell population at the single cell level have been developed.    In this project, a microfluidic device was developed to monitor the electrical property of the micro-droplets entrapping one or more cells.  Instead of oil or organic solvents, water immiscible room temperature ionic liquid (RTIL) was applied as a novel solvent to generate aqueous droplets inside the microfluidic device.  The electrically conductive nature of the RTIL enables rapid and simple monitoring of the electrical property change inside the micro-droplets.  The effect of the physical and chemical properties of the RTIL, such as viscosity, density, and hydrophobicity, and the microchannel junction geometry on the size and interval of generated droplets were also investigated by experiments and numerical simulation.  The conventional simulation model could not be applied to RTIL-based droplet generation due to the higher viscosity and density.   The novel RTIL-based micro-droplet technology developed in this project will enhance the advance of various bio-related fields, such as high-throughput screening of drug candidates and fundamental studies at the single cell level using femto-liter volume micro-droplet as a reactor with the capability of electrical monitoring.
