<AbstractNarration>UTEP-UCSB PREM: Fundamental Molecular and Interfacial Design for Next Generation Photovoltaic Systems&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A synergistic interdisciplinary research approach to the advancement of the basic understanding of the molecular and interfacial structures essential for efficient solar energy conversion will be conducted. In this project, an innovative, student-centered, inter-campus program called "UTEP-UCSB PREM" will be created to manage the scholarly activities of the participating students. Prof. L. Echegoyen from UTEP and Prof. C. Hawker from UCSB lead this institutional partnership in which eight UTEP and eight UCSB scientists and engineers (chemistry, materials, physics, and electrical and mechanical engineering) and one from Sandia National Laboratories form collaborative research teams that focus on the following key fundamental aspects of solar energy photovoltaic research: (1) theoretical calculations to predict mechanisms and guide the design of new active compounds, (2) development of high-yield novel systems with tunable properties for next-generation solar cells, (3) crystal engineering to establish structure-function relationships for improved cell efficiencies, (4) semiconductor nanocrystal growth simulations to predict function, and (5) development of new interfacial transparent materials with well-characterized composition and structure, to establish structure-function relationships and guide the design of next-generation interfaces for solar cells. The world-class instrument facilities at the UCSB MRL will enable and catalyze the exploration of the basic science of solar cells and provide unique opportunities for cross-fertilization of ideas, mentoring, and multidisciplinary training. The collaborative teams will hold research-focus group meetings via real-time video teleconferencing and hold an annual symposium hosted by each institution, revolving yearly. This will foster a high-level of research intensity and a well-orchestrated student-centered organizational environment. Ultimately, this research partnership will increase our understanding of the fundamental mechanism of solar cells and pave the way for the next generation of decentralized energy production in the world.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP) is a major research university located in the Southwest region of the United States and has a student body composed of 78% Hispanic-Americans and 55% women out of which a large portion are low-income first-generation college students. The proposed UTEP-UCSB PREM partnership will promote and enhance the participation and advanced degree attainment of over 20 Ph.D. and over 30 B.S. students, most of whom will be from underrepresented minority groups. Students will develop expertise in the broad areas of green energy and sustainability while acquiring a strong set of multi-disciplinary skills in fundamental research. The participating students will carry out this research at both academic institutions and will be mentored by faculty from several disciplines. Mentoring of junior and mid-career faculty will also be fostered. This PREM program will allow UTEP to significantly accelerate its emergence as a focal center for materials research and develop a long-lasting collaborative partnership with UCSB's MRL. The research results under the UTEP-UCSB PREM partnership will be disseminated in peer-reviewed journals and conferences, and to the public at large via a dedicated web portal and frequent presentations at local K-12 schools.</AbstractNarration>

The ethnicity diversity in the PREM program includes, 2 African American, 2 Asian, 76 Hispanic, 3 Caucasian, and 3 Not Reported. Except for 2 students, ALL are members of URM Groups and/or female. (Reference Figure 2)</p> <p>&nbsp;The PREM program at the UTEP campus has been offering excellent educational and training opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students through a wide range of activities. Training through hands-on laboratory experience, faculty/postdoc mentoring, and research seminars and workshops are the key activities that promote educational experiences for students across the UTEP campus. One of the most important educational components is the required participation of ALL PREM participants, including the summer REU students, in ALL workshops offered by the Campus Office of Undergraduate Research Initiatives (COURI). The COURI workshop titles are: Lab Notebook and Writing Research Reports, Responsible Conduct of Research, Writing Abstracts Using Research Reports, Preparing Poster Presentations, Preparing a Personal Statement, Preparing a CV/Resume, and Developing a Professional Path.</p> <p><strong>REU:</strong> The main educational project originally proposed under the PREM program was the REU exchange, which was successfully initiated in the summer of 2013. PREM education staff and researchers at both UTEP and UCSB are dedicated to improving access to science for diverse groups and to building a competent workforce of scientists and engineers. &nbsp;Our educational programs provide undergraduate research opportunities for UTEP students at UCSB and vice versa.</p> <p>&nbsp;<strong>Outreach:</strong> During the 2015 reporting period, Dr. Echegoyen presented a hydrogen car demo which initiated the expansion of the outreach component for PREM in El Paso. The presentation was followed by PREM student sessions to develop five new outreach activities during Spring of 2015. This presentation and outreach activity development was a response to the EAB recommendation to further expand the outreach component. During the PREM program, the PREM students have impacted 6,460 local school aged students by visiting their campus and actively participating in hands-on outreach activities. (Reference Figure 3) &nbsp;Initially the outreach program was targeting middle and high school audience. The program expanded the student audience to include elementary grade students during the last 3 years of the program. The outreach activities have been modified to provide the opportunity for the younger students to actively participate.</p> <p>&nbsp;As students in the program graduated and new students entered the program, each outreach team met throughout the semester to allow the PREM students to learn and modify their activities as needed. The PREM students had developed a sense of ownership of their respective outreach activities which have enabled the students to positively impact students from local schools who mainly belong to underrepresented minority groups.
