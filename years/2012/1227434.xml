<AbstractNarration>This award funds three projects in economic theory.  The first part of the research studies optimal mechanisms when the principal has the opportunity to verify the types of the agents at a cost.  For example, consider the problem faced by the head of an organization who must decide which of several divisions in the organization will be allowed a new hire.  The head wants to allocate this job slot to the division that would fill the position in the way that best promotes the organization as a whole.  However, each division has more information than the leader about its own job applicants.  The head may want to consider investing some money in verifying the statements made by each division about the job applicants; by doing this the head can promote the organization's overall interests.  But at the same time the head must remember that the resources spent to verify information are not available to meet the organization's other goals.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The second project considers a particular class of matching models.  In this class of models, participants in the match will make decisions in advance of the match about individual career choice.  Each person must weigh both the satisfaction and pay that each career provides.  However, people also understand that they will participate in the match and may find a partner.  Partners share income; therefore someone who anticipates matching to a high-income partner has an incentive to choose a highly satisfying but low paying job.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The third project looks at the incentives that affect a firm's choice of certain product characteristics.   Recently economists have developed a number of models of "temptation", in which consumers make decisions today while perhaps under-estimating their ability to control their actions tomorrow.  In these models, the characteristics of the products available to consumers are taken as given.  However, in reality firms often must choose the degree to which a specific product is "tempting"; eg, the nicotine level in a cigarette, the alcohol level in liquor, etc.  This project will consider how firms make these choices, and how government policies such as "sin taxes" affect these choices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These projects are each applicable to the design of policies and incentive plans to address a variety of social problems.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The project is intended to focus on various environments where agents may have access to evidence about their characteristics, and a principal would like to make a decision based on those characteristics, but the preferences of the agents and the principal differ.     One issue studied is how the principal should take into account their costs of checking the evidence. This is explored in a "simple allocation problem" in which the principal has one good to allocate to one of the agents, the agents al wants the good, but the principal wants to allocate it depending on their type.
