<AbstractNarration>Today's wireless networks are facing an emerging spectrum crisis due to increased demand. FCC has recently allowed non-licensed devices to operate in the TV spectrum band, leading to cognitive radio networks (CRNs). It is argued that CRNs result in a technical and economical conflict with the TV broadcast companies, which own licenses to the TV spectrum. In this project, CRNs are considered as a business opportunity for broadcast companies. The answer to the following question is sought: "Is it economically and technically viable for broadcast companies to utilize TV white spaces for low-cost Internet provision and web-enabled TV services?" To facilitate the involvement of broadcast companies in the cognitive radio business, the concept of cognitive radio-enabled TV set (Cog-TV) is considered. Cog-TV provides low-cost access to the Internet and local area network capabilities. Cog-TVs are assigned optimal spectrum sensing schedules to provide service differentiation capabilities through a novel neighborhood watch concept. Dynamic pricing techniques are developed with the objective of distributing the peak-time demand load. Moreover, the cost of building the Cog-TV infrastructure in urban and rural areas is analyzed to determine its economic feasibility. Through this architecture, broadcast companies can leverage their channel ownership to create a competitive advantage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results from this research are expected to enable transformative and economically viable CRN development and management approaches. The Cog-TV concept has the potential to bring affordable Internet service to a large group of American households and impact consumer market by creating a niche market in new TV sets.</AbstractNarration>
