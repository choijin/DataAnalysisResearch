<AbstractNarration>In recent decades it has become clear that animal development is remarkably parsimonious, with the same underlying regulators being used repeatedly to pattern different structures at different stages of the life cycle.  In large part, this parsimony is achieved by changes over time in the responsiveness of target genes to these regulators.  Such changes explain how the same regulator can activate or repress distinct sets of target genes at different stages of development.  The goal of this research is to understand how target gene responsiveness is controlled during the life cycle.  The focus of the work is insect metamorphosis, a process known to involve global shifts in such responsiveness.  The work tests the hypothesis that pupa-specific target responsiveness in Drosophila is controlled by the E93 gene.  E93 encodes a gene regulator that is expressed specifically at the pupal stage, and is required for most or all patterning processes that occur at this time.  E93 is known to function during leg development to control the pupa-specific responsiveness of the Dll gene.  This work tests whether other genes that change their responsiveness in the pupa are also regulated by E93, and determine the molecular mechanisms by which E93 acts.  An understanding of how E93 controls target gene responsiveness will have broad significance, as similar mechanisms likely direct life cycle transitions in many other organisms, including ourselves.  The work includes outreach activity at a local high school.  In a project to characterize the evolution of E93, students will collect and classify local insects, purify their DNA, and conduct phylogenetic studies of the E93 gene.  After a year of piloting, the project will be expanded to include selected schools within the city of St. Louis, engaging students who otherwise would have little or no exposure to research.</AbstractNarration>

In some cases, these transitions can result in dramatic changes in body form.  How do such transformations occur?  In recent decades, it has become clear that the same basic tool kit of patterning signals is responsible for producing both adult and juvenile forms.  What changes from one stage to the next is whether or not cells are competent to respond to these signals.  How such changes in competence are controlled is poorly understood.  Our long-term goal is to understand the mechanisms involved.  We have identified the Eip93F(E93) gene, which encodes a DNA-binding regulatory protein, as a key determinant of pupa-specific competence during metamorphosis in the fruit fly Drosophila.  E93is expressed only at the pupal stage, and almost all patterning processes that normally occur in the pupa fail in E93mutants.  In prior work, we carried out a detailed study of one E93-dependent process, the induction of bracts (small cuticular outgrowths) by bristle cells in the pupal leg.  In this work, we showed that E93functions to activate the competence of a bract-specific regulatory element of the Dllgene, which specifies bract fate.
