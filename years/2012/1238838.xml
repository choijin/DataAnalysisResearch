<AbstractNarration>The project entitled - Nanoscience Transforming STEM Education at Hampton University - has the goal to develop and implement an integrated, multidisciplinary STEM research and education program in nanoscience that prepares students for graduate studies and professional careers in the field of nanoscience. The project seeks to answer the question: Will the implementation of an interdisciplinary, nanoscience project at the institution accomplish a desired transformation within the university that will result in improved recruitment, retention and graduation of more, highly-qualified STEM graduates for entry into graduate schools or the STEM workforce? The objectives are to develop an undergraduate nanoscience curriculum concentration; engage students in nanoscience-related research throughout the academic year and summer session at national laboratories, industries and international universities; offer professional workshops and seminars; provide "next steps" educational and career support;  provide professional faculty development to increase their publications records; promote the nanoscience project to incoming and current STEM students to interest them in pursuing the nanoscience concentration; and increase awareness of local high school students in nanoscience and career opportunities in STEM.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The implementation activities require participation across targeted disciplines including Biological Sciences, Chemistry, Engineering, Mathematics and Physics where minorities and women are underrepresented. The institution's student body is approximately 88% African American. This project will greatly assist in the institution's ongoing efforts to strengthen the undergraduate research environment in nanoscience and STEM research and to increase the number of women and minorities who pursue Ph.D.degrees and careers in nanoscience and STEM fields. A significant component of the project is to give students international research partnership experiences by having internship opportunities at international universities and thereby better prepare them to participate in the global workforce.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In 2012, Hampton University successfully applied for the Achieving Competitive Excellence (ACE) award through the Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP) at the National Science Foundation (NSF).  The five-year (2012-2017) project, entitled "ACE Implementation: Nanoscience Transforming STEM Education at Hampton University (NanoHU)", purposed to establish a formal nanoscience program at Hampton University by systematically implementing an integrated STEM research and education program in nanoscience at the university.

Scholars and Fellows accounted for 41.5% of the enrolled students, and 85.4% of the students majored in STEM fields. While 34 undergraduate students were recruited to the program, 28 (82.4%) persisted having either completed program requirements (i.e. STEM research and earn nanoscience minor), or are in the process of completing program requirements. The nanoscience minor was designed and managed through seven departments (Biological Sciences, Chemistry and Biochemistry, Computer Science, Engineering, Marine and Environmental Science, Mathematics, and Physics).  The nanoscience course resulted from the contribution of four departments (Physics, Chemistry and Biochemistry, Computer Science and Biological Sciences).  The course is available to all students and satisfies the institution’s general education requirements, serving as a physical science elective.  The course and the curriculum now serve as models for other novel courses and minors. The 28 students who persisted as either NanoHU Scholars or Fellows, conducted research across 11 institutions external to the University.  Six of those students are now co-authors on peer-reviewed publications and 10 have received at least one award or recognition for presentations (oral or poster) at technical meetings.  Moreover, at least two research projects for graduate students were initiated as derivatives of the undergraduate research projects. The seminar series has impacted no less than 500 students, including all Scholars and Fellows, across the University.  All Scholars and Fellows have participated in at least 90% of professional development activities in the form of weekly meetings, workshops, scientific meetings, and seminars.   All faculty mentors received guidance regarding research opportunities beyond the BS program.  All Faculty mentors, all Scholars and Fellows received opportunities to participate in a number of grant-writing opportunities, including the workshop for the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship Program Award. Scholars, Fellows and Faculty were instrumental in promoting the NanoHU to local elementary schools, area churches, and other civic organizations. NanoHU hosted a total of 65 high students over the past five summers at Hampton University.  Said high school students (Pioneers) engaged in 6-week summer research projects, mathematics enrichment activities, and additional STEM &ndash;related activities over that time.  Fifty-two (80%) of the 65 Pioneers are enrolled in colleges or universities as STEM majors.   As a consequence of NanoHU’s implementation, several institutional changes have occurred:  Expansion of Hampton’s lexicon to officially include nanoscience  Increased multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary nano-infused research  Increased student enthusiasm among STEM and non-STEM students Increased student research on and off campus Establishment of a disciplinary ecosystem that spanned departments Decreased fragmentation of research with nano-related content.      Furthermore, results from NanoHU have been disseminated widely via publications and presentations (print and seminar).  In fact, NanoHU is the subject of at least four book chapters, one paper, and 12 presentations.     In conclusion, NanoHU is now recognized as a model for STEM undergraduate education.  The project has realized its intellectual merit through disciplinary interest in its work.  Furthermore, it has had significant broad impact on k-12 schools, undergraduate and graduate students, university faculty, and institutions of higher learning.
