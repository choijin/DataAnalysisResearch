<AbstractNarration>This project is aimed at achieving significant spectrum efficiency gains through inter network collaboration in radio resource management.  The proposed SAVANT (spectrum access via inter network collaboration) architecture is based on a new protocol interface for dissemination of spectrum usage information, policies and algorithms between neighboring networks to enable spectrum coexistence algorithms that reduce interference and improve spectrum packing efficiency. A new inter-domain spectrum coordination protocol (ISCP) is being developed to enable independent networks to negotiate radio resource management policies and optionally merge radio resource controllers for joint optimization.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The scope of research to be conducted includes ISCP protocol design/validation, evaluation of alternative algorithms involving network collaboration, prototype implementation and performance evaluation.  The methodology for the project involves a mix of analysis, simulation and experimental prototyping.  Generalized analytical models for radio localization, propagation and interference are developed and incorporated into simulation studies of inter-network cooperation using the ISCP protocol framework.  These simulation models are expected to provide insight into the type of collaborative radio resource optimization algorithm to be used along with quantitative evaluation of ISCP overhead, complexity and performance.  The project also includes an experimental prototyping track in which emerging software-defined network (SDN) technology is used to develop a proof-of-concept system with multiple collaborating networks. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed ISCP inter-network protocol has the potential for large gains in wireless spectrum utilization, and could thus influence future industry standards.  The project will also produce educational materials for training of graduate students in software-defined networking and wireless systems.</AbstractNarration>

The project started by defining an inter-network collaboration architecture with interfaces for the exchange of radio map information and algorithm/policy negotiation between neighboring networks. Extensive simulation studies were conducted to evaluate potential performance gains for unlicensed WiFi in dense wireless deployment scenarios. The results demonstrate significant performance gains for logically centralized cooperative algorithms relative to current practice in terms of overall throughput/spectral efficiency as well as fairness.  A design effort aimed at realizing the SAVANT architecture using emerging software-defined network (SDN) technology was also carried out with the goal of building an experimental prototype which could later be used in real-world field trials and/or made available to the community as open source.  Using the experimental SAVANT prototype along with simulation/analysis tools, we carried out a comprehensive study of LTE-U/WiFi co-existence in a shared spectrum band such as the 3.5 Ghz band now under consideration for small cell mobile data and WLAN applications.  The results of this study show the feasibility of using inter-network cooperation protocols for joint optimization of radio parameters, achieving significant gains over current spectrum sharing practices.  This work was presented at the IEEE DySpan 2015 conference where it received the best technical paper award. The final phase of the project during 2016 led to a refinement of the overall architectural concepts behind SAVANT and an indentification of fully distributed spectrum assignment algorithms enabled by the framework.   The LTE/WiFi coexistence use case was studied with a comprehensive set of experimental evaluations on the ORBIT testbed using software defined radio (SDR) implementations of LTE.   Broader impacts:  This project resulted in a novel dynamic spectrum management architecture which provides significant gains in spectrum efficiency as required to meet rapidly growing demands of wireless applications including cellular mobile data and Internet-of-Things (IoT).  The proposed SAVANT design is distributed in nature and avoids undesirable scalability and single-point-of-failure/control properties associated with current dynamic spectrum management solutions such as the spectrum assignment server (SAS).  The research effort also contributed to specialized workforce training in the wireless technology area.       Last Modified: 01/26/2017       Submitted by: Dipankar Raychaudhuri]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
