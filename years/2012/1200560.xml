<AbstractNarration>Spot fires in wildfire environment are caused by embers lofted into the atmosphere and blown well ahead of the main front of the wildfire. The objective of this research is to establish an experimentally verified stochastic model for ember flight in wildfires. The research program will build on existing deterministic models for ember flight and develop analytical and numerical models that account for the inherently stochastic nature of the problem. The models will include parameterizations of the probability distribution functions for ember size and shape, fire size and intensity, and the turbulent velocity fluctuations in fire plume and the atmospheric boundary layer. The models will be verified through a series of ember flight experiments conducted in a large scale boundary layer wind tunnel. The experiments will measure lofting height and downwind transport distance for a broad range of sizes, shapes, and wind conditions. This will provide experimental measurements of the flight distance for lofted embers. The experimentally verified numerical model will be used to perform parametric sensitivity studies to establish those parameters that most greatly influence the downwind risk of ember spotting and starting fire. &lt;br/&gt;The spot fires can cause significant property damage and can endanger the lives of home owners and firefighters. Understanding the mechanics of how embers are lofted up into the atmosphere and then blown downwind will greatly enhance our ability to predict the risk of spot fires and improve our response to such threats. The project will transform the way that ember flight is modeled by addressing the random nature of the processes involved. The ultimate goal is to mitigate property losses caused by spot fires in wildfire environment. The research team will develop a public outreach program to educate school students about the risks from wildfires, and to encourage students to pursue careers in science and engineering. The outreach program will be focused on South Carolina schools through demonstrations of the tests and videos and other materials that will be made available on the web.</AbstractNarration>

The flight of embers is a complex problem that is influenced by the ember shape, wildfire size, and wind speed.

A series of tests tracked the flight path of over 15,000 model embers over a broad range of wind conditions and ember shapes. Our results, combined with theoretical analysis of the behavior of wildfire plumes in natural wind flows (in which the wind speed increase with height) showed that ember flight models must account for the wind &ndash; fire plume interaction and lift forces acting on the ember. Ember flight is also highly variable and depends greatly on when and where an ember forms within a fire. Our experiments showed that an individual ember can travel up to twice as far as the average flight distance for similar release conditions. The second figure below shows ember flight paths for 118 nominally identical tests and illustrates the large variability in landing location from nominally identical release conditions. This variation in ember flight has been observed in real wildfires but not accounted for in prior ember flight models. A high resolution computational model of our wind tunnel experiments was also developed. The third figure below shows a contour plot of the computational model fire plume and the trajectories of model embers lofted into the air. The computational model was able to predict the mean ember flight distance measured in our experiments. This is the first ever experimentally validated model for ember flight.</p> <p>Beyond wildfire applications, the research has improved our understanding of how long thin cylinders are transported in strong winds. This is important information for engineers trying to protect houses from flying debris, such as lumber or tree branches, in hurricanes and tornadoes. Our analysis of fire plume &ndash; wind interaction will also lead to improved models for pollution dispersion in the atmosphere.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 10/27/2016<br>      Modified by: Nigel&nbsp;Kaye</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1200560/1200560_10154431_1477591112976_fig1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1200560/1200560_10154431_1477591112976_fig1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="spot fire schematic"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1200560/1200560_10154431_1477591112976_fig1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="spot fire schematic"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Schematic diagram showing embers forming from burning trees, being lofted into the air by the fire plume and then being blown down wind before landing and starting spot fires.
