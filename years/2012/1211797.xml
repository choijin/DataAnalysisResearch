<AbstractNarration>This project will test whether urban social and economic decay and urban infestations of mosquitoes feedback upon one another and, if so, how to break this vicious cycle.  Research in Baltimore, Maryland, will examine whether features of urban decay such as population decline, abandoned lots, and unmanaged refuse promote mosquito production and whether this in turn discourages care for and use of the outdoor environment by residents and exacerbates urban decay.  Comprehensive sampling in three focal neighborhoods will quantify the association between the abundances of mosquitoes and the physical and socio-economic status of neighborhoods, and how mosquito exposure influences resident support for and participation in outdoor activities and urban revitalization. Experiments will identify activities that best support and motivate resident-led strategies to control mosquitoes. Specifically, researchers will: 1) assess the quality and quantity of positive and negative social and environmental features in each neighborhood ; 2) quantify mosquito abundance and identify mechanisms that facilitate winter survival; 3) measure resident knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors associated with controlling mosquito breeding habitat and personal exposure; and 4) test the efficacy of education and active citizen-science interventions in changing mosquito control behaviors of residents and their perceptions about neighborhood greening projects. Results will increase understanding of coupled human and pest dynamics in an urban context and provide fundamental information for translating ecological theory in urban ecosystems and developing socio-ecological theory for sustainable advances in urban greening and public health. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Coupled human-mosquito dynamics are an important model for developing new socio-ecological theory on human-pest interactions, improving urban quality of life, and engaging broader community participation in neighborhood revitalization. Despite over a century of organized and often sophisticated efforts to control mosquitoes, nuisance complaints persist and mosquito-borne diseases are a persistent and growing concern in urban communities across the globe. The need for personal responsibility in managing urban pests at the scale of individual parcels is increasingly viewed as the better route to mosquito control in urban and suburban settings. This work investigates this socio-ecological system, integrating expertise and theory from community ecology, geography, education, and environmental justice. The research is designed to include community leaders and residents at all stages of data collection, interpretation, and dissemination, as well as in brainstorming remediation strategies.  The project will train graduate and undergraduate students, including members of under-represented groups, use social media to recruit and involve citizen scientists and community members, and partner with city and state agencies and a community-based foundation.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: small;">Despite centuries of organized and often sophisticated efforts to control mosquitoes, nuisance complaints and mosquito-borne diseases persist. This research investigated coupled mosquito and human systems dynamics in the context of current human actions and a legacy of inequitable urban investment that has led to stark gradients in urban decay (e.g., population decline, abandoned lots, and unmanaged refuse). This work explicitly evaluated how and where symptoms of urban decay in Baltimore, MD, facilitate mosquito production, which discourages resident management and use of the outdoor environment. This work is timely in investigating conditions that support the persistence of mosquito arboviral vectors, including the <em>Culex pipiens </em>and the invasive <em>Aedes albopictus</em>.</span></p> <p><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Our work quantified how social and environmental amenities are inequitably distributed across urban neighborhoods in predictable ways. For example, unoccupied or vacant land is more quickly redeveloped or managed as shared green space in neighborhoods with greater household incomes and higher housing values. Unmanaged infrastructure and associated trash in lower income neighborhoods contributes to greater adult mosquito production because it is favorable habitat for all life-stages (e.g., egg, larva, adult). Juvenile mosquito populations build up early in summer when container habitats fill with water and higher population abundances of <em>Aedes</em> and <em>Culex</em> vector species persist in these sites throughout the season. In drought years, residents in higher income neighborhoods were more likely to add water for yard and garden maintenance supporting large, later summertime peaks in mosquito abundance in those neighborhoods only. </span></span></p> <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: small;">On average, mosquito abundances were significantly higher in lower income neighborhoods but residents in all neighborhoods reported changing individual behavior due to perceived mosquito exposure. Residents in higher income neighborhoods were more concerned with reducing mosquito infestations so they could use their backyards for recreation, median-income neighborhoods generally had the greatest engagement with shared gardens and greenspaces, and residents in lower income neighborhoods were more likely to avoid vegetated spaces in their neighborhood and sit on front stoops. Residents in these latter neighborhoods, where mosquito populations were the largest, were the least likely to report mosquito nuisance as a top environmental problem. They were also the least likely to report or ask for help managing mosquito infestations. </span></p> <p><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">While there was an association between resident understanding of mosquito ecology and household education attainment and/or income level, it is not clear that this reliably translates to better mosquito management practices. In addition to generating 14 research publications to date, this grant supported the development and distribution of outreach materials on household mosquito management, training of citizen scientists, and intervention experiments to reduce mosquito exposure at multiple spatial scales. </span></span></p> <p><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Community engagement through interviews, PhotoVoice, summer camp and after-school programs, and civic ecology workshops were used to show residents how to reduce mosquito habitat. Methods included removing water-holding containers and helping to organize groups to identify key issues with neighborhood garbage disposal and collection that contributed to persistent mosquito infestation. The PhotoVoice project resulted in local and city-wide art displays showing residents&rsquo; photographs and narratives of neighborhood health challenges and assets. Mosquito Stoppers, our citizen science program, was part of a broader community program established for West Baltimore. The community program worked with local leaders to organize gardening, park cleanups and multigenerational discussions. The Mosquito Stoppers included 37 residents who took on specific data collection duties on their own blocks to demonstrate a role for citizen scientists in generating authentic data that captured the peaks and seasonal trends in mosquito abundances across two years. We also awarded five small grants to West Baltimore community groups who designed and implemented their own plans for reducing local mosquito breeding. These included a tire drive with a youth organization, vacant lot restorations, planting of purposed mosquito-repellant vegetation, and alley management. Block-scale habitat removal interventions were implemented across 2 and 6 blocks over two years. In the second year, habitat removal was followed with additional bait-and-kill trapping. Removing accessible juvenile habitat and bait-and-kill traps were not effective methods for reducing adult mosquito populations on blocks with high percentages of abandoned infrastructure.</span></span></p> <p><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">In summary, the legacy of inequitable urban investment in Baltimore, MD, has resulted in disparate environmental amenities and greater presence of abandoned infrastructure in some neighborhoods. The loss of infrastructure and a declining resident population in these neighborhoods has created a negative feedback where empty buildings and associated garbage now support the establishment and persistence of urban pests, including mosquitoes. The presence of nuisance species further discourages residents from accessing and maintaining either personal or shared natural resources. Further, despite evidence of large mosquito populations, the residents in these same neighborhoods are unlikely to report infestations or ask for help. &nbsp;</span></span></p> <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong><em>&nbsp;</em></p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 12/04/2017<br>      Modified by: Shannon&nbsp;L&nbsp;Ladeau</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1211797/1211797_10204974_1512410057408_Franklin.Square_Tire.Drive2016--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1211797/1211797_10204974_1512410057408_Franklin.Square_Tire.Drive2016--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Tire Drive"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1211797/1211797_10204974_1512410057408_Franklin.Square_Tire.Drive2016--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Tire Drive"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Tires are great habitat for developing mosquitoes.
