<AbstractNarration>Dr. Matthew Wolf-Meyer and Dr. Nancy Chen, both of the Department of Anthropology at the University of California-Santa Cruz, will convene two linked workshops, one in Santa Cruz and the other in Los Angeles. At each of these workshops they will bring together researchers whose work informs understanding of the contemporary practice and experiences of medical pluralism in the United States. Medical pluralism refers to the coexistance of different medical systems in a single societal context. While most previous research on medical pluralism has been on the extension of allopathic or western medicine into non-western societies, Wolf-Meyer and Chen will focus their workshops on consumer choice in contemporary western, market-driven contexts. Because of its long tradition of diverse immigration and multiple established medical treatment options, California is a particularly apt site for this undertaking. The outcome of the workshop will be a special issue of a professional journal on medical pluralism in the United States, and the establishment of a network of researchers who can pool their collective knowledge and resources for future research, grant applications, and publications.</AbstractNarration>

Participants presented current research and discussed themes which shape emerging research in medical anthropology for the 21st century.  We also discussed strategies for graduate student mentoring and cross campus research initiatives.  The outcomes of our meetings are as follows: first, one of the participants (Celina Callahan-Kapoor, a PhD candidate in anthropology at UCSC) has posted two thematic summaries of the event on the blog Somatosphere;[1] a third entry is currently being prepared. These posts are both meant to promote the work of UC medical anthropologists, as well as provide a summary of the event as public outreach.  Secondly, and ongoing, is the development of multi-campus initiatives that will build upon our shared expertise.  The next UC cross campus meeting is planned for February 2014.  There are currently two National Science Foundation grants being planned. The first is a multi-institution, multi-PI research grant focused on how Americans from diverse backgrounds understand æstressÆ and its biological effects; the planned submission date is February 2014. The second grant is for a Research Coordination Network, which is planned to support graduate student training across campuses, and to provide funding for annual workshops; our plan is submit this grant application in August 2014.
