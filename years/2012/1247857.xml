<AbstractNarration>Nanoparticles typically have sizes between 10-6 and 10-9 m (&lt;1 micron in size) and have different chemical and physical properties than the bulk mineral solids.  We now understand that they are transitional between truly dissolved atoms or molecules and crystalline solids and may have special properties that can be exploited by new nanotechnologies.  Previous research at Auburn University has shown that some metallic hydrothermal ores in the western United States formed by aggregation of metallic nanoparticles, particularly ones rich in such valuable metals as gold and silver.  Thus the transport of solid nanoparticles of gold, silver and other metals appears to be a new but little-studied ore-formation process.  Previously, researchers have assumed that metals were delivered to the site of their ultimate deposition in true solution, and this now appears not to be the case, at least in some situations.  A present-day example of this process is the black smoke emanating from sea floor hydrothermal vents on the ocean floor, which is composed mainly of metal-sulfide nanoparticles entrained in supercritical hydrothermal fluids.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This NSF-supported grant will look at transport of metallic nanoparticles involved in the formation of shallow bonanza ('epithermal') vein deposits of gold and silver, which were the type of precious-metal ores commonly mined in the western US in the 1800s.  These ores not only exhibit spectacular mineral textures formed as a result of aggregation of metallic nanoparticles, but preliminary isotopic (copper, lead, and sulfur) investigations have suggested that the nanoparticles that formed the ore mineral textures, appear to have come from much deeper down in the crust than the shallow setting where they were deposited.  The hypothesis to be tested with this study is that basaltic magmas, formed from partial melting in the underlying mantle, may release metals in a sulfur-rich, low density phase akin to a 'vapor', which forms nanoparticles of metals, metalloids, and sulfur upon some degree of cooling.  Thus the nanoparticles appear to lock in high temperature and primitive isotopic compositions similar to the source magma chambers, and therefore must be transported upward a considerable distance (a few km?) to form the shallow ores.  If this can be substantiated by the planned new isotopic investigations of ores from Nevada and Idaho, this will be a new aspect of hydrothermal ore-forming processes that can guide how and where such valuable ores occur, both at a regional and district scale.  Results have implications for better understanding metal release and transport from magmas, and perhaps will shed light on what are the sources of magma composition that lead to formation of such ores.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Nanoparticles, which are typically &lt;10-7m in diameter, often have unique chemical and physical properties that can differ substantially from their larger counterparts composed of the same materials.  Thus, they have applications for new technologies and industries and consequently much basic and applied research has been conducted on nanoparticles over the past couple of decades.  Much of the nanoparticle research has focused on synthetic-prepared particles and perhaps nano-surfaces composed of them.  In the geosciences, it has become increasingly apparent that nanoparticles (mineral(oids)s, or amorphous compounds) occur naturally, and thus also have potentially important industrial uses.  Further, such mineral nanoparticles perhaps even played a role in forming templates for assembling the basic organic building blocks required for the origin of life on Earth.  Natural metallic sulfide nanoparticles were first discovered as the "black smoke" emanating from hot spring vents and "chimneys" on the ocean floor in 1979.  These metallic nanoparticles formed by cooling of hot "hydrothermal" solutions associated with young volcanic rocks and are locally the precursors for ore minerals of metallic deposits formed on the sea floor. About a decade later, the PI for this project recognized that metallic nanoparticles (and nanoparticles of opal, which is amorphous silica) were important in forming at least one other hydrothermal metallic ore deposit type: high grade ("bonanza") gold-silver-quartz vein deposits.  These are also associated with volcanism, but form on the continents as opposed to the sea floor.  These deposits, called epithermal veins, are important sources of gold and silver worldwide, and the western USA has been particularly well-endowed with these ores.  Many 1800s mining towns sprung up in the western USA to exploit these relatively shallow and rich ores.  Field work for this project focused on one such 1800s mining town: Silver City, Idaho, which was a major silver and gold producer from ~1860 to 1895 from underground mine workings.     In the field, the PI and graduate students mapped veins at the surface and in accessible portions of underground workings, and collected bonanza gold-silver ores from mine 1800s mine tailings (spoil) piles that were the target ores of the early miners.  These samples collected as part of this NSF project, locally exhibited the tell-tale signs of nanoparticles and their aggregation textures seen previously in epithermal gold-silver ores at the Sleeper, National, Midas, Ivanhoe mines in northern Nevada.  At the time of aggregation and deposition the gold particles to form the bonanza ores, some of the original nanoparticles had grown to sizes bigger that typically associated with nanoparticles, and even locally exhibit crystalline morphologies.  In the lab, bonanza ore samples were dissolved in hydrofluoric acid to remove silica, and disaggregated ore minerals were handpicked to separate them for subsequent isotopic analyses.                 An important result from this project has been the recognition that even metallic sulfide minerals can form nanoparticles that eventually aggregate to form textures like those shown for gold and silver minerals.  In particular, the copper-iron-sulfide mineral chalcopyrite is both intimately associated with the gold-silver minerals and also makes its own "stand alone" fractal dendrites.  Thus chalcopyrite was used in this study for determining both the copper and sulfur isotopic compositions of the mineral to infer geochemical processes important in bonanza ore formation.  Similarly, copper isotopic ratios were measured in silver and gold minerals in these ores that contained minor amounts of copper.  Results show that the ore minerals retained a primitive magma-like isotopic signature, consistent with the metallic nanoparticles forming at depth close to their source magma chamber, which is surprising given the sallow nature of these ores and that ...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
