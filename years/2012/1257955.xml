<AbstractNarration>This project uses broadband communication to support a diverse community of STEM learners,  including K-12 students, their teachers and parents, school administrators, community organizers, city planners, and university faculty and graduate students. The project will build a community-situated, challenge-based, collaborative cyber-learning environment (C3STEM) that harnesses computational thinking, modeling, simulation, and challenge-based learning to support STEM learning in the context of a city traffic planning. C3STEM will use the traffic domain as the source for real-world problems for STEM education by developing projects through which high school students (from at least two schools) will collaboratively address problems of traffic congestion and safety in urban and suburban environments.   Classroom-based student groups will work with their classroom teacher, traffic experts, and the Vanderbilt researchers to analyze real traffic data from regions near their homes and schools. The collaborative effort will lead to the students gaining an understanding of the traffic patterns, which will support the students developing agent-based models that align with the observed patterns in their section (e.g., traffic congestion along selected thoroughfares at different times of day and the effects of stoplights and interstate on/off-ramps).  This process will teach fundamental concepts of data analysis and computer-based modeling and will motivate other curriculum-related mathematics and science lessons such as, Physics concepts, such as inertia, speed and acceleration, and Mathematical concepts, such as algebra, calculus, probability, and statistics.    The project will leverage GENI and broadband infrastructure to provide real-time collaborative sessions and large-scale data transfers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact:&lt;br/&gt;Via the combination of broadband communication, live data from community resources, computational modeling and collaborative learning, the products of student labor will not simply be for a grade, but their work will be regarded as an contribution to the community. This represents a cultural shift, which not only puts STEM in the foreground of active citizenship, but also raises the stature of teachers and K-12 education. The project results will be not only disseminated through journals and conferences but student projects will be displayed on a Web-based 'science-fair' and the PIs will create a Wikibook that archives the lesson plans and their evaluation. This text can be added to and revised by the community, as well as informing and supporting future community-situated, challenge-based programs.</AbstractNarration>

Furthermore, the findings provided us valuable insights into R&amp;D needs at the infrastructure level for scalable and resilient collaborative learning in formal and informal environments.  The key outcomes of this project can be summarized along the following dimensions:  (1)    C3STEM Infrastructure: C3STEM incorporates two core learning environments based on modeling and simulation: (1) CTSiM (Computational Thinking using Simulation and Modeling) for fundamental physics- and calculus-based modeling of vehicle and traffic operation, while also incorporating parameters that imply driver behaviors, and (2) C2SuMo (Cloud-based, Collaborative, Scaled-up Modeling) for macro-level modeling that uses a Google Maps interface along with the high-fidelity Simulation of Urban MObility (SUMO), a freely-available open-source visual traffic simulator for scaled-up, city-wide traffic simulations. Students start with CTSiM, a visual modeling and simulation environment that emphasizes computational thinking to build models of vehicle dynamics using their fundamental knowledge of NewtonÆs laws of mechanics, and then extend these models to include driver behaviors to model traffic flow on city streets. CTSiM adopts an agent-based modeling paradigm that provides the basis for designing a progression of C3STEM traffic simulation units that build on one another. After working individually on a set of CTSiM and C2SuMo units, students work in small groups to collaboratively solve a challenge problem that requires them to find the right timing sequences for a set of adjacent traffic lights to maximize traffic flow (minimize waiting times) through the intersections.  (2)    Curricular Units: For the CTSiM curricular units we developed six problem units that focus on model buluilding using fundamental knowledge of physics and calculus. The problem units include: (1) vehicles decelerating to stop at a STOP sign, and then accelerating to speed up; (2) vehicle taking left and right turns at an intersection; and (3) traffic flow through an intersection, which include left and right turns first with a STOP sign, and then with traffic lights.

The last two units students work on are challenge problems, where students work in small groups to sequence traffic lights to optimize traffic flow through adjacent intersections in a city grid.  (3)    User Studies and Findings: Our final set of  studies included one with 62 students from two Chattanooga high schools: (a) The STEM High School, and (b) East Hamilton High School. Students worked remotely to access the cloud-based server at Vanderbilt University to work on the CTSiM and C2SuMo units. A second study involved 26 high school students from Nashville Metro schools, who worked on the system and challenge problems in the classroom as well as from home. They used Google Hangouts to collaborate when they were ou...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
