<AbstractNarration>This award supports the continuation of the Research Experiences for Undergraduates and Research Experiences for Teachers REU/RET site within the Center for Astrophysics, Space Physics and Engineering Research at Baylor University. Thirty participating students will be actively engaged in cutting edge research under the direct supervision of energetic faculty mentors through the completion of self-contained ten week projects in a collaborative research environment. Student research opportunities are in the areas of astrophysics, complex plasma physics, cosmology, elementary particle physics, nuclear physics, quantum optics, space physics, and superstring physics. The site further provides research opportunities at the Center for up to fifteen teachers, who also develop curricula to take back into the classroom. Participants engage in twice-weekly seminars, an Undergraduate Research Symposium at the end of the summer and specially designed classes in various research areas of interest.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[Since 1993, CASPER has hosted the National Science Foundation Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) and Research Experience for Teachers (RET) programs as part of the CASPER Summers Outreach Initiative. During the summer of 2016, seven undergraduate students participated in the program working directly with CASPER faculty. Both theoretical and experimental research projects were conducted under the direction of these faculty members with assistance from their graduate students. Several high school students also participated in summer research through the High School Summer Science Research Program (HSSSRP) sponsored by the College of Arts and Sciences. The above provided an inegration of students into groups consisting of members possessing a wide range of skills and expertise. Over the course of the summer, faculty members presented short talks on various topics such as providing tips on literature searches, writing papers, preparing posters and presentations, and applying to graduate school. During Friday CASPER Group Meetings, REU participants provided weekly progress reports on their research, and shared current research interests. At the end of the summer, each REU Fellow gave a twelve-minute presentation detailing their research and results. After the summer, several REU Fellows presented at state and national meetings and / or were listed as co-authors on publication presentations.  During the program, technical skills developed by the Fellows include: Laser safety Vacuum technology Programming Electron microscopy Image analysis and data extraction Astronomical observing techniques Setting up and maintaining ultra-high vacuum systems Ultra-high vacuum scanning tunneling microscopy Sample preparation for surface science measurements Understanding surface reaction dynamics and kinetics   During the program, research skills developed by the Fellows include: Experimental complex plasmas Surface physics Astronomy Early planet formation String theory   Education and Outreach: REU Fellows learned about graduate school admission and preparation. Broader Impacts: This REU program directly impacts the ever growing shortage of qualified scientists, technicians, mathematicians and engineers.
