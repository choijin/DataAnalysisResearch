<AbstractNarration>This award provides support for the International Project Office (IPO) of the Urbanization and Global Environmental Change (UGEC) project, an international collaborative research project sponsored by the International Human Dimensions Programme on Global Environmental Change (IHDP).  UGEC has functioned since 2005, coordinating and facilitating new knowledge generation and dissemination about global environmental change in urban areas, placing special emphasis on collaborative activities that bridge the social and natural sciences as well as national boundaries.  Through its catalytic impact on development of new research projects and its networking activities, UGEG has become an international leader in research on urbanization and global environmental change.  The IPO has built an international interdisciplinary research coordination network of scholars and practitioners whose work deals with various facets of the interface of cities and the environment, promoting collaboration among academics and practitioners as urban areas prepare to respond to global environmental change.  During this third phase of UGEC activity, the IPO will promote the next generation of UGEC research, with an emphasis on synthesizing findings and connecting science to policy.  The IPO will promote, coordinate, and disseminate science and policy findings in the UGEC field by actively providing a platform for the docking and synthesis of global case-studies.  It also will continue to facilitate connections between research and practice by organizing international workshops and conferences utilizing cutting-edge communication tools, and it will assist in increasing the connections between U.S.-based networks of UGEC scholars and practitioners with their international counterparts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The UGEC IPO will make significant contributions to UGEC science and policy by facilitating integrative and synthetic understanding springing from new interdisciplinary knowledge.  It will encourage innovative conceptual and methodological approaches that link the social sciences with the natural sciences, and it will establish a new platform for the realization of continuous synthesis activities.  The IPO will operate at the boundary of science and practice, communicating its integrative efforts to decision makers, practitioners, and other end-users at different scales.  Through its support for international collaborative research and its encouragement for the involvement of early-career scientists in such efforts, the UGEC IPO helps address the social, economic, and environmental consequences of urbanization in diverse settings around the globe.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Since it was established in 2006, the Urbanization and Global Environmental Change (UGEC) Project has advanced science on the multi-scale interactions and feedbacks between urbanization and Earth system processes. The project emphasizes the tight coupling of these processes; global environmental change (GEC) is both a driver and outcome of socioeconomic and biophysical process in urban areas, and urbanization is both exo- and endo-genous to GEC. Hosted for a decade at the Julie Ann Wrigley Global Institute of Sustainability (GIOS) at Arizona State University (ASU), the UGEC center of operations, the International Project Office (IPO), has built a strong identity as an international platform of regionally networked scholars and scholar-practitioners engaged in better understanding and responding to the interactions and feedbacks of urbanization and GEC.</p> <p>The UGEC Project develops innovative conceptual frameworks, models, and methodologies capable of supporting the research and practice of sustainability in an urbanizing world. The project steers research to facilitate parallel and comparative cross-study analyses and syntheses; facilitates the exchange of knowledge between scientists, decision-makers, practitioners, and other end-users at the international, national and local levels; and builds capacity by training young scholars and practitioners to more effectively address global environmental issues in urban areas.</p> <p>Urbanization and environmental issues are even more relevant now than ten years ago when the UGEC Project began. Urban research is among the top priorities of the GEC community in addressing global sustainability challenges (Future Earth, 2014) and Future Earth has adopted &lsquo;cities&rsquo; as one of its initial Knowledge Action Network priorities (Future Earth, 2016). Projections show that over 65% of the world&rsquo;s population will be urban by 2050; the vast majority of urbanization will occur in developing countries and in smaller cities worldwide (UNDESA, 2014). Globally, urban areas generate more than 80% of gross domestic product (GDP), consume between 67 and 76% of energy, and emit about three-quarters of greenhouse gases (GHGs) (Dobbs et al., 2011; Seto et al., 2014). Urban areas are also sources of sustainable solutions. &nbsp;Locally and regionally, they have become key actors in climate change mitigation (reducing GHG emissions) and adaptation (reducing vulnerabilities to climate impacts); internationally, cities and urbanization processes are gaining increased attention (Romero-Lankao &amp; Dodman, 2011). The UGEC community has contributed insights to the following developments: the greater breadth of urban topics across international journals, special issues (e.g., Romero-Lankao &amp; Dodman, 2011; Simon &amp; Leck, 2015), United Nations commissioned reports (e.g., UN-HABITAT 2011; 2013); the recent inclusion of dedicated urban chapters in both Working Groups II and III of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Fifth Assessment Report (IPCC AR5) (Revi et al., 2014; Seto et al., 2014); and the establishment of a specific urban goal (Goal 11 &ndash; Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable) as part of the post-2015 United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) (UN, 2015).</p> <p>Over the last decade, urbanization and GEC research has evolved to become more multi-, inter-and trans-disciplinary, and has a stronger presence in the literature. Collectively, this body of research reveals that urbanization and GEC interactions occur at multiple spatial and temporal scales, and that these interactions are complex, diverse, and dynamic (Seto et al., 2016). For example, we now have a better understanding of urban areas as complex, dynamic socio-ecological systems that are interlinked and teleconnected with respect to land changes; food, energy and water system flows; economic (e.g., foreign direct investment and global trade), information and technology flows; and human mobility (Pickett et al., 2001; Seto et al., 2012b). Increasing urbanization processes and climate change uncertainty will continue to modify the environment at multiple scales by altering the hydrological and carbon cycles, land use and cover, and biodiversity (Grimm et al., 2008a), with clear and often unequal implications for urban communities and populations, particularly in developing countries (Satterthwaite et al., 2007). Profound environmental changes occur where urbanization is rapid (e.g., Sub-Saharan Africa; East and Southeast Asia) (UNDESA, 2014), but poverty and lack of infrastructure and social/governance institutions make it difficult to cope (Parnell et al., 2007).</p> <p>There is a large, urgent opportunity to influence the urbanization trajectory and underlying processes that result in urban built infrastructure and supporting systems before irreversibility and lock-in occur (Romero-Lankao et al., 2014a).
