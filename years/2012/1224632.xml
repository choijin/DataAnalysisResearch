<AbstractNarration>University of Pittsburgh doctoral student, Nora C. Bridges, supervised by Dr. Kathleen M. DeWalt, will undertake 12 months of field research on how indigenous people inform and build local knowledge of health remedies in a context of increasing engagement with diverse outsiders. She will investigate whether and to what degree local knowledge is a resource through which, 1) health is maintained, 2) indigenous identity is asserted, and 3) sociality is supported.  It is hypothesized that agility in local knowledge repertoires provides successful livelihood strategies.  This research seeks to examine the simultaneous roles of innovative production and strategic consumption in the provision of scarce medical resources in increasingly pluralistic settings.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will be carried out among Indigenous Amazonians in the Upper Napo of Ecuador. The researcher will document shifts in local knowledge of remedies shifts across rapidly changing environmental and socioeconomic contexts.   Data collection methods will include structured surveys, formal elicitation techniques, participatory mapping, home garden inventories, in-depth semi-structured interviews, participant observation, and document collection.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will contribute to theories of local knowledge production in contexts where indigenous curing repertoires co-exist with market penetration and altered environments.  In addition to theoretical development, this research is intended to help devise a more sophisticated and nuanced framework to better describe how health decisions are made and scarce resources are allocated in order to enhance human health programs, generate recommendations for sustainable livelihoods, and fortify cultural and biological diversity.  Funding this research also supports the education of a graduate student.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   For indigenous Kichwa women and men, life in Upper Amazonia is characterized not only by significantly altered physical environments but also by rapidly shifting healthscapes.  As ways of life are changing, Kichwa informants argue that their health is threatened and illnesses are exacerbated by the diminishing usage of plant-based remedies. Increasingly complex situations of medical pluralism, the push-pull tension of simultaneous resource extraction and conservation projects, and accelerating market integration produce drastic impacts that narrow primary health care options and hinder access to plant-based medical resources. These extra-local forces transform peopleÆs relations with the forest, river, and garden environments. Because Kichwa actors report that the severely altered environments they live and work in have created health insecurity for them, they are pushed to reinterpret health needs and desires, reorganize local knowledge, and rebuild repertoires of remedies in these contexts of imposed change. Consequently, they confront these challenges by martialing their social and kinship networks to procure plants for remedies via garden cultivation and collection from the forest.               This project centers attention on therapeutic decision-making, lay healing knowledge and techniques, and intracultural variation in knowledge and practice related to plant-based remedies in Napo Province, Ecuador. The objectives of this project are to document the ways in which plant remedies are a resource to maintain health, assert indigenous identity, and strengthen social ties and affective links among family members.  This work showcases the ways in which Napo Kichwa women and men have devised innovative strategies to maintain and iteratively infuse local ethnomedical knowledge and practice during their quests to allocate scarce resources for their own health and that of their family members.               Ethnographic fieldwork was carried out from 2012&mdash;2014 in Napo Province, Ecuador.  The data collection techniques included: a.) household censuses (n = 25); b.) participant observation; c.) shared sensory experiences engaging in livelihood strategies with at least one representative from each household in the study (n = 25); d.) freelisting interviews regarding prevalent illnesses in the community (n = 65) and plant remedies used (n = 65); e.) in-depth semi-structured interviews regarding: life history; perceptions of environmental changes through time; opinions about ecotourism, oil companies, medical specialists (i.e., shamans, midwives, herbalists, etc.) and health clinics; medical decision-making; and the preparation and provision of plant remedies; f.) home garden inventories (n = 9); g.) health profiles and illness histories for each household (n = 25); and h.) extensive interviewing with ten key informants on plant remedies (n = 102).               This research has produced rich data from triangulated qualitative and quantitative methodologies. The freelisting interviews demonstrate the intracultural variation in knowledge of plant remedies.  The findings suggest that the women and men who have married into the study communities are the most knowledgeable ones regarding local knowledge and remedy use. This finding runs counter to the assumption that it is community elders who are the most knowledgeable about medicinal plants. Data from health and illness histories show that many of the residents in the study communities increasingly use health clinic services and their natural medicine usage is perceived as dwindling when compared to ten years ago.  Data from the key informant interviews about plant remedies invited Kichwa perspectives on the implications of using plant remedies in times of illness.  Results suggest that Kichwa women and men do not conceive of the use of plant remedies as an isolated and singular event that transpires solely when illness strikes.  Rather, they consider the use of natural medi...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
