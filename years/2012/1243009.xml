<AbstractNarration>Humans have great ability to affect ecological changes at global scales, yet have had limited success in managing or predicting the outcomes. This failure is worrisome as human populations grow and press the limits of ecological resources and services. Scientific disciplines that should provide insight into solving global problems, including ecology, conservation biology and restoration ecology, have generally looked to the past for guidance about the future. However, it is increasingly recognized that high rates of current change require new perspectives and broader vision. Unfortunately, there have been few efforts to synthesize what is known about managing change into the future and the conservation challenges that result. This conference will bring together international, national and regional leaders from the relevant management and scientific communities to  address current and anticipated future conservation and management challenges, using the southeastern United States as a case study for developing a regional conservation plan. This region has noteworthy biological diversity, rapidly increasing human populations, rapid urbanization, long history of commodities production, and mostly privately owned land with critically important, but sparse public land.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Future regional conservation efforts must include diverse interests with the common goal of blending economic and ecological well-being. This conference builds on the Jones Center mission to understand, demonstrate and promote excellence in natural resource management and conservation in the southeast. It is an interdisciplinary  partnership  between the Center, the U.S. Department of Agriculture Forest Service Southern Research Station, The Odum School of Ecology at the University of Georgia, and the Department of Defence Strategic and Environmental Research Development Program. Participants will identify gaps in current knowledge and develop strategies for managing social, political, economic and ecological systems to deal with critical conservation challenges. Focus will be on the synthesis of understanding at regional to international scales, applications of science to regional planning, and prioritization of approaches to meet regional conservation challenges.  Outcomes and anticipated products of the conference will reflect and benefit from the breadth of the participants.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Project Outcomes Report  Award Title: Conservation and Natural Resource Management in an Uncertain Future: Using the Southeastern U.S. as a Model for Managing Change.  Federal Award ID: 12340009  Human industry and development have had such an effect on the Earth System, altering atmospheric chemistry, the cycling of nutrients, and the distribution of land cover, that many argue we have entered the "Anthropocene" or a geologic epoch of human domination.  These changes have reshaped the distribution, species composition and function of ecosystems in ways that are often not predicted and sometimes considered undesirable.  This failure to anticipate or manage change presents significant challenges as human populations grow, develop and approach the limits of ecological resources and services (clean water, crop production, forest products, and wildlife habitat).  Disciplines centered on environmental problem solving - applied ecology, conservation biology, and restoration ecology - have generally looked to the past for guidance.  However, the current rate of change requires new approaches and broader vision.  Unfortunately, few efforts have attempted to synthesize what is known about managing future change or ways to address the conservation challenge it presents.  We organized a conference that brought together international, national, and regional leaders to address anticipated conservation and management challenges.  We used the southeastern United States as a model.  This region is an illustrative example.  It has noteworthy biological diversity, increasing human populations, rapid urbanization, and a long history of commodities production.  The majority of the land is privately owned, with critically important, but sparse public land.  Future conservation efforts must include management of diverse interests with the goal of integrating social economic and ecological well-being.  The conference had three institutional partners, the J.W. Jones Ecological Research Center, the USDA Forest Service Southern Station, and the Odum School of Ecology University of Georgia, to ensure broad perspectives.  During the conference, participants identified gaps in current knowledge and developed strategies for managing social, political, economic, and ecological systems to deal with critical conservation challenges.  Students from the Grady College of Journalism at the University of Georgia participated in the conference.  Three student reporters attended and approximately eight others helped build a conference news website (envtjour.uga.edu/recent-projects-3/landscape-change-in-the-south-east/).  The students also created a video that articulated the key points raised in the conference.  Social media were included in the website to allow for a continuing interest and public participation in the website.  By exposing the next generation of journalists to key ecological issues in the southeast, this conference has begun a long-term investment in reaching a wider public.  Graduate students from ecology, forestry, wildlife, and conservation programs at southeastern universities were able to attend the conference at subsidized rates and free housing.  Graduate students were given an opportunity to present posters of their work and attend all conference activities.  Following the conference, an editorial group was formed to synthesize conference discussions and develop a formal communication.  This resulted in the writing of a synthesis article that is being published in Forest Ecology and Management, a leading journal among ecologists, managers, and conservationists.  The article proposes a new model for conservation and management planning based on the development of Achievable Future Conditions (AFC) at broad landscape scales.  The core of this approach is to develop scenarios, that are views of the future, based on projections of climate, human population growth, and land development trends.  It then uses estimates of risk to determine the vu...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
