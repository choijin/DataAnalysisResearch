<AbstractNarration>This workshop responds to the growing interest in reconciling the study of sociolinguistic variation with syntactic theory. These vital subfields of scientific inquiry into human language have been estranged virtually since their inception, with longstanding disputes centered on fundamental methodological and theoretical issues. However, recent work has demonstrated that variationist empirical methods are indeed well suited for investigating variable phenomena of relevance to syntactic theorizing, and furthermore that independently motivated models of syntax and morphology have become sufficiently articulated that plausible formal mechanisms of intra- and inter-speaker variation can be proposed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop has dual objectives. The first is to develop explicit strategies for evaluating competing theories of variation and syntax, which requires synthesizing current knowledge and identifying areas of consensus. For example, one influential approach holds that syntactic variation should be analyzed as "multiple grammars", while other accounts have located variable mechanisms in the grammatical architecture itself. The second objective is to stimulate collaborative research beyond the conventional domains of either variationist sociolinguistics or theoretical syntax, for instance second- or first-language acquisition, multi-lingualism/dialectalism, the emergence of new dialects/idiolects, language/dialect attrition or death, heritage languages/dialects, or language processing. The application of refined theoretical concepts and modified empirical methods to these and other exciting topics raises prospects for unification of a greater scope.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To such ends, this workshop brings some of the most prominent scholars on syntactic variation from Europe and North America together with students and young researchers at the 2013 Linguistic Society of America Linguistic Institute at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, an ideal venue for intense cross-disciplinary interaction. In addition to invited speakers, the workshop will feature 30-minute talks, panel commentary, and plenty of time allotted for general discussion.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project funded an academic workshop (conference) on the topic of syntax and variation. Syntax deals with the ways in which languages put words together to form larger units like phrases and sentences. To a large extent, most research on syntax has ignored issues related to variablity related to social factors, instead preferring to build a theory of an ideal non-varying language. The goal of the workshop was to bring together researchers who were working specifically on topics that dealt directly with variablity in syntax. Language variablity is a fundamental fact about how language works, and although much has been discovered by building theories of idealized language, actual variation must ultimately be explained too. The workshop brought together eleven speakers from North America and Europe to present their research to each other and an audience of linguists who were attending the LSA Linguistic Institute July 6-7 2013, a bi-annual summer school run by the Linguistic Society of America.  Hosting the workshop at the LSA Institute ensured a broad cross section of linguists as participants (almost 70 in all).  The workshop was attended by linguists of all levels (undergraduate and graduate students as well as faculty).  The main goal of the workshop was to foster collaboration among different areas of linguistics, particularly those working on sociolinguistic variation as well as those working on formal syntax, since these two areas have traditionally not collaborated extensively. It defnitely achieved this goal, both in terms of speakers and audience.  In the longer term, the workshop has helped to strengthen research in the field of syntax and variation and a permanent yearly conference Formal Ways of Analyzing Variation has now been inaugurated, partially as a result of the the collaborations formed at the workshop.  While there is no direct impact of the workshop on the broader society,  fostering research on language variation can definitely have a positive  impact on society.  Language discrimination whether class based or  ethnicity based remains one of the few areas of publicly tolerated  bigotry, and research which shows how language variation is both  systematic and explainable can help to educate both the public and  educators on the importance of linguistic tolerance along with the  effects that language variation (and teacher's misunderstanding of it)  can have on learning more generally.
