<AbstractNarration>The Biological Pump has long been recognized as an important sink for atmospheric CO2 concentrations through the sequestration of carbon in ocean sediments. The contributions of bacteria to the sequestration of carbon in the ocean reservoir of refractory dissolved organic carbon (RDOC) have only recently been recognized. This process, conceptualized as the Microbial Carbon Pump (MCP), also appears to play a significant role in carbon sequestration and the regulation of atmospheric CO2. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this project, researchers at the University of South Carolina at Columbia will build upon the framework of the MCP to address the following hypotheses: 1) The production and composition of bacterial DOC vary with biological (e.g. community structure) and physicochemical (e.g. nutrients) parameters in the ocean, 2) Bacteria sequester carbon in semi-labile DOC (SDOC) that persists for years to decades in mesopelagic waters, 3) Microbial communities in mesopelagic and bathypelagic waters have the metabolic potential to produce and degrade bacterial DOC. Naturally-occurring bacterial DOC in these waters is very resistant to microbial degradation, 4) Heterotrophic bacteria are the predominant source of bacterial SDOC and RDOC. These hypotheses will be addressed using a combination of field (NW Pacific Ocean and Sargasso Sea) and experimental approaches to investigate spatial variability in the production and decomposition of bacterial DOC and to relate these processes to community structure and environmental conditions. This study will provide estimates of the reservoirs of bacterial SDOC and RDOC in the ocean and critical insights about the ocean carbon cycle and the regulation of atmospheric CO2 concentrations. It will also lay a foundation for addressing how the MCP and bacterial carbon sequestration will respond to climate change. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:   This project will strengthen collaborations between the PI's laboratory and Dr. Hiroshi Ogawa's laboratory at the Atmosphere and Ocean Research Institute in Japan. This collaboration includes participation on a Japanese-sponsored expedition to the North Pacific Ocean aboard the R/V Hakuro maru.   Additionally, it will support a postdoctoral associate and a doctoral student who will participate on research expeditions to the NW Pacific Ocean and Sargasso Sea. Their research will focus on the MCP, and they will present their findings at national conferences in years 2 and 3.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Microorganisms play a dominant role in the ocean carbon cycle through carbon fixation (photosynthesis) and mineralization (respiration).  The balance between these two biological processes influences the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and our climate.  Bacterial respiration is known to be responsible for the mineralization of about half of all the carbon fixed by photosynthesis every year.  Our research investigated the composition and fate of bacterial metabolites that escape mineralization and persist in the ocean.  Very little is known about this recently recognized process, which is important because this process can sequester carbon in the ocean and effectively remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.  Our research used two approaches to investigate the significance of bacterial metabolites in the ocean carbon cycle.  The first approach involved growing marine bacteria in the laboratory and harvesting the dissolved metabolites released into the seawater culture.  State-of-the-art chemical analyses were used to characterize the composition and structure of the bacterial metabolites.  The second approach involved collecting seawater samples form various locations in the ocean and isolating the dissolved molecules to examine their composition and structure using the same state-of-the-art analyses.  The age of the dissolved organic molecules collected from the ocean was estimated from radiocarbon analyses and ranged from hundreds to thousands of years, indicating they can persist in the ocean for millennia.  Comparison of the bacterial metabolites from the laboratory cultures with the dissolved molecules from the ocean demonstrated striking similarities in chemical composition and structure.  This observation is of great significance because it demonstrates that the carbon sequestered in the deep ocean is of biological origin and can be rapidly synthesized by bacteria.  Previous studies suggested the sequestered carbon was predominantly the product of abiotic processes, such as thermal and photochemical alterations.  Our research and findings also generate many new questions about the controls on the ocean carbon cycle.  Graduate and undergraduate students participated in this project along with a postdoctoral associate. All participants engaged in presenting the results of the research at national and regional meetings and conferences.  This project provided critical and invaluable experience for these young and aspiring scientists.       Last Modified: 09/08/2016       Submitted by: Ronald Benner]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
