<AbstractNarration>The focus of this project is to investigate the yields of secondary organic aerosol (SOA) in an environmental chamber as a function of VOC/NOx levels and oxidant exposure. SOA formed from the OH oxidation of organic precursors happens mostly during the daytime. However, NO3 radicals are abundant at night. These elevated NO3 levels can also coincide with elevated levels of VOCs/IVOCs due to lower nighttime boundary layer heights, which may result in significant nighttime SOA formation. The chamber results will be used to model the underlying oxidation mechanisms and to relate them to atmospheric photochemical processes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will provide new insight into the formation of secondary organic particles in the atmosphere and the oxidative aging of these particles. The results are important for understanding how aerosols influence the cooling and heating of the atmosphere and alter climate.</AbstractNarration>

Our NSF projected focused on laboratory studies of the atmospheric particles containing organic matter, which accounts for a significant fraction of all atmospheric particle mass.

Using a small chamber containing a highly reactive atmosphere, these laboratory studies provided measures of the chemical composition and mass yields of organic particles as a function of gas-phase emissions, such as biogenic emissions from plants and anthropogenic emissions from internal combustion engines, and as a function of pre-existing particle chemistries (i.e., common atmospheric inorganic matter).

Observing the particleÆs chemical composition and its changes with particle aging tells us about the processes that control the properties of atmospheric aerosol particles.  In collaboration with multiple national and international collaborators, we investigated the phase state (i.e., liquid or solid) of these organic particles, their capacity to absorb gas-phase water under high relative humidity conditions, their viscosities and the rate of internal water diffusion, all of which govern the ability of these organic particles to form cloud droplets.
