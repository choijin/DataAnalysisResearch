<AbstractNarration>With this award, the NSF Division of Chemistry supports the National Academy of Sciences in their efforts to develop a workshop on the Culture of Safety.  This workshop will bring physical scientists and administrators together with experts from the social and behavioral sciences communities to determine how to effect a meaningful change in the culture and attitude toward safety in non-industrial chemical research laboratories.  The objective of the workshop is to provide practical guidance on how all participants in the chain of responsibility for laboratory safety can build an environment where safe practice is the expected norm and is routinely given primacy over other research activities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop will meet the need for a more in-depth, interdisciplinary exploration of laboratory safety in non-industrial chemistry laboratories.  It will compare practice in these settings with practice from other sectors known for managing high risk, and with knowledge of the behavioral science literature.  A report on the best practices to create and maintain satisfactory safety culture will be produced.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Culture of Safety Workshop will enhance infrastructure for research through its impacts on improved safety in non-industrial laboratories.  It particular, it will provide information and guidance that will be useful to university administrators, department chairs, and faculty as they seek to build an environment and mindset of safe practice by improving research experiences at both the graduate and undergraduate level.  Society at large is expected to benefit by reducing the risks to individuals and communities from unsafe lab practices and by enabling a cadre of researchers who are better prepared to assume positions in private sector research.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Recent serious and sometimes fatal accidents in chemical research laboratories at United States universities have driven government agencies, professional societies, industries, and universities themselves to examine the culture of safety in research laboratories. These incidents have triggered a broader discussion of how serious incidents can be prevented in the future and how best to train researchers and emergency personnel to respond appropriately when incidents do occur. As the priority placed on safety increases, many institutions have expressed a desire to go beyond simple compliance with regulations to work toward fostering a strong, positive safety culture: affirming a constant commitment to safety throughout their institutions, while integrating safety as an essential element in the daily work of laboratory researchers.  The National Research Council report, Safe Science: Promoting a Culture of Safety in Academic Chemical Research, examines the culture of safety in research institutions and makes recommendations for university leadership, laboratory researchers, and environmental health and safety professionals to support safety as a core value of their institutions. While the report is focused primarily on academic chemistry laboratories, there are a wide variety of environments both in and outside academia that may benefit from the recommendations made herein. Presidents, chancellors, and provosts should discuss safety frequently and publicly and demonstrate through their actions that safety is a core value of the institution. They should deploy university resources in ways that support safety and reduce existing disincentives to safety practice&mdash;for example, by paying for personal protective equipment and hazardous waste disposal, so that PIs do not have to pay for such measures out of grant funding.  Each institution should have a comprehensive risk management plan for laboratory safety that addresses prevention, mitigation, and emergency response. In addition, provosts should work with faculty governance to incorporate efforts to foster a strong, positive safety culture as an element in the criteria for promotion, tenure, and salary decisions for faculty. Vice presidents for research and deans of schools and colleges should, in addition to deploying funds in ways that support safety, ensure that the lines of research undertaken by the institution are ones it has the capacity to perform safely.

For example, they should encourage open dialog about safety concerns among researchers in their labs, and establish regular times&mdash;such as "safety moments" at the beginning of lab meetings&mdash;where concerns can be raised. Establishing ongoing measures to support safety, such as unannounced walk-through inspections and non-punitive reporting systems for near misses, is also important. Department chairs, meanwhile, should work to build strong and cooperative relationships between their departments and EHS. EHS professionals should partner with...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
