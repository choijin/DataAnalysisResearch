<AbstractNarration>This award funds the research activities of Professors Adam Leibovich and Ayres Frietas at the University of Pittsburgh. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is currently taking the data at a remarkable rate. This data will allow particle physicists to probe the "Standard Model", which is the best current understanding of the fundamental interactions and building blocks of matter.  Since the LHC is taking data at a higher energy than has previously been explored, it is possible that physics beyond the Standard Model will be discovered.  This project will in part focus on signatures for beyond-the-Standard-Model physics that can be probed at the LHC.  The goal is to find ways to determine properties of new non-Standard Model particles, such as mass and spin, even if we do not know what the new physics happens to be. This project will also focus on theoretical techniques to improve calculations of various particle-physics signals, including calculating higher-order perturbative corrections, summing infinite series of corrections, and pursuing path-integral techniques. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is also envisioned to have significant broader impacts.  The proposed project is well suited for the participation of students at different levels, allowing them to acquire knowledge and skills in theoretical physics, mathematical methods, computer programming and data analysis.  This project also has important connections to experimental high-energy physics and cosmology, thus strengthening synergistic effects between these different fields of specialization.  Finally, the calculational techniques studied here also have applications in other fields of physics, such as general relativity and fluid dynamics.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In order to understand the data that is generated at the world's different particle colliders, in particular at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and other particle physics and astroparticle physics experiments, it is necessary to make the most precise theoretical calculations possible.  The experiments at the LHC are designed to teach us about the building blocks of nature: the fundamental particles that build up everything around us and the interactions between these particles.  Our understanding of these fundamental particles and interactions is summarized in the "Standard Model of Particle Physics" (SM).    The SM describes almost all observations that have been made at particle colliders, but it is known to be incomplete.  For instance, it does not include gravity, dark matter, dark energy, and neutrino masses.  The goal of particle physics is to obtain a more complete picture of nature that encompasses both the SM and the missing pieces.    To do this, experiments are performed at very high energies and very high beam intensities, in order to be able to discover new heavy and weakly interacting particles.  To discriminate a new physics signal from the SM in the experimental data, precise calculations are needed.  The goals of and outcomes from this grant contributed to this objective by developing computational techniques, applying them to make more accurate calculations, and testing predictions for possible new physics signatures within and beyond the SM against a number of experimental and theoretical constraints.  Without these precise calculations, it would not be possible to identify hints of the new physics needed to explain the missing pieces, such as dark matter.  Therefore, a strong theoretical program is required to complement the experimental program being carried out at the world's particle colliders.    More specifically, the main outcomes from the grant include the following:  (a) signature-based analysis of new physics signals at the LHC with minimal model assumptions, with a focus on characteristic features that can help to identify the underlying physics mechanisms and to distinguish them from the SM; (b) precise calculations of electroweak boson production and decay, including higher-order (two-loop) corrections, that are sensitive to indirect new physics effects; (c) developing new calculational techniques to reduce the uncertainty of theoretical calculations and to systematically include the numerically dominant corrections; (d) improved predictions for SM particle production processes at the LHC that may shed light on the details of the recently discovered Higgs boson and on the peculiar pattern of quark masses and mixings; (e) the proposition of new experimental signatures at the LHC that are sensitive to well-motivated classes of new-physics models.  The results have been published in leading scientific journals and have been presented and discussed at a number of national and international conferences. In addition, newly developed computer programs for the evaluation of precision calculations have been made publicly available and can be freely used by other researchers.  The grant supported the training of graduate students and postdocs.  Also, some of the project outcomes have had an impact on experimental efforts of the LHC collaborations, in particular related to fragmenting jet functions and new physics signatures motivated by the anomaly of the muon's magnetic moment. In addition, Freitas' work on electroweak precision observables has led to him playing a leadership role in ongoing efforts to study the physics goals and capabilities of future high-luminosity e+e- colliders (ILC, FCC-ee, CEPC).
