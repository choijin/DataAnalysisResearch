<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project proposes to develop and commercialize an&lt;br/&gt;active driving aid that enables semi-autonomous, cooperative navigation of an electric-powered wheelchair&lt;br/&gt;(EPW) both indoors and in dynamic, outdoor environments. It uses intelligent sensing and drive control&lt;br/&gt;systems that work in cooperation with the driver to aid in negotiating changing terrain, avoiding obstacles/&lt;br/&gt;collisions, and maintaining a straight path. Additionally, the system allows for higher-level path planning&lt;br/&gt;and the autonomous execution of non-linear routes of travel in a safe and efficient manner. The goal of&lt;br/&gt;the project is to enable active, safe, and independent living. The innovation is that as an individual begins to&lt;br/&gt;lose cognitive, perceptive, or motor function ? due to age, injury, or disease ? the system can augment that&lt;br/&gt;loss because it can interpret the user?s intent and it can ?see? out into the environment on their behalf. This&lt;br/&gt;exteroceptive sensing capability is enabled by leveraging the latest in 3D imaging technology. The team will&lt;br/&gt;exploit their experience in commercializing smart-EPW technologies (including acquiring FDA approval),&lt;br/&gt;and will apply the knowledge they have gained in developing autonomous driving solutions through their&lt;br/&gt;participation in the DARPA Urban Challenge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will have significant impacts in the U.S. Socially,&lt;br/&gt;it will have a direct positive effect on the quality of life and independence of the elderly and disabled.&lt;br/&gt;Leveraging robotics for personal mobility can help Americans with disabilities to participate fully in basic&lt;br/&gt;activities such as employment, education, worship, recreation, and other activities of community life often&lt;br/&gt;taken for granted. Economically, a serious side effect of the rapidly growing elder population, to over 70&lt;br/&gt;million by 2030, is that it will place unprecedented strains on the U.S. healthcare system. This impact can&lt;br/&gt;be moderated in part by enabling individuals to maintain their independence and live at home longer. It is&lt;br/&gt;estimated that adding a single month of independence and health to America?s elder population would save&lt;br/&gt;$5 billion, while decreasing hospitalization and institutionalization 10% would save $50 billion annually.&lt;br/&gt;As a result, technology for home-centered approaches to healthcare, such as the proposed system, are necessary.&lt;br/&gt;In research terms, while the immediate focus is in the field of assistive robotics, this research will be&lt;br/&gt;extendable to general field and service robotics as much of the work is related to 3D perception.</AbstractNarration>
