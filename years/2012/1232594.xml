<AbstractNarration>Lightning, the massive dielectric breakdown of the atmosphere that occurs during thunderstorms, is a dramatic process that demands study and explanation.  The mechanisms that cause lightning and the mechanisms by which lightning proceeds in storms are complex and still areas of active study.  In fact, understanding lightning is considered one of the great-unsolved problems of atmospheric physics.  This research seeks to investigate a particularly intriguing feature of lightning that was verified experimentally only recently - the production of X-rays by lightning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To achieve this goal, an array of 10 X-Ray/lightning detectors will be built and deployed at Monmouth College and at high schools throughout western Illinois and eastern Iowa, which will accumulate lightning, X-ray, E-field and atmospheric data for long time periods.  There is clear evidence that a large ground based detector array can measure X-ray spectra from natural lightning.   When the resulting spectra are combined with electric field and meteorological data, significant understandings of lightning, lightning generated X-rays and the storms that produce them can be obtained.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: &lt;br/&gt;The goal of this research is to measure the energy spectrum of natural lightning while recording data on electric field strength and meteorological data.  The following specific and important questions will be addressed in this study.&lt;br/&gt;1) What is the energy spectrum of natural lightning generated X-rays?&lt;br/&gt;2) Which storms produce lightning generated X-rays, which don't, and how are they different?&lt;br/&gt;3) How can the energy spectrum of lightning generated X-rays and environmental conditions be used to understand how lightning is generated?&lt;br/&gt;4) How can the energy spectrum of lightning generated X-rays be used to test models of lightning formation and propagation?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: &lt;br/&gt;By measuring the X-ray spectra while recording other data, significant contributions to understanding lightning and the storms that form lightning can be made.  These data will be an important part of advancing this understanding.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project also has broad impact through its outreach component.  Undergraduate and high-school students will play an active role in both taking and analyzing data.  This study will collect data for extended periods of time at many locations and provides a small undergraduate college a considerable outreach opportunity.  Research experiences like this are sound pedagogy and will allow college faculty to engage students in new and creative ways.</AbstractNarration>

In spite of the ubiquity of lightning (it is common on earth and has been observed in other planetary atmospheres), the initiation and propagation of lightning are still not well understood.&nbsp; To study lightning, storms, and how the atmosphere works, in this study we watch the skies over northern Illinois, eastern Iowa, and northern Indiana in a different part of the electromagnetic spectrum.&nbsp; Rather than watching the sky in the visible spectrum as we can do with our eyes, we watch in the X-Ray/Gamma Ray energy range.&nbsp; As we see different processes in the universe when we do radio astronomy rather than visible astronomy, when we watch the atmosphere in a different way, we expect to observe and learn new things.&nbsp; In particular, recent data indicate that some lightning produces X-rays. By watching storms in this high-energy, shorter wavelength regime (at photon energies up to 1600 keV at multiple locations), we hope to understand more about how they evolve as they pass over the countryside.&nbsp; To do this, we built and deployed detector packages to measure photons with energies up to 1600 keV while recording meteorological data like barometric pressure, temperature and relative humidity.&nbsp; Our detectors, deployed at high schools and colleges, run for as close to 24/7 as we can make them run.
