<AbstractNarration>This collaborative research grant investigates new optimization models for determining resource allocation decisions of law enforcement to interdict illegal drug networks.  These decisions focus on scheduling the activities of law enforcement in order to successfully monitor, target, and arrest criminals in an illegal drug network.  These decisions will be modeled using a novel dynamic interdiction framework and a Markov Decision Process framework.  The proposed models specifically incorporate the need to balance intelligence operations, which help to identify new criminals and build cases against known high-ranking criminals, and physical interdictions, which remove criminals from the network.   Specialized constraint programming-based optimization algorithms will be proposed and integrated into traditional integer programming techniques in order to exploit the structure of the scheduling decisions associated with identifying, targeting, and arresting criminals throughout the network to solve the proposed models.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the results of this research will provide tools that help to better understand how to utilize scarce law enforcement resources to mitigate illegal drug trafficking.  This includes a better understanding of: (i) how to utilize resources of national agencies (e.g., the Drug Enforcement Agency) across various cities in partnering with local law enforcement,  (ii) how to best diversify the portfolio of criminals that are currently under surveillance by law enforcement, and (iii) how the flow of information between criminals impacts interdiction efforts.   The results of this policy-driven analysis will be shared with practitioners through collaborations with local law enforcement agencies.  The project will engage freshmen engineering students in cutting-edge research and develop their high-performance computing skills by implementing the specialized algorithms on supercomputing resources capable of exploiting decomposition-based solution approaches.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This research has created analytic approaches in order to determine effective resource allocation policies for operations against illegal drug trafficking and other application areas where an ?enemy? is operating an illegal and unwanted supply chain (e.g., nuclear smuggling, gun-running).  The work has resulted in a new algorithmic approach to solving a general class of dynamic models that are applicable in a large of network interdiction settings.  The development provides important comparisons between the characteristics and performance attributes of mathematical programming and constraint programming on an important problem class.  Specifically, this project offers modelers insights into how temporal models in integer programming are/aren?t aided by tools available through the field of computer science in the form of constraint programming and then how to properly integrate the tools of constraint programming and integer programming on dynamic problems.  The work also has demonstrated that reformulation techniques can be created for bi-level programming problems (or interdiction problems) whose inner problems have integer variables.  This is valuable to this field since our reformulation technique shows that you can solve a single-level integer programming problem in order to solve our particular layered network interdiction problem.  This finding offer other researchers insights into how to take advantage of the power of commercial integer programming solvers for difficult bi-level programming problems.     Finally, this research has provide a new mechanism to assess the vulnerability of information, SCADA, and control systems for infrastructure networks that arise from the potential of hackers to attack the cyber components of these systems.
