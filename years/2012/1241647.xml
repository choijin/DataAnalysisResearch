<AbstractNarration>As the cyber threat continues to grow at an exponential pace, the US is challenged to find cybersecurity leaders who are equipped with technical cybersecurity knowledge and an understanding of the organizational phenomena that impact the successful implementation of cybersecurity initiatives. The HOLISTiC (Human &amp; Organizational Learning - Integrated STudies in Cybersecurity) program is meeting this challenge by piloting a doctoral-level Cybercorps program to develop cybersecurity leaders who are able to effectively navigate the complex and unpredictable cybersecurity environment. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;HOLISTiC is being implemented within the George Washington University (GW) Executive Leadership Doctoral Program (ELP) in Human and Organizational Learning (HOL). Working closely with the ELP program faculty and advisors, and through the integration of dissertation research from program entry, students are working toward the completion of doctoral degree requirements in 3 years. The HOLISTiC program is producing 6 cybersecurity leaders who have a strong technical foundation and expertise in key areas such as risk analysis, information management, and organizational change; a portfolio of advanced research and analysis skills; establishing a community of practice that engages students and cybersecurity experts in collective dialogue, and; driving the development of practically-based, rigorous research on cybersecurity challenges that span technical and non-technical areas.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[The purpose of the HOLISTiC Executive CyberCorps Program was to transform cybersecurity technical experts into executive-level managers. The HOLISTiC program was launched to explore three general hypotheses: whether cybersecurity technical experts would benefit from executive leadership education, if the Cyber Corps structure could be applied to doctoral level education, and whether material benefits to the cybersecurity community could be achieved through this effort. The findings from the HOLISTiC experiment address both the intellectual merit and broader impacts of the program and are summarized as follows:  Collective learning in advanced human and organizational theory is a powerful approach for senior personnel to expand their individual capabilities; Teaching "soft" sciences to cybersecurity professionals can make them more effective in executing "hard" science solutions; Teaching research methods and approaches enriches the knowledge bases of cybersecurity leaders; and There is significant and value in the basic concept of taking highly technical individuals and teaching them how to respond to the human factors skills of executive leadership which directly impact how this technology is used.  The HOLISTiC Executive CyberCorps Program was designed to create a specialized doctoral level learning environment in which existing cybersecurity technical experts could explore the meaning of leadership, learn the fundamentals of human and organizational learning, and pursue research in contemporary challenges for cybersecurity?s executive leaders.  In June 2014, six students were accepted into the pilot program. Two students withdrew from the program before completing coursework; one student relocated due to a job change and the second student withdrew due to a significant medical diagnosis. Of the four students remaining at the end of the project period, one student had successfully completed the doctoral program and three students were actively working toward completion of their dissertation research. The executive-style program allowed students to simultaneously study as full-time students and work full-time in career positions. As they developed their skillsets, the "cyberdoc" cohort members met to explore the human and organizational aspects of technical cybersecurity concepts and to present their scholarly work at conferences and technical meetings.  Together, the cyberdocs developed in a strong community of scholar-practitioners. While students expressed initial hesitation to presenting at academic conferences, those same students acknowledged afterward that the professional development requirement was enormously valuable in cementing their internalized understanding of how to communicate their cybersecurity knowledge to diverse audiences. One student recommended that executive coaching would be an excellent addition to the program.  Another student suggested that having more interaction with senior leaders would be a useful addition for possible future cohorts.
