<AbstractNarration>The early and middle Miocene (ca. 23 to 11 million years ago) witnessed an expansion of the world's tropical and subtropical forests, and an increase in the diversity and distribution of mammals that thrived in forests with low seasonality and high productivity. Apes flourished under these conditions in the Old World. The contraction of subtropical forests in the late Miocene in Eurasia resulted in a decline in the diversity and abundance of apes, and the rise of monkeys and other mammals able to survive in more open and seasonal habitats. Several fossil sites in southern China provide evidence of this critical transition.  In this project, the fossil site of Shuitangba, Yunnan Province, China, will be investigated because it has yielded the abundant and well-preserved remains of many mammal species of terminal Miocene age (~6.1 mya). Among them are an ape and a monkey, the first such co-occurrence in the Miocene of Eurasia. Recovery and detailed study of the fossils by an international team of American and Chinese investigators will make possible the characterization of the paleoenvironment of Shuitangba and the nature and adaptations of the site's many species, especially its primates and carnivores. Direct comparison of the Shuitangba biota with others of similar age in eastern Asia will provide a clearer idea of the nature and pace of environmental evolution in the region.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Shuitangba captures a unique snapshot of the transition from the widespread evergreen forests of the Miocene to the more heterogeneous and seasonal habitats that followed. This project thus promotes the understanding of an ecosystem poised at the tipping point of a major change.  The Shuitangba fauna and environment provide an unusually clear picture of a distinctive regional ecosystem that contained long-established species alongside new arrivals.  A better understanding of the adaptations of species within such ecosystems may shed light on the dynamics of modern unstable environments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project fosters strong international collaboration with Chinese scholars, including advanced training for Chinese paleoanthropologists, paleobiologists, and fossil preparators, and promotes public science education in China through media coverage and development of museum displays.  A junior US scientist will be integrally involved in the research, and US undergraduate students also will receive substantial participatory research training.</AbstractNarration>

Intellectual Merit Outcomes   We have deepened our field?s understanding of a terrestrial ecosystem during a critical transitional time period through peer-reviewed publications and presentations that detail the community composition (taxonomy and systematics) and community structure (ecological niche) of the Shuitangba mammalian fauna. Three species previously unknown to science have been described and we have gained insight into the ecological niches that they, and the other taxa at Shuitangba, occupied. We also have a deeper understanding of the paleoenvironment at Shuitangba and how its wet and wooded habitat may have allowed Shuitangba to function as a refugium.  Broader Impact Outcomes  This project has provided opportunities for training and professional development and has contributed to the education and training of undergraduate and graduate students and early career scientists, all of whom are from traditionally under-represented groups in science. The project has also engaged in significant educational and public outreach activities at the Cleveland Museum of Natural History, where the activities and results of the project were disseminated to the general public through lectures, public days, interactions with K-12 students, blog posts, and museum-produced videos. Through the research activities of this project, we have also deepened collaborations between Chinese and American scientists.
