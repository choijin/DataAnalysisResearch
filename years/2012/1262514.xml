<AbstractNarration>A Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Sites award has been made to Oklahoma State University that will provide research training for 10 students, for nine weeks during the summers of 2014-2016. The program will focus on the interdisciplinary science in developing bioenergy and other biobased products. Students will be associated with the Biobased Products and Energy Center which consists of over 20 scientists and engineers representing a wide range of disciplines including microbiology and molecular genetics, plant and soil sciences, biochemistry and molecular biology, and biosystems and agricultural engineering. Students will be conducting full-time lab research as well as participating in seminars and workshops on various topics, such as the collegial work environment, responsible conduct in research, professional communication skills, career opportunities in industry and academia, and the graduate school application process. Students will also be provided tours of other research institutions and local industries, such as the Weatherford Wind Energy Center. Students will gain experience in a wide range of facilities including the DNA/Protein Core Facility, Array and Bioinformatics Core Facility, and Advanced Technology Research Center. Core equipment available includes instrumentation to perform automated DNA sequencing and marking, electrospray mass spectrometers, surface analyzer, scanning electron microscope, and other state-of-the-art analytical machines. Students will be recruited from a variety of institutions, especially those having limited STEM-research opportunities and large populations of underrepresented minorities. Recruitment efforts will be multifaceted, including traditional formats plus videos highlighting students' experiences through the Center's YouTube channel. Students will be selected based on academic achievement, previous research experiences, interest to pursue a career in a STEM-based field, and desire to pursue graduate studies.  Students will be tracked to determine their continued interest in their STEM-based field of study, their career path, and the lasting influences of the research experience. Information about the program will be assessed by various means, including use of an REU common assessment tool available to BIO-funded REU PIs. More information is available by visiting http://bioenergycenter.okstate.edu/reu or by contacting the PI (Dr. Sarah Lancaster at sarah.lancaster@okstate.edu).</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The REU Site&rsquo;s (Interdisciplinary Approach to Sustainable Biobased Products and Energy Development; BIO-1262541) major goal of the project was to introduce students to the interdisciplinary science involved in developing bioenergy and biobased products. Through this award a Bioenergy REU site was set up at Oklahoma State University to provide research experience to students enrolled in non-PhD granting institutes. Another important aspect of the program is that Faculty mentors from the Biobased Products and Energy Center at OSU mentored REU student-driven projects that are integral to well-established research programs. The specific objectives of the project were: 1) Educate students about the scientific processes and procedures required to conduct bioproducts and bioenergy research; 2) Help students understand the importance of an interdisciplinary environment in developing bioproducts and bioenergy production systems; 3) Explore the role of bioproducts and bioenergy research in a global society; 4) Provide students professional skill development opportunities that are necessary for a successful career; and 5) Encourage students to pursue graduate studies and careers in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) related disciplines, specifically those related to biobased products and energy. An interdisciplinary training program, which integrated research and education, rapidly moved undergraduate participants towards intellectual and research independence. Participants improved competence in communication, collaboration, and technical presentation skills. Team-building activities and scientific field trips reinforced the collaborative nature of the program and science in general. Invited speakers provided career mentoring. Culminating annual oral and poster presentations at the university-wide &ldquo;NSF-REU Symposium&rdquo; provided participants with an experience similar to a scientific conference.</p> <p>A total of 30 participants, during summers of 2014-2017, from rising freshman through rising seniors, were recruited from predominantly undergraduate institutions throughout Oklahoma and beyond. Participants engaged in 9-weeks of full-time, joint research efforts with expert faculty advisors. Projects addressed fundamental questions related to bioenergy and biobased products from single celled algae to field crops such as sorghum and switchgrass, improving biomass production through traditional and molecular breeding approaches, identifying organisms for improved conversion of biomass to fuel, and improving biochemical and thermochemical processes for converting biomass to fuels. REU mentees worked in several different research settings such as laboratories, growth chambers, greenhouses, field environments, and pilot scale plants and appreciated the interdisciplinary nature of bioenergy and biobased products. A total of 30 oral and 30 poster presentations were made by the REU students. Involvement in the REU Site increases the likelihood that participants will enroll in graduate level STEM education, thereby improving the scientific workforce of the US.</p> <p>Over the course of the three-year REU Site, 400 applications were received from undergraduates with a demographic makeup of which women, underrepresented minorities, and undergraduates from economically depressed areas were well-represented. Most participants (82%) were sophomores or juniors are seeking additional research training and plan to apply and attend a graduate level training program in a STEM discipline and 100% of students that graduated are now attending graduate schools or have gained employment. The REU students that completed their undergraduate degrees are currently working towards advanced degrees at higher education institutes (e.g. University of Cambridge, Purdue University, Manhattan College), or have been employed (e.g. Chemical Scientist) or continued with additional research training (e.g. EPSCoR Research Internships). Thus, the REU Site: Interdisciplinary Approach to Sustainable Biobased Products and Energy Development was successful in: (i) encouraging students to enroll in graduate school, (ii) broadening participation of students underrepresented in graduate school training, and (iii) increasing the quality and quantity of the US scientific workforce. In addition, past REU participants have contributed to the intellectual research and discovery mission of the US, particularly in the area of bioenergy and biobased products.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 11/29/2017<br>      Modified by: Vijaya Gopal&nbsp;Kakani</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1262514/1262514_10258740_1480589246794_2015_REU--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1262514/1262514_10258740_1480589246794_2015_REU--rgov-800width.jpg" title="2015 Interdisciplinary Approach to Sustainable Bioenergy"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1262514/1262514_10258740_1480589246794_2015_REU--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="2015 Interdisciplinary Approach to Sustainable Bioenergy"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Research Training in an Interdisciplinary Environment at Oklahoma State University</div> <div class="imageCredit">Gopal Kakani</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Royalty-free (unrestricted use)</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Vijaya Gopal&nbsp;Kakani</div> <div class="imageTitle">2015 Interdisciplinary Approach to Sustainable Bioenergy</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1262514/1262514_10258740_1480588826540_2014_REU--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1262514/1262514_10258740_1480588826540_2014_REU--rgov-800width.jpg" title="2014 Interdisciplinary Approach to Syustainable Bioenergy"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1262514/1262514_10258740_1480588826540_2014_REU--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="2014 Interdisciplinary Approach to Syustainable Bioenergy"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Understanding the Interdisciplinary nature of STEM through field trips</div> <div class="imageCredit">Gopal Kakani</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Royalty-free (unrestricted use)</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Vijaya Gopal&nbsp;Kakani</div> <div class="imageTitle">2014 Interdisciplinary Approach to Syustainable Bioenergy</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1262514/1262514_10258740_1480588465473_2016_REU--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1262514/1262514_10258740_1480588465473_2016_REU--rgov-800width.jpg" title="2016 Bioenergy REU Activities at Oklahoma State University"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1262514/1262514_10258740_1480588465473_2016_REU--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="2016 Bioenergy REU Activities at Oklahoma State University"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Interdisciplinary Approach for Sustainable Bioenergy (2016)</div> <div class="imageCredit">Gopal Kakani</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Royalty-free (unrestricted use)</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Vijaya Gopal&nbsp;Kakani</div> <div class="imageTitle">2016 Bioenergy REU Activities at Oklahoma State University</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
