<AbstractNarration>The nonlocal dielectric approach can significantly enhance the classic Poisson dielectric model by considering the polarization correlations among water molecules. However, current studies on the approach are mostly restricted to the water solvent, due to modeling and algorithmic complications that arise in the case of ionic solvents. The current ionic models that do exist fail to incorporate crucial nonlocal dielectric effects. Recent developments also indicate that entropic changes due to protein-ligand association are critical to understanding binding affinity. The computation of entropy, however, remains a very difficult task. Motivated by these challenges, this project aims to develop new nonlocal continuum electrostatic models and new numerical quadratures for the direct calculation of entropy and free energy for protein in ionic solvent. The new nonlocal models will be constructed from a novel combination of the nonlocal dielectric approach with the fundamental measure theory of hard-sphere mixture fluids under the constrained functional optimization protocol. They are expected to significantly improve the accuracy of electrostatic potential calculations in comparison to the classic Poisson-Boltzmann equation, since they reflect both ionic size effects and polarization correlations among water molecules. The new numerical quadratures will be developed by using a special prismatic element interpolation constructed from a prismatic mesh of a bounded state region near a potential energy minimum point. The computing complexity will be further reduced through using a new nonlocal model for computing involved electrostatic potential. Lastly, new fast numerical algorithms and program packages will be developed for solving the new dielectric models and for implementing the new numerical quadratures.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Calculation of electrostatic potential energy, entropy, and free energy for protein in ionic solvent is a fundamental task in biomolecular simulations. The new nonlocal dielectric models, numerical quadratures for computing entropy and free energy, and the accompanying efficient numerical algorithms and program packages produced from this project will be a considerable contribution to the fields of mathematical biology, computational biochemistry, computational mathematics, and computer science. They will play important roles in ion channel studies, rational drug design, and other bioengineering applications, and will improve our quantitative understanding of critical physiological processes, cellular energetics, and affinity in protein-ligand binding, and of health and disease in general.  The findings from this project are expected to have a significant impact on the development of mathematics, computer science, biochemistry, and bioengineering.  Because there has been substantial interest recently in algorithms for solving high-dimensional problems, any advances made in this project will have broad potential impact in a variety of areas that are related to high-dimensional integrals with integrands that decay exponentially.</AbstractNarration>

Furthermore, we show that the Fermi distribution is a set of optimal ionic concentration functions in the sense of minimizing an electrostatic potential free energy. Numerical results are reported to show the difference between a Poisson-Fermi solution and a corresponding Poisson solution.  Another important outcome is the establishment of a new web server, called SMPBS, to distribute our efficient finite element software packages for solving a size modified Poisson-Boltzmann equation (SMPBE) to the public domain. It is the first web server for computing biomolecular electrostatics  in count of ionic size effects. Since SMPBE not only reflects ionic size effects but also includes the classic Poisson-Boltzmann equation as a special case, its web server SMPBS is expected to have a broader range of applications than a PBE web server.   We exposed most of the parameters for mesh generations and solvers to allow a user to save the results and mesh data. In this way, our web server can be a valuable education tool for scientist and students to study the properties of SMPBE and explore the performance of our two solvers.  We were excited that the first nonlinear nonlocal dielectric  model, called the nonlocal modified Poisson-Boltzmann equation (NMPBE), which was developed in this project, was pulished on the Journal of Computational Physics [ Vol. 322 (2016), pp. 1-20]. We plan to construct a web server for our NMPBE software package, and release it by the early of 2017. Consequently, this new model can be applied to protein simulation, playing important roles in the prediction of biomolecular electrostatics.   More outcomes have been reported in our project final report.        Last Modified: 10/19/2016       Submitted by: Dexuan Xie]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
