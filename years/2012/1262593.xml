<AbstractNarration>An award is made to Carnegie Mellon University to develop evolutionary models, algorithms, and software for multidomain protein families.  These families evolve through the insertion, duplication, and deletion of domains, sequences that encode discrete structural units that are the building blocks of protein function.   The emergence of novel domain combinations drives the evolution of functional variation and interaction specificity in protein families that perform core molecular functions.  Multidomain families are of central importance throughout life.  In bacteria, multidomain families encode the two-component kinase signaling systems that are the back-bone of cellular communication.  In eukaryotes, multidomain families are implicated in tissue repair, cell death, inflammation response, antigen recognition, and innate immunity.  This project will develop a computational framework for reconstructing the evolutionary history of a multidomain family, including the domain events that gave rise to present-day proteins, the ancestral domain architectures from which they evolved, and a tree describing the history of the family as a whole.  This new framework will comprise a formal, event-based model of multidomain family evolution; algorithms for inferring domain events and the ancestral domain content of a given family; and an implementation of these algorithms in prototype software for inference and visualization of multidomain protein histories.  Because this approach considers domain sequence, as well as domain content, and incorporates an explicit model of events, it promises a dramatic increase in accuracy and detail.  &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The results of this project will enable evolutionary biologists to investigate the processes of protein evolution, bench biologists to identify appropriate experimental targets, and cell biologists to complement experimental results with evolutionary analyses.  This project will contribute to educational resources through the development of teaching materials on multidomain evolution for an undergraduate course, a graduate course, and a workshop on "Developing Bioinformatics Programs at Minority Schools."  This one week workshop is part of a Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center initiative to develop new bioinformatics programs at minority-serving institutions. This project will also provide research training for undergraduate and graduate students at the interface between biology and computer science.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The objective of this project was to develop evolutionary models, algorithms and software for multidomain proteins, mosaics of sequence fragments that encode protein modules: structural or functional units called domains.  Because of their modular nature, multidomain proteins play central roles in allowing cells to communicate with other cells and with their environment.  Multidomain families are the workhorse of cellular communication in prokaryotes and provide the "glue" required for multicellularity in animals.  In human health, multidomain families are implicated in tissue repair, apoptosis, inflammation response, and innate immunity.  Understanding the evolutionary history of a protein can provide the key to understanding its function.  For multidomain families this requires reconstructing the history of insertion, internal duplication, and deletion of domains.  This has crucial consequences for predicting protein function, because gain, loss, or replacement of a domain can result in an immediate and dramatic change in how the protein interacts with other cellular components.  Current methods are unable to detect such domain replacements.  For this project, we developed a powerful and innovative approach to reconstructing the evolutionary history of multidomain proteins.  Software implementing these new algorithms, with a user manual and example data sets, has been made publically available.  Unlike current methods, our framework is based on a model that considers domain sequence, as well as domain content, and incorporates an explicit model of events.  Our reconstruction algorithms can thus infer the correspondence between domain architecture evolution and gene and species evolution, the domain duplications, insertions, deletions and transfers that gave rise to present-day proteins, and the ancestral domain architectures from which they evolved.  As a demonstration of the power of our approach, we analyzed the Membrane-associated Guanylate Kinase (Maguk) family of multidomain scaffolding proteins, which plays important roles in cell-cell communication and adhesion.  Our analysis reveals an on-going process of gain, loss and replacement of domains in Maguk protein evolution.  These results, which could not have been obtained with current methods, contradict prior claims that the same modular architecture rarely forms more than once in evolutionary history.  Our results suggest that domain architectures may be much more plastic than previously thought, call for the reexamination of current theories of multidomain protein evolution using more information-rich approaches, and provide a foundation for more accurate evolution-based protein function prediction.  This project contributed to national scientific resources in the form of new, publically available software.  It has provided research training for undergraduate and doctoral students and postdoctoral fellows.  It has also been the basis of teaching materials used in the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center?s Summer Institute in Bioinformatics, an initiative to assist faculty from minority-serving institutions to develop new curricula and degree/certificate programs in bioinformatics.
