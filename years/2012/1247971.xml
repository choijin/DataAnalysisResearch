<AbstractNarration>This INSPIRE award is partially funded by the Perception, Action, and Cognition Program and the Social Psychology Program in the Division of Behavioral and Cognitive Sciences in the Directorate for Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences, and the Human-Centered Computing Program in the Division of Information and Intelligent Systems in the Directorate for Computer and Information Science and Engineering.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The notion of collective wisdom - that many interacting individuals can produce better ideas, insights, solutions and decisions than a single individual can produce - is a foundational principle for many institutions of modern societies, including elections, parliaments, governing boards, free markets and the free press. Until recently, such collective wisdom could only be harnessed through massive unstructured mechanisms such as elections and markets, or through highly structured and interactive but smaller-scale mechanisms such as legislatures, committees, boards and panels. With the advent of the Internet, the World-Wide Web and social network technology, the paradigm has changed. It is now possible for large numbers of diverse, geographically distant individuals to interact in structured ways and at almost no cost. This has opened up vast possibilities for innovation and creativity, but these possibilities are still largely unrealized. A major reason for this is the lack of a systematic scientific understanding of collective innovation in human networks. The current project addresses this through a combination of methods from several disciplines, bringing together a unique group of researchers with expertise in social psychology, cognitive science, computer science, engineering and network theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The fundamental principle underlying the research is that an understanding of natural human innovation requires a coordinated combination of laboratory and field studies and that neither is sufficient on its own. Field studies of innovative human networks (communities of research scholars and engineers) will be used to identify natural patterns of innovation through data mining and intelligent analysis methods. Laboratory experiments will then verify and validate these patterns under controlled conditions. Thus, through a combination of large-scale fieldwork and careful experiments, the investigators will develop better metrics for measuring innovation and discover ways to help groups and individuals be more innovative. Most importantly, this project will clarify how the connectivity of individuals in a network acts to boost or suppress innovation, leading to recommendations for making human networks from corporations to social networks more innovative.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recent studies suggest that the rate of innovation must increase exponentially to sustain a growing and urbanizing global society. While the proposed research will focus on specific areas, the methods it generates will inform organizations and governments broadly in developing policies conducive to innovation. In today's fast-moving, highly competitive world, such policies are likely to be a major determinant of scientific, technological and geopolitical leadership.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit:  The major goal of this research project was to understand how innovation happens in human networks: What factors &ndash; including behaviors and social interaction patterns - underlie such innovation? What distinguishes innovative individuals or groups from non-innovative ones? Is it possible to detect "signatures" of creativity through computational methods? To achieve this goal, the project followed two tracks: a) Track 1 involved analyzing digital text data that is expected to be rich in innovative ideas; and b) Track 2 involved studying the behavior of small to medium-sized groups in the laboratory as they tried to solve problems requiring creativity.

Over the five years of the research, which involved five senior investigators and 25 graduate and undergraduate students, produced several important outcomes, and has so far resulted in 33 publications and 34 presentations all over the world. Many more results and publications are likely to be produced in the next two years as more data is analyzed.  Several extremely valuable data sets  will continue to be analyzed for at least the next two or three years and are expected to yield very important insights about the process of collective innovation. One of these data sets includes almost 8,000 research papers written over 20 years in one of the currently most exciting fields of research: Artificial intelligence. Another data set provides citation and collaboration linkages between researchers as expressed in thousands of research papers in the field of electronic circuit design. And finally, interaction patterns and ideas produced by hundreds of participants in five extensive experimental studies over five years have been logged, annotated and archived in the third collection of data. Together, these data sets provide a unique resource to study innovation over many scales.  The research also resulted in the development of computational models and software tools, including the following:  Extracting      causal relationships between designs to study how designs influence each      other and trigger innovation.   Extracting      ideas from large sets of documents such as collections of research papers,      news reports, etc.   Analyzing      very large amounts of longitudinal text data to understand how ideas      emerge, evolve, merge, and split over time as they percolate through large      communities of human thinkers.    Discovering      the structure of thought underlying the composition of text documents and      conversations.   Analyzing      how relationships evolve in a scientific community through the citation of      each other?s work by researchers in the community.    Studying      how ideas spread within communities with different social structure, and      how this triggers the generation of new ideas in the minds of individual      agents within the community.   Analysis of the data obtained from computational simulations real-world sources, and laboratory experiments have already yielded several important insights:  Creative (poetic) texts have a different      pattern of association between words than non-poetic ones.   Text is typically composed in blocks of      sentences, and the mean number of sentences in a block is consistently      between 6 and 7.   Peer      learning and innovation in social networks depends significantly on whom      people choose to be influenced by but not much on the structure of the social      network.    Highly cited papers come exclusively from research groups with a large number of publications.   Age and gender diversity in small brainstorming groups produces fewer creative ideas, while diversity of opinion generates more interaction and more novel ideas.    Creativity depends less on the number of ideas generated and more on how much the group discusses each generated idea.    Computational analysis of data from      brainstorming experiments revealed several interesting results: 1) In      brainstorming by several individuals or groups, only a few individuals or      groups generate a large proportion of the ideas and most generate very few;      2) A high-performance group needs at least one high-performer while      low-performing groups consist mainly of low-performance individuals; 3)      Ideas generated early in a group brainstorming session tend to be more      emotionally laden and have greater influence on the final outcome; 4) It      may be possible for machine-learning based methods to automatically estimate      the novelty of ideas generated by brainstorming.      Broader Impacts:  The research in this project has resulted in the training of many students in interdisciplinary research, many of whom will have impacts in diverse fields. The methods and outcomes have the potential to improve brainstorming strategies, provide computational platforms for more efficient brainstorming, suggest ways to encourage creativity through educational methods, automatically discover knowledge and information from large amounts of text data, lead to more innovative organizations, and help explain how both good ideas and misinformation spreads across communities.
