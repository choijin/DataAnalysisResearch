<AbstractNarration>This project will develop a series of lab exercises comprising a senior-level undergraduate or introductory graduate lab course on fundamental design issues of wireless networks and technologies. Over the course of this lab sequence, students will practice designing, implementing and running wireless experiments using the GENI wireless testbed infrastructure. These labs enable student to learn wireless networks protocols and technologies by working with real systems and evaluating wireless schemes in real conditions, instead of relying on the 'protected' environment of software simulations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Through building protocols on a real platform, students will understand the challenges in the design of wireless systems and the approaches and techniques that are used today, and will become familiar with open research issues in the wireless field. They will learn how to resolve realistic issues and how to design algorithms that work in practical situations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The outcome of the project will be a set of materials (including a lab manual, disk images, experiment scripts, software, and slides) that can be used by academic institutions throughout the US, together with the integrated GENI wireless facilities, to supplement traditional courses on wireless networks with a hands-on lab component.  All data generated as part of the proposed effort will be electronically disseminated using the portal of the WiTEST Lab in NYU-Poly and on the GENI.net website. Developed software and results of the lab development will be made available in the open-source format and will be free for academic use. Educational materials will be announced on the web site and will be shared with academic colleagues upon request.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In this project, we have developed a set of prepared experiments on a range of topics, including: wireless link adaptation, IP mobility, TCP congestion control, adaptive video streaming, wireless signal propagation, software defined radio, and QoS of wireless networks. Each experiment is designed to show a side of computer networks that wouldnÃ†t usually be covered in textbooks and classroom lectures, and to highlight the differences between the simplified models taught to students and the behavior of real networks.  These experiments run on GENI wireless resources, part of a distributed computer networks research infrastructure deployed at university campuses across the United States. These resources are open to all researchers and educators, including those who don't have GENI deployments on their own campus. Students using our lab exercises access our research-grade wireless networking infrastructure, no matter where they are located.   In their feedback, students consistently refer to three favorite parts of the lab experience: (1) Collecting their own data on a real network, (2) Plotting data using built-in tools, and (3) Running an experiment to answer a question that is relevant to their own lives. Comments include:  "I liked that we can find ourselves the answer to a question after experimentation."  "This lab was very interesting because of how I encounter these problems in real life."  "Getting our own dedicated cellular network was pretty cool."  "I liked that I see the real time measurements."  "I liked that we could take our measurements, not have them be given to us."  "I loved the fact that it was an easy to understand way of explaining video buffering because this is a topic that I always felt that I understood but didn't know how to explain it to others."      In the first few years of this project, the GENI WiMAX lab materials have been used by hundreds of students at universities in the United States and abroad.
