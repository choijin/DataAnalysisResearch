<AbstractNarration>Responding to urgent needs for a long-term multidisciplinary observation system for understanding rapid high-latitude climate change in the Arctic Ocean, a Eurasian and Makarov Basin (EMB) observational network is proposed as an element of the Arctic Observing Network (AON). Three August-September cruises, one every two years, will be conducted, with extensive measurements along continental margins, a boundary current conduit; cruises will cover vast areas from Svalbard to the East Siberian Sea. The program ties together oceanographic, chemical, and ice observations using moorings, repeated oceanographic sections, and Lagrangian drifters to provide vital information about Arctic Ocean changes.  The overarching goal of the study as an AON element is to compile a cohesive picture of the state and transformations of Atlantic Water (AW) in the EMB, with particular focus on three major observational targets: (1) along-slope AW transport by the boundary currents (2) interaction of AW branches with shelf waters, deep basin interior and upper ocean (3) EMB indications of changes in the upper ocean circulation. The proposed targets are broad in scope and pose a wide range of challenges to modern high-latitude observational oceanography.  The EMB's size and location mean that this part of the Arctic Ocean is representative of pan-arctic conditions and processes, and therefore appropriate for long-term observing. Therefore, the project is an important element of the pan-AON.  Graduate students will be supported; female and Alaska Native students will be encouraged to participate. Program outreach will culminate in 2013 with a shipboard summer school. Data and products, critically-needed benchmarks for Arctic satellite sea-ice and altimeter measurements, will be available per AON data policy.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The upper 200-500 meters of the water column of the Arctic Ocean can be generally described as consisting of a cold and relatively fresh polar mixed layer, a halocline layer (a region of rapidly increasing salinity with increasing depth), and a warm and salty Atlantic layer.  The Atlantic layer is a large source of both heat and nutrients (primarily nitrate and phosphate) to the Arctic Ocean.  Atlantic water enters the Arctic via Fram Strait and the Barents Sea and circulates around the Arctic Ocean periphery along the continental slope and makes its way into the deeper basins primarily via mid-ocean ridges.  Along this general circulation pathway, Atlantic water encounters and melts sea ice and mixes with Siberian shelf waters freshened by river runoff; mixing with these less saline waters forms the halocline layer of the eastern Arctic that insulates the cold mixed layer and sea ice of the interior Arctic Ocean from the underlying warm Atlantic layer.      The purpose of this project was to better understand the circulation of the Atlantic water as it progressed along the Siberian continental slope and the mixing of this Atlantic water with less saline waters that form the eastern Arctic halocline.  These processes are particularly important as they influence the distribution of the Atlantic water heat; for example, a weakening of the eastern Arctic halocline will result in increased vertical mixing of warm Atlantic waters up to the surface that will melt more sea ice.  As the Arctic continues to undergo accelerated change, it is important to understand how the circulation and mixing of Atlantic water, as well as the formation and modification of halocline waters, may also be changing.     Three research cruises were completed during August and September of 2013, 2015, and 2018.  During these cruises a total of 336 oceanographic stations were occupied.  These stations were organized in a series of transects, each crossing the continental slope, that progressed from the Barents Sea (in the west) to the East Siberian Sea (in the east).

Samples were also collected for the measurement of additional variables (e.g., dissolved organic carbon, nitrogen isotopes, DNA, particulate organic carbon, and rare earth elements) by international collaborators.     The major outcomes of the project included the characterization of water mass fronts.
