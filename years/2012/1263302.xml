<AbstractNarration>A Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Sites award has been made to the University of Nebraska-Lincoln that will provide research training for 10 students, for 10 weeks during the summers of 2013- 2015. The program focuses on bioenergy -- the application of molecular and physiologic principles using microbes, algae and plants to create renewable sources of energy thereby promoting a sustainable society. The School of Biological Sciences and the Center for Plant Science Innovation have 15 participating faculty who will serve as mentors. There is a wide range of very interesting and exciting projects for the students. Projects employ molecular biology, biochemistry and or genetics to understand energy dynamics in model species. Students are expected to do full-time lab research as well as participate in seminars and various workshops, such as the responsible conduct in research, professional communication skills, career opportunities in industry and academia, and the graduate school application process. Students are also provided tours of local industries of relevance to renewable energy production. REU students have access to a rich array of individual mentor's facilities as well as many interdepartmental labs and centers with core facilities such as electron microscopy, microarray analysis, surface analysis, etc. The program's multi-phase recruitment effort consists of both traditional "hard copy" formats as well as digital-based advertising. Students are selected based on academic record, research performance, and potential for outstanding research in biological engineering or quantitative biology. Students are tracked to determine their continued interest in their academic field of study, their career paths, and the lasting influences of the research experience. Information about the program will be assessed by various means, including use of an REU common assessment tool. More information is available by visiting http://www.unl.edu/summerprogram/research#bioenergy, or by contacting the PI (Dr. Paul Blum at pblum1@unl.edu) or the co-PI (Dr. Heriberto Cerutti at hcerutti@unlnotes.unl.edu ).</AbstractNarration>
