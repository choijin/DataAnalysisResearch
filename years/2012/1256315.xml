<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project proposes the commercialization of a&lt;br/&gt;new type of industrial refrigeration system for cooling raw milk in Indian villages, without the&lt;br/&gt;use of backup diesel generators. The innovation lies in a novel thermal battery pack concept&lt;br/&gt;developed by Promethean Power Systems with a Phase I grant from the National Science&lt;br/&gt;Foundation. The battery solves a chronic unreliable electricity problem by converting and&lt;br/&gt;storing electrical energy in the form of thermal energy through a process of freezing and melting&lt;br/&gt;a material. The battery needs just five hours of grid electricity to charge and, once charged,&lt;br/&gt;provides constant cooling power on demand when the grid is off.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will be the introduction of clean energy&lt;br/&gt;technologies in refrigeration applications, eliminating costly spoilage of foods and providing&lt;br/&gt;clean energy alternatives to developing economies that currently rely on fossil-based fuels for&lt;br/&gt;their continued growth. In developing countries, billions of dollars of perishable foods are&lt;br/&gt;wasted annually because of inadequate cold-chain supply networks. A major obstacle in setting&lt;br/&gt;up a cold-chain network is the lack of reliable grid electricity to run refrigeration systems in&lt;br/&gt;villages and farming areas. In such conditions, diesel generators are often used as backup, a nonideal&lt;br/&gt;solution with high cost and environmental impact. Promethean?s thermal battery eliminates&lt;br/&gt;diesel generators and makes village refrigeration systems economically viable. This could&lt;br/&gt;revolutionize dairy industries around the world, especially in India, the largest producer and&lt;br/&gt;consumer of milk in the world, where nearly 400 million people depend on milk for their daily&lt;br/&gt;protein. Although Promethean?s first commercialization efforts are in India where thermal&lt;br/&gt;batteries are needed the most, these efforts will benefit US economy by providing a large and&lt;br/&gt;growing market to US products and affirming America?s leading role in spreading innovative&lt;br/&gt;ideas throughout the world.</AbstractNarration>

Our next commercial applications are in the United States where the battery can serve as an energy efficiency device to shift large refrigeration loads from peak time to off-peak hours.  Our battery is currently being used to provide fast, efficient cooling power for a micro-brewery in Boston.

Locally, In India, our thermal batteries help reduce IndiaÆs dependence on foreign oil (by eliminating the use of diesel generators) and improve the quality of milk and fresh produce for Indian consumers.   As a partner and ally of the United States in this region, India has welcomed AmericaÆs assistance in solving its difficult grid infrastructure problems.
