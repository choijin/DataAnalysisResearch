<AbstractNarration>This project focuses on the impact of land-use and land-cover change from expansion of sugarcane production and associated economic factors related to increased biofuel production in the Cerrado.  The Cerrado consists of woodland savanna and is the second largest biome in Brazil.  It also is one of the world's biodiversity hotspots.  Global efforts to reduce carbon emissions and higher demand for "clean," more sustainable alternatives to fossil fuels have led to the development of biofuel production in many parts of the world, including the Cerrado.  A team of U.S.-based investigators and their Brazilian collaborators will determine how external factors, including biofuel demand and supply, sugarcane demand and supply, biofuel industry expansion, and government policy, impact farmers' decisions to produce sugarcane for biofuel production as well as other forms of land-use and land-cover change in the Cerrado.  They will examine factors affecting farmers' decision making, and they will predict future land-use and land-cover change in the Cerrado under different biofuel market and policy scenarios.  The investigators will collect a broad mix of qualitative and quantitative data using surveys and interviews.  They will conduct archival research to provide a detailed understanding of the policy and macroeconomic context for the emergence of the sugarcane industry in the Cerrado, and they will analyze satellite-based remote sensing data to develop an data on land-use and land-cover change at the field level across the study region.  They will develop a modeling framework to integrate conduct market analyses and farm-level household analyses in a comparative, longitudinal approach, with an emphasis placed on viewing sugar and ethanol processes as related to the equilibrium of supply and demand.  The modeling also will provide a predictive platform to model the impacts of sugarcane production and expansion on land-cover change under different scenarios using actual field, farm, and market-level data. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will enhance basic understanding regarding on how market demand and supply and government policy have affected the behavior of both the ethanol industry and the farmers who are providing an increasing supply of sugarcane via land conversion in Brazil.  It also will add insights and information regarding the extent to which existing agricultural cropland, pasture, and native vegetation are being converted to sugarcane.  With bioenergy and its human and ecological impacts the subject of debate among policy makers and civil society in Brazil and elsewhere, project findings will have implications for conservation initiatives and sustainability.  The project will contribute to graduate education and training at Kansas State University and the University of Kansas, and it will help build international partnerships between U.S.- and Brazilian-based researchers and students.  The project will ensure future international collaboration on the impacts of bioenergy expansion in Brazil and create the basis for comparative work on U.S. and Brazilian energy geographies.</AbstractNarration>

In addition, the project examined the factors affecting&nbsp;farmers' decision-making regarding sugarcane production and expansion.&nbsp;</p> <p>The findings from the project are having an impact on our understanding of land use and land cover change due to sugarcane expansion.&nbsp;&nbsp;The expansion of the&nbsp;sugarcane sector toward the new frontier of Cerrado&nbsp;can be attributed to different&nbsp;factors. First, the increase in demand for ethanol. Second, the influences of&nbsp;political actions since different levels of the government&nbsp;were sending positive stimuli to the private sector to&nbsp;invest. Third, consolidation of the sugarcane sector in&nbsp;the state of Sao Paulo with a consequent increase in&nbsp;land competition and environmental problems, resulting&nbsp;in new environmental regulations that increased the&nbsp;cost of production in that state, thus&nbsp;motivating the&nbsp;industry to&nbsp;search land elsewhere. Fourth, agricultural conditions and&nbsp;land prices in the Cerrado states provided suitable conditions&nbsp;for the mechanization and&nbsp;production of sugarcane. Fifth, the locations of&nbsp;mills are a very good incentive for sugarcane expansion. Sixth, the intensification of grain production could be releasing land for sugarcane expansion. Seventh, sugarcane expansion is occurring specially on degraded pastureland.&nbsp;Eight, the trust in mills and the willingness to enter into contracts are essential to maintain sugarcane and ethanol expansion in the Brazilian Cerrado given sugarcane&rsquo;s geographic, temporal and physical asset specificities. Contracts provide mills access to sugarcane supply or to land for sugarcane production. Results from this study help mills understand producer&rsquo;s demands and needs, and provide suggestions on how mills can improve on making producers feel supported and heard.&nbsp;</p> <p>The project has produced many research&nbsp;papers&nbsp;in prestigious journals like Biomass &amp; Bioenergy, Journal of Land Use Science, Journal of Extension and Rural Studies, The International Food and Agribusiness Management Review, GeoJournal.&nbsp;Other deliverables from the project include policy outreach publications published in Portuguese by IPEA (Instituto de Pesquisa Economica Aplicada), a major policy research institute in Brazil, as well as presentations at national and international research conferences. In addition, research was presented in organized sessions at policy conferences in Brazil to further disseminate project results. A unique geodatabase of land use and land cover change was developed for the Cerrado for future study, as well as land use maps that provide crop specific identifications not previously available within the study region.</p> <p>It is important to highlight that the study has helped to&nbsp;train a number of graduate students. &nbsp;In fact, the project facilitated the&nbsp;training of 5 students from Latin America, in addition to, 3 U.S. students. The project has mentored 5 graduate students and 3 undergraduate students. Two Brazilian students&nbsp;finished their&nbsp;Ph.Ds&nbsp;in the U.S., and both&nbsp;are&nbsp;working as Postdoctoral&nbsp;in the U.S. &nbsp;</p> <p>This study has&nbsp;contributed to our understanding of the sugarcane industry and its linkages to national and global markets. Although much research has addressed ethanol expansion in Brazil,&nbsp;little&nbsp;was known about the role of sugarcane expansion in the Brazilian Savanna.&nbsp;The potential significance of&nbsp;this study reaches far beyond intellectual contributions, and has broad policy implications&nbsp;with respect to sustainable development. Such information, is&nbsp;ultimately&nbsp;necessary for the design of public policies, both environmental&nbsp;and economic, to adjust the speed of the Cerrado&rsquo;s land-cover change. In fact, the&nbsp;use by policy&nbsp;makers represents one the project&rsquo;s most important impacts. The results of the study is helping to inform and educate policy-makers and other public institutions about the drivers and impacts of the expansion of sugarcane in the Cerrado to help assist with assessment of the economic, environmental, ecological and social implications and related policy.</p> <p>In addition, the project brought expertise in the areas of agribusiness, economics, geography, sociology, engineering, agronomy,&nbsp;from domestic (Kansas State University and the University of Kansas) and international (Universidade Estadual Julio de Mesquita, UNESP; Empresa Brasileira de Agropecuaria, EMBRAPA)&nbsp;that fostered a broader picture of the research questions and impacts from the project.
