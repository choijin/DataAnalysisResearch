<AbstractNarration>This action funds Scott N. Schiffres of Carnegie Mellon University to conduct a research project, entitled "Nano-sized particles to enhance heat transfer in melting-freezing with applications to solar thermal energy storage," during the summer of 2012 at the University of Tokyo in Hongo, Tokyo, Japan.  The host scientists are Shigeo Maruyama and Junichiro Shiomi.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Intellectual Merit of the research project lies in the study of how nano-sized particles, such as carbon nanotubes and graphene, influence thermal conductivity in materials undergoing phase-change.  A metal coated fiber 3-omega technique is being used to characterize thermal conductivity of the phase-change material with nano-sized particles in addition to characertizing other aspects of the nano-sized particle suspension.  One application of this research is to understand how nano-particles may enhance heat transfer during melting and freezing, allowing for enhanced thermal storage and reduced energy usage.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.  These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  Thermal conductivity measurements of nanofluids (fluids with suspended nanoparticles) reflect dramatic, yet controversial, improvements in thermal conductivity. We hypothesized that the degree of agglomeration/percolation and the thermal resistance between contacting nanoparticles are significant factors affecting the nanofluid thermal conductivity, especially at high nanoparticle volume fractions.  We sought to control the pressure applied to the nanoparticle-nanoparticle junctions in the nanofluid and to measure the resulting thermal conductivity and electrical conductivity.  To apply pressure to the nanoparticle junctions, we controlled the base fluid crystal size through careful control of the cooling during base fluid freezing.  Energy saving applications of nanofluid phase change, such as passive solar heating, benefit from improved thermal conductivity by increasing the thermal energy storage and withdrawal rates per unit surface area.     By controlling the cooling rate of a graphite nanoplatlet and hexadecane nanofluid, we are able to dramatically vary the frozen nanofluid thermal and electrical conductivity, as well as the lengthscale of the nanofluid crystallization. The nanofluid liquid-to-solid thermal and electrical conductivity enhancement can be varied for the same loading nanofluid. We hypothesize that this controllable and reversible enhancement stems from the underlying nanofluid crystallization phenonena, which we characterized with optical microscopy of the frozen nanofluid.  Solidification with rapid cooling minimizes the liquid-solid enhancement by reducing the percolation between graphite nanoplatlets and nanoplatlet clusters, while slow cooling maximizes percolation between graphite nanoplatlets and nanoplatlet clusters.   This collaboration forged through this project is ongoing, with additional thermal and electrical measurements versus cooling rate at Carnegie Mellon and additional environmental scanning electron microscopy work being conducted by collaborators at the University of Tokyo.  Additionally, Professor Junichiro Shiomi of the University of Tokyo is serving on my Ph.D. thesis committee.       Last Modified: 01/22/2013       Submitted by: Scott N Schiffres]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
