<AbstractNarration>This project puts forth organizational genetics as a novel theoretical and empirical approach to understand the structure and dynamics of generative innovations. Generativity refers to an overall capacity to produce unprompted change driven by a large, varied, and uncoordinated audience, as seen in digital ecosystems such as Apple, Youtube, Android and Wordpress. In such ecosystems, most innovations are accomplished by third-party individuals who often go beyond the design intent of the original innovators. Using data from highly generative innovation contexts, the researchers seek to understand how combinations of existing technological components that act as genetic elements (i.e., genotypes) can give birth to the incredibly rich and dynamic varieties at the product level (i.e., phenotypes). Each individual innovation is characterized as a co-expression of a certain set of existing components (referred to as "technology genes") in the similar way system biologists characterize the structure and dynamics of cell behaviors though a co-expression network of genes. Furthermore, the ways in which mutations in technology genes can cause changes in the co-expression network, which in turn causes changes in the behavior of the digital product is explored. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Such evolutionary analysis of generative innovations ultimately allows an understanding of how distributed organizations can produce generative innovations without a traditional organizational structure that centrally governs and coordinates innovation activities. More specifically, the research contributes to the organization literature by developing new evolutionary model of organization design for innovations and to the open innovation literature by showing the structural and dynamic patterns of open innovations through interactions among third-party developers. Additional important methodological contributions are in the advancement of an analytical approach to analyze big data to understand complex and multi-level, socio-technical phenomenon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although digital artifacts from open ecosystems have become an important part of the economy, very little is known about the generativity of such artifacts. Understanding the mechanisms of generativity can empower organizations in several ways: first, they can become more innovative by using existing artifacts to design new digital artifacts; second, it can help organizations create innovation opportunities based on effective exploitation of digital platform that prompts uncoordinated interactions among heterogeneous and distributed innovators; and finally, understanding generativity can not only help organizations in product design and innovation, but also in related contexts such as viral marketing. These findings will be of interest not only to firms and innovators, but also to policy makers and the media as well.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Digital technology is rapidly re-shaping the way we live and work. One of the unique aspects of digital technology is how fast it is evolving, due to its re-programmability and re-combinability. Such unique characteristics of digital technology make it highly generative. Yet, its evolutionary process and underlying structure is not well known. In this study, we investigate how complex digital ecosystems evolve over time. Specifically, we studied the history of the world&rsquo;s largest blog platform, WordPress, from inception in 2004 until 2014. We also studied the evolution of an open source community focusing on JQuery Javascript project, in the world&rsquo;s largest open source community, Github. We used tools from evolutionary and system biology to detect the patterns of evolution and the underlying generative structures. In WordPress study, we discovered 443 basic software components (APIs) that are repeatedly used to produce 23,218 plug-ins that form the generative landscape of the WordPress ecosystem. The interaction patterns of 443 APIs form 11 different clusters of plug-ins. Based on our study, we argue that the highly complex digital ecosystems are formed based on 3 layers of digital components: core, cluster core and periphery. Core components are essential in forming the overall ecosystem. Cluster core components play the most crucial role in creating the diversity within the ecosystem as they are the foundation of creating different clusters of plug-ins. Finally, periphery components create diversity within each cluster.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>From GitHub study, we developed the notion of generative diffusion of innovation. The idea is that, unlike physical products, digital products evolve as they diffuse. However, the pattern by which they evolve as they diffuse is not necessarily uniform. Based on this insight, we developed a way to measure the generativity of digital product based on two dimensions of generative diffusion of innovation: (a) the rate of change; and (b) the direction of change. We further found that the nature of collaboration among programs influences the degree of the generativity of open source projects.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 05/19/2017<br>      Modified by: Youngjin&nbsp;Yoo</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1261977/1261977_10234036_1495208891345_Picture3--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1261977/1261977_10234036_1495208891345_Picture3--rgov-800width.jpg" title="CIrcos Diagram of WordPress Ecosystem"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1261977/1261977_10234036_1495208891345_Picture3--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="CIrcos Diagram of WordPress Ecosystem"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Circos diagram visualizes the generative structure of WordPress Ecosystem, by showing the connection between individual digital components (APIs) and individual digital products (plug-ins) that are in 11 clusters.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Sungyong Um & Youngjin Yoo</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Youngjin&nbsp;Yoo</div> <div class="imageTitle">CIrcos Diagram of WordPress Ecosystem</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1261977/1261977_10234036_1495208479095_Picture2--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1261977/1261977_10234036_1495208479095_Picture2--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Heat Map of WordPress Ecosystem"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1261977/1261977_10234036_1495208479095_Picture2--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Heat Map of WordPress Ecosystem"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">This heat map shows how different clusters share different APIs.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Sungyong Um & Youngjin Yoo</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Youngjin&nbsp;Yoo</div> <div class="imageTitle">Heat Map of WordPress Ecosystem</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1261977/1261977_10234036_1495208392639_Picture1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1261977/1261977_10234036_1495208392639_Picture1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Dendrogram of WordPress Plug-in Clusters"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1261977/1261977_10234036_1495208392639_Picture1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Dendrogram of WordPress Plug-in Clusters"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">WordPress ecosystem has 23,218 plug-ins that are created by recombining 443 APIs.
