<AbstractNarration>The international GEOTRACES program has two major goals:  (1) to determine global ocean distributions of selected trace elements and isotopes and evaluate the sources, sinks, and internal cycling of these species to characterize more completely the physical, chemical and biological processes regulating their distributions; and (2) to understand the processes that control the concentrations of geochemical species used for proxies of the past environment. Because the cycling of trace elements and isotopes in the sea is intimately connected with both the organic and the inorganic biogeochemical transformations of carbon, the achievement of the goals of GEOTRACES would be very difficult if not impossible unless synoptic measurements are also made on the organic and inorganic marine carbon system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this project, researchers at the University of Washington will participate in the U.S.GEOTRACES Pacific campaign in 2013 to characterize the regional ocean carbon system.  They will use two approaches.   First, they will measure the depth distribution of the 13C/12C stable carbon isotopic ratio of the dissolved inorganic carbon (del13C), which has been designated in the international GEOTRACES Science Plan as a key parameter and has the highest measurement priority. Second, they will estimate the rate of organic matter (OM) export from the surface layer based on dissolved O2/Ar gas ratios.  Measurements of del13C will be made at about 22 stations for a total of ~525 samples. Additionally, they will measure the dissolved O2/Ar gas ratio at ~5 km spatial resolution in the surface layer using an underway measurement method that has been used extensively in other oceanic regions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cruise track will cross a wide range of biological productivity regimes from the coastal upwelling zone off Peru to the oligotrophic gyre surrounding Tahiti. The proposed high resolution O2/Ar-based OM export rates should clearly detect the expected offshore decrease in OM export and locate transition zones or fronts in productivity. The expected large offshore productivity gradient will provide the opportunity to determine the impact of OM export from the surface layer and OM degradation at depth on upper ocean depth distribution of del13C, trace elements (TEs), O2 and nutrients along the section.&lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;The initial del13C and TE measurements during GEOTRACES illustrate the potential to improve our understanding of the processes that control del13C, TEs and nutrient distributions in the modern ocean and, as a result, improve the utility of del13C and TEs as tracers of past changes in the ocean circulation and carbon cycling, which is a long term goal of this research.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts.  The data and research results will be broadly distributed to the international oceanographic and paleoclimate communities and incorporated into the PI's graduate and undergraduate teaching curricula.  Additionally, there will be active undergraduate participation (5 students currently) in preparing samples for del13C analyses.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ A better understanding of the role of metals on the ocean?s biology is needed.  Plankton need certain metals like iron and manganese to photosynthesize. In certain ocean regions the concentration of metals dissolved in seawater limits the rate of photosynthesis which in turn can limit the rate of uptake of carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere and, by consequence, the earth?s future (and past) surface temperature.  We measured the isotopic composition of the CO2 dissolved in seawater (referred to as 13C/12C) on an oceanographic research cruise in the South Pacific Ocean between the coast of Chile and the island of Tahiti as part of the GEOTRACES project.  The first goal was to compare the distribution of 13C/12C to the simultaneously measured distributions of concentrations of phosphate (PO4) which is an essential nutrient for photosynthesis and cadmium (Cd) a metal involved in photosynthesis.  The second goal was to identify the processes which controlled the distributions of 13C/12C, PO4 and Cd in this region of the South Pacific Ocean.  One important characteristic of 13C/12C and Cd is that one can measure these two characteristics on forams (a type of plankton that precipitates a shell of calcium carbonate) preserved in ocean sediments which potentially allows one to reconstruct the distribution of PO4 in ocean during previous times (e.g., during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) about 20,000 years ago when the atmospheric CO2 level was about half of today).   The distributions of 13C/12C, PO4 and Cd measured during the GEOTRACES cruise indicated that in the eastern portion of the cruise track near the Chilean coast the rates of photosynthesis and respiration by marine organisms was the primary factor controlling the distributions.  In contrast, in the western portion of the cruise track near Tahiti physical mixing of water parcels was the primary control on the distributions.  These results were not completely surprising as the cruise track was chosen because it crossed ocean regions that have anomalously high rates of photosynthesis (near Chilean coast) and anomalously low rates of photosynthesis (near Tahiti) in the surface ocean.  The results have significant implications in order to use 13C/12C and Cd measured on foram shells to reconstruct past distributions of the PO4 in the ocean.  The relationships between 13C/12C and PO4 and between Cd and PO4 are significantly different today for forams living near Tahiti and near the coast of Chile.  Thus we need to account for these differences when using 13C/12C and Cd on preserved forams shells to reconstruct the PO4 distribution in this ocean regions during the LGM.  The ocean?s PO4 distribution is tightly coupled to the ocean?s CO2 distribution which in turn affects the atmosphere?s CO2 concentration.  For example, accurate reconstructions of the ocean?s PO4 distribution during the LGM will yield insight into the processes causing the low atmospheric CO2 levels during the LGM.
