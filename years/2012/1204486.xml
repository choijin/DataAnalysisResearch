<AbstractNarration>Understanding the structure of atomic nuclei is important in understanding how those nuclei are produced.  As nearly 70% of nuclei heavier than iron and all of the actinides were produced by the so-called r-process in what is presumed to be very violent environments capable of producing extremely exotic nuclei, it is important to understand not just the stable nuclei in nature, but the very exotic ones produced in extreme stellar events.  Current rare isotope beam facilities are making progress towards producing some of these nuclei.  The current aim of this project is to understand the most fundamental property of very exotic atomic nuclei - their mass.  By understanding nuclear masses and mass trends, it is possible to understand how nuclei in exotic environments interact with others and how nuclear abundance changes in these environments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nuclear masses approaching the r-process path will be measured with the Time of Flight (TOF) technique.  In this technique, the flight time for a mixed beam of nuclei will be measured between two points in a fragment separator.  Comparing the flight times of unknown nuclei to those of known nuclei will help determine the masses of the unknown nuclei.  Several experiments are planned and approved at the Radioactive Ion Beam Factory at The Institute of Physical and Chemical Research and at the National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory.  In addition to gaining a better understanding of one of the most fundamental questions in science, this experiment will work to provide a future for science and scientists in the United States.  Scientists will be trained at all levels, including the Ph.D. and undergraduate level as well as at the high-school and elementary level.  Direct training of Ph.D. students will occur in multiple high-profile experiments.  Further, multiple auxiliary outreach activities to undergraduate and high-school students will be done in order to excite and inform students about science.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit   1. A new theoretical approach to nuclear spin-isospin excitations, based on the fundamental meson-exchange interaction and extending to complex emergent effects, has been developed. This is a significant step forward in understanding the microscopic mechanisms of nuclear beta decay and in building an accurate and predictive theory, which helps to answer fundamental questions about the elemental composition of our universe and neutrino mass.  2. The joint theoretical and experimental studies of the neutron skin oscillation mode in neutron-rich nuclei have (i) confirmed the universality of its two-component structure and provided an important benchmark on our theoretical approach which successfully predicts the properties of this mode in exotic nuclei; (ii) enabled a clear systematics of this mode, providing constraints on the nuclear symmetry energy and on the equation of state, which are important ingredients for understanding the stellar evolution.    3. The developed generalized response theory is a step toward a more precise solution of the nuclear many-body problem, which aims at a unified description of both high frequency nuclear oscillations and low-energy spectroscopy.   4. It has been found that in the processes, such as the radiative neutron capture, the enhancement of the radiative strength functions (RSF) at low gamma-energies is significant in some nuclei. A mechanism for this enhancement has been proposed and validated theoretically. It was concluded, in particular, that the RSF used for astrophysical r-process nucleosynthesis modeling should account for the observed enhancement.   5. Our detailed studies of the coupling between the single-particle and collective degrees of freedom, pion exchange and superfluidity effects have allowed important conclusions on the nature of the in-medium nucleon-nucleon interaction.   Research from this award resulted 18 journal publications including a review book chapter and 28 presentations at international meetings and academic seminars on nuclear physics: 22 invited talks (20 by the PI and 2 by the research associate) and 6 contributed talks (3 by the PI, 2 by the research associate and 1 by a graduate student).    The Broader Impact of this project includes: (i) training the next generation of scientists, (ii) raising the profile of female physicists, (iii) integration of the forefront research into the regular courses of the WMU graduate program.   The project has provided training opportunities for three graduate students. Two graduate students and the research associate supported by this award are female. For their future careers, students benefit greatly from putting into practice theoretical concepts and computational algorithms they encountered in their classes. Both the students and the young scientist involved in this project received training and gained experience in both theoretical and computational physics, including nuclear theory, quantum field theory, programming, and presentation skills. After such a training,  students can start to build their research careers or work outside of academia, making use of the skills they acquired in solving complex theoretical physics problems.
