<AbstractNarration>The persistence of quasiperiodic motion on codimension-one tori in nearly-integrable volume-preserving maps is explained by KAM theory. However, the robustness of these tori and the existence of remnants upon destruction are understood only in two-dimensions. The PI proposes to study tori of three-dimensional maps, and to generalize the residue criterion discovered by Greene and the anti-integrable limit discovered by Aubry. Studies will include symmetry reduction, invariance, and the loss of integrability for general, structure-preserving maps and flows. An important application is the optimization of mixing in open duct flows used in the continuous blending of materials. Our current understanding of the mixing process is, for the most part, limited to flows that are in essence two-dimensional and either closed or recycling. Transport in three-dimensional systems can be quantified by the flux through the destroyed structures, computed using a generalized action based on Lagrangian forms, thereby obtaining accurate and computationally efficient volume fluxes. The PI and students will use the concept of transitory dynamics to quantify and optimize transport in open flows. The extension to episodic and more general time-dependence will clarify the definition of Lagrangian coherent structures in aperiodic dynamics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The complexity of patterns obtained by mixing a passive scalar in a fluid can be observed by anyone pouring cream into hot coffee. That this process is not fully understood is perhaps less obvious. If the flow is sufficiently turbulent then mixing is rapid and uniformity is not hard to achieve. If, however, the flow is slow, on a small scale, or viscous, then mixing is much more difficult. Yet, such processes are important to many applications including the development of micrometer scale bioreactors and effective mixing of polymer and granular materials. A predictive theory for laminar mixing would also contribute to the understanding of climate modeling and pollution dispersal in the atmosphere as well as nutrient dispersal and spawning efficiencies for sea life. Mixing in laminar flows proceeds by stretching and folding due to chaotic motion that gives rise to fine-scale structure where diffusion is effective. Any measure of mixing requires quantification of chaos and its concomitant transport. Chaotic motion in incompressible fluids has some similarities to that in conservative dynamics. The later models are used to predict the lifetime of particles in accelerators, obtain rates for simple chemical reactions, calculate confinement times in plasma fusion devices, understand the spectra of highly excited atomic systems, and design efficient spacecraft trajectories. For chaotic dynamics, prediction of specific trajectories is difficult; nevertheless, chaos can be profitably utilized, for example, to improve efficiency of spacecraft trajectories, by judiciously applying small course corrections, or to enhance the lifetimes of particles in confinement devices and the rates of chemical reactions. In this study, chaos will be used to optimize mixing with the goal of obtaining practical designs for open, three-dimensional, mixing devices.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The PI received NSF grant DMS-1211350 to study Structure, Transport, and Chaos in Volume-Preserving Dynamics. A primary goal was to investigate the loss of structure and the onset of chaos in conservative and volume-preserving systems. Concepts of particular interest were symmetry, resonances, tori, transitory dynamics, mixing, and transport.</p> <p><br />Symmetry: The existence of symmetries implies the existence of related sets of orbits and can be used to reduce the dynamics. A volume-preserving map with an incompressible symmetry is shown to reduce to a skew-product form, decreasing the effective dimension by one. Unlike the Hamiltonian case, this does not imply a corresponding invariant, or action-like variable.&nbsp;</p> <p><br />Resonances and Twist: When a Hamiltonian system is integrable, its phase space is foliated by invariant tori. A similar definition is reasonable for a volume-preserving map though it can have differing numbers of actions and angles. Perturbations of such a system may lead to chaotic dynamics and transport. The PI obtains a normal form for such mappings near resonance and show that these maps reduce, upon averaging to the usual area-preserving twist or nontwist standard maps. The twist condition appropriate for the volume-preserving setting is, however, distinct from the nondegeneracy condition used in KAM theory.</p> <p><br />Invariant Tori: Tori can form transport barriers, and their breakup can allow orbits to move between previously isolated regions. Recently destroyed tori act as partial barriers and the crossing time near a broken torus has an algebraic singularity. However, there is, as of yet, no mathematics to tell us the structure of these barriers. The PI and students use a generalization of Greene's residue method to compute "last invariant torus", showing the frequency dependence of the threshold.&nbsp;They also generalize the "automatic reducibility" method to find the tori. Results indicate that broken tori become cantori, local robustness depends upon the number theoretic properties of the rotation number, and the rotation number is curiously piecewise-constant under continuous parameter changes. A new indicator, the local stretching, is used to detect critical invariant tori (see attached image).</p> <p><br />Transitory Flows and Mixing: A transitory system is an appropriate model for a practical mixer. Examples studied include a transitory ABC flow, a droplet moving through a microfluidic channel mixer, and the "Rotated Arc Mixer" The latter is a stationary pipe nested within a spinning pipe; windows cut in the inner pipe allow the rotation to episodically affect otherwise axial fluid motion. The scheme for accurately computing transport is several orders of magnitude faster than Monte Carlo techniques. Strategies for optimizing mixing in viscous fluids or for small volumes rely on effective stirring as diffusive mixing is otherwise slow. Optimal mixing protocols were developed for compositions of shear flows (see attached image) and point vortex stirrers.</p> <p><br />Mixing and Coherent Structures: The PI and collaborators study a model for in situ remediation of contaminated groundwater. Chaotic advection is used to help optimize the spreading of the interface between contaminant and water, thereby enhancing degradation reactions. A random porosity field enhances the interfacial length, but the effects of chaotic advection are still important. Another study concerned the reaction enhancement in chaotic flows for reactants that are initially separated. Surprisingly this can result in pulses of reaction that are several orders of magnitude larger than a diffusive model would predict.</p> <p><br />Stickiness and Transport: A collaboration with scientists in Israel led to new insights on the structures that influence stickiness of tori. The PI had shown that infinite sequences of "islands around islands" and of nested cantori are both important for determining stickiness exponents. Numerical studies supports a conjecture that there is universality in the distribution of these structures. The PI and students show that transport in higher-dimensional systems is profoundly affected by the symplectic condition: a map that is only volume-preserving can exhibit strong drifts along resonance channels that would otherwise be forbidden in the symplectic case (see attached image).</p> <p><br />Dynamics on Hamiltonian Networks: The PI and collaborators study synchronization in a Hamiltonian network of oscillators, generalizing the commonly-studied dissipative case. The synchronization threshold can be computed analytically and is shown vary dramatically when network structure varies.</p> <p><br />Parabolic Maps: The PI and a collaborator from Nizhny Novgorod study the formation of elliptic structures in an area-preserving map when it undergoes a bifurcation that creates a parabolic fixed point. Numerical support is given for a conjecture that the model has both a positive measure of nonuniformly hyperbolic orbits and of elliptic orbits (see attached image).</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 06/30/2018<br>      Modified by: James&nbsp;D&nbsp;Meiss</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1211350/1211350_10185387_1504372881817_HarperMC_12--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1211350/1211350_10185387_1504372881817_HarperMC_12--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Optimal Mixing by shearing"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1211350/1211350_10185387_1504372881817_HarperMC_12--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Optimal Mixing by shearing"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">A simple mapping model of mixing consists of alternating shears.
