<AbstractNarration>The Biopolymers Gordon Research Conference (GRC) will focus on the fundamental physico-chemical properties of biopolymers, including structure, folding dynamics, stability, and interactions. The goal of the meeting is to convene leaders in the field with students, postdocs and juniors scientist in a five day conference that will discuss current state and future directions of research efforts in biopolymers. The conference will advance our understanding of the fundamental properties of biopolymers as related to their biological function and will foster connections between physics, chemistry, chemical engineering, computer science and biology. The 2012 Biopolymers GRC will specifically support the participation of minorities and women.</AbstractNarration>

In designing the formal speakers program, emphasis was placed on current unpublished research and discussion of the future target areas in this field. There was a conscious effort to stimulate lively discussion about the key issues in the field today. Time for formal presentations was limited in the interest of group discussions. In order that more scientists could communicate their most recent results, poster presentation time was scheduled. Attached is a copy of the formal schedule and speaker program and the poster program. In addition to these formal interactions, "free time" was scheduled to allow informal discussions. Such discussions are fostering new collaborations and joint efforts in the field.          Thank you for your support of this Conference. As you know, in the interest of promoting the presentation of unpublished and frontier-breaking research, Gordon Research Conferences does not permit publication of meeting proceedings.
