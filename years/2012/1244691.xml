<AbstractNarration>Research combining a variety of intensive geographically-referenced data streams is spreading across many scientific domains, ranging from environmental science to transportation to epidemiology, and opportunities to create new multi-disciplinary and data-intensive scientific collaborations are expanding. Yet, the unique characteristics of georeferenced data present special challenges to such collaborations. These data are highly identifiable when presented in maps and other visualizations. The potential opportunities and benefits of collaboration are constrained by the need to protect the locational privacy and confidentiality of subjects in research using georeferenced data. This research addresses the challenges facing geospatial data-intensive research communities by focusing on the unique confidentiality characteristics of geospatial data and their visualizations, on disclosure risks, and on the potential for sharing geospatial data within a Virtual Data Enclave.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Association of American Geographers and the Interuniversity Consortium for Political and Social Research at the University of Michigan will engage the geospatial research community to (1) conduct research on the unique confidential characteristics of large georeferenced data sets and on viable ways to manipulate these data and their geovisualizations to protect confidentiality and privacy; (2) conduct research on methods and procedures to assess and reduce disclosure risks in maps and other research projects derived from locationally identifiable data; (3) conduct research regarding the viability of sharing and archiving confidential georeferenced research data using a Virtual Data Enclave to enable sophisticated analyses of these data under conditions that protect the privacy of research subjects, and (4) intensively test confidentiality methods within the geospatial Virtual Data Enclave to reduce disclosure risk and develop standards for disclosure review.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Advances in geographic technologies (such as geographic information systems, computer mapping, and GPS) have provided new and increasingly powerful tools for researchers to visualize and analyze a wide range of phenomena ranging from the environment to transportation to disease prevention. Geographic analyses and visualizations of geographic data associated with such phenomena have created opportunities for innovation and advanced research across a broad range of disciplines. Yet, analysis and mapping of individual-level data associated with specific locations (i.e., georeferenced data) may reveal patterns of interaction between people and their social and physical environments. Individuals become more identifiable when their individual locations (e.g., home or work) and itineraries (e.g., travel to work) are available. This research will examine ways to protect the confidentiality and locational privacy of geographic data collected and shared among researchers. Specifically, this project will conduct research on the unique challenges to using and sharing confidential georeferenced research data and their visualizations, including: (1) the development and testing of technologies and procedures to protect confidentiality of geographic data while also allowing access to and sharing of important data among researchers, and (2) the development of standards for disclosure of information that protect individuals' privacy.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Data collections in the social sciences increasingly include specific geographic information, like addresses and GPS coordinates.  Researchers would like to take advantage of this detailed information and merge it with other geo-referenced sources, like administrative data.  However, geographic coordinates and trajectories are highly identifiable, and releasing geo-referenced data could risk disclosing information collected under a promise of confidentiality.  This project tested a facility that allows qualified researchers to analyze detailed geographic data in a secure remote access system.  The "geospatial virtual data enclave" implemented at the Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research at the University of Michigan provides researchers remote access to sensitive data.  Users of the system employ familiar software in a secure computing environment that prevents data from being downloaded or copied.   Project staff and experienced researchers developed and tested the "Geospatial Virtual Data Enclave" (GVDE) to determine whether confidential geospatial data could be stored, analyzed, and shared within the GVDE.  We discovered that most standard geographic analysis software functions properly in the virtual computing environment, but there are some limitations related to the distance between the user and the remote computing system.  When this distance is very great or the communication channels are slow, precise movements on a graphical user interface become difficult.  We found that this is not a severe problem for users located in the U.S., but it was a problem for users located in Asia or Europe.  There are a number of potential solutions to this problem, such as a network of regional secure data centers.  We also found that most researchers were not accustomed to working in a remote computing environment, and we have improved documentation to help them get started.  The project tested thirteen software tools designed to anonymize geographic data.  The tools use a variety of algorithms to mask the locations of individuals by aggregating the data or moving them to other places on a map.  Testing was conducted in the secure remote computing environment.  A project report describes each of these software tools and compares their performance on different types of geographic data.   This project demonstrated that data with confidential geographic information can be provided to researchers for sharing and analysis in a "virtual data enclave."  Systems like this at the University of Michigan and elsewhere protect confidential data, which can be kept in a single secure location, while they increase access to researchers, who do not need to travel to the site holding the data.  Thus, these systems reconcile the publicÆs legitimate concerns about privacy and the research communityÆs need to analyze valuable and often expensive data sets.  Science advances more rapidly when data are shared to replicate findings and apply new analyses.  The public benefits because more scientific research can be conducted at lower costs.
