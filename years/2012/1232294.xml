<AbstractNarration>This award continues funding the long-term research program in aridland ecology. The research is to understand how the physical environment and climate variability together affect common species, community dynamics and ecosystem processes in the northern Chihuahuan Desert. The Sevilleta LTER Program addresses ecological concepts and theory emphasizing pulse driven processes in space and time through comprehensive and interdisciplinary research in desert grassland, shrubland, forest and riparian habitats in central New Mexico. Through a combination of long-term measurements, experiments, and modeling,  the research considers how climate and the physical environment interact to effect change in aridland ecosystems. The focal sites are the Sevilleta National Wildlife Refuge and the Middle Rio Grande Basin. The Sevilleta LTER support our Schoolyard LTER program, the Bosque Ecosystem Monitoring Program, reaches hundreds of middle and high school students annually in classroom and outdoor settings. The Arts and Ecology REU Program brings together students from fine arts and ecology for an 11-week summer research and creative experience. LTER scientists and students actively participate in the Ecological Society of America?s SEEDS Program by hosting workshops and mentoring SEEDS Fellows. The Sevilleta LTER participates in the newly developed Junior Scientist Outreach Program, a program sponsored by the Biology Department at the University of New Mexico, which targets underserved Hispanic students in Albuquerque's south valley. Activities include organized visits to the campus, summer field camps, and active participation in field research.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This funding allowed us to continue our long-term study of how climate change and climate variability affects the plant and animal communities and ecosystem processes of a rapidly changing arid landscape in New Mexico. The study site is in the Sevilleta National Wildlife Refuge, which has the good fortune of being located at multiple biome transitions - the boundaries between dramatically different plant and animal communities. Two major boundaries in our study area include the transition from Great Plains to Desert Grassland and from Desert Grassland to Creosotebush dominated shrubland. The change from Great Plains to Desert grassland paves the way for invasion of grassland by the native shrub, creosotebush. This transition has significant ecological implications. Shrub dominated ecosystems have (1) high rates of soil erosion and nutrient losses, (2) changes in biodiversity (some higher, some lower), which matters in a wildlife conservation area, (3) warmer winter nightime temperatures - as much as projected by climate change itself, (4) loss of economic value, and (5) the potential to sequester more carbon than Desert grassland.
