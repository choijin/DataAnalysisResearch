<AbstractNarration>Mutualisms occur when species interact with each other in a way that benefits both; a familiar example is pollination by bees.  Essential to the survival of many species, mutualisms are critically important for the functioning of natural ecosystems.  When many different mutualists depend on each other, they create complex webs of interactions, known as mutualistic networks.  A key feature of these networks is the strength of each pair of interactions, which is difficult to measure accurately when there are many of them.  This study provides such measurements for a mutualistic network of fruit-eating animals and the fruiting plants whose seeds they disperse.  Specifically, birds, bats and primates feeding in fig trees will be studied in Madagascar.  Interaction strengths and the role of these interactions in the community will be investigated by field observations, experiments, laboratory assays, and statistical analyses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition, the project team will take practical steps to increase public awareness of mutualisms, improve ecological training of students, and promote effective conservation planning.  In particular, the team will share project results with the public through outreach programs and training for middle- and high-school students and teachers, and will enhance ecological training of undergraduate and graduate students via mentorship programs coordinated with the research.  Finally, they will increase capacity for science-based conservation planning by working with land managers in the United States and Madagascar.</AbstractNarration>
