<AbstractNarration>The proposed center seeks to establish a new Industry/University Cooperative Research Center (I/UCRC) addressing broadband wireless access and applications. The center will focus on four areas: 1) enabling sharing up to many GHz of spectrum using technological advances and enabling platforms such as spectrum trading and auctions, and millimeter wave communications; 2) co-existence of heterogeneous devices (e.g. radar and communication systems); 3) providing connectivity for new applications such as wireless devices in the hospitals of the future, bringing wireless into the hospital in novel ways; and (d) improving electronic warfare technologies that address national-security issues.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The new center addresses an area of critical economic and has the potential to support development of broadband wireless as a platform for innovation as addressed in the White House PCAST Report.  The proposed center has the potential to link a diverse set of member companies across the broadband industry sector with university discovery in this area.  Moreover, the center participants have a history of start-up initiation, and the opportunity from new starts to leverage the ecosystem created by the center is significant.   The center plans to impact students via their conduct of center research, curriculum development and REU site development.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
