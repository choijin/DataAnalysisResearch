<AbstractNarration>How do institutions organize to perform the many functions that they seek to perform, such as education, health, infrastructure, market regulation, or policing?  How do they interact internally and with other organizations in the society at large to execute these functions and gain feedback on their performance, and what are the implications of these patterns of activity and connectivity?  This project proposes that institutions are complex systems that self-organize so as to provide a range of essential products, services, rules, and regulations for the economy and society.  It will use the growing presence of institutions on the Internet to gather and analyze the first comprehensive, objective dataset on the functions institutions perform and the connectivity of individual institutions with each other and with different parts of society.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will develop novel methods for community discovery, graph mining, and analytical web crawling to transform the information in the websites of U.S. institutions, and the linkages of these websites with each other and with societal organizations, into a pilot dataset on the activity and connectivity of institutions in the United States.  These data will then be used to investigate the nature and evolution of the activity and connectivity of U.S. institutions, and their implications for public policy, relations with business and society, and economic productivity and performance.  The project will open new avenues for analysis of variation in the activity and connectivity of institutions, including a range of new indicators of institutional linkages and connectivity, as well as new techniques for web crawling, data mining, and data analysis of complex networks.  The project will also form the basis for new techniques and collaborations between computer scientists and economists.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ How are public agencies organized to perform the many functions that they seek to achieve, such as education, health, infrastructure, market regulation, or policing?  How do they interact with each other to execute these functions, and what are the factors that explain these patterns of activity and inter-connection?  We study governments as complex networked systems that self-organize within the boundaries of their mandating laws and statutes so as to provide a range of essential products, services, rules, and regulations for the economy and society.  The project used the growing presence of U.S. public agencies on the Internet to gather and analyze the first comprehensive, objective Internet-based dataset on the functions U.S. state governments perform and how they are organized and connected in order to perform them.  The fact that the US has 50 semi-independent states allowed us to use these new data to explore cross-state variation in government structure and function.  In particular, the project developed novel methods for community discovery, graph mining, and analytical web crawling to transform the information in the websites of U.S. public agencies, and the hyper-links between these websites, to create a pilot dataset on the presence and inter-connections of government agencies in the United States.  We then used these data to investigate the functional structure of state governments.   We find:  That it is feasible to collect large scale data on government activity on the web and to use these data to advance core computer science challenges such as community discovery in complex networks and collaborative filtering. That the Internet footprint of state governments provides a substantially valid picture of real-world government structure.  In particular, it reflects a strongly hierarchical structure organized around states (not, for example, around nation-wide functions or communities of practice such as heath, education, or public safety) and that these state-level structures reflect with a high degree of specificity the laws and statutes that mandate them, thus validating the use of this kind of data for further analysis. That government scales sub-linearly in the number of agencies, their size, complexity, and inter-connections among each other.  Much of the scaling is due to growth of two functions, education and municipal and county administrations; most other functions are only marginally larger or more complex or connected in larger states. This implies that there are significant economies of scale in the organization of government.  That government structure systematically reflects differences in the industrial structure of state economies, and to a lesser extent their location, but does not reflect several other important and widely theorized possibilities, including state income or the ideological opinion of state citizenries about the proper role and functions of government.     By demonstrating the method and its validity, we hope that this pilot project will open new avenues for the creation of new Internet-based measurements of social phenomena in general and of government functions in particular. More narrowly, by generating new metrics on the size, traffic and network structure of government agencies, old theories about the structure, function and effectiveness of government can be tested and new theories will have to be developed in order to account for new and hitherto unknown facts. These activities may also allow the creation of more effective and powerful techniques for web crawling, data mining, and data analysis of complex networks. Finally, the project will hopefully form the basis for new collaborations between computer scientists and scholars of political economy, political science and economics.  The result will provide intellectual advances both in computer and social sciences, as well as a range of new tools for understanding governmental structure and function.
