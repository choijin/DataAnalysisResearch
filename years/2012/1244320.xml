<AbstractNarration>Sulfur is an essential element for all life. Bacteria play a key role in the sulfur cycle through diverse metabolic pathways. When sulfur is limited in the environment, bacteria express specific proteins to retain intracellular sulfur. The alkanesulfonate monooxygenase system provides bacteria access to an alternative sulfur source under sulfur limiting conditions.  These studies will elucidate the essential role of the alkanesulfonate monooxygenase system in supplying sulfur to bacteria. The broad objective of this project is to fully establish the mechanism used by the alkanesulfonate monooxygenase system to better understand its physiological role in sulfur acquisition and the overall sulfur cycle. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An educational component of this project seeks to encourage students from underrepresented groups in the sciences to participate in research at Auburn University. The PI is collaborating with the Minority Programs Coordinator in the College of Science and Mathematics (COSAM) to participate in the Summer Bridge Program for incoming minority freshmen planning to major in sciences, mathematics, or pre-professional programs. An interactive talk on the importance of research in an undergraduate education will be presented followed by a hands-on laboratory experiment to stimulate interest in undergraduate research. The grant will provide a summer research fellowship to a minority student in COSAM for each funding year.</AbstractNarration>
