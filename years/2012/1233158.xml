<AbstractNarration>Objective:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal is to conduct the NSF Workshop on Nanotechnology Infrastructure to identify nanotechnology infrastructure needs in universities related to the NNIN (National Nanotechnology Infrastructure Initiative).  Columbia University and the SRC will co-organize the workshop which will be held in Arlington, Virginia on April 3-4, 2012.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The NNIN has been very successful in establishing facilities and infrastructure for universities to perform basic research in all areas of nanotechnology. This Workshop attempts to identify the needs for the next phase of NNIN which will continue and expand the research capabilities in US Universities and educate the next generations of scientists and educators in an area of National importance. The proposal?s goals are clearly articulated and the participants who are prominent in their scientific fields are appropriate for achieving the stated workshop goals. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The NNIN has had a fundamental impact on US nanotechnology R&amp;D and education over the past 10 years and is expected to continue to do so. Additionally, more emphasis will be placed on the societal and ethical implications of nanotechnology which will broaden the benefits to society.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Nanotechnology is generating entirely new scientific and technological opportunities that offer revolutionary solutions to major problems of society including energy, health, environment, climate, and economic development.  The robust advancement of research and development for Nanotechnology within the United States will require the support of a state-of-the-art physical infrastructure that is widely accessible.  For the past decade, the National Nanotechnology Infrastructure Network (NNIN) has served as a major and enabling factor for extremely-successful development.  As the NNIN moves toward the end of its designated program term and as nanotechnology progresses toward the new Nanoscale systems, an important issue is:  what capabilities should NSF generate and nurture in order to provide the important and critical needs for continued development of Nanotechnology?  Accordingly NSF has supported a workshop of recognized national experts to evaluate the needs of, and appropriate future investments in, a national infrastructure for nanotechnology.  The workshop was held in Arlington, VA on April 3-4, 2012 with 22 participants representing a wide range of stakeholders.  The participants examined the opportunities provided by a nanotechnology infrastructure as well as the needs of the scientific and technological communities for realization of these opportunities.  On this basis, the workshop participants urge the formation of a new infrastructure network.  As envisioned, the infrastructure network will build on the fundamental fabrication tools that have been developed by the electronics industry, including lithographic patterning.  However the infrastructure will be distinguished from the current NNIN by incorporating the following major elements, to offer a much broadened scope and user-base:  (1)  Emphasis on utilization of the network nature of the program to provide value to the stakeholders far greater than individual components.  (2)   A user-base that is much broadened beyond electronics and electronic device fabrication to include less traditional communities such as environmental sciences, geosciences, and biosciences.  (3)  Availability of new cutting edge fabrication capability to users who require it.  (4)  Capabilities to create complex and three dimensional Nanoscale systems through heterogeneous integration.  (5)  Capabilities to build Nanoscale systems across multiple dimensional scales through hierarchical design and fabrication.   (6)  Major extension of capabilities for fabrication in soft matter including potentially biological interfaces.  (7)  New generations of modeling and simulation along with the use of new design tools to maximize overall understanding and fabrication efficiency.  (8)  Facilities capable of supporting the translation of discovery into prototypical elements suitable for evaluation of manufacturability and proof of business concept.  (9)  Partnerships with industry, government, and other groups to provide specialized capabilities within the network when warranted.  The network will also include linkages with other networks and federal infrastructure investments, such as facilities at NIST and DOE.  (10)  Coherent unified program of education and outreach built upon the unique nature of the network and funded at a level commensurate with the goals and directions of the program.  (11)  Commitment to support and champion environmental responsibility, health, and safety (EHS) by providing direct capabilities (characterization and fabrication/synthesis) as well as establishment of the benchmark for EHS within a university environment.  (12)  Incorporation of understanding of societal and ethical implications (SEI) of nanotechnology.  This infrastructure network will cultivate support through strong partnerships and collaborations with other federal agencies with active interests in Nanoscale Science and Engineering as well as with industrial and governmental research facilities.
