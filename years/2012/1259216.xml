<AbstractNarration>SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports a workshop on the Materials Genome Initiative. The workshop will be held at NSF in Arlington, VA in December, 2012. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Materials Genome Initiative promises to revolutionize the way in materials science and engineering is practiced. Many areas stand to benefit from this initiative, but in order to have a long lasting impact it is important for the materials research community to identify clear opportunities for development and compelling areas of research. The workshop will focus on the synergy between computational and experimental research. The workshop will bring together experimental, computational, and theoretical scientists and engineers with the goal of identifying such opportunities. This workshop complements past workshops related to MGI which largely centered on computational aspects. This workshop includes the interaction of computation with experiment and other important aspects in the broader context of how materials research is done.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The areas of research to be covered in the workshop span a wide spectrum of materials science and engineering, ranging from semiconductors to polymeric systems. The candidate speakers have been carefully selected on the basis of their expertise, vision, and the influence that they have exerted in materials research. Additional participants for the workshop will also be invited in order to provide a forum for discussion that is inclusive and representative of the materials community at large. The key outcome of the workshop will be a report that will be widely disseminated throughout the scientific community.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Materials Genome Initiative (MGI) advanced a new paradigm for materials discovery, namely that the pace of materials discovery could be accelerated via complementary efforts in theory, computation, and experiment. Along with numerous successes, new challenges are inviting researchers to refocus the efforts and approaches that were originally inspired by the MGI. In May 2017, the National Science Foundation sponsored the workshop "Advancing and Accelerating Materials Innovation Through the Synergistic Interaction among Computation, Experiment, and Theory: Opening New Frontiers" to review accomplishments that emerged from investments in science and infrastructure under the MGI, identify scientific opportunities in this new environment, examine how to effectively utilize new materials innovation infrastructure, and discuss challenges in achieving accelerated materials research through the seamless integration of experiment, computation, and theory.  Over one hundred participants attended the two-day workshop and were actively engaged in productive panels and discussions. Participants came from industry, national laboratories, and academia. A wide range of fields of inquiry were represented in presentations and all other aspects of the workshop. The key findings from the workshop were summarized in a report. That report, which will be published in the scientific literature, provides perspectives that aim to guide the direction of future materials research and its translation into societal impacts.
