<AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Princeton-CEFRC Summer School in Combustion is an intensive one-week seminar series held annually at Princeton University, during which advanced graduate students and researchers in combustion and energy will take two courses of 15 hours each. The participants are outstanding senior graduate students sent by their respective supervisors, from all across the country, as well as faculty members and research staff from government and industrial labs. These participants hold strong potential to be leaders in the combustion and energy R&amp;D community. Scholarships are available to students enrolled in U.S. academic institutions to cover local expenses. The 2010 and 2011 sessions drew in 122 and 140 participants respectively. Videos of the 2010 lectures by Professor Norbert Peters on Combustion Theory, and by Drs. Stephen J. Klippenstein and Charles K. Westbrook on Combustion Chemistry and 2011 lectures by Professor Moshe Matalon on Combustion Theory, Professor Michael Pilling on Combustion Chemistry, and Professor Marcus Alden on Advanced Laser Diagnostics are available on the Princeton University website. For more information on the Summer School, please visit http://www.princeton.edu/cefrc/combustion-summer-school/ .&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The 2012 session is scheduled to be held on June 24 to June 29. It is expect this year?s applicants pool to surpass the previous two years, as we have expanded the program provide an even broader variety of topics, something very much sought after, based on feedback from previous year participants. This year, a five-day lecture series is offered on: ?Frontiers of Combustion? covering topics in Policies and Issues in Energy and the Environment, given by Professor Robert H. Socolow; New Developments in Combustion Technology, given by Dr. George A. Richards; Alternative Fuels Including Biofuels, given by Professor William H. Green; Cyber-Combustion, given by Dr. Jacqueline H. Chen; and Nanoengineered Reactive Materials and Their Combustion and Synthesis, given by Professor Richard A. Yetter. In addition to this exciting new offering, the foundation courses of Combustion Theory and Combustion Chemistry are still offered, and will be taught by Professors Heinz G. Pitsch and Hai Wang, respectively. And adding to these foundation courses, Internal Combustion Engines (Gas Turbines and Reciprocating Engines) will be jointly given by Professors Timothy C. Lieuwen and Rolf D. Reitz.</AbstractNarration>

Law  Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering  Princeton University, Princeton, NJ 08544    Objective  The Princeton-CEFRC Summer School on Combustion is part of the outreach program of the Combustion Energy Frontier Research Center (CEFRC), which is one of the 46 Energy Frontier Research Centers (EFRCs) established by DOE in 2009. The goal of the Center is to develop a validated, predictive, multi-scale, combustion modeling capability to optimize the design and operation of evolving fuels, especially biofuels, in advanced engines for transportation applications.  The Summer School program was conceived by recognizing that while combustion is an interdisciplinary subject, due to limitations at individual institutions the training received by most combustion researchers has not been sufficiently comprehensive to equip them to make breakthrough discoveries. The Summer School therefore aims to offer advanced graduate level courses to remedy this deficiency. Approach  The 2012 session was held from June 24 through June 29. Participants comprised of senior graduate students and professionals from academia, industries and government labs. World-renowned researchers were commissioned to deliver the lectures. Four 15-hour lectures were offered over 5 days, with 3 hours in the morning and 3 hours in the afternoon The four courses and their respective lecturers were:     Combustion Theory: Heinz Pitsch of RWTH Aachen university Combustion Chemistry: Hai Wang of the University of Southern California Internal Combustion Engines: (1) Gas Turbines: Timothy C. Lieuwen of the Georgia Institute of Technology and (2) Reciprocating Engines: Rolf D.

Yetter of Penn State     Detailed lecture notes were prepared and distributed to the participants beforehand. Participants lived in comfortable dormitory setting, and had meals together in the student cafeteria, hence facilitating networking. Room and board for all US students were covered by the Center.   Relevance to NSF  Many participants were involved in research projects supported by the NSF. The enrichment of their knowledge in combustion will benefit the progress of these research projects. Furthermore, it is anticipated that many of the graduate students will become active researchers in combustion and propulsion in the future, some assuming leadership positions. This Summer School experience will undoubtedly prove useful as they carry out their responsibilities.  Accomplishments for Reporting Period  200 participants from 24 states, 52 universities and 3 U.S. government labs. Of the 200 participants, about 120 were graduate students with the rest being professionals.  Participants were highly satisfied with the experience, with many laudatory feedback comments. All lectures were professional taped and are freely available to the general public through the Princeton University web-site. Detailed lecture notes are freely available to the general public through Princeton UniversityÆs web-site.        Last Modified: 12/20/2012       Submitted by: Chung K Law]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
