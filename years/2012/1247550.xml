<AbstractNarration>The proposed research project is designed to identify, synthesize, and characterize novel neurotoxins from the venom of terebrid marine snails (teretoxins) in a high throughput manner. A biodiversity centered toxin discovery strategy, coupled with innovative mass spectrometric techniques, will be used to expedite the discovery of novel teretoxin peptide sequences. Identified teretoxins will then be immobilized via an oligosaccharide glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) linker on solid support to form a teretoxin-GPI microarray. The ability to access teretoxins in a microarray format facilitates the discovery of ligands for probing the mechanics and functional activity of ion channels in neuronal circuits. The specific objectives of this research proposal are to: 1) Discover novel teretoxins using charged-enhanced electron-transfer dissociation mass spectrometry techniques. 2) Synthesize teretoxin-GPI chimeras using several chemical synthesis strategies, and 3) Develop a teretoxin-GPI neuropeptide microarray to do high throughput screening of ion channel ligands. The successful completion of these research objectives would produce a systematic approach, with broad appeal for identifying cysteine-rich neurotoxins from the enormous peptide toxin libraries of scorpions, snakes, and spiders, in addition to marine snails, and develop a neurotoxin microarray for high throughput screening of ion channel ligands, a fundamental advance in the characterization of the neuronal circuit. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The proposed education initiative will develop and implement an undergraduate laboratory research program termed, RAISE-W (Research Assisted Initiatives in Science Empowerment for Women) that is geared towards increasing and retaining the number of women, especially underrepresented women, engaged in scientific research in STEM disciplines. Key barriers for retaining women in STEM fields are perceived stereotypes and a lack of skills for successfully balancing career/family pressures. RAISE-W will build the foundation for overcoming these obstacles. The components of the RAISE-W program are to: 1) Identify and recruit qualified undergraduate women at The City University of New York (CUNY) who will be paired with CUNY faculty to engage in scientific research projects.  2) Provide a "coaching regime" that teaches program participants skills in time management, achievement, and career development. 3) Support graduate school activities via a research proposal award, ensuring the participants stay on the STEM track.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The intellectual merit of this CAREER Award has&nbsp;advanced how we identify, characterize and optimize peptides from venomous marine snails to better understand the evolution of venom in nature and how we can use these peptides to &nbsp;investigate the mechanics of ion channels and neuronal receptors.&nbsp;</p> <p>The major goals of this project were to discover and characterize novel peptides from venomous snails that can provide new tools for biomedical research and also trace the evolution of venom in nature. The venomous snails that we study are called terebrids, from the conoidean family The Terebridae. Terebrids are predatory mollusks found globally in tropical marine habitats. We were the first to make a molecular phylogeny of the terebrids and use that as a roadmap to help us identify which species were actively producing venom for predation or defense.&nbsp; Unlike more recently evolved conoidean snails, not all terebrids have a venom gland and one of our findings is that there is a correlation between anatomy and phylogeny, meaning the terebrids with a venom gland tend to group into similar clades (branches). This is important because it provides a roadmap for hypothesis driven research to identify the species that we should study, instead of randomly going to the beach and hoping to get lucky. We are using natural evolution to point us in the direction of potential chemical targets for success.</p> <p>Using this approach we have identified and structurally characterized several novel peptides from terebrids, one of which, Tv1 from <em>Terebra variegata</em>, has resulted in a patent for antitumor activity. We have also developed a new tool for docking peptides to their molecular target (<em>ToxDock</em>). Each terebrid can produce &gt;200 peptides in their venom. This is an astronomical amount for us to try to characterize manually. ToxDock is a computer algorithm that can model different versions of a venom peptide to its molecular target (ion channels and receptors) to help us find peptides that are more selective for their targets, which would make them more specific tools for studying cellular physiology. ToxDock is freely available on the web for anyone to use:&nbsp;<a href="http://rosie.rosettacommons.org/tox_dock">http://rosie.rosettacommons.org/tox_dock</a>. &nbsp;</p> <p>In terms of broader impacts and broadening participation, the education component of this award established an initiative geared towards recruiting and retaining women in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics). The initiative, RAISEW (Resource Assisted Initiative in Science Empowerment for Women), examines if productivity and skills acquisition will empower women in STEM fields to remain in the pipeline and push forward boundaries in science and innovation. RAISEW borrows techniques from the corporate world to train female undergraduate, graduate, postdoctoral and pre-tenure faculty how to be successful in a STEM career. RAISEW program participants are paired with executive coaches to identify and eliminate barriers to their success, similar to what is offered to corporate CEOs. Over one hundred female undergraduate, graduate, postdoctoral and pre-tenure faculty participated in the five year tenure of this award. On the whole, RAISEW participants expressed stronger agreement after participation in RAISEW that their family, friends, and others supported their ambition and interest to become a scientist. RAISE-W helped undergraduate participants set foundations for the necessary supports to pursue their careers. Additionally, participants expressed more confidence in having the &ldquo;skills, tools, and knowledge&rdquo; to take the next step towards becoming a scientist.</p> <p>Another important broader impact resulting from this award is the creation of a science learning games company, <em>Killer Snails, LLC</em>. Based on results from the research supported by this award and the desire to improve how STEM is taught nationally and internationally, the PI applied for and received an NSF-ICORPS award to commercialize this project. In collaboration with Jessica Ochoa-Hendrix and Lindsay Portnoy, Killer Snails, LLC (KS) was founded to bring science out of the laboratory and into classrooms and living rooms. KS develops award-winning learning games such as <em>Assassins of the Sea</em> and immersive virtual reality experiences that explore the amazing ecology, biodiversity, and biomedical application of extreme creatures of nature.</p> <p>Our inaugural game <em>Assassins of the Sea</em> is commercially available and launched on Amazon as the&nbsp;23rd best selling toy/game&nbsp;on&nbsp;<em>Amazon&rsquo;s LaunchPad&nbsp;</em>and the&nbsp;94th best-selling card game&nbsp;on Amazon as a whole. <em>Assassins of the Sea</em> won the 16Bit award for the Best 2016 TableTop game from Playcrafting, and was a Finalist for 2017 MENSA Mind Games Select Seal Award. KS has received both a phase I and Phase II Small Business Innovation (SBIR) Award and is currently launching two new games, a digital version of <em>Assassins of the Sea, Assassins of the Sea 2.0, </em>and<em> Biome Builder. </em>Killer Snails games and accompanying teacher assessment dashboard can innovate how STEM is learned and taught.
