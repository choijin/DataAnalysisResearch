<AbstractNarration>PREM - Computational Research and Education for Emergent Materials&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Partnership in Research and Education in Materials (PREM) expands and strengthens a long-term partnership between W. M. Keck Computational Materials Theory Center (CMTC) at California State University Northridge and Princeton Center for Complex Materials (PCCM). The overarching vision of the PREM is to establish a joint research powerhouse on computational materials science and to increase recruitment, retention and degree attainment by members of underrepresented groups in materials research. Building upon past successes, the rationale for the Center's expansion lies in its demonstrated ability to bring together unique talents and capabilities across disciplines to solve complex problems in emergent materials, to enhance the stature of materials research, and to impact broadly education and outreach. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This PREM strives to solve fundamental problems in emergent materials that have vital scientific and technological importance as well as economical and societal impacts. A multidisciplinary team with coordinated and complementary skills in theory, computation and experiment is assembled into three interdisciplinary research areas: (1) Interfacial charge transfer and separation in excitonic photovoltaics. A first-principles based theoretical framework will be developed to address fundamental problems at the organic/organic and organic/inorganic interfaces (2) Quantum phenomena in topological materials. The intriguing competitions between electron interaction, nontrivial band structure and random disorder in topological insulators will be explored, and (3) Spintronics in multifunctional devices. The electronic structure and spin transport in multifunctional nano-systems will be examined.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PREM is committed to enhancing broad participation of underrepresented groups in materials research and education. The Center will expand and strengthen its educational and outreach programs by focusing on recruitment, retention and degree attainment and develop infrastructure for the broader community through the following thrusts: (1) Multipronged recruiting strategies to attract minority students; (2) Summer programs for research training of undergraduates and high school teachers at Princeton PCCM; (3) Organization of summer Materials Science Camps for high school teachers; (4) Research training and education for undergraduates, graduates and postdoctoral fellows at CMTC; (5) Industrial/national laboratories outreach for student training and internships, and (6) Curriculum development. The integration of teaching and research will assist students in making informed career choices, and improve their ability to participate in post-graduate education.</AbstractNarration>
