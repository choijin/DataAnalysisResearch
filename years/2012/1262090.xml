<AbstractNarration>The Ontario Winter (OW) Lake-effect Systems (LeS) field campaign will involve multiple university and non-profit organizational groups who week to better understand mechanisms controlling the timing and location of heavy snowfall and associated cloud structures over and around the U.S. Great Lakes region.  Observational assets to be deployed during OWLeS include the University of Wyoming King Air, the CSWR Doppler on Wheels mobile radars, multiple sounding systems, the Millersville University Profiling System, the UAH Mobile Integrated Profiling System, and a variety of other surface in-situ instruments.  The focus of this particular research team's activities is on the intersection of LeS and influences of higher terrain, e.g. as represented by the Tug Hill Plateau region of upstate New York.  They will make use of climatological analysis, field research, real-data numerical modeling and idealized large-eddy simulations to address two overarching questions related to LeS:  1) How does the interplay between environmental conditions, cloud processes, lake shape and size, and terrain scale and geometry affect orographic precipitation enhancement during lake-effect storms?; and 2) Under what conditions does orography modify the morphology of LeS and the generation, distribution, and intensity of precipitation over surrounding lowland areas?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main regions of study will be areas around the Great Salt Lake and the Tug Hill Plateau downwind of Lake Ontario.  This team plans to contribute two snow observation stations and a deployable rawinsounding system to OWLeS field effort.  The intellectual merit of this effort is centered on evaluation of the following three main hypotheses: 1) The height of the capping inversion or stable layer relative to the downstream barrier crest regulates orographic precipitation enhancement and the lowland to mountain precipitation ratio; 2) Ice particle growth and fallout from the lake-effect system and boundary layer turbulence are important contributors to orographic precipitation in unblocked lake-effect events; and 3) Large lake-land temperature contrasts and associated land-breeze convergence yield lake-dominated events, whereas terrain-dominated events occur during periods with weaker lake-land temperature contrasts.  Broader impacts of the project will include the participation of undergraduate students in data collection, education and training of two graduate students, one of which is drawn from an underrepresented group in atmospheric sciences, and various outreach activities.  This research has the potential to contribute to improved prediction of lake-effect heavy snow storm events, which would in turn support both societal and economic benefits.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Lake-effect snowstorms have dramatic impacts on ground and air transportation, public utilities, and local and regional economies downstream of the Great Lakes of North America and other large bodies of water around the world (Figure 1).  Lake-effect snowfall can be especially intense and prolific over hills, mountains, and plateaus that lie downstream of large bodies of water.  This project has specifically investigated how and why hills, mountains, and plateaus influence the intensity of lake-effect snowfall.  During December 2013 and January 2014, the Ontario Winter Lake-effect Systems (OWLeS) field program was conducted in upstate New York to examine lake-effect storms over and downstream of Lake Ontario.  During OWLeS, we operated a network of precipitation radars and snowfall measurement stations to advance our understanding of how storms evolve as they move from the east shore of Lake Ontario to the highest reaches of the Tug Hill Plateau (Figure 2).  The observations, combined with computer modeling, have transformed our understanding of how the Tug Hill Plateau affects lake-effect storms.  Prior to this research, it was widely viewed that the increase in lake-effect snowfall over the Tug Hill Plateau was due to a deepening and strengthening of the updrafts in lake-effect storms.  Instead, we have shown that the storms become shallower and the updrafts weaker, with the greater snowfall over the Tug Hill Plateau a result of the snowfall becoming steadier and more persistent.  We have also shown that the enhancement of snowfall over the plateau, relative to along the coast of Lake Ontario, is smallest when the lake-effect storm is organized in an intense, narrow band (Figure 3) and weakest when the lake-effect storm is less organized (Figure 4).  Finally, we have shown how the unique shape of the Lake Ontario coastline produces important airmass boundaries known as land-breeze fronts that ultimately affect the development of the lake-effect storm and its enhancement over the Tug Hill Plateau.  These and other project findings advance scientific knowledge of lake-effect systems and have been disseminated to the science community through nine articles in major peer-reviewed journals and 24 oral and poster presentations at major national and international conferences.  Through webinars, our research findings have also been communicated to National Weather Service meteorologists who forecast for the Tug Hill Plateau.  Our activities also involved significant outreach efforts.  During OWLeS, we visited rural public schools, providing hands-on lessons on the intricacies of winter storms and tours of Doppler on Wheels mobile radars operated by the Center for Severe Weather Research (Figure 5).   Regular posts to our Wasatch Weather Weenies blog, which receives as many as 70,000 page views during winter months, enabled the public to experience field-program activities and lake-effect storms, as well as our science discoveries.  Based in part on research conducted during this project, we have also helped to develop an exhibit at the Alf Engen Ski Museum in Utah, which has over 450,000 annual visitors, specifically covering winter storms and snow. Three graduate students were trained and mentored during the project, one receiving their MS degree and two receiving their PHDs.             Last Modified: 08/16/2017       Submitted by: W.
