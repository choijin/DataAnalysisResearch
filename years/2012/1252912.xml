<AbstractNarration>This project studies various phenomena related to diffusive tracer particles in a strong array of opposing vorticies. One particularly interesting aspect is a seemingly anomalous diffusive behaviour exhibited on "intermediate" time scales. On long time scales this anomalous diffusive behaviour should "average" to an effectively Brownian behaviour, recovering classical homogenization results. The project crucially uses tools from both Probability and PDE. The educational component of this project aims to further interaction between these two areas from the undergraduate to the post-graduate level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Observing the movement of gravel particles shows intermittent periods of rest and travel. One aspect of this project studies an idealised system modelling this behaviour with the eventual aim of rigorously quantifying the "rest and travel". This is closely related to questions about homogenization -- the approximation of inhomogeneous media with microscopic inhomogeneities by a homogeneous one. This project crucially uses tools from two connected but different areas in Mathematics: Probability and PDE. The educational component of this project aims to further interaction between these two areas from the undergraduate level all the way to the post-graduate level.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The main intellectual merit of this award was an understanding of the  effective behavior of advected tracer particles on intermediate time  scales. It is well known that on long time scales the effective behavior of such  particles is usually purely diffusive. In some situations, however, these time scales are too long to be of  practical interest, and we instead study the effective behavior on  shorter (intermediate) time scales. Surprisingly, we find that on these time scales, the effective behaviour  is not purely diffusive and involves a memory effect. The main results obtained through this award study this using tools from  Probability, PDE and Analysis.  In addition to the above, PI also studied the following problems:  The interaction between mixing and diffusion. The tangling / winding of random (Brownian) trajectories. Scaling limits of Branching and Coalescent processes. Bose-Einstein condensation in low density plasmas. The dynamic breakdown of Type II super-conductors. A dynamic instability in the $Q$-tensor model for nematic liquid crystals. The analysis of certain equations arising in the numerical study of incompressible fluids.   The scope of this award also included a significant educational  component, through which the following activities were performed.  The creation of a new PDE course for undergraduates. Co-organizing a working group stochastic PDEs for graduate students, and young researchers. Co-organizing a mini-symposium on PDEs for researchers at the AMS annual meeting. Supervising 3 post-docs, and collectively producing 5 published papers. Supervising 3 graduate students, and one masters student, who collectively produced 4 published papers. Giving over 40 seminars and research presentations, hosting over 25 leading experts, and funding student / post-doc travel.   All the research performed through this award has been submitted  to/published in peer-reviewed journals, and has been posted on the arXiv  (a free, publicly accessible preprint server). All educational materials developed have been posted ononline  (on the PIs website, and/or on open source hosting sites) and are freely  accessible to the general public.
