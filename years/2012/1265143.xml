<AbstractNarration>This project builds upon two major results of priorr research to develop high performance Solid Oxide Fuel Cells (SOFCs) with improved durability and reliability using unique multilayered structural approach to design and process of electrolyte and cathode/anode constituents of the single cells. The first is the multilayered electrolytes with carefully designed thermal residual stresses bringing the significant increase in reliability of the electrolytes and the single cell as a whole, at the same time allowing maintaining the very high oxygen ion conductivity and chemical and phase stability of the structures. The second is the use of the catalytically active perovskites cathodes deposited by the superior additive manufacturing techniques on the electrolyte substrates. It is expected that highly compatible electrodes/electrolyte assemblies will be produced as single solid oxide fuel cells exhibiting superior power densities, reliability, and durability at lower operational temperatures. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is a growing global industry for fuel cells including, but not limited to: telecommunications; space industry; hospital and commercial building backup and; large-scale data backup.  Fuel cells can potentially supply the total power demand for large capacity applications, while reducing carbon dioxide emissions. The SOFC systems developed through this project are quiet, have no carbon emissions and have the potential to reduce facility energy service costs. SOFCs can also be positioned on-site in remote areas, making it possible to match power generation to the electrical demands of the site.</AbstractNarration>
