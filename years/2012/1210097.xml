<AbstractNarration>This action funds Dacotah Michael Melicher of North Dakota State University to conduct a research project, entitled "The evolutionary origin of appendages in sepsid flies," during the summer of 2012 at The National University of Singapore in Singapore.  The host scientist is Dr. Rudolf Meier.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Intellectual Merit of the research lies in the investigation of the evolutionary and developmental origins of a novel, jointed abdominal appendage which appears to have evolved independently in several species of sepsid flies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.  These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The research described here was funded by the NSF East Asia and Pacific Summer Institute program with several objectives. The first objective is to foster international collaboration between our research partner in Singapore who has access to a large, globally distributed collection of sepsid flies and taxonomic information on these species and our university which has experience with molecular and genomic techniques. Sepsid flies are an emerging model system for the evolution of new traits.  Adult male flies have a complex jointed appendage on their abdomen which is not found outside the family Sepsidae.  The appendage is present in some sepsid species showing a pattern of primary gain, secondary loss, and recovery of the lost appendage in individual species within the family.  The second objective is to obtain larval tissue samples from species which represent clades within the Sepsidae family in target species representative of the pattern described above.  This tissue was stained, mounted, and photographed and statistical analysis was performed on laval cell counts obtained from this tissue.  The tissue mounts were returned to North Dakota State University and are part of ongoing research into larval development.  During the exchange period EAPSI funding was used for travel and lodging in Singapore.  The research described here will improve our understanding of the evolution of new traits and the mechanisms which produce them.  This exchange has also helped solidify an ongoing exchange between North Dakota State University and and the National University of Singapore.
