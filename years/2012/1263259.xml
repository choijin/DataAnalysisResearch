<AbstractNarration>This award from the Division of Chemistry (CHE) at the National Science Foundation supports a Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Site led by Professors David R. Benson and Joseph A. Heppert at the University of Kansas (KU). The research projects supported at this Site entitled "A Summer Experience for Undergraduates Integrating Research, Education, and Career Development in an Interdisciplinary Environment", is dedicated to providing for the students a stimulating interdisciplinary environment with a multifaceted career enhancement program that encourages and prepares the participants for graduate studies and careers in the chemical sciences. Key components of the program include ethics and safety training, panel discussions highlighting the variety of career options available to chemists (including entrepreneurship), a short course on green chemistry, and site visits to companies and institutions in the greater Kansas City Area that are engaged in interdisciplinary science. The participants will benefit from the highly collaborative environment provided by the large KU chemical community, close interactions with faculty and graduate student (or postdoctoral) mentors, state-of-the-art facilities, and opportunities to communicate and disseminate their accomplishments in written and oral forms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Additionally, the NSF funding that is requested to support 10 participants per year will be given to students who have limited opportunities for research at their home institutions. This includes students at primarily undergraduate institutions, as well as students at other schools who cannot partake of available research opportunities for personal economic reasons. Additional participants will be supported by individual faculty research grants. The goals are for at least 50% of the NSF-funded participants to be women, and for 20-30% to come from traditionally underrepresented groups in the sciences. This REU Site program has provided summer research experiences for more than 450 undergraduates from across the country over the past 25 years, thereby effectively serving as a regional hub for undergraduate research.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit  This NSF-REU award provided direct support for 30 undergraduate students to engage in cutting edge, interdisciplinary research at the University of Kansas (KU) during the summers of 2013-2015.  An additional student was supported by a no-cost extension in Summer 2016, joining 9 undergraduates funded by a subsequent NSF-REU award.  All but one of the 31 NSF-funded participants were from Primarily Undergraduate Institutions, in keeping with our goal of providing students with their first major research experience.   The full cohort of undergraduates taking part in the KU Chemistry REU program each summer ranged from 14-20 students, and included additional students from PUIs supported by individual faculty research grants, one or more KU student ambassadors, and at least one international student supported by other means.  A key component of the KU Chemistry REU experience is a Career Enhancement Program (CEP) that combines career options discussions, a professional development symposium, and a "short course" on Green Chemistry.  Career options discussions during the 2013-2016 seasons included sessions with former REU students who are currently in the KU Chemistry graduate program, KU faculty members, a chemistry professor from a PUI, and chemists working in industry including entrepreneurs housed at the KU Bioscience &amp; Technology Business Center.  Career options discussions were also featured in at least one field trip each summer, destinations which included the Stowers Institute for Medical Research in Kansas City, MO, the Kansas City District Laboratory of the US Food and Drug Administration, and the research facilities of the KU Center for Environmentally Beneficial Catalysis (CEBC).   The Green Chemistry "short course" introduced for this grant period was designed to take advantage of opportunities offered through our partnership with the KU CEBC and the growing number of faculty with research focused on sustainability issues in chemistry.  One session featured a presentation at the CEBC that included a general introduction to green chemistry principles and an overview of an ongoing project with one of their industrial collaborators.  Two additional sessions featured "big picture" presentations by Chemistry faculty with research interests that touch on various aspects of sustainability in chemical industry.   Strengthening scientific communication skills is a major objective of the KU Chemistry REU program.  All participants gave public oral presentations about their research goals and progress, and reported their final results in poster format at an end of summer multi-disciplinary research symposium open to all summer undergraduate researchers at KU.  A well-received change to the program was instituted in Summer 2015, wherein students gave short presentations about goals of their research projects early in the program, as well as more formal presentations featuring their research accomplishments during the final week.  We also encourage participants to give presentations at regional or national scientific conferences, and 20 of the 31 students supported by this grant did so (17 poster presentations and one oral presentation at American Chemical Society national meetings, one poster presentation at Pittcon, and one poster at ABRCAMS).   In addition, five papers featuring work by the NSF-funded REU participants have been published in peer-reviewed scientific journals, with several more planned or in progress.  Results of anonymous online surveys indicated that the students made substantial gains in many key areas, including thinking and working like a scientist, and developing useful research skills.  The survey data further revealed that our program greatly increased the likelihood of attending graduate school for approximately 70% of the 31 participants.  Information about the 31 students supported by this award can be found on the KU Chemistry REU web site (http://www.chemreu.ku.edu/alumni).     Broader Impact    The KU Chemistry REU program is designed to provide cutting edge research experiences to students in four year institutions having limited research infrastructure.  All but one of the 31 students supported by this award met this criterion, whereas only ~50% of students pursuing graduate degrees in Chemistry at US Universities are from PUIs.  Our recruiting efforts are also geared toward increasing the diversity of the STEM workforce, by encouraging participation of women and members of traditionally underrepresented groups in the sciences, including students with disabilities.  Of the 31 participants supported by this award, 55% are women and 29% are from underrepresented minority groups.  These are significantly above the national averages (~40% and ~10%, respectively) for Chemistry PhD recipients.          Last Modified: 09/21/2017       Submitted by: David R Benson]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
