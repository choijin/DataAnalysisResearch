<AbstractNarration>The existence of dark matter is known from gravitational effects, but its nature remains a deep mystery. One possibility motivated by other considerations in elementary particle physics is that dark matter consists of undiscovered elementary particles; Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) are one possibility. Evidence for WIMPs that could constitute dark matter may come from experiments at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN or from sensitive astronomical instruments that detect radiation produced by WIMP-WIMP annihilations in galaxy halos. The orbital motion of the WIMPs composing the dark matter halo pervading the galaxy should result in WIMP-nuclear collisions of sufficient energy to be observable by sensitive laboratory apparatus. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will provide funding for research and development steps to support DarkSide-G2, a second-generation ("G2") direct WIMP search using a liquid argon Time Projection Chamber (TPC) with an active mass of 3.3 tons. Liquid argon is a promising medium for WIMP detection due to its efficient conversion of energy from WIMP-induced nuclear recoils into both ionization and scintillation. The argon scintillation time profile ("pulse shape") depends on the type of ionizing particle, providing particle discrimination that can be used to suppress background. This is one of the most powerful background rejection factors among all dark matter detectors, and when combined with the measurement of ionization, background rejection is even further enhanced. The performance of a ton-scale or larger liquid argon TPC would be limited by the high rate of 39-Ar beta decays if atmospheric argon was used. DarkSide-G2 will use argon collected from underground sources which has been shown to have 39-Ar content lower than atmospheric argon by at least a factor of 150. These funds will allow the groups to carry out the detailed mechanical design work necessary to ensure the functionality of the detector, develop necessary high voltage and data acquisition elements, and develop and identify the extremely radiopure detector components and techniques necessary to maximize the sensitivity of the experiment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts: This activity will advance the development of astroparticle physics and its scientific and educational mission in a variety of ways: (1) it will offer a continuing opportunity for the training of students, who will have a chance to contribute a cutting-edge project in fundamental science and advanced engineering; (2) it will benefit society by developing techniques that could find application in areas ranging from national security to medical imaging; and (3) it will support continued development of successful E&amp;O programs such as the LNGS-South Dakota-Princeton summer school for high school students.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The major goal of the program was the preparation of a proposal for a second generation argon dark matter detector.  The DarkSide collaboration, with support from this grant, submitted in November 2013 to NSF and DOE full proposal for DarkSide-G2, an underground argon dark matter detector with a proposed sensitivity of 2x10-47 cm2.  NSF and DOE opted to decline the proposal in July 2014.  We continued nevertheless the development towards larger and more sensitive underground argon dark matter detectors.  We submitted in April 2015 to Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso a Letter of Intent for DarkSide-20k, a 20-tonne fiducial target of low-radioactivity argon and operate within existing infrastructure already constructed as part of the DS program at LNGS.  DarkSide-20k is conceived to accumulate a background-free exposure of 100 tonne&times;yr and to reach a sensitivity of 9&times;10-48 cm2 for a 1 TeV/c2 dark matter particle mass (9&times;10-47 cm2 for 10 TeV/c2).  DarkSide-20k will be capable of achieving the highest sensitivity for high mass dark matter particles of any experiment currently "on the books".  If approved promptly, it could become the most powerful dark matter experiment searching for high mass dark matter to start data taking by 2020.  The stated improvement in sensitivity requires the development of two new technologies: the production of many tonnes of depleted argon and the use of cryogenic photosensors based on SiPM arrays with area of several square meters.  We also redefined our long-term goal as that to reach the sensitivity level set by the so called "neutrino floor", i.e. the dark matter sensitivity level where coherent nuclear scattering by atmospheric neutrinos provides one count of background.  Based on the result from DarkSide-50 with atmospheric and underground argon, we believe that an experiment based on low-radioactivity argon is uniquely capable of achieving this sensitivity.  We defined as part of our long-term program the development at LNGS of a 300-tonne depleted argon experiment.  For now, we call this ultimate experiment Argo.  Argo is conceived to accumulate an exposure of 1,000 tonne&times;yr free of background other than that induced by coherent scattering of neutrinos, and thus reach beyond the sensitivity corresponding to the `neutrino floor? in dark matter searches.  As well as providing the most sensitive WIMP search, Argo would also carry out an ambitious program of precision measurements on low-energy solar neutrinos (7Be, pep, and CNO neutrinos) through neutrino-electron elastic scattering.  Liquid argon has a scintillation light yield ten times larger than that of the organic liquid scintillator target of Borexino, yielding in turn a much sharper energy resolution.  The use of the two-phase argon technology affords a sharp definition of the fiducial volume effecting a strong reduction of the systematic error that dominates the measurement of 7Be neutrinos in Borexino.  The anticipated precision of the measurement is 2% for 7Be, 10% for pep, and 15% for CNO neutrinos.  This award resulted in:  The most sensitive direct dark matter search with argon, registering no background events for a (1422&plusmn;67) kg&times;d exposure with an atmospheric argon fill and for a ~2000 kg&times;d exposure of underground argon, corresponding to a 90% C.L. upper limit on the WIMP-nucleon spin-independent cross section of ~2&times;10&minus;44 cm2 for a WIMP mass of 100 GeV/c2; The procurement of a 150 kg batch of underground argon, now filled in the DarkSide-50 detector, and verified to be highly depleted in 39Ar; The development of the technology of LAr TPC with depleted argon fill, which was proven capable of running with extremely low background. This technology is well poised to be scaled to significantly larger detectors while maintaining the ability of running with a very low background; The approval, by LNGS and INFN, of DarkSide-20k, dating April 2017; The construction of a single global argon program around DarkSide-20k.  DarkSide-20k is now participated by researchers from the ArDM, DarkSide, DEAP, and MiniClean Collaborations, to form a single global program of argon dark matter searches.  This new program was announced at the U.S. Dark Matter Workshop in dates March 23-25, 2017.  The abstract for the announcement is reported below in Italics.
