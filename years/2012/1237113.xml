<AbstractNarration>This Innovation Corps project proposes a technology that will focus on reducing the time, cost and effort, and on extending the capability, associated with machining of primarily but not limited to semiconductors and ceramics such as silicon, silicon carbide, sapphire, and others. The proposed technology (Micro Laser Assisted Machining) benefits the manufacture of challenging materials that are hard and brittle. The 50% decrease in material hardness during the Micro Laser Assisted Machining process can be directly correlated to the improved tool life and doubling of machining productivity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, this innovation will eventually result in entirely new capabilities relative to production of materials and products currently not viable or achievable due to processing or use-limitations. Potential applications to emerging technologies, such as turbines and plug-in electric vehicles, where advanced high power and high temperature operation of devices is required, such as IGBTs, may prove to be compatible with the micro laser assisted machining processing technology, possibly resulting in reduced overall manufacturing costs and improved quality.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Micro-LAM project outcomes and findings that address the intellectual    merit and broader impacts:  The successful project outcomes include:  Hypothesis testing, business model canvas, customer discovery and development, minimum viable product (MVP), getting out of the lab and meeting with over 150 companies, and demonstrating the technology in an industrial setting.   As a result of the I-Corps program we have identified customers' needs that address their problems and configured our technology as a solution to meet their requirements.  The technology has been taken out of the university laboratory and applied to real world, industrial, manufacturing successfully.   The broader impacts of our project include: development of faculty and students to participate in start up businesses based upon a university spin off company.  Using technology (IP) orginiating at a university as the basis for a business to commercial the reserach results will enhance our manufacturing competitiveness (making products better, faster and cheaper) and contributing to economic development through the creation of jobs and business development.  The technology has attracted interest from a variety of large industrial seqments, including: optics, semiconductor, automotive and aerospace and printing.  Applications include ceramic and semiconductor materials processing, and applications for metal and glass manufacturing.   The I-Corps program lead directly to the successful establishment of an SBIR Phase I award (July 1, 2012) to continue commercialization activities (R&amp;D) of the technology.  These awards were augmented with grants and contracts from the Michigan and University Technology Development Funds (Mi-ETF and TDF respectively), with assistance from local, regional, state economic developers.
