<AbstractNarration>Although scientists have learned much in the past 20 years about how individual ecosystems are likely to respond to climate change, extending this knowledge to regional and continental scales has been a far greater challenge. At these larger spatial scales, both the environment and the attributes of ecosystems vary dramatically. For example, in the central US, there are strong temperature and rainfall gradients from Texas to North Dakota and the dry plains of Colorado to eastern Kansas, and the types of grasslands differ as well (from short grasslands in the west to tall grasslands in the east). In order to better forecast how entire regions will respond to expected climatic changes, there is a pressing need to understand why ecosystems differ in their sensitivity to changes in climate.  This project includes research designed to answer a question of fundamental importance for advancing knowledge of biological processes at large scales:  How important are the attributes of ecosystems per se vs. the environmental context in which climate is changing in determining ecological responses to climate change at regional scales?  To answer this question, a geographically distributed field experiment will be conducted at six sites in NM, CO, WY and KS and the results from this experiment will be used to strengthen an existing process-based terrestrial ecosystem model. With this model, the relative importance of ecosystem attributes versus the environment for determining responses to climate change will be evaluated and then scaling rules for extending site-based knowledge to regional scales will be developed.  The experiment imposed will be a severe multi-year drought in grasslands arrayed along a rainfall gradient (from desert grassland to mesic tallgrass prairie).  Key responses measured will include many related to carbon cycling and budgets and plant biodiversity. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project has a number of broader impacts including enhancing existing terrestrial ecosystem modeling approaches, and conducting a field experiment that will provide a platform for others in the scientific community to conduct additional research activities.  A project website will make products (datasets, key results, papers, models) available to the scientific community and general public. Research will occur on federal lands and at a number of other research stations where outreach programs are in place, allowing results to be shared with a wide range of stakeholders.  The project is also designed to provide training opportunities for numerous graduate and undergraduate students. Because this study is unique in its spatial extent and combination of field and modeling approaches, the collaborative training opportunities available to students differs substantially from traditional degree programs.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ To improve forecasts of how grasslands across the central US will respond to expected increases in drought in the future, we conducted an experiment where we imposed identical droughts in six different grasslands in the central US from New Mexico, to Colorado, to Wyoming to Kansas. These sites span temperature and rainfall gradients, and reflect a strong gradient in the type of grasses that occur in each.  Our interest was in determining if some grasslands were more sensitive to drought than others, and why.  We measured responses in above and below ground plant growth (productivity) and plant biodiversity in droughted and non-droughted plots. Growing season drought was imposed identically in all sites over a 4-yar period by removing 66% of each natural rainfall event by using experimental drought shelters in the field (see photo).     We found initially that grasslands in the drier regions of the US were more sensitive to drought than those in regions that received more rainfall. However, over time, the more mesic grasslands responded to drought more strongly. We also compared our experimental treatments to responses to a natural drought at the six sites.  Results from both were similar and consistent with previously published patterns of sensitivity to precipitation change generated at larger geographic scales.     Changes in plant community composition reflected responses to drought over time. Although changes in overall biodiversity were minimal, there were substantial changes in the abundances of different plant species in response to drought at each site.     Overall, our research has impacted our fundamental knowledge-base of how ecosystems respond to drought as well as informing theory and providing new methods to facilitate the success of other researchers.  Our results have relevance for developing new domestic livestock grazing management plans to cope with a future of increasing drought frequency.  We have specifically published our results in journals that reach managers and other stakeholders.     Finally, six different field technicians received training and professional development opportunities from their employment by this project and four graduate students have made this project the centerpiece of their research activities as part of their PhD programs.
