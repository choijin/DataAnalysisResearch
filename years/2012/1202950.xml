<AbstractNarration>The intellectual merit of this award is based on the fact that a sensitive search for neutrino-less nuclear double-beta decay is the only practical way to determine if neutrinos are Majorana particles (their own antiparticles). This exotic decay is the most sensitive test of lepton-number conservation, which is an important symmetry in elementary particle physics. In fact, if neutrinos are Majorana particles, an accurate measurement of the beta-decay half-life would yield the effective Majorana mass of the electron neutrino. The laboratory observation and measurement of such a decay would be truly transformative of elementary particle physics, astrophysics and cosmology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award provides base support for a team working on two neutrino-less double-beta decay experiments: USC has a major task for CUORE (using Tellurium-130) at the Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso (LNGS). The PI is the U.S. Coordinator for the construction of CUORE-0, which will operate in the CUORICINO cryostat and yield physics beyond that of CUORICINO, the precursor experiment to CUORE. USC also leads a major Task in the MAJORANA DEMONSTRATOR R&amp;D (using Germanium-76). The PI is responsible for the procurement of enriched 76-Germanium Oxide, its reduction to metal, zone refinement to detector quality metal, and reprocessing of scrap material. He was responsible for building the facility for the Germanium-processing and is in charge of its operation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A broader impact would be an important contribution to cosmology. Another is, and has been, new detector technology for National and Homeland security. A third broader impact is new cryogenic and Germanium-detector technology for other basic and applied sciences. CUORE is yielding the new technology of large cryogenic detectors.</AbstractNarration>
