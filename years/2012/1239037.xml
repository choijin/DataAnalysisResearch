<AbstractNarration>This CPS Frontiers project addresses highly dynamic Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs), understood as systems where a computing delay of a few milliseconds or an incorrectly computed response to a disturbance can lead to catastrophic consequences.  Such is the case of cars losing traction when cornering at high speed, unmanned air vehicles performing critical maneuvers such as landing, or disaster and rescue response bipedal robots rushing through the rubble to collect information or save human lives.  The preceding examples currently share a common element: the design of their control software is made possible by extensive experience, laborious testing and fine tuning of parameters, and yet, the resulting closed-loop system has no formal guarantees of meeting specifications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The vision of the project is to provide a methodology that allows for complex and dynamic CPSs to meet real-world requirements in an efficient and robust way through the formal synthesis of control software. The research is developing a formal framework for correct-by-construction control software synthesis for highly dynamic CPSs with broad applications to automotive safety systems, prostheses, exoskeletons, aerospace systems, manufacturing, and legged robotics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The design methodology developed here will improve the competitiveness of segments of industry that require a tight integration between hardware and highly advanced control software such as: automotive (dynamic stability and control), aerospace (UAVs), medical (prosthetics, orthotics, and exoskeleton design) and robotics (legged locomotion). To enhance the impact of these efforts, the PIs are developing interdisciplinary teaching materials to be made freely available and disseminating their work to a broad audience.</AbstractNarration>

The vision of the project was to develop new methodologies that allow for complex and dynamic CPSs to meet real-world requirements in an efficient and robust way through the formal synthesis of control software.

These methods are compatible with legacy software.   &gt;Three methods for addressing modularity and composition of control specifications: passivity indices, ranking functions, and robust invariance.   &gt;Three new methods for attacking the so-called "curse of Dimensionality" in correct by construction control methods: A new temporal logic based on counting specifications, that is, contol problems that must keep track of the number of agents that are attending to a plurality of tasks; satisfiability modulo convex optimization which treats specifications of larrge size that can be cast as a disjunction of convex constraints; and a theoretically sound manner to combine tools from machine learning with trajectory optimization.   &gt; Two methods were developed for designing controllers on the basis of data.  One focused on system identification.  It uses both additive and multiplicative uncertainty models and formulates a robust optimization method to choose a model that is the least conservative for the design of correct-by-construction controllers.  A second method designs a model-free controller for which it is possible to formally prove the existence of a sufficiently high sampling rate ensuring that conrollers solving output regulation and tracking problems for the approximate linear model also solve the same problems for the true and unknown nonlinear model.   &gt; The theoretical results were complicated with numerical tools and many concregte examples.
