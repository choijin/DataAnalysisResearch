<AbstractNarration>Rutland High School (RHS) in socio-economically diverse Rutland, Vermont, is piloting a new program for engaging upper level high school students in learning about Earth system science through integration of chemistry, physics, biology, and technology in classroom- and field-based experiences.  A new semester-long course called "New England Landscapes: A Field Based Study of Local Geology through Chemistry, Biology and Physics" is helping students develop the critical thinking, problem solving, observation, and science writing skills that will engage them in the geosciences and better prepare them for the collegiate level.  This course, which emphasizes instruction and use of field methods and introduction to local geology, is being road-tested by 24 students. The course incorporates multiple weekend and day-long field excursions through-out the New England region, during which students engage in hands-on implementation of the methods they learn in the classroom.  Through the Year End Studies (YES) plan program, half of these students participate in a two and a half-week, intensive opportunity to conduct authentic research, building on individual research proposals developed during the semester course.  This abbreviated semester provides a focused enrichment opportunity for students especially interested in the geosciences.  During that time, students will return to the field to collect relevant samples and data, utilize collaborator Princeton University's laboratory space for sample analysis, and produce a final paper on their findings.  Evaluation activities during the pilot phase are being used to identify the potential of the program to serve as a model that could be replicated elsewhere.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>American secondary schools traditionally move students through a sequential series of science classes. For many educational programs, the course offerings and pedagogy do not promote the development of future geoscientists. Attracting and retaining top students in the geosciences requires a shift in the current curriculum paradigm away from traditional, teacher-centered instruction, and towards interdisciplinary inquiry-based learning. This project focused on the development and implementation of New England Landscapes (NEL), a field-based course that integrates concepts from biology, chemistry, and physics to help students explore local geology. <br /> &nbsp;<br /> There were four primary objectives for the NEL course: improving science literacy, building the future geoscience workforce, developing geoscience education networks, and introducing students to innovative technologies for geosciences. Positive results were observed in all four areas. <br /> <br /> Improvement in science literacy was measured through a series of pre- and post-assessments that evaluated student understanding in general science literacy standards (hypothesizing, questioning, etc.) and geoscience-specific standards (conservation of matter, earth systems). A traditionally taught college preparatory biology class was used as a control group. Overall, the NEL students showed a 0.5 point growth while the control group only improved by 0.05 points in the general science literacy standards. An even greater improvement occurred with the geoscience standards scores where then NEL mean improvement was 1.2 points. No control was used for the geoscience content specific standards due to the specialized nature of the material. Attached figures summarize these results. <br /> <br /> In addition to the quantitative data, there is significant qualitative data that points toward the success of this course in building a future geoscience workforce. Students completed surveys reflecting on the NEL course and future plans. As of spring 2014, 40% of NEL students are either currently majoring or plan to major in geosciences at the university level. Prior to NEL, many of these students did not recognize the potential to pursue a career in both geology and another science such as physics or chemistry. These students may have been influenced by the field-based approach, which provides authentic examples of professional opportunities in the geosciences. Encouraging students to actively participate in inquiry, rather than just learn about science content, allows for the development of long lasting interest and connection with this field of study.
