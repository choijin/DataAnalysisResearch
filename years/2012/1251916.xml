<AbstractNarration>This study aims to determine whether the efficiency of inspections can be improved by changing the number of inspectors sent to conduct an inspection.  Individuals behave differently in group settings and therefore inspections conducted by a group, as opposed to a sole-inspector, may result in different outcomes (such as in the severity of sanctions or the ability to deter future violations).   This study will also investigate several explanations for why an additional inspector might matter, including collusion, social pressure or the ability to share work. Concern has been expressed that inspectors might become 'captured' by the regulated party or that social pressure might dissuade inspectors from issuing citations for violations.  This project will add to the small but growing literature on the behavior of enforcement agents as well as identify the role of group effects in the inspector-inspected relationship as an important area of scientific inquiry.&lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;This study will examine data from government inspections of offshore oil and gas platforms in the Gulf of Mexico to determine whether increasing the number of inspectors sent to a platform influences the severity of penalties issued as well as the deterrence of future oil spills, injuries, and fatalities.  Two natural experiments (specifically, daily variation in helicopter flying conditions and a permanent closure of an inspections office) will be used to estimate the effect of inspection group size and the number of prior visits of the same platform by the same inspector. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project also has substantial broader impacts.  Current budgetary pressures on regulatory agencies underscore the importance of designing optimal inspections. This project will provide new insights to regulators on the effectiveness of increasing enforcement as well as how to properly deploy scarce inspector resources. Concerns about inspection in the nuclear, coal mining, and oil industries highlights the importance of understanding the role that inspector intensity plays in ensuring compliance.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Government inspection agencies typically face large workloads and small budgets.  Individual inspectors and inspection teams are tasked with periodically visiting sites and issuing notices of violations and/or penalties upon detection of violations.  Yet, little is known about whether sending a team of inspectors is better than sending a one inspector &ndash; or if increasing team size will improve outcomes. This study seeks to answer the questions of whether changing the number of inspectors that are sent to a site has an effect on (1) the penalties that are issued and (2) the subsequent impact on safety.   We focus on inspections of offshore oil and gas platforms in the Gulf of Mexico.  Inspecting offshore platforms is a costly endeavor.  There are over 3,000 platforms in the Gulf of Mexico, which must be inspected at least once every year, by a staff of only approximately 55 inspectors. After the BP Deepwater Horizon spill in 2010, it was widely recognized that the enforcement agency was underfunded, and in 2012, the total budget for the regulator doubled to $50 million, with the call to "hire new oil and gas inspectors."  We use historical data on inspections conducted from 2003 to 2010 to examine the impact of increasing inspection team sizes.  A key difficulty to overcome in designing a reliable research project on inspection team size is that platforms that are thought to be poor performers may be sent more inspectors (in anticipation of more violations) or fewer inspectors (in anticipation that violations will be easy to detect).  Therefore we use a random assignment of inspector group size, which is driven by weather-inflicted restrictions, to identify the effect of group size.  Inspections of offshore platforms require the use of helicopters to take inspectors to the platforms; however, whether a helicopter can fly depends on weather conditions.  On occasion, bad weather only afflicts part of the inspection area, while the remainder of the area is still accessible.  When this happens in the Gulf, inspection plans are modified at the last minute, and more inspectors are sent on fewer inspections.    Using this random assignment of inspector group size, we find that increasing the number of inspectors that are sent to a site increases the severity of the sanctions that are issued (e.g., more platforms are required to be shut down).  Creating larger inspection groups comes at a cost: either new inspectors have to be hired or fewer inspections can be conducted.  However, our findings show that trading off the number of inspections with the number of inspectors is worthwhile if a regulator prefers more severe penalties.     We then use the variation in sanction severity to examine the effect on future safety outcomes.  We find large, but statistically insignificant, reductions in self-reported incidents, such as oil spills, explosions, injuries and fatalities, occurring in the short term (six and twelve months) after a platform was inspected by a team with more inspectors.  Without further data collection, it is not possible to determine whether our findings are driven by  penalties being too small to change behavior or due to low statistical power from the infrequency of these self-reported incidents.   While our empirical context is the enforcement of safety regulations in the Gulf of Mexico, the implications of our findings are likely to carry over to most government enforcement activities facing resource constraints.  If a regulator is faced with choosing between more inspections or more inspectors, we show that the increase in severe sanctions that result from sending an additional inspector is larger than the increase in sanction severity from performing an additional inspection.
