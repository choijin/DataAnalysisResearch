<AbstractNarration>Agricultural productivity is driven by photosynthetic activity, which occurs in tissues of plant shoot systems.  A major limitation to shoot size (and productivity) arises from adverse soil conditions, such as drought, compaction, and saline conditions.  Plant roots are biological sensors that detect these adverse conditions, and by an unknown mechanism, cause the shoot system to slow or arrest growth.  This project will test whether the root-to-shoot stress signal is the same mobile signaling molecule that is produced in Arabidopsis bps1 mutants.  BYPASS (BPS) proteins function to prevent synthesis of a small metabolite, the bps signal, which moves from the root and arrests shoot growth.  The principle investigator hypothesizes that the bps signal is a previously undescribed plant hormone, and preliminary data indicate that it stops growth by interfering with stem cell identity.  Approaches include a full analysis of gene expression changes in shoots treated with the bps signal, and molecular and genetic experiments to uncover the mechanism of bps signal gene regulation.  Experiments will also investigate whether, in normal plants, the bps signal is produced in response to stress.  These experiments will use transgenic Arabidopsis plants that carry markers that respond to the bps signal and will use metabolomic approaches to measure bps signal levels.  These investigations are critical for developing strategies to reducing agricultural crop losses due to soil-related stresses.  Investigators involved in this research also provide educational opportunities to the community including girl scouts, K-12 schools, prisoners, and local garden clubs, and develop laboratory teaching materials for college and high school students.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goal of this project was to elucidate the mechanism by which plant shoot growth is regulated by a small molecule that is synthesized in plant roots.  Shoots are dependent on water and nutrients that are supplied by the root, and so plants have evolved mechanisms to coordinate shoot growth with conditions in the soil.  However, we currently have little understanding of this process; we know little of the chemical nature of root-derived signaling molecules or the mechanism by which they regulate shoot growth?  This is also an economically important question because a root that senses drought is known to produce signals that cause the shoot to reduce growth.      This project's scientific goal was to characterize the mechanism by which Arabidopsis shoot growth is regulated by the root-derived signaling molecule called dalekin.  Dalekin is over-produced in roots of Arabidopsis bypass1 (bps1) mutants, and has been demonstrated to be a graft-transmissible compound that is sufficient to repress expression of WUSCHEL (WUS), a key regulator of shoot stem cells.  We previously showed that dalekin does not use the well-established CLAVATA signaling pathway to repress WUS expression.  This project used three approaches to elucidate the mechanism by which dalekin represses WUS expression.  First, mild changes in ionic conditions, e.g. 50 mM KCl added to the growth medium, elicits a profound suppression of the seedling growth arrest phenotype.  In this project, a wide range of nutritive ions were investigated. We demonstrated that the anion (Cl-) was not important for suppression, but both monovalent (K+) and divalent (e.g. Mg++) ions suppressed the shoot arrest phenotype in bps1 homozygous mutants when present at modest concentrations (e.g. 50 mM).  We also demonstrated that simply changing the osmotic conditions through addition of mannitol or PEG did not suppress the shoot phenotype, which further supports a role for cations in restoration of WUS expression and growth. To understand how dalekin might impact the seedling ionome, we compared the ionomes of bps1 and wild-type seedlings. This study revealed that many nutritive ions were at low levels in bps1 mutants, and that supplementation led to increases of a suite of ions.  We further demonstrated that cations affect response to dalekin, not dakekin synthesis, by analyzing dalekin levels in KCl-grown bps1 seedling (bioassay).  Finally, we characterized bps1 mutants that were also mutant for one or two ion transporters.  We found that several different classes of ion transporters, when mutant, led to modest increases in leaf size.  Taken together these experiments revealed that the response pathway involves misregulation of many different ion transporters and diminished nutrient uptake.  Second, we carried out a molecular characterization of a bps1 suppressor that was revealed after crossing bps1 to a set of Arabidopsis accessions.  The strongest suppressor identified was found in the APOST1 accession.  Bulk segregant analysis was used to identify a small interval on chromosome 2 that contained the suppressor, and then cloning and testing individual candidate genes by transforming them into bps1 mutants.  One of the likely suppressor genes was shown to provide the same level of suppression as seen with the original APOST1 suppressor in transgenic bps1 mutants. However, the identity of this suppressor did not provide insight into regulation of WUS expression or shoot growth.  The third approach came from a transcriptome analysis that identified genes that were up-regulated in wild-type shoots responding to dalekin. These up-regulated genes were tested genetically; phenotypes of double mutants combining bps1 and T-DNA mutants were characterized.  None of the double mutants showed restored shoot growth, and so no single up-regulated gene explained dalekin-induced shoot arrest.  However, a pair of up-regulated genes that encode nearly identical proteins are attractive candidates. Their adjacent positions in the genome complicates standard genetic approaches, so we used CRISPR to successfully generate large deletions that removed most of both genes.  The roles of these two genes in shoot growth repression will be known when the triple mutants are examined.
