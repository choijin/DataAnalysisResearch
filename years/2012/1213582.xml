<AbstractNarration>In this award, funded by the Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program of the Division of Chemistry, Professor Andrew C. Hillier of Iowa State University and his graduate student researchers will be supported to develop new methods for spectroscopic detection of analytes using periodic (diffractive) nanostructures.  The research will use metal-coated periodic nanostructures' plasmon properties to enhance the detection of molecular adsorbates.  The Hillier group will also work on developing, theoretical models to better understand the spectroscopic enhancements seen with these nanostructures.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Surface plasmon-enhanced spectroscopy is analytical method that provides improved sensitivity over other detection methods.  The work of Professor Hillier and his student colleagues is aimed at providing scientists with improved detectors for chemical species.  This research is important in that it may lead to methods that can detect chemical species at lower concentration, which could be important in diverse technological areas including semiconductor processing, chemical agent detection, etc. Besides the broader scientific impact of this research, the students participating in this project will be exposed to cutting-edge research in analytical chemistry..</AbstractNarration>
