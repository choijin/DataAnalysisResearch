<AbstractNarration>A symposium will be held at the Cornell University campus May 14-15, 2012.  The focus of the meeting covers a range of topics in current hydrologic sciences (Turbulence in ABL, atmospheric radiation, evaporation, erosion, open channels, instability and fluid mechanics; infiltration, Boussinesq and runoff relationships, and hysteresis and thermodynamics) suggested by two leaders in the field , Wilfried Brutsaert and Yves Parlange.  The symposium will include 30 students as well as videotaping of presentations and planning for a special issue of Water Resources Research.  The gathering of individuals around these research themes represents a solid research contribution to advance the state of the field.</AbstractNarration>
