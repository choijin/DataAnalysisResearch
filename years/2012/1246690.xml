<AbstractNarration>The goal of this project is to provide a unique opportunity for students to present their research results, learn cutting edge research, and interact with internationally recognized researchers from both academia and industry at the ACM SIGMOD/PODS 2013 Conference. As one of the most prestigious conferences in data management research, ACM SIGMOD/PODS has contributed significantly to the advance of all aspects of data management technologies and applications since 1975. Today ACM SIGMOD/PODS is a dynamic and comprehensive program for publication, education, and interaction; and it is a leading international forum for database researchers, practitioners, developers, and users to explore cutting-edge ideas and results and to exchange techniques, tools, and experiences. This project provides partial support for students matriculated at U.S. institutions, especially female and minority students, to attend and present their research work at ACM SIGMOD/PODS 2013 in New York City. Besides meeting with researchers from academia and industry during regular program sessions, in SIGMOD/PODS 2013 students are able to participate in the following interactive activities as partially supported by this project: a new researcher symposium, an undergraduate research poster competition, face-to-face meetings with leading researchers, and a student mentoring workshop. These opportunities will have a long lasting impact on the future career of the participants. The broader impact is to train the future generation of leaders and workforce in the critical field of data management. The project details are available via the website http://www.sigmod.org/2013/.</AbstractNarration>

The SIGMOD conference program included 2 keynote talks, 76 research papers selected from 372 submissions, 6 tutorials, 43 demonstrations, and 15 industrial presentations.  The PODS program included 24 papers selected from 97 submissions.  11 workshops were co-located with the conference, and took place immediately preceding the main conference.  Student attendance at SIGMOD/PODS has always been a priority for ACM and NSF.  Students represent the future of the field, and making sure that promising students can attend the conference is important for recruiting and retaining the best students in the field.  This grant helped reimburse 32 students from US institutions for their travel and accommodation costs to and from the conference.  Registration fees for the conference itself were waived for award recipients.  Students who attended the conference were able to present their own research, as well as learning about the latest advances in the field.
