<AbstractNarration>Stream confluences, the joining of two streams, represent both unique habitat patches and critical movement corridors within a riverscape.  Although the hydraulic and thermal nature of a particular confluence influences the ability or likelihood of biota to travel through it, confluences generally have been ignored in restoration efforts because they are hydraulically and geomorphologically complex and dynamic systems.  The doctoral dissertation research project will seek to advance basic understanding of the thermal, geomorphological, and hydraulic conditions present at stream confluences with the intention of informing conservation, management and restoration of these uniquely important river features. The doctoral student will explore answers to the question:  How do tributary confluence dynamics influence thermal habitat patterns in the main channel?  The student will employ cutting-edge distributed temperature sensing fiber optic arrays coupled with acoustic Doppler current profilers in a paired confluence sampling design.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will contribute to basic understanding of the processes through which channel morphology influences hydraulic and thermal habitat variability at confluences under different hydrologic conditions.  It will integrate hydraulic, geomorphic, and thermal observations at stream confluences to form a holistic understanding of the complex interactions the influence thermal habitat dynamics in confluences. The knowledge generated will transform basic understanding of stream confluences by: investigating small confluences (small tributaries joining a large river), confluences on a Great Plains sand-bedded river, and thermal mixing patterns and associated thermal refuge habitat dynamics within both small and large confluences.  The project will provide policy makers and public stakeholders with the greater knowledge that will facilitate scientifically based, cooperative decisions regarding confluence restoration.  As a Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement award, this award also will provide support to enable a promising student to establish a strong independent research career.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement grant was used to characterize the hydrology of intermittent prairie headwater streams of the Konza Prairie Biological Station (Konza) located in Northeastern Kansas, USA.   Our findings help us understand how these types of streams, common in the Great Plains and used extensively for water supply, alternate from flowing to dry conditions in relation to weather and climate patterns.  We found that headwater stream flow is very challenging to predict in this dynamic climate region of the USA.  The timing of stream flow was not strongly related to recent precipitation within a watershed.  Furthermore, immediately adjacent streams were often out of synch in term of the timing of their flows. Results of this study suggest that local watershed-scale processes, such as groundwater storage, dynamic infiltration flow paths, and soil moisture conditions produce a threshold-driven hydrologic response, decoupling the headwater hydrologic regimes from sub-annual weather patterns. Our published results represent some of the only peer-reviewed rigorous analyses of prairie headwater stream hydrology.  These findings should serve as a base reference for the discipline of hydrology within the semi-arid Great Plains of the North America.  Our work can help water resources agencies and private landowners better understand the climate variables controlling the timing and duration of freshwater flows in a chronically water-stressed region.  The grant funds directly supported the professional development of a female doctoral student via participation in a workshop run by The Center for Transformative Environmental Monitoring Programs (CTEMPs) and her experiences gained from working with a large, long term hydrologic regime dataset.
