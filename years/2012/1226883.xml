<AbstractNarration>This proposal addresses the hardware, control and planning technologies required to achieve soft robotic systems, in order to offer inherent safety and adaptation to the human-machine systems of the future. The project is motivated by a broad range of aspects of human-robot interaction, including soft augmentation tools for safe compliant manipulation, soft exoskeletons for rehabilitation of neuromuscular disorders, or active clamping systems that can conform to arbitrary surfaces. The proposed research will address the algorithmic and device-level challenges that arise in the design of soft compliant robots capable of pose-invariant and shape-invariant grasping. A combination of algorithmic solutions to modeling, control, planning, and adaptation will lead to new soft compliant manipulators that do not need accurate geometric models for grasping. By designing soft compliant fingers and hands, new approaches to grasp planning and manipulation will be enabled. A novel composable actuation system and supporting planning and control algorithms with features inspired by natural muscle will be developed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: Soft robots are inherently low-cost. Affordable soft manipulators will enable in-home assistants for the elderly or incapacitated, but these robots must be able to manipulate the natural world as easily as people do. The next generation robot manipulators will also support new levels of factory automation, in which robots will work synergistically with humans with the ultimate goal of reducing the cost of manufacturing in the USA. The proposed soft devices will provide a new approach to assistive and rehabilitative usage of compliant robotic platforms. Their functional compliant properties will enable them to work side-by-side with human beings or as part of their bodies, to augment and improve human productivity and performance. This new wearable soft robotic technology will not only help workers perform tasks, but also improve the quality of life for many people. In addition, the PIs have a long tradition of integrating research and education by providing research training at all levels, from high-school teachers and students to undergraduate and graduate students, and postdocs. A range of activities to reach out to undergraduate students, high-school communities, women and minorities is planned.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>By 2020 the number of industrial robots is projected to be around 31 million. The industrial robots are masterpieces of engineering that can do so much more than people do. Yet these robots remain isolated from humans on the factory floors because they are large heavy and dangerous to be around. By comparison organisms in nature are soft safe compliant and much more dexterous and intelligent. Soft bodied systems like the octopus can move with greater agility, they can bend and twist continuously and compliantly and have the potential to execute tasks that require dexterity and strength. This project explored new types of robots, with the objective of bringing machines and materials closer together ? with machines becoming soft, like materials, and materials becoming intelligent and capable like machines. Soft refers to the body of the robot. Soft materials are the key enablers for creating soft robot bodies. Young?s Modulus which measures stress to strain&nbsp; is a useful measure of the rigidity of materials used in the fabrication of robotic systems. Materials traditionally used in robotics (e.g. metals, hard plastics), have moduli on the order of 10<sup>9</sup>?10<sup>12</sup> Pa, whereas natural organisms are often composed of materials (e.g. skin, muscle tissue) with moduli on the order of 10<sup>4</sup>?10<sup>9</sup> Pa (i.e. orders of magnitude lower than their engineered counterparts).
