<AbstractNarration>Objective:   &lt;br/&gt;          &lt;br/&gt;The objective of this program is to develop a comprehensive set of communication tools for the  design and implementation of a very dense sensor network within a building infrastructure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit:   &lt;br/&gt; The intellectual merit is to lay the foundations for the design of lightweight communication protocols to robustly collect data from a heterogeneous sensor network with both regular and event-driven traffic patterns. We will use diverse techniques from communication theory, sensor design methodologies, distributed algorithms and engineering implementation guidelines in our study. The end result will be design guidelines, distributed algorithms and a practical implementation in the context of the Y2E2 building (at Stanford) and &lt;br/&gt;the upcoming new zero-energy ECE building (at UIUC). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts:       &lt;br/&gt;The broader impact is via the development and distribution of a prototype sensor network platform that will enable energy efficient building and also be useful in  effective traffic monitoring and real-time monitoring of structural health for infrastructures.</AbstractNarration>
