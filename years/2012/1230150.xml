<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will enable a completely new approach to biology. The fundamental unit of biology is the single cell, and each cell contains complex genetic machinery. Many fundamental questions could be answered if biologists could perform genetic analysis on large numbers of single cells derived from tissues. The vast majority of useful applications would require detection of multiple genetic loci in single cells. For example, immunologists would like to measure co-expression of multiple T cell receptors and inflammatory molecules in hundreds of thousands of single T cells circulating in human blood. Currently, biology lacks elegant tools to perform this type of analysis. The current project aims to solve this problem with an innovative approach for analysis multiple genetic loci in hundreds of thousands of single cells analyzed in parallel. The technology uses a device to isolate single cells into aqueous-in-oil picoliter microdroplets, amplifies and links two or more genetic loci by intermolecular hybridization, and then sequences linked loci in reversed emulsions by next-generation sequencing. This enables far more complicated biological analysis than is possible if analyzing only a single locus in a single cell, or a single locus across many single cells.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project includes commercial applications in genetics and immunology research as well as molecular diagnostics and pharmaceutical development. Immunology researchers worldwide are eager to understand T cell and B cell immune repertoires. Immune repertoires respond to factors such as infectious disease, age, and obesity, so immune repertoire profiling is of great interest worldwide. The innovation of this proposed research is to link subunits of antibody genes to reveal a more complete immune repertoire profile. A similar method could be used to link subunits of T cell receptor genes. The platform will also enable unique and innovative approaches to a number of currently intractable problems in molecular diagnostics, including noninvasive monitoring of immunotherapy, noninvasive monitoring of autoimmune disease, and inflammatory response to allograft procedures. Finally, T cells and antibodies are increasingly used as therapy for disease, and immune repertoire profiling technology will be critical to the development of such therapies. In summary, the technology developed in this project will be marketed to research immunologists, leading to fundamental improvements in our understanding of immunology. Eventually, the technology could be extended to the fields of molecular diagnostics and immune therapy, which could help cure intractable diseases.</AbstractNarration>

However, immune systems are very complex, and in the past it has been difficult for scientists to characterize immune dysregulation. In our NSF project, we invented a new technology that allows scientists to characterize immune dysregulation by analyzing millions of immune cells in parallel. Our technology uses new methods for microfluidics, a discipline that involves manipulation of picoliter quantities of liquid. We use microfluidics to encapsulate single immune cells, lyse them, and then capture RNA transcripts that encode antibody molecules. We then make large libraries, or mixtures, of antibody molecules based on the blueprint provided by the RNA transcripts. Our throughput is millions of cells per hour, whereas prior technologies only achieved hundreds of cells per hour. Once we have large libraries of millions of antibodies, our scientists can then screen for antibodies that help characterize or treat disease. Our project involved a partnership with the Novartis Institutes for Biological Research, and we published two research studies in a peer-reviewed journal. We are now using our technology to help better understand immune dysregulation in diseases such as cancer, autoimmunity, and immune deficiency.
