<AbstractNarration>The information age has made it trivial for anyone to create and then share vast amounts of digital data.  This includes unstructured collections made of data such as images, video, and audio to collections of born digital content made up of data such as documents and spreadsheets.  While the creation and sharing of content has been made easy, its inverse, the ability to search and use the contents of digital data, has been made exponentially more difficult.  In the physical analogue librarians have used the process of curation to standardize the format by which information is stored and diligently index holdings with metadata to allow both current and future generations to find information.  Digitally this does not happen as that curation overhead is an unwelcomed bottleneck to the creation of more data.  Though popular services such as modern search engines give the illusion that this is being done, this is largely over the portion of digital data that is text based and/or containing text metadata.  Unstructured collections and contents trapped behind difficult to read file formats, however, make up a significant part of our collective digital data assets and are largely not accessible. &lt;br/&gt;Science today not only uses but relies on software and digital content.  It is well known that science is not only responsible for a significant amount of our digital data holdings but that also much of this is un-curated data, what the scientific community currently refer to as "long-tail" data.  As such contemporary science, which relies on digital data and software, software which evolves and disappears quickly as underlying technology changes, is entering a realm where scientific results are no-longer easily reproducible and as such in essence no longer a science as science hinges on the fact that a documented procedure will result in the same result each time.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  DIBBs Brown Dog prototyped a Data Transformation Service (DTS), an extensible, scalable, and interoperable software component of the envisioned research cyberinfrastructure ecosystem, supporting the emerging data wrangling needs being encountered in the scientific community.  As scientific research has become more dependent on data and analytics there has been a growing need for tools that can broadly support data transformations in the form of format conversions as well as metadata extraction towards facilitating data discovery over dataset collections.  Serving as a mechanism by which to share and provision tools for such transformations the DTS allows scientific applications to offload the need to implement, and re-implement, these transformation capabilities.  Towards supporting a broad range of scientific domains Brown Dog has further developed a host of interfaces on top of its native API such as low barrier web tools, native OS tools, software plugins, a catalog / set of libraries to facilitate the sharing of new transformation tools, and capabilities supporting large datasets where proximity of computation to the data is needed. The Brown Dog effort has engaged a broad range of scientific, education, and industry endeavors in support of their data wrangling needs.  Within biology, Brown Dog has supported the data/model conversions needed by the ecological forecasting community as part of the PEcAn effort.  Additionally, we have worked to support phenomics through the TERRA-REF effort facilitating the sharing and analysis of unstructured crop sensor data.  Within geoscience the effort supports the data needs of the IML-CZO and engages the broader critical zone community, studying the near surface environment where life occurs, towards providing tools to facilitate in the navigation of the communities very heterogeneous data towards allowing scientists to ask questions of the entire body of data.  Within engineering/resilience Brown Dog supports research needs at the University of Illinois and Southern Methodist University providing tools and clients to support a broad range of users and data needs in this area.  For example at SMU the civil engineering/informatics curricula leverages the Clowder framework, which provides the metadata capabilities of Brown Dog, to facilitate interactions with real data within classroom settings.  Within materials science Brown Dog works closely with efforts like DIBBs T2C2 and NIST to support the organization, sharing, and reuse of lab data, data possessing large amounts of descriptive metadata, data that is often lost.  Other activities, and emerging activities, span the archival community and NARA, medicine, library science, the Hathi Trust, supporting the National Parks, paleoclimatology, agriculture, social science, and international collaborations with the European Union in support of cultural heritage data and the humanities.  Finally, within industry we continue to work with partners to leverage these new technologies while simultaneously hardening and adding new capabilities to these tools for broader production uses which the scientific community can then leverage towards new discoveries.     The Brown Dog prototype DTS has carried out over 129 million data transformations over a petabyte of data, producing 46 publications across its supported scientific endeavors as well as its data infrastructure developments, supporting 13 graduate students, and building activity within the areas of ecological forecasting, earthcasting, urban informatics, and applied artificial intelligence.  Brown Dog continues to support the various communities described as well as working with new communities with data wrangling needs across a number of projects and activities.  With the friendly user interface of Clowder, and the powerful tools that it gives access to through that interface, we see a growing community of users with need and interest in terms of leveraging these capabilities.  Going forward we will continue to bring together these communities, aiming to establish a robust open source community around its development and governance.
