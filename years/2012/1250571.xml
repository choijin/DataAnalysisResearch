<AbstractNarration>The conference, Indigenous Worldviews in Informal Science Education, is designed to advance research on the integration of Native and Western science in relation to informal science learning.  The goals of the conference are to integrate and synthesize research and theory, formulate a research agenda, and share the results with the STEM education community. The conference is organized around six strands:  Collaboration, Policy, Holistic Education, Next Generation Youth, and Evaluation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A six-week preconference online discussion of conference issues leads into the two-day conference, held at Imiloa Astronomy Center in Hilo, Hawaii.  The meeting brings together sixty participants including educators, research scientists, learning researchers, policymakers, and Native youth. The conference includes keynotes, workshops and synthesis discussion groups, which will be synthesized and presented at a policy outcome meeting held in Washington, DC that follows the conference.  Conference results will be further disseminated at relevant conferences, in publications, and through online discussions.  A full evaluation process will inform the detailed planning of the conference and will evaluate the effectiveness of the conference, based on responses from conference participants.</AbstractNarration>

The IWISE project was highly successful in bringing together a diverse and thoughtful group of professionals, elders, traditional knowledge holders, and Native youth in order to identify existing work and themes around Indigenous worldviews in informal STEM;  Participants highly appreciated the quality of the keynote speakers, panelists, special guests, and participants and felt this contributed to setting the stage for learning and bringing out key ideas and examples of this work; Many key themes emerged within and across the five conference strands (Collaboration with Integrity, Environmental Sustain-ability, Evaluation, Holistic Education, and Next Generation Youth). These themes comprise a key deliverable of IWISE in terms of its intellectual legacy, and are outlined below: There is a need for emphasizing holistic perspectives on learning, in which informal environments are just one part; Reciprocal and balanced approaches to "intersections" of Indigenous worldviews and STEM are essential, so that all perspectives are honored (that is, it?s not just about Indigenous knowledge enriching western science, but STEM efforts must also support or be compatible with Indigenous core values); Ensuring that Native communities are primarily benefiting from STEM practice and research that collaboratively involves them is a core principle of reciprocal work that occurs within the context of collaboration with integrity; Focusing on intergenerational learning that includes and honors the wisdom of elders, and supports the growth and leadership of Native youth, is another key aspect of collaboration with integrity, and challenges the power relationships inherent in the current system of conducting western science; STEM learning needs to start from a holistic "Science of Place," based on the land, place, culture, community, and core values; this principle is mirrored by calls for STEM teaching based in learner significance that form the conceptual foundation of education reforms in K-12 science education. Language and frameworks need to be reconsidered at all levels from a cultural perspective; for example, from Indigenous perspectives, the term "informal" can inadvertently convey that the knowledge shared in these environments is peripheral and of less value or importance.  Similar considerations have been raised by museum learning scholars who suggested the term "free-choice learning" to counter the notion of inferiority in the term "informal". The need to continue supporting and nurturing this community, such as through regular webinars, face-to-face meetings, and a standing annual conference. Another key recommendation was around expanding the community.             Last Modified: 04/25/2018       Submitted by: Leslie K Kimura]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
