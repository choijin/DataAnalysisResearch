<AbstractNarration>Private and widely dispersed information across individuals is pervasive aspect of economic environments. In financial markets, traders possess different information about the value of an asset; in labor markets, employees and employers have different information about the cost of a job. In the interaction of the individual agents, the nature of the private information held by the individuals influences the outcome of the entire economy. In particular, the structure of the interaction - the form of the network - determines the aggregate outcome. Yet from the point of view of an observer, be it as an analyst or a regulator or a legislator, the precise nature of the private information and network structure of the agents is rarely known.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The current research develops a method to analyze the behavior and the welfare in an economic environment, online as well as offline, independent of the structure of the private information and network structure of the agents. Concurrently, the investigators will analyze the extent to which the structure of the economic environments (payoffs, preferences) can be identified from the empirical data without knowledge of the exact information and network structure. The methods have epistemic and computational advantages over earlier approaches. The investigators will identify bounds on the statistical moments of the equilibrium distribution. Conversely, the statistical description of the equilibrium outcome allows the investigators to give precise bounds on how much can be learned from the data when the nature of the private information is unknown.&lt;br/&gt;   &lt;br/&gt;This new approach to networks with private information offers techniques to analyze the welfare implications of economic rules and institutions by providing bounds that are independent of the knowledge of the information and network structure. The method allows the investigators to assess the implications of different policies and regulations regarding information disclosure, trading restrictions, and reserve requirements that are independent of the specific information held by the economic agents.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Interaction, Information and Identification  Economic analysis of strategic environments and institutions relies on assumptions about participantsÃ† information and about how participants interact.  This project has developed new tools for analysis of how information and interaction structure matter.  These tools allow statistical identification of economic parameters of interest.   These new tools have been used to develop new substantive findings of interest.  Economists have long been interested in price discrimination, i.e., what happens if a monopoly seller can choose different prices to different consumers.  Such price discrimination must weakly increase the profits of sellers but in general has ambiguous effects on consumer welfare.  In work developed under this project, the limits of price discrimination have been identified, showing that price discrimination can sometimes allow efficient outcomes and allow consumers to gain 100% of the benefits from shifting to an efficient outcome.  We also study the impact of information on volatility in the economy.  We show that small idiosyncratic shocks to productivity, which do not have an impact on aggregate productivity, can lead to high volatility in output.  We also identify bounds on how much aggregate volatility and identify the information structures that give rise to the highest volatility.  Volatility is maximized when participants observe information that conflates idiosyncratic and aggregate shocks.
