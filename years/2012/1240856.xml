<AbstractNarration>The Rochester Institute of Technology, in collaboration with TERC, proposes the Inclusive Exploring Computer Science (I-ECS) curriculum as a set of curricular and tool-based enhancements for visually impaired high school students.  I-ECS will be conducted via face-to-face and online support for cohorts of visually impaired high school students.  While innovations have resulted in assistive technology for people with disabilities, gaps remain in the level of participation in university-level computing degree programs by the visually impaired.  A significant factor is the lack of precollege preparation in courses that promote success in computing degrees.  Isolation, the lack of role models and access to resources contribute as well. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project strives to increase the participation of students with visual impairments through better preparation and support.  The overall goals are to increase access to an established curriculum (Exploring Computer Science) and success within the area of computing for students with visual impairments at the high school level.  The development of programming tools and online modules will provide access where gaps exist in current software.  The project team will assess the degree to which original Exploring Computer Science (ECS) can be made accessible to high school students who are visually impaired.  The comparison in student achievement and attitudes about Computer Science will also be conducted between students using the ECS curriculum and those using the I-ECS curriculum in order to evaluate the similarity of the two curricula.  By design, the I-ECS project intends to increase participation in computing by individuals with visual impairments at all socioeconomic levels via student and educator support.  The project will involve students, parents and educators from around the nation.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The structured approach, building on the foundation of an existing high school computer science curriculum, will enable those with visual impairments to have greater access to the diverse areas of computer science through face-to-face and online resources that foster continuous learning and community, as the means to transition to college degrees in computing.  The project components are designed to promote growth by all participants, including parents.  The online community will foster greater accommodation of visually impaired students in the computer science classroom.  Assessment will provide much needed statistical analysis of both the challenges and successes of students who are visually impaired.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Inclusive Exploring Computer Science (I-ECS) project, led by the University of North Texas, in collaboration with TERC, developed curricular and tool-based enhancements for visually impaired students to learn computer science.  The overall goal was to increase access to the popular Exploring Computer Science curriculum, enabling students who are blind or have low vision to fully participate in the activities of five ECS units: Human-Computer Interaction, Problem Solving, Web Development, Data Analysis, and Robotics.  Three cohorts of middle and high school students participated in a two-week I-ECS Summer Academy, and some continued with online support and instruction.  The I-ECS project added to, replaced, and/or modified activities that relied on sight, by creating physical, tactile, auditory, and technological enhancements designed to eliminate barriers and increase student engagement and learning. For example, in the Problem Solving unit, several activities were modified by the inclusion of tactile graphs, models, and maps. In some cases, the project developed new technologies to enable access&mdash;the Data Analysis unit was enhanced by the creation of a web-based data sonification tool.  To increase access to the Robotics unit, software was designed so both sighted and visually impaired students could program LEGO Mindstorms robots using a text-based language that works with assistive technology.  Intellectual Merit  Usability results indicated that I-ECS enhancements enable students with visual impairments to employ multiple learning modalities&mdash;tactile, kinesthetic, and auditory&mdash;to access key activities in each unit that originally required sight. In addition, careful integration of assistive techniques and technologies, such as Braille and screen readers, and new technologies can further reduce curricular barriers. Lastly, we confirmed that enhancements could be designed to support students? understanding of both top-down processes (moving from big picture to detailed work) and bottom-up processes (learning how individual components cohere into a final product). This was particularly necessary when building and programming robots.  While enhancements improved student access and increased participation, not all of them made the pathway to learning easier. In order to create visual access, some enhancements placed new demands on students.  For instance, tactile approaches for learning about binary code and data sorting, taxed memory, and the robotics programming language required development of new skills.  Thus, in some cases, additional supports must accompany enhancements for them to be fully usable and effective.  Overall, both students who had low vision and those who were blind reported feeling engaged and confident while working on human-computer interaction and problem-solving activities, as well as more specific and complex data analysis, web design, and robotics building and programming tasks.  Furthermore, enhanced activities helped expose students to computer science information and concepts and to develop new skills, particularly related to building and programming robots.  Broader Impact  Our work will impact the ECS curriculum community by providing resources and accessible tools for students with visual impairments and their teachers.  More broadly, it will impact the Computer Science education community by offering resources that serve as models for designing and implementing curricular accommodations for students with disabilities.  Since many public school educators do not work with students with visual impairments, and many teachers of the visual impaired have little knowledge of Computer Science, I-ECS resources will enable both populations to support and encourage visually impaired students to explore computer science and other STEM subjects, as well as consider STEM careers. Project outcomes advocate for visually impaired students becoming equal members in their classrooms and school communities, and, ultimately, of a scientifically literate citizenry.
