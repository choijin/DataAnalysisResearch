<AbstractNarration>The primary research objective of this proposal is to improve the temporal resolution of atomic force microscopy (AFM) through non-raster sampling schemes based on compressed sensing (CS). While AFM continues to be used heavily for the study of systems with nanometer-scale features, its temporal resolution limits its applicability to the study of dynamics. The research approach progresses from non-raster sampling of a single image, including robust time-optimal control techniques to move the tip of the microscope as rapidly as possible between measurement locations, to CS driven schemes for acquisition of image sequences. The methods developed will be implemented and tested on AFMs to demonstrate their capabilities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the results of this research will extend the utility of AFMs by increasing the imaging rate while also decreasing the interaction with the sample, limiting any damage caused by the imaging process. While focused on AFMs, the techniques to be developed will be directly applicable to other scanning probe methodologies, such as scanning tunneling microscopy and near-field scanning optical microscopy, as well as more broadly to scenarios in which a short-range sensor is acquiring information in a large area. Examples of such scenarios include environmental monitoring by autonomous robots, large-scale data collection in ocean environments, and weather sampling. Further, the robust time-optimal control results will be broadly applicable in industries that include disk drives, tape drives, wafer scanning systems, electronic manufacturing, and more. Graduate and undergraduate students will benefit through participation in the research while outreach activities will engage middle and high school students in the Boston metro area, with a focus on students from low-income families, and in the Boulder metro area, with a focus on female students.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

This was a collaborative project with a team at Boston University (BU), with PI Sean Andersson, and a team at the University of Colorado Boulder (CU Boulder), with PI Lucy Pao.</p> <p>The Atomic Force Microscope (AFM) is one of the most versatile methods of imaging nanoscale structures.

While there are a variety of imaging modes, the fundamental effect is that as the probe is brought to the sample, the inter-molecular forces between the probe and sample cause the probe to deflect. A controller is then wrapped around that deflection signal to maintain a constant level. The control output is then a measure of the sample topology. The AFM tip is typically raster-scanned back and forth across the sample in order to produce an image of the sample.</p> <p>Although the AFM has excellent spatial resolution, one key drawback is that the imaging process is slow&mdash;often on the order of minutes per image for commercially available instruments. This has led to a large research effort to increase the speed of AFMs. Most efforts focus on methods to increase the overall speed of the system.

Existing non-raster scanning patterns such as spirals can also be applied for sub-sampling of images and have been demonstrated experimentally to produce faster imaging while still producing accurate reconstructions. However, from the theory of compressive sensing, it is known that randomized sampling is critical to producing accurate reconstructions for a broad class of samples. Thus, ideally, one would acquire a random collection of the pixels. However, doing so requires the AFM probe tip to be repeatedly lifted and re-engaged with the sample, and each such engagement takes a significant amount of time. Inspired by this, the BU team introduced the notion of &mu;&minus;paths, where randomly placed short scans are combined with compressive-sensing based image reconstruction algorithms to produce the final image.&nbsp; The &mu;&minus;path approach balances randomness with continuous scanning.

Working with the CU Boulder team, we have provided a hardware demonstration of using the &mu;&minus;path scanning approach on the AFMs in our laboratories. Compared to conventional raster scanning, our experimental results show that using &mu;&minus;paths can lead to improvements of up to approximately a five times reduction in scanning time while yielding comparable image quality.
