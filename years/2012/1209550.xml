<AbstractNarration>This action funds Michael Yoshitaka Erlewine of Massachusetts Institute of Technology to conduct a research project, entitled "Investigating focus sentences in the endangered Atayal language of Taiwan," during the summer of 2012 at Academia Sinica in Taipei, Taiwan.  The host scientist is Professor Henry Chang.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Intellectual Merit of the research project is to investigate focus constructions in the endangered Austronesian language of Atayal. "Focus" refers to sentences like "I only like chicken... not beef" where the additional emphasis on "chicken" produces a very different meaning than the similar "I only like chicken... not love." The careful study of these sentences illuminates how focus works across different languages, as well as describing Atayal language's different structural strategies for expressing meaning, that is, its syntax-semantics mapping.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.  These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.</AbstractNarration>

Linguists study the diversity of human languages, as well as what they have in common. Doing so can further our understanding of the human capacity for language and therefore of humanity itself. This requires comparing and contrasting properties of geographically and genetically very different languages. To this end, the documentation and analysis of understudied and endangered languages is critical.  In this project, I conducted fieldwork on Atayal, an endangered and understudied language of Taiwan in the Austronesian language family. Through structured interviews with native speakers of the language, I documented and analyzed structural patterns in the sentences of the language.  This work led to an original discovery on the notion of "subjecthood" in Atayal. In this language, as in many other Austronesian languages, the grammatical "subject" of a sentence can be diagnosed through a variety of properties: (a) the subject triggers a marking on the verb; (b) only subjects can be questioned using question words such as "who" and "what"; (c) subjects have a special marking, which is qu in Atayal. While all of these "subjecthood" properties normally pick out a single subject per clause, in this variety of Atayal I discovered that, in certain situations, properties (a) and (b) will identify one argument, while qu will mark another argument (property (c)).  Various researchers have proposed explanations for these different "subjecthood" properties in Austronesian languages (often appealing to grammatical Case or a topic-like position). This discovery in Atayal shows us that "subjecthood" properties (a) and (b) must be somehow separated from property (c). This has important consequences for the notion of "subject" cross-linguistically and in particular for the study of Austronesian languages.  Like many other endangered languages, it is unclear how long Atayal will continue to be spoken. When a language dies, an important body of data about the diversity of human language disappears, and it also often has devastating consequences for its people and culture. This project was able to contribute to the better documentation and understanding of this unique language, an important data point of human language variation.
