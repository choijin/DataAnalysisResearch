<AbstractNarration>In this project funded by the Chemical Synthesis program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Brian C. Goess of the Department of Chemistry at Furman University will develop syntheses of new members of the sesquiterpene furanosteroid family of natural products.  These molecules, which include wortmannin, have attracted significant attention for their ability to inhibit the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinases (PI3K), enzymes known to play a critical role in cell growth and differentiation.  Syntheses of six new members of this family of natural products, none of which have been previously synthesized, will be developed.  Additionally, modifications to the synthesis routes will generate analogs suitable for use in assays to determine the biological activities of these new natural products.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These new natural products are isolated in only minute quantities from their natural sources.  Given their important biological activities and their potential as chemotherapeutics, chemical synthesis of each of these molecules is necessary.  This work will also enable more efficient methods for the preparation of this entire family of molecules, including those that exist but have not yet been isolated from natural sources.  This project could have significant impacts on pharmaceutical industries and general biological studies.  This project will also serve as the training ground for undergraduate chemists, many of which will attend graduate schools in chemistry, where the skills they develop on this project will be extensively utilized.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Many of the most effective drugs used today are derived from natural sources. One challenge to the use of natural medicines is the limited quantity produced by the source organisms.  Since nature rarely produces enough of a medicinally useful natural product for human use, it falls to chemists to make large quantities of these molecules for testing and eventual consumption.  Most chemical syntheses begin with smaller molecules produced in abundance by nature that are bonded together in sequence through chemical reactions to produce the large, structurally more complex drug targets.  Our project involves the synthesis of a family of plant-derived natural product molecules known as steroid furans.  At the outset of this project, not much was known about how to synthesize these molecules and what their biological activity might be. But, their structural similarity to a known molecule that has attracted attention as a potential cancer chemotherapeutic suggested that these molecules would be excellent candidates for chemical synthesis and biological activity evaluation.  Over the past six years and with the help of NSF funding, our team of undergraduate researchers at Furman university has developed a twelve-step synthesis route that allows the production of a large quantity of these complex steroidal furans starting from a very simple molecule, acetone, the main ingredient in nail polish remover.  We are also obtained evidence that this molecule has potential as a cancer chemotherapeutic. We are now working on synthesizing additional members of this family of natural products, and we are collaborating with biologists at our institution with the hope of finding some that have potent biological activity against cancers or other disease targets.    During this project period, ten undergraduate researchers learned the skills necessary to become tomorrow's synthetic chemists in academia, pharmaceutical companies, and in government research labs.  Their talents, many of which will be further honed through graduate studies, will ensure our nation continues to have a range of effective and affordable drugs available to meet the future health care needs of you and your family.
