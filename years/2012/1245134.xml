<AbstractNarration>This project establishes a design-based inquiry approach to teaching advanced laboratory courses that is interdisciplinary in nature, fosters student and instructor collaboration, and incorporates technology into the learning process. Students in three courses, Cell Biology, Advanced Instrumental Analysis, and Introductory Statistics, collaborate on semester-long research projects investigating questions related to air pollution and lung cell toxicity. This is a relevant topic for southwestern Pennsylvania, where pollution exposure has been correlated with an increase in mortality rates. The students use virtual laboratories and online video tutorials to supplement technical skills and enhance science learning and Web 2.0 interactive collaborative technologies to collaborate throughout the semester.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: Project activities are based on research published in the literature about how students best learn science and the process of scientific investigation, and how supplemental technology can positively impact learning. The project builds on prior work by the Principal Investigators and is supported by university-wide commitments.  The primary pedagogical goals are to: 1. Develop, adapt, and refine design-based inquiry approaches to laboratory experiences that use real-world data and student-developed research studies.  2. Incorporate learning technologies, such as interactive virtual labs and video tutorials into the curriculum.  3. Assess the effect of this approach on student understanding of scientific concepts and processes, higher order skills, and attitudes toward science and research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The project directly impacts approximately 150-200 STEM students per year (three-fourths of whom are enrolled in laboratory science courses).  The interdisciplinary framework for teaching scientific investigation can be adapted within other disciplines and at other institutions. Project findings and the curricular framework are being disseminated at Seton Hill through a series of teaching and learning forums, to other STEM faculty through conferences at professional society national meetings and publication in peer-reviewed journals, and freely to the general public via the Seton Hill website. The virtual laboratories and video tutorials are being disseminated broadly through cataloging with the National STEM Distributed Learning (NSDL) services.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is being jointly funded by the Directorate for Biological Sciences and the Directorate for Education and Human Resources, Division of Undergraduate Education as part of their efforts toward support of Vision and Change in Undergraduate Biology Education.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    We developed a model curriculum for interdisciplinary STEM teaching and learning utilizing a collaborative and inquiry-based approach to laboratory science.  The curriculum implementation was led by faculty teaching Cell Biology and Chemistry laboratory courses and Mathematics.  The resources demonstrating our approach, assessments of our project, and access to the free eBooks consisting of virtual laboratory modules and video tutorials are available universally through the Seton Hill University website, www.setonhill.edu/nsfgrantassessment, and through the NSDL (National Science Digital Library).  As demonstrated by the grades of three of the five tasks assessed on performance task quizzes, which were administered at the beginning of each module, the use of technology suggested an increase in critical and analytical thinking skills and student understanding of the process of scientific inquiry.  Throughout the project, a skill rubric -- which included laboratory observation of studentsÆ critical and analytical thinking skills (such as the ability to identify problems, propose solutions, and understanding scientific concepts and processes of science) -- was developed and utilized to investigate the quality of student learning.    To most effectively model active learning and the collaborative nature of science, students worked in interdisciplinary groups throughout the semester.  Students used technology resources integrated into the curriculum to support laboratory learning and collaborate with each other in real time, creating a virtual community. By using Web 2.0 applications, students planned and executed research projects collaboratively with other group members and faculty in real time, resulting in more efficient, interactive, and in-depth teaching and learning experiences.  The differences between pre- and post-Participant Perception Indicator (PPI) survey responses in each question in the categories understanding, skills, attitudes, integration of learning, and meeting learning objectives (relative to the baseline semester) were investigated.  Overall, we noted continually-improving responses in all GPA categories as the semesters progressed.   Our findings indicate that students with lower GPAs demonstrated more substantial improvements from pre-test to post-test in semesters when we utilized Comprehensive Assessment of Team Member Effectiveness (Catme.org) for like-grouping as opposed to self-selection grouping.  As a result of the implementation of this curriculum, faculty pedagogical skills related to the design and assessment of inquiry-based performance tasks have expanded throughout Seton Hill University.  A STEM teaching and learning community has been cultivated to share professional and curricular development efforts, improve laboratory course instruction, and foster a community of student learners (locally through Seton Hill University Teaching and Learning Forums and regionally at the Western Pennsylvania Undergraduate Biology Research Symposium hosted at Seton Hill University). Building on their experience as part of the project, faculty have been involved in recent oral, poster, and panel sessions at national conferences at which the overarching goal was to provide instructional guidelines and examples related to inquiry and problem-based learning with the hopes of broadening student participation in STEM-related research.   Faculty presented new pedagogical approaches (resulting from research gained through this project) on curriculum development to SHU faculty at the Fall 2015 Teaching and Learning Forum.  Furthermore, faculty are in the process of disseminating the curriculum developed as part of this project and findings via peer-reviewed publications.  Students have earned prestigious Summer Undergraduate Research Program (SURP) internships as a result of gaining research experience through this project and have presented their findings at the Western Pennsylvania Undergraduate Biology Research ...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
