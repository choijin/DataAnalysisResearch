<AbstractNarration>The exchange of DNA and genes among bacteria is common and contributes, for example, to the spread of antibiotic resistance between different bacterial pathogens.  In contrast, until recently gene transfer from bacteria to animals (including insects) was believed to be rare and unimportant. The number of complete DNA sequences for insects is rapidly growing and these have revealed that gene transfers between microbes and insects are actually common.  Some of these transfers have become functional insect genes, potentially giving those insects new biochemical capabilities.  The goals of this research are to answer two basic questions: 1) What are the functions of bacterial gene transfers in insects and 2) How do inserted bacterial sequences become active insect genes? To address these questions, the complete DNA sequences from different insects are examined for candidates of bacterial origin. The candidates are then confirmed using molecular approaches, and their functions are examined by knocking out the genes using genetic methods.  Sequences are also examined to evaluate how they have changed to allow for activation of the gene in the insect. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of this project involve science and education, and include implications for pest control.  For example, pesticides designed to act on bacterially acquired insect genes found in a pest will likely have few toxic effects on other species.  The project also has significant education outreach, which includes working with educators at regional community colleges to develop discovery based opportunities for community college students through workshops and research internships.</AbstractNarration>

Also revealed in the study is that microbial sequences are often present in these genome assemblies as "contaminants". They are both a problem and an opportunity. In this project, microbial contaminants were identified for removal to avoid serious errors in genome assemblies. These contaminants also provide important information on bacterial symbionts and the structure of insect microbiomes, for future study and as potential targets for insect control.
