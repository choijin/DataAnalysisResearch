<AbstractNarration>Within the next three decades, climate variability, climate change and global development trends could have varied and profound effects on human well-being, especially in the developing world. Understanding how human and earth system trajectories will interact is essential to making better decisions that can reduce negative consequences for society and ecosystems. Research related to climate impacts has traditionally been separated into a number of poorly coordinated tasks, with independent models and research groups developing a) socio-economic development pathways, b) emissions and land use scenarios, c) land cover projections, d) climate simulations, and e) impact assessments. This disjointed approach has led to inconsistencies in assumptions across different components of the problem, lack of incorporation of feedbacks, unmanaged uncertainty propagation, and introduction of errors when upscaling or downscaling information across components.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To address these issues, better approaches to impact assessment are required that provide richer, higher resolution, and more internally consistent information about future societal and earth system conditions, and that link models of human and earth systems more effectively. The central objective of this proposal is to improve understanding of the joint consequences of socio-economic development and regional climate change by developing and applying tools to better integrate human and earth system models. This objective will be pursued by focusing on impacts in three key systems - urban areas, agriculture, and forests - in three regional case studies in rapidly developing countries - China, India, and Brazil. The project will develop an integrated suite of community tools for linking the most relevant type of global human system model, integrated assessment models (IAMs), with the Community Earth System Model (CESM), developed and validated through broad-based scientific collaboration and community support over the past 15 years. It will employ these tools to link the CESM with one IAM, the integrated Population-Economy-Technology-Science (iPETS) model, and carry out end-to-end impact assessments for our case study regions, from socio-economic scenario development through earth system analysis to impact and adaptation assessment. These assessments will serve as a proof-of-concept for this new modeling framework as well as produce valuable assessment information. Importantly, the research framework will be applicable in other human systems, in other regions, and with other IAMs than those employed here, to contribute to an even broader understanding of the human consequences of climate change.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This overall objective of this project was to improve the modeling of urban climate at the global scale using the Community Land Model-Urban (CLMU). This was done done through four major paths of inquiry:     1)    Model development specifically to improve usability and energy simulation  Together with colleagues at the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) we have helped upgrade the urban model to include: a) expanding model capability to simulate multiple urban density classes within each model grid cell; b) a more sophisticated and realistic building space heating and air conditioning submodel.  Specifically, by allowing the model to simulate multiple urban types in a grid cell we increase the flexibility of the model to assess climate change and urban heat island impacts on different populations (based on who lives in each urban type).      2)    Improved methods for creating and analyzing scenarios using the CLMU  Working with NCAR, we developed a THESIS tool that allows for a much more structured and easy framework for incorporating new information and the creation of a wide variety of scenarios for past, current and future urban characteristics.  We will continue to develop this tool set to be able to facilitate the ability to develop specific SSP based urban scenarios for IPCC projections in the future.  The tool set is publically available at the NCAR web site (https://svn-iam-thesis-release.cgd.ucar.edu/urban_properties/. DOI: 10.5065/D6R78CMT).  Nine simulations have been performed to test various scenarios as sensitivity tests to assess urban trade-offs between reducing emissions strategies and urban heat island impacts.     3)    Determining the potential impact of building characteristics on urban climate  While we have developed significant advances in our models we also assessed the relative impact of wall characteristics on urban climate from observations, with results demonstrating that material properties can make a significant difference in urban heat island impacts. Several case studies were developed to examine the determination of Local Climate Zones (LCZs) their connections to urban heat events for various cities in Brazil as well as Kansas City. In addition, an examination of the impact of spatial configuration of green space as a mitigation tool for urban heat islands was also conducted which resulted in illustrating that the important factor is the total amount of green space present in the urban landscape, not the configuration or size of the patches.     4)    Improved spatial and specific types of urban data on a global scale  As part of developing better information for describing and developing input parameters for the CLMU, we have initially updated the original urban dataset and have collaborated with a number of groups to develop entirely new ways of developing urban spatial extent, urban morphology characteristics and ultimately urban building properties.  Initial work focused on developing urban spatial extent in 9 distinct urban classes through the World Urban Database and Portal Tools project (WUDAPT).      The results from this project are already beginning to have an impact on the broader scientific community. Other groups involved in modeling of the Earth system have begun using the input datasets that have been developed through this project. In addition the WUDAPT methods that we assisted in developing are being used worldwide to examine urban climate issues.
