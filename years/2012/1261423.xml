<AbstractNarration>The metabolic activity of microorganisms dominates the biogeochemical evolution of the Earth over geologic time.  One of the fundamental questions facing scientists seeking to understand global biogeochemistry is: What is the relationship between microbial community composition (who¡¦s there?), metabolic activity (what are they doing?), and ambient environmental conditions (e.g., pH, sulfate levels) (how are they impacted?). Sulfur cycling, particularly the coupling between sulfate reduction and sulfide oxidation, is one of the dominant geochemical pathways driving carbon mineralization within many diverse microbial ecosystems today. Isotopic and mineralogical evidence recovered from ancient rocks suggest biological sulfate reduction played an important role on early Earth as well.  In attempt to better understand this globally important process and the corresponding biosignatures of active sulfur cycling microorganisms, we are proposing a multi-disciplinary, high-resolution geochemical and molecular biological investigation of closely coupled microbial sulfur cycling in three representative microbial ecosystems. These include a 3-4 member synergistic anoxygenic phototrophic consortium, moderately diverse chemosynthetic sulfur-oxidizing mats, and highly complex benthic oxygenic photosynthetic microbial mats. These systems differ in terms of biological complexity and in the major sulfur cycling pathways, that collectively will provide fundamental information regarding light-dependent and -independent sulfur metabolisms.  Our work combines analyses at high spatial (?Ým-scale) resolution of sulfur and carbon isotopic data using secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) and FISH-nanoSIMS, microvoltammetic sulfur species measurements, and CARD-FISH molecular imaging to investigate the linkage among microbial spatial organization, metabolic activity, and establishment of geochemical gradients by coupled sulfur cycling communities. Together, the data from this combined laboratory and field study will develop a new toolset that can be used to study tightly coupled sulfur cycling on an unprecedented scale within microbially dominated sedimentary environments.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will inform scientists about the fundamental chemistry and biology governing sulfur in the environment, past and present.  This is important because sulfur plays a critical role in processes controlling not only how we view the evolution of life on this planet, but also about ore deposits as sources of metal resources, oil and gas formation and their economic recovery, soil nutrient availability affecting crop yields and the quality of water resources, and the transport of many contaminants in ground and surface waters.  Additionally this project will help train the next generation of scientists with the scientific and technical knowledge to work in high tech and scientific industry, research, and education fields.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The coupling of the microbial and chemical spheres of any system can be a critical part of how any natural or engineered system containing microorganisms functions.  We focused on how the element sulfur is cycled in specific natural examples where microbial communities play a critical role in how sulfur molecules can be utilized by microbes for energy (as something it essentially breathes or eats).  We did this to better understand some of the fundamental interaction between life and its surroundings - with the idea advances here will benefit ways we think about the origin and evolution of life on earth, ways to look for it on other planets, ways we can essentially use microorganisms in natural and enginnered systems to produce useful medicines, chemical products, and fuel sources, and ways microbes affect the mobility of contaminants, nutrients, and 'critical' elements for society in earth systems.    Our results from these field settings have taught us that the spatial resolution of the interactions between life and their chemical surroundings can be very small - not surprising as microbes themselves are on average a micron in diameter.  But it also taught us these interactions can change over very fast time scales (seconds), and affect some details of their chemical surroundings which are not expected.  In particular, organisms that also utilie the energy from sunlight can affect their chemical surroundings by injecting significant quantites of hydrogen peroxide into the fluid around them.  This in turn has a significant effect on the forms of sulfur that hydrogen peroxide interacts with.  This observation may be a critical piece of the puzzle of life's evolution on earth, and may be a significant process that will need to be considered in the development of large-scale bioreactors for development of biofuels.    This grant also supported the development and training of the next generation of American scientists thorugh opportunities to be part of a highly cross-disciplinary team and study processes that have to bring together understanding of core geology, chemistry, biology, and physics principles.  We additionally advanced the use of specific electrochemical tools to investigate how these systems change in space and time to understand the fundamental interactions between specific chemical forms and microbial life.
