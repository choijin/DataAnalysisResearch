<AbstractNarration>This funding will establish a new CISE Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site at the University of Maryland-College Park.  This Site focuses on research in combinatorial algorithms, which are algorithms that work on discrete objects such as numbers, graphs, or data where one needs to optimize over a space of possible solutions.  To help create a climate in which students learn new techniques, understand a few real world problems, and work on designing and implementing algorithms, the students will be involved in applied algorithms research projects that will be jointly advised by members of the UMD theory group in conjunction with faculty in different research areas, such as systems, artificial intelligence, and databases.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This REU Site will support eight undergraduate students for ten weeks each year.  The Site will recruit computer science, computer engineering, and mathematics majors, with a focus on students from Historically Black Colleges and Women's colleges.  The Site will help bridge the gap between theory and practice, which will benefit both as it gives theorists new and exciting problems and non-theorists tools they can use.  The students will have the opportunity to see what research is like, obtain a solid grounding in algorithms, and encourage them to go to graduate school.</AbstractNarration>

Some projects involved getting such data andusing it to make conjectures.  There is a marvelous synergy between theory and practice.The projects exploit this synergy. We give a few examples of the research this grant produced.     PASSWORD CRACKING: There has been much theoretical work on both how tocrack passwords and how to prevent them from being cracked.  There wereseveral projects on how to use such work in the real world.  These resultedin a paper (On the Effectiveness of Pre-Processing  Salted Passwords) by Evangelista, Katz, Lowe, Schneider, Taylor, Thiruvengadam,Viterick.  Submitted to Journal of Cryptology) and a set of slidesthat are now used in a cryptography course taught at the University ofMaryland (Using Rainbow Tables to crack passwords by Weinshenker).   KEY DISTRIBUTION: A central authority (e.g., a bank) needs to send outkeys to many people so that various subsets of them, if they get together,can encrypt and decrypt messages, but no other subsets can.  This is easyto do if you allow very long passwords.  The projects involved schemeswhere you can simultaneously use short passwords and good security.  Thiswork resulted in a paper (Symmetric-Key Broadcast Encryption: The Multi-Sender Case by Freitag, Katz, Klein. Submitted to Journal of Cryptology).   BIKE SHARE: Many cities have bike share programs where people can rent abike to get from place A to place B.  This leads to many mathematicsquestions: (1) Where should the bike share centers be to maximize usage?(2) How much to charge to make it simultaneously popular and profitable?(3) What is the best route for trucks to come around and take bikesback from less popular spots to more popular spots?

This work resulted in a conference presentation(Algorithms for Scheduling Data Centers &amp; Assembly Systems, by Murray, Chao,Khuller.  European Symposiusm on Algorithms Aug. 2016).        FORMULATING CONJECTURES IN MATHEMATICS: Ramsey theory is a branch of mathwhere one often proves that a number exists, but the proof gives largebounds (e.g., n is less than 1,000,000,000) We used algorithms to get muchbetter bounds.  These results support the conjecture that that these numbersare much smaller than the bounds given by the proofs.
