<AbstractNarration>Several recent Supreme Court decisions have rendered the federal sentencing guidelines advisory (US v. Booker, Gall v. US, 2007; Kimbrough v. US, 2007), thereby returning discretion to federal judges to impose non-Guidelines sentences. This research project aims to qualitatively examine the ramifications of these cases for case adjudication in federal drug trafficking cases. To date, the research that has examined Booker's impact has primarily relied upon the Sentencing Commission's outcome data; this project will supplement those analyses with systematic, qualitative field research which will demonstrate how local courts have responded to the dramatic policy change brought about by Booker, et al. The project is comprised of case studies set in Federal Defender's offices in four distinct districts that differ from each other in overall size; size of criminal and drug trafficking caseload; demonstrated rate and type of sentence outcome variations; and geographic location. Direct observations, in-depth interviews, and case file data will be used to develop a detailed account of how sentencing is and has been done in each district pre- and post-Booker, particularly in regard to guilty plea negotiations. Portraits of the case processing norms in each district will be developed to supplement what is captured in formal sentence outcome data, and to provide a contextualized picture of contemporary federal sentencing that accounts for how localized institutional processes shape case outcomes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project aims to contribute to theoretical debates about the changing nature of criminal justice administration, and advance understandings of criminal courts as culturally embedded legal organizations as they juggle the competing demands of technical rationality and quests for justice their operation. The research will inform how policy change differentially plays out on the ground, and will provide insights into how policies can most effectively be implemented in the diverse locales that comprise the federal district court system.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  This research project provides a critical analytic link between the well-told, front- end story of the national politics that gave rise to the punitive drug laws that emerged in the 1980s and the well-documented back-end story of its consequences, including its contributory role to mass incarceration, by uncovering how federal drug laws on-the-books come to life in full force. By shifting focus to the adjudication practices responsible for producing federally sentenced drug defendants, this is a study about the realization of legal power: how its possibilities and potentials are understood, and how it is deployed to compel guilty pleas and induce lengthy prison sentences.   The study was conducted in four geographically distinct district courts, in order to be able to compare how the same set of laws gets put into action in divergent ways as a function of local legal norms and structures. In doing so, the study demonstrates how "hammer" of federal drug laws gets made local in ways that often take different forms, but that nonetheless overwhelm the ability of defendants to exercise their procedural rights and that all too often end in unjustifiably long sentences. Data for the study includes field notes of direct observations collected from late 2012 through summer 2014 detailing how cases are adjudicated in each of the four districts; transcripts from 70 in-depth interviews with defense attorneys, former and current federal prosecutors, and district court judges in those districts; case file materials including sentencing memos, plea agreements and sentencing documents from sentenced drug cases in the districts, and the official data specific to the districts from the US MarshallÆs office, the US Attorneys, the courts, and the Sentencing Commission, much of which is available from 1992-2013.   The findings demonstrate how well-entrenched norms and practices within trial-level federal court communities&mdash;as situated in large, complex institutions&mdash;present a formidable barrier to efforts aimed at reducing the racially unequal, punitive reach of this system. Local federal justice system actors, and the organizational units in which they work, are deeply invested in maintaining their legitimacy, stature, and role in the justice system, so they operationally adapt to changing policies in order to stave off diminution. They do so, though, in a manner that corresponds to local norms and logics, therefore maintenance techniques take shape in particularized ways that diverge across districts. As such, policy interventions that aim to roll back the force of these laws will need to account for the heterogeneous forms of resistance that will emerge from front-line institutional actors.   In terms of its intellectual merits, this project provides new insights into institutional life, by scaling down the analytic focus, bringing tools from social psychology and micro-sociology to the question of how and why social institutions&mdash;like trial-level courts and the interconnected offices and agencies that comprise them&mdash; behave as they do.

It also advances our socio-legal understanding of courts as culturally embedded organizations as they struggle with the demands of technical rationality and the less instrumental quests for legitimation and justice their operation.   This project also has broader impacts. Due to significant recent legal changes to federal sentencing, and ongoing efforts by Congress to reform sentencing statutes, this research has the potential to inform how policy change differentially plays out on the ground, and will provide insights into how policies are most effectively implemented in light of the complexities and specificities of the disparate courts that comprise the federal system.
