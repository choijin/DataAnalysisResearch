<AbstractNarration>In this project funded by the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor David Shelton of the University of Nevada Las Vegas will conduct a series of nonlinear laser light scattering experiments to probe the structure of molecular liquids. Contrary to the generally accepted view that intermolecular position and orientation correlations in liquids extend at most a few molecular diameters, second-harmonic light scattering reveals molecular orientation correlation at distances of tens to hundreds of molecular diameters in many liquids. The polarization dependence of second harmonic light scattering provides a uniquely sensitive probe of long-range polar molecular order. This study aims to measure the strength, range and form of the long-range molecular orientation correlations in liquids, and to gain an understanding of the origin and consequences of these correlations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Liquids and systems of nanometer scale are of wide importance and current interest in physics, chemistry and biology. A wide range of basic and applied chemical research will be impacted by the results of this investigation of previously unobserved structure at the nanometer scale in many common liquids including water. Graduate and undergraduate students will participate in this research, and will be trained in state-of-the-art laser light scattering techniques.</AbstractNarration>
