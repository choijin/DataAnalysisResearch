<AbstractNarration>This is a project to continuing testing aspects of the Early Anthropogenic Hypothesis, the conjecture that early agricultural practices by humans altered the terrestrial carbon cycle, causing a net increase in atmospheric CO2 and methane that offset a natural decline during the Holocene (the last 10,000 years).  The hypothesis is based on observations of orbital climate variability.  During previous interglacials atmospheric CO2 and methane began to decline early, leading to cooling and ultimately glacial inception.  The Holocene is an outlier in this regard because the greenhouse gases increase in the atmosphere from the mid-Holocene to preindustrial values in the mid 1700s.  There is great debate about why.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Based on new information that per capita land use has changed, the project will test whether this can account for the rise in greenhouse gases observed during the Holocene.  It will invoke a series of novel general circulation experiments for the last 6000 years, comparing the expected natural changes with those that might have been caused by anthropogenic impacts.  The researchers will use the Coupled Environmental System Model (CESM1) and compare the results with observational data for the Holocene.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Because it is controversial, the Early Anthropogenic Hypothesis has generated much research activity in the field of paleoclimatology, resulting in dedicated symposia, journal volumes, popular books and public lectures.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[       This Project Outcomes Report covers research conducted during 2013-2015 under co-operative NSF research grant GA10938 to the University of Virginia, with a subsequent one-year no-cost extension to My 2016. This grant was linked to funding to the University of Wisconsin.     Our efforts have significantly advanced the awareness of the scientific community about a controversial and provocative hypothesis we first proposed in 2003 &ndash;- the idea that early farming had significant effects on greenhouse-gas emissions and on EarthÃ†s climate well before the start of the industrial era. Progress under the current grant, building on prior research, has come in several areas:     (1) Our research has confirmed that the rising trends in greenhouse-gas (CO2 and CH4) concentrations during the last ~6000 years of the current warm interglacial interval are opposite in direction to those during 7 previous interglaciations that are possible analogues to this one. This finding, based on ice core measurements extending back 800,000 years, provides direct support for the hypothesis that human farming activities intervened during the last several millennia in what had previously been a natural climate system.     (2) Complementary work in related scientific disciplines has provided ground truth evidence that agricultural activities can explain major portions of the greenhouse-gas anomalies detected in ice-core records. In regions such as Europe and China, pollen records and archaeological site remains show that forests began to be cut 8000-6000 years ago, thus emitting anthropogenic CO2 to the atmosphere well before the industrial era. In addition, irrigated rice farming and livestock tending spread across southern and southeast Asia after 5000 years ago, thereby emitting anthropogenic methane to the atmosphere.
