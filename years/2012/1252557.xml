<AbstractNarration>The grant funds travel to a meeting of Software Engineering (SE) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) researchers to promote synergies between the two fields.  Advances in several AI areas, such as data mining, natural language understanding and constraint solving, have become ready for application in many domains, including SE. SE as an area for AI -- automating the activities of programmers -- is still a long-term vision for AI. SE goals, such as component-based, evolvable software containing valid world models and correct code, are important to AI as they are to other fields. The workshop will explore synergies between the fields and serve as a planning meeting for future interactions.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ SE has resulted in tools and methodologies that can build large and complex systems. Prior research in AI suffered from too many prototypes and not enough deployed systems. We believe that SE has much to offer AI about systems engineering and scalability of methodologies.  Yet AI research rarely uses this work.   The aim of the RAISE workshop was to answer the question:           Are SE and AI researchers ignoring important insights from AI and SE?   Thus RAISE Æ13 was a crossover workshop where the state of the art in both fields was documented and extended.   This workshop explored not only the application of AI techniques to software engineering problems but also the application of software engineering techniques to AI problems. Our objectives were to address three kinds of issues:   How to improve SE via AI How to apply AI to SE activities How to improve AI via SE                The goal of the RAISEÆ13 workshop was to strengthen the AI-and-SE community and also develop a roadmap of strategic research directions for AI and software engineering.  The  workshop brought together researchers from the AI and software engineering disciplines to build on the interdisciplinary synergies which exist and to stimulate research across these disciplines. The first part of the workshop was devoted to current results and consisted of presentations and discussion of the state of the art.  For notes (and tweets) taken during this first part, see http://storify.com/Greg4cr/raise-2013-day-one. This was followed by a second part which looked over the horizon to seek future directions, inspired by a number of selected vision statements concerning the AI-and-SE crossover. For notes (and tweets) taken during this first part, see http://storify.com/Greg4cr/raise-2013-day-two. Using the discussions and presentations from the workshop, participants developed lists of open issues and opportunities (listed in this document). Finally, a set of future activities were planned (a journal special issue and a RAISEÆ14 workshop).           Last Modified: 09/10/2013       Submitted by: Timothy J Menzies]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
