<AbstractNarration>The project is devoted to three topics closely related to the Model Theory of Modules, an interdisciplinary branch of Mathematical Logic that seeks to understand the Representation Theory of Rings and Algebras using the formal mathematical language of Linear Algebra. The first topic is a global theory of finite-dimensional representations of a semisimple Lie algebra. The classification of such representations is classical, but only offers a local theory, giving criteria for when two finite-dimensional representations are isomorphic. By considering the theory of finite-dimensional representations, the project seeks to study the representations called pseudo-finite dimensional representations, because they satisfy in the formal language all the theorems of finite-dimensional representations. These nonstandard representations will be used to study varieties of finite-dimensional representations, and thus lead to a global theory of finite-dimensional representations. The second activity of the project is to study the precise nature of the relationship between the Model Theory of Modules over a ring and the K-theory} of that ring. One hopes to establish a precise relationship between these two areas in terms of a theory of homology introduced to study formulae in the formal language of representations. Finally, a theory for complete exact categories is to be developed not by using the techniques of model theory directly, but rather by mimicking in a categorical setting the intuition used in the model theory of modules to study purity.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The project will be devoted to a close examination of the relationship between activities carried on by algebraists most interested in applications to geometry and physics, but using the formal methodology of mathematical logic. These activities will use the language to study the symmetries that arise in algebra, and conversely, apply these symmetries to formal language. In other activities of the project, the PI will continue to act as consultant to professional development programs offered to elementary and middle school mathematics teachers in Northwest Central Ohio.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Main Goals: A) Pseudo-finite dimensional representations of semisimple Lie algebras; B) Homology of positive primitive formulae; and C) Exact categories with direct limits.  Major Activities: A) A joint article with Sonia L?Innocente is in press; B) Herzog is working on the logic of positive primitive formulae as a logic that specializes to a quantum logic (in the presence of an involution) when the Axioms of Contradiction and Excluded Middle are included. C) Two articles are in preparation, one with Ph Rothmaler and P.A. Guil Asensio and another with Sergio Estrada, X.H. Fu and Sinem Odabasi.   Specific Objectives/Significant Results: Both of the goals A) &amp; B) are now closely linked to questions of coordinatization of a modular lattice by a ring R. A) The model-theoretic study of pseudo-finite dimensional representations has turned its focus on quantum logics and coordinatization of the quantum logic by the ring of definable scalars; B) The homology of positive primitive formulae and Goursat's Lemma are now seen to provide the structural underpinning of coordinatization of modular lattices; C) What was initially meant to treat Eklof Lemma in the context of ideal approximation theory is now seen to be closely related to the so-called DG-cotorsion triple in the category of complexes.  Key outcome: The main outcome of the research done in the past year has been a change in perspective that has shifted the priority of the model theory of modules to questions of coordinatization of modular lattices, with particular emphasis on quantum logics.   Professional Development: Herzog participated in a project to bring professional development to teachers of middle school mathematics in high-needs school districts in the southern districts of Columbus, Ohio.  He has also hosted two Ph.D. students from Nanjing University at Ohio State University. One student spent 3 months at OSU; the other is spending 18 months at OSU.   Dissemination: During the reporting period, Herzog has reported his research at conferences in Erice, ITALY, Manchester, ENGLAND, and in CHINA in the cities of Huangzhou and Changchun. Herzog was invited to give one of five plenary lectures (just after the reporting periond) at the ICRA 2018 meeting in Prague. This the most-attended regularly held conference in representation theory of algebras.  Publications: A paper entitled "The universal abelian regular ring" is in press; its sequel, entitiled "The universal quantum logic of a ring with involution" is near submission.
