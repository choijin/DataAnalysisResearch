<AbstractNarration>In this  project we propose to expand our methods (Makanin-Razborov's machinery, algebraic geometry over groups, free actions on non-standard trees, structure of limit groups, etc.) developed in the proof of the Tarski's conjectures on first-order theories of free groups into several directions: model theory and algebraic geometry in the presence of negative curvature and for right-angled Artin groups; group actions on Lambda-trees, Lambda-hyperbolic geodesic spaces, and cube complexes; algorithmic problems for groups and elimination processes; equations in a wide variety of groups and algebras.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Solving equations is one of the main themes  in mathematics from ancient times.  Equations give a universal language to describe scientific problems in all their variety. Over the years (centuries, in fact) equations and their solutions became very complex, so to understand their hidden structure one has to use very elaborate techniques from algebra and geometry. In particular, groups are used to describe symmetries of  mathematical objects, they play a fundamental role in studying solutions of equations.  Nowadays, when mathematics gets ever more complex, equations alone cannot describe subtleties of scientific phenomena; new problems require much more powerful means and more powerful languages.  Most of the essential properties of objects that occur in everyday mathematical practice can be described in a very particular but universal language, so called first-order logic.  In this project we study  properties of groups, in all their entirety, that can be described in the first-order logic. Along the way we hope to shed some light on several fundamental open problems in group theory and algebra.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    This project was in the area of combinatorial, geometric and algorithmic group theory, model theory, and theory of algebras.      Intellectual Merit:  We would like to mention here the following results that were obtained in the course of the project. We described definable subsets and definable subgroups in torsion-free hyperbolic groups and proved that the first-order theory of a torsion-free hyperbolic group is decidable.  These results give solutions to the old Malcev and Tarski problems (originally stated  only for free groups) in a much broader context of torsion-free hyperbolic groups.  We gave a   complete classification of finitely presented groups acting freely on $\Lambda$-trees, described their algebraic structure, and established various algorithmic properties.  This solves the main problem of Alperin and Bass program on group actions on trees.  We solved the classical model theoretic problems for free associative algebras over fields, namely, we showed that the first-order theory of such algebras are undecidable and two such algebras of finite rank are elementarily equivalent if and only if their ranks are the same and the fields are equivalent in the weak second order logic.  Besides, we showed that if a ring with at least one proper  Noetherian centralizer has the same first-order theory as a free associative algebra then it is also a free associative.  We described precisely in cohomological terms the algebraic structure of finitely generated groups which are first-order equivalent to a given finitely generated nilpotent group.   We developed a model theory of free solvable groups in a way similar to the classical results on model theory of complex,  real, and p-adic numbers.  The results about hyperbolic groups and actions on trees give solutions to old well-known problems, and the results on algebras, nilpotent and free solvable groups open new areas of research.  More then thirty papers related to the award are published or submitted, and more then 50 invited talks are given.        Broader Impact: The work of O. Kharlampovich and A.
