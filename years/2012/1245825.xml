<AbstractNarration>This award is to support student participation in workshops that are affiliated with the annual ACM symposium on Computer and Communication Security conference (CCS), which are to be during October 15-19th 2012, in Raleigh NC. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The annual ACM Computer and Communications Security Conference is a leading international forum for information security researchers, practitioners, developers, and users to explore cutting-edge ideas and results, and to exchange techniques, tools and experiences. Since 2001, CCS started accommodating affiliated workshops to explore security issues in a variety of emerging areas. The CCS workshops have become active forums for researchers to form focus groups, discuss and collaborate on emerging and critical security problems, and disseminate fresh, revolutionary (and sometimes even controversial) ideas. These workshops also serve as natural venues to bring together researchers from multiple disciplines to address security issues in specific domains, such as health care, cloud computing and national critical infrastructures. The workshop selection process is rigorous and well coordinated. All workshop proposals are carefully reviewed by the CCS steering committee and evaluated based on their topic, intellectual merits, and relevance to academia and industry. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    This grant supported travel grants for 29 US Persons (students) to attend workshops on security in emerging areas that were affiliated with the 2012 ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security (CCS) held in Raleigh NC, as well as attending the 2013 ACM CCS Conference held in Berlin, Germany.     The annual ACM CCS Conference is a leading international forum for information security researchers, practitioners, developers, and users to explore cutting-edge ideas and results, and to exchange techniques, tools and experiences. CCS workshops quickly become active forums for researchers to form focus groups, discuss and collaborate on emerging and critical security problems, and disseminate fresh, revolutionary (and sometimes even controversial) ideas. These workshops also serve as natural venues to bring together researchers from multiple disciplines to address security issues in specific domains, such as health care, cloud computing and national critical infrastructures.         Attendance of supported students helped improve the quality of the workshops and conference, and helped them gain a better knowledge and understanding of the field, indirectly helping their research thus promoting training and learning. Increased attendance of the workshops also helps improve the exchange of ideas with fellow researchers, and partnerships for all attendants of the workshop. Overall this grant supported increased presence of US Persons in this international forum of computer security researchers and practitioners.
