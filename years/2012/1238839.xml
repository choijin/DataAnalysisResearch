<AbstractNarration>The overarching goals of this project are to establish a culture of research in materials science at the University of the Virgin Islands, and to contribute to enhancing the infrastructure for integration of research and education at this undergraduate institution. The research objectives of the project are to understand doping mechanisms in graphene, to perform annealing studies to investigate if the microstructure of graphene can be modified to determine conditions that lead to more permanent doping effects in the material for device applications, and to develop a quantitative understanding through computational modeling and simulations. The research on understanding electrochemical and electronic doping mechanisms in graphene will advance the knowledge of properties of graphene for electronic and sensor device applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will demonstrate p-type doping of graphene by surface modification with tetrafluorotetracyanoquinodimethane (F4-TCNQ).  F4-TCNQ has been widely used in organic light-emitting diodes to reduce the hole injection barrier by forming a narrow space-charge region near the metal contact, thereby improving device performance. Modifying the graphene surface with F4-TCNQ is therefore expected to favor electron transfer from graphene to F4-TCNQ molecules, leading to an electron accumulation layer in F4-TCNQ and a depletion layer in the graphene, thereby achieving p-type doping of the graphene. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The second task of this project is to investigate the effects of transition metals (TM) as potential electronic dopants in graphene using a chemical vapor deposition system. The doping studies will be complimented with carrier transport measurements. The project intends to find a correlation between the desired amount of doping, the concentration of atoms and their arrangement on the surface. A series of annealing experiments will be performed in order to determine whether or not the doping effect is still present. Lastly, it will be determined which mechanism is best suited for n-type and p-type doping and which set of conditions are most favorable for graphene to maintain its doped state.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit     The intellectual merit of the work lies in its potential to open up new opportunities for learning new physical phenomena,  and to understanding  which doping mechanism is best suited  for graphene, or what combination of mechanisms are  necessary  for graphene to maintain its dopant  state upon annealing.   The immediate impact of the work will be the generation of new experimental results. The results will lead to new understanding of the properties of graphene for device applications, thus contribute to advancing the field and materials science in general.

Broader Impacts     The Research Initiation Award was a great addition to the HBCU-UP program, as it allowed for young researchers at HBCUs to partner with researchers from other Universities to build a research program that might have been difficult to build otherwise.      Dr. Wayne Archibald, a UVI graduate with a Ph.D. in Materials Science and Engineering from Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) was well suited for this support.  His area of Materials Science is an interdisciplinary one offered an opportunity for UVI undergraduate students to become involved in research that is directly applicable to many different fields of engineering.  This area was not represented at the University, and thus this award was able to help to build infrastructure for this type of research, and will parallel many other collaborations that UVI has with other institutions for faculty and student research projects.     During the period of this award, Dr. Archibald has continued his involvement in research, and has both led and capitalized on a collaboration with Brookhaven National Laboratory and other Minority Serving Institutions which brings together faculty and administrators from these institution in order t...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
