<AbstractNarration>The amount of primary production attributable to sea ice algae is seasonally and quantitatively important to current arctic marine ecosystems and biogeochemical cycles. Although light and nutrients have been studied for decades as the determinants of ice-algal production, more complex synergistic effects between ice algae and other microbial residents of sea ice that may foster primary production are poorly known. Studies of sea-ice bacteria and algae, including genomic evaluations, have revealed potential links between compounds called compatible solutes (CS), commonly used by microbes to protect against osmotic shock (death by cell explosion) in high-salinity surroundings, and the availability of regenerated nitrogen within the ice. This research will test a seasonal-synergy hypothesis whereby CS precursor compounds (like choline) that are released by ice algae during fall freeze-up are taken up by bacteria in the ice, converted to CS for survival in the high-salinity brines of winter sea ice, and then metabolized for carbon, nitrogen and energy as spring temperatures warm, salinities freshen, and the need to retain CS as osmoprotectants diminishes. An important end product of this bacterial conversion of CS is ammonia, increasing the within-ice availability of nitrogen to ice algae on the verge of blooming as photosynthetically active radiation penetrates the ice. Elements of this proposed seasonal synergy between bacteria and algae encased in sea ice will be examined by a combination of field and laboratory approaches. Sea-ice brines will be collected during fall freeze-up and spring-bloom periods and tested for bacterial uptake of choline, conversion to CS, and remineralization, using radiolabeled and stable isotope-based incubations and spectroscopic methods. The latter will reveal the key bacterial phylotypes responsible for a CS-based seasonal synergy within sea ice. Measurements of temperature, salinity, pH, bacterial and viral abundances, chlorophyll pigments, and extracellular polysaccharide substances will provide environmental and biological context. Pure cultures of available and newly acquired (on CS- based media) sea-ice bacteria will be examined across temperature and salinity gradients to clarify the key processes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will help to launch the faculty career of an early career polar scientist and provide training opportunities to graduate and undergraduate students in the field, in the laboratory, at the computer, and in outreach efforts in Washington State, Alaska and Greenland. By conducting the proposed field research from the Greenland Climate Research Center in Nuuk, Greenland, this US team will foster international cooperation among scientists from the US, Greenland and Denmark, adding to the outcome and continuing pan-Arctic goals of the recently completed International Polar Year.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The microscopic algae that grow in the lower porous layers of sea ice during springtime provide important nutritional support for the organisms and ecosystems of polar regions, yet these algae can run out of the nutrients that they need when the waters underlying sea ice can no longer supply them.  This project explored the possibility of another source of nutrients to sea-ice algae, particularly nitrogen, that would lengthen their growing season or enhance their total productivity and thus the larger ecosystem.  The results of this study show that cold-adapted bacteria, other microorganisms also living inside of sea ice, protect themselves against harsh overwintering conditions (freezing temperatures and high salt concentrations) by storing nitrogen-rich organic compounds intracellularly, but when conditions become milder in springtime, they instead consume and respire these compounds releasing carbon dioxide and ammonium, one of the sources of nitrogen for sea-ice algae.  A "seasonal synergy" thus appears to exist within the ice between algae and bacteria that may benefit the larger ecosystem.  An unexpected result was that both the ammonium and carbon dioxide produced within the ice can be consumed by yet another group of microorganisms, the nitrifying bacteria, which convert the ammonium to nitrate, a favored source of nitrogen for many sea-ice algae, and the carbon dioxide to new organic food (all done in the dark), adding to what the algae already produce through light-driven photosynthesis.  Uncovering these types of interactive relationships between the different types of microbes living in sea ice adds to an understanding of how ecosystems persist and even flourish in the Arctic marine environment and other polar settings.  As the work took place on sea ice in Greenlandic waters, collaborations with Greenlandic, Danish and other scientists were developed, with resulting co-authored publications, and the local indigenous Greenlanders were able to assist and participate in the research and benefit from an understanding of the results.  While pursuing this research, several junior scientists earned higher degrees, including one Masters degree and two PhDs, and gained unique training in Arctic field-based research and in the conduct of international collaboration.
