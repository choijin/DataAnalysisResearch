<AbstractNarration>In 2010, IODP exp. 327 launched series of experiments based on instrumentation placed in 6 boreholes (Holes 1026B, 1027C, 1301A, 1301B, 1362A, and 1362B) on and near the Juan de Fuca Ridge (JDFR). The experiments were designed to examine hydrological and biological processes in basaltic ocean crust. Major issues to be addressed include overall permeability, the magnitudes, velocity and directions of fluid, solute,and heat transport,constraints on the fluid storage properties of crust, determining how fluid reservoirs respond to seismic perturbations, and investigating the variability, diversity, and metabolism of resident microbial populations. This project will recover sensors and samplers in the instrumented boreholes(CORKs),access data and samples, collect biological incubators placed at depth within the boreholes, and seal the CORKs. All of these activities are needed for the completion of the JDFR experiments&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once the data and samples are retrieved, the PI's will develop new numerical models for the hydrology (permeability, thickness and extent of permeable zones, connectivity, direction of flow, and anisotropy) of ocean crust based on the results of flow tests. T sensors will enable thermal structure to be determined in conjunction with flow parameters. DNA will be analyzed via ?16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes as well as select full-length Sanger-style sequencing and gene fingerprinting techniques.? The PI's will look at diversity, shared species, emergence and disappearance of groups. Metagenomic work will be done on some samples.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts include training of 4 shipboard educators, with an emphasis on recruiting underrepresented groups for these positions, teacher workshops, and special training for undergraduate and graduate students and post-docs. Research team includes grads, undergrads, and post-docs.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project was part of a collaborative package of grants to investigators from six institutions: the Universities of Alaska, California at Santa Cruz, California at Santa Barbara, Hawaii, Miami (this project), and Southern California.  The overall goal of the collaborative program was to conclude a 2004-2014 phase of hydrogeological and microbiological experiments conducted in six sealed subseafloor borehole observatories called "CORKs" that had been installed in 2004 and 2010 by the Integrated Ocean Drilling Program in sediment-covered young oceanic crust on the eastern flank of the Juan de Fuca Ridge.  This location is known for significant off-axis hydrothermal circulation of warm (~65&deg;C) formation fluids in the permeable oceanic basement beneath the less permeable sediment cover.  The CORKs included downhole sensor strings, as well as instrumentation installed above seafloor to access subseafloor fluids and pressure signals via wellhead valves, all designed to elucidate the physical, chemical, and microbiological effects of and controls on the active circulation of formation fluids at the location.  The set of experiments included a ground-breaking hole-to-hole tracer hydrologic test &ndash; the first ever conducted in the oceanic crust &ndash; to resolve the actual direction of the extensive flow of formation fluids.   The overall collaborative program supported a 2014 research cruise using the manned research submersible DSRV Alvin to recover downhole sensor strings and data and samples from the wellhead instrumentation.  Aspects supported by this particular project included download of formation pressure data from recorders on the wellheads and recovery of long-term temperature loggers installed on the downhole sensor strings.  Pressure data were successfully recovered from all of the CORK installations. Downhole sensor strings with autonomous formation temperature loggers were recovered from three of the installations, and the long-term temperature records provided important constraints for the interpretation of the ground-breaking hole-to-hole tracer hydrologic experiment.  The results of that experiment were published recently in peer-reviewed scientific literature (Neira et al., 2016, Earth and Planetary Science Letters, v. 450, pp. 355-365).  These results confirmed a hypothesis of dominant formation fluid flow direction from south to north, consistent with permeability provided by tectonic fabric that is aligned generally parallel to the Juan de Fuca seafloor spreading center to the west.  The results also indicate that the high formation permeability may be confined to a relatively low proportion of basement void/pore space that is inter-connected (termed "effective porosity").  Thus, the project has fulfilled the most important aspects of the intellectual merit as originally proposed.  In addition, this project has also fulfilled important aspects of the broader impact as originally proposed, both in terms of support of graduate education and in providing a permanent archive of the data from the project.  The first author of the tracer experiment paper mentioned above was at the time a graduate student at University of California at Santa Barbara.  In addition, the project has supported analyses of tidal signals in the pressure data by a graduate student of Hispanic descent at the University of Miami who is expected to earn his doctorate by summer of 2018.  Finally, the pressure and temperature data from this specific project are now posted on the internet for open public access via the IEDA Marine Geoscience Data System, at http://www.marine-geo.org.
