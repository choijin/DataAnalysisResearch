<AbstractNarration>IPDPS is an international forum for engineers and scientists from around the world to present latest research findings in all aspects of parallel computation. In addition to technical sessions of submitted paper presentations, the meeting offers workshops, tutorials, and commercial presentations &amp; exhibits along with a PhD forum for young researchers. This award will contribute towards increasing student participation in the symposium and the field. The award will contribute funding for up to 20 students to travel to IPDPS 2012 in Shanghai, China. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
