<AbstractNarration>As part of a SAVI, researchers from the U.S. and from Finland will collaborate on investigating the relationships between engagement and learning in STEM transmedia games. The members of U.S. Team for this project come from TERC, WGBH and Northern Illinois University.   The project involves two intensive, 5 day workshops to identify new measurement instruments to be integrated into each other's research and development work.  The major research question is to what degree learners in the two cultures respond similarly or differently to the STEM learning games.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The FUN collaboration consisted of five parallel strands, each with separate outcomes.     FUN Strand 1: Games with Kinect Interactivity   EdGE and TAUCHI of Tampere designed two adaptations of EdGEÆs research-grounded physics learning game, Impulse. They both used the XBOX Kinect platform. Two different interfaces (mechanics) were designed and tested with small groups in Finland and the US. The mechanics designed for Kinect showed potential for increased engagement but did not align well with potential embodied physics learning because the mechanic could not be directly related to the amount of force imparted. The investigators concluded that the development of a haptic interface for EdGE learning should wait until force-sensitive interfaces are available. Since this research, those interfaces have become available, and have submitted a Cyberlearning EXPloratory proposal (Dec 2015) for research on haptic game-based learning as a direct result of this work.     FUN Strand 2: Seed Research: Flow Studies Across Multiple Testbeds   Researchers from EdGE, Northern Illinois University, Rutgers University, and University of Tampere studied flow experiences in game-like environments.  This study was conducted in 4 settings: An EdGE Physics game for high school students; an NIU engineering game for undergraduates; a Kinect math experience for early elementary students in Tampere, Finland; and within Minecraft.edu with middle school students in Finland who are learning English as a Foreign Language. All teams used the Experience Sampling Method (ESM) to measure flow experiences during learnerÆs interactions in the environment. This research found that playersÆ flow, or engagement, was related to improved learning, while immersion alone was not. Several conference papers and an article in Computers and Human Behavior (Hamari et al., 2015) are a direct result of this work.     FUN Strand 3: International Study of Identity in Games   The US and Finnish teams shared ongoing research on Identity and how it influences game-based learning.

As part of this rich cultural exchange, FUN team member, WGBH Kids Digital Senior Exec Producer Bill Shribman was the keynote speaker at ITK in April 2014, held in H&auml;meenlinna, Finland and chaired by Jarmo Viteli. Before an audience of 800 people, Bill touched on everything from politics and culture wars to trends in educational technology, multi-platform production, and media literacy.
