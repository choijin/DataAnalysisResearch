<AbstractNarration>Intellectual merit: A field and modeling study of estuarine frontogenesis and sediment trapping in a highly-stratified estuary will be conducted in the Connecticut River estuary. Frontogenesis in estuaries is poorly understood, yet it is a fundamental mechanism influencing many aspects of estuarine hydrodynamics and sediment transport. The fronts in estuaries are among the strongest observed in any marine environment, producing intense, localized density gradients, abrupt transitions in stratification, bottom stress, and turbulence, strong vertical velocities and intense sediment trapping. The processes that lead to sediment trapping depend on the same physical variables and occur at the same scales as those producing estuarine fronts, providing a strong motivation for an interdisciplinary study of the dynamics of estuarine fronts and associated sediment trapping. The Connecticut River estuary is the field site - an energetic regime with intense and highly time-dependent fronts and ephemeral trapping of fine-grained sediment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The observational program will include measurements of the frontal structure as it varies at tidal and seasonal timescales, as well as intensive, high-resolution measurements with fixed and ship-mounted instruments to obtain unprecedented spatial and temporal resolution of the physical regime. Simultaneously, suspended-sediment concentrations and properties with optical and acoustic methods will be quantified and subjected to an extensive laboratory and field calibration effort. The water-column observations will be coupled with bed-sediment characterization to address interactions among sediment flux convergence, ephemeral deposition, and spatially and temporally varying availability of resuspendable sediment. Observational measurements will be paired with a high-resolution numerical model of the hydrodynamics and sediment transport to help interpret the observations and to investigate the details of the dominant physical processes leading to frontogenesis and associated sediment trapping.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The study will provide a comprehensive examination of estuarine frontogenesis, linking current theoretical understanding of quasi-steady hydraulics with the dynamics of partially-mixed estuaries in order to understand, quantify and parameterize frontogenesis and its influence on the overall estuarine regime. Through the combination of high-resolution measurements and modeling, the research team will perform a rigorous examination of the mechanisms of sediment trapping, particularly in context with the strong but highly time-dependent convergence resulting from estuarine fronts and the associated, ephemeral deposits of fine-grained sediment. The study will address the sensitivity of these hydrodynamic and sediment-transport processes to variations in estuarine forcing conditions, based both on the observed variation of forcing and model sensitivity studies. Model sensitivity studies will also be used to determine whether frontal convergence processes may explain the long-term evolution of estuarine morphology and the potential implications of shifts in forcing variables on the overall estuarine regime.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts: This study will lead to the understanding and improved prediction of the generation of fronts in estuaries and the influence of fronts on the fate and transport of fine sediment and associated contaminants. These findings will have application to the modeling and management of the heavily populated, industrialized and otherwise human-impacted estuaries around the world. This project includes implementation of new educational components: a short-course in advanced field methods for graduate students from across the international estuarine research community, and an undergraduate field research class that will be coupled to the graduate-level field class. The project will also support the thesis work of two graduate students.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Estuaries are important environments for society as well as coastal and marine organisms.  They provide nursery and habitat for important species; they provide protected harbors for ships; they are the sites of many of the great cities of the world.  They are also among the most threatened of environments, due both to global climatic factors such as sea level rise as well as local abuses such as pollution and overdevelopment of the shoreline.  This project provided new information about the natural processes in estuarine environments that will help guide future management decisions to preserve and enhance the valuable natural resources of estuaries.   The research addressed the physical processes that affect the flow of water and sediment through the Connecticut River estuary. This estuary belongs to a particular category of estuaries&mdash;tidally energetic salt wedge estuaries&mdash;which are common but have not been studied extensively in the past.  The study revealed some important attributes of this type of environment, both with respect to the mixing and exchange of salt and fresh water, and also with respect to sediment transport.   The study provided important insights about the formation of fronts&mdash;i.e., regions of strong gradients in water properties, within estuaries.  The study also provided new insights that will improve the quantification of mixing in stratified flows, with application to many natural environments, including the oceans and atmosphere.    The study of sediment  transport indicated that short estuaries like the Connecticut River export most of the sediment they receive from the watershed directly to the adjacent marine environment, rather than trapping it in mud deposits as is observed in bigger estuaries like Chesapeake Bay and the Hudson River.   Sediment and contaminants still get trapped in the estuary, but the sediment goes out into the marine environment during high discharge, then comes back in during low flow.  This complex pathway of sediment transport has important geochemical implications, because the chemistry of the marine environment differs markedly from the riverine and estuarine conditions.  The variability of sediment transport and trapping also has implications for dredging of harbors and for the transport and fate of contaminants in estuaries.
