<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Global changes in transportation and communication have placed a premium on the ability to speak two or more languages. However, learning a third language (L3) can interfere with the learner's proficiency in a previously acquired second (L2) language, a phenomenon referred to as language attrition. Fundamental questions about why languages attrite, how they attrite, and what aspects of language are most susceptible to attrition remain unanswered. This proposal seeks to better understand how the learning of a new language (L3) can interfere with the learner's proficiency with a previously acquired non-native language (L2), in the context of real-world language learning among college students.  Dr. Lee Osterhout, from the University of Washington, will perform three experiments using a high density EEG-based brain activity measure to longitudinally investigate changes in learners' ability to process sentences in their L3 (Italian) and in their L2 (a similar language, Spanish, or a less similar language, such as Japanese).  Because the brain activity measure is differentially sensitive to aspects of linguistic meaning and grammar, the results will provide a specific understanding of what linguistic knowledge (for both the L2 and L3) has been gained or lost, and how the acquisition of one language influences the loss of another.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Given the importance of multi-lingual skills in the modern, inter-connected world, a better understanding of the causes of language attrition will have broad impact.  Findings from this project may lead to ways to improve and customize instructional pedagogy with respect to language learning, and to protect previously acquired foreign languages. This project will generate a large data set with broad relevance.  Potentially, this data set could be used to study the spatial origins of language-sensitive brain responses, test new mathematical and computational tools for high-density EEG-based brain source imaging, and address the fundamental question of how brain activity, at the temporal scale of milliseconds and from multiple brain regions, changes as a result of learning and "unlearning" outside of the laboratory.</AbstractNarration>

Accomplishment/Results  The goal of this research is to study the acquisition and attrition ("forgetting") of classroom-learned languages. Due to the limitations of standardized proficiency tests, we are investigating language learning and attrition by recording event-related brain potentials (ERPs) from the scalp, while participants read sentences in their second or third language. During the current year of funding, we made further progress on Experiment (Aim) 1 and initiated Experiment (Aim) 2.     Experiment (Aim) 1  Experiment 1 examines the acquisition and attrition of L3 Italian word meanings and grammatical rules. Our current results confirm that the brain responses to linguistic anomalies in Italian sentences change systematically as a person becomes more fluent in the language. Furthermore, as fluency increases, the brain responses to errors of meaning or grammar become increasingly distinct. At present 14 participants have completed both the language acquisition phase and the language attrition phase; we are continuing to schedule learners for the post-instruction attrition phase. Visual inspection of the data do show the expected changes in brain activity during both phases. However, given the longitudinal nature of the study, more data from the attrition phase need to be acquired before the appropriate analyses can be performed.     Experiment (Aim) 2.  We completed construction of the stimuli needed to conduct Experiment 2 and validated the stimuli by having the Italian and Spanish instructors read through the materials. We also made significant progress in recruiting and running language learners, native Italian speakers, and native Spanish speakers.  Although data acquisition for the language learning component has been completed, data acquisition for the attrition period (each subject will be tested twice during the attrition phase) will continue until near the end of the project period. For both experiments, additional data acquisition during the attrition phase is needed before attrition results can be assessed. Notable preliminary findings from the acquisition phase of Experiment 2 are described below.        1. L2 Italian proficiency (as measured by behavioral assessments) varied widely across the learners and predicted the amplitude of the P600 effect to grammatical anomalies in Italian sentences. This result further validates P600 amplitude as a brain-based metric of L2 proficiency.  2. Sabouin et al. (2006) reported "transfer" of L2 knowledge to an unstudied L3. In our study, L3 Italian learners "transferred" aspects of the Italian gender system to a language (Spanish) they had never studied. We found that Italian proficiency (in the Italian learners) predicted the magnitude of the ERP response to Spanish gender violations, even when the participants had never had any instruction in or significant prior exposure to Spanish.  However, the "quality" of the ERP response was different across Italian and Spanish:  Italian gender anomalies elicited P600 effects whereas Spanish gender anomalies elicited N400 effects. Learners apparently transferred "knowledge" of the rule from their L3 to an unknown but typologically similar language. However, the neural "procedures" that detected the anomalies in the known known apparently did not transfer to the unstudied language.  3. More generally, Increased proficiency in L2 Spanish can facilitate or inhibit grammatical learning in typologically similar L3 Italian (as manifested in ERPs elicited during real-time reading), as a function of congruency or incongruency across the two languages.     Publications. Given that the design of the project is longitudinal, publication of the work will necessarily come after the bulk of the data have been collected.
