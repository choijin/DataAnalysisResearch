<AbstractNarration>This project expands and enriches a semester long research based molecular biology laboratory course into a novel year-long research based curriculum that emphasizes experimental design and execution, data interpretation, and written and oral presentation skills as integral components of the course.  The year-long approach has been piloted and preliminary assessment studies demonstrate significant learning gains by undergraduate students completing the two semester series.  The year-long program will be completed by all biology majors and will be spread over two courses: Genetics (BIO231) and Introduction to Cellular and Molecular Biology (BIO335). In both courses, specific content areas covered in lab will predominantly reflect the respective parent courses; during BIO231 students will develop and refine experimental methods to conduct and analyze a microarray experiment to study the effects of osmotic stress on yeast cells. These data will be used as a roadmap in the following semester in BIO335, where they will clone candidate genes involved in osmotic stress and ultimately, design and conduct cell-based functional assays to test hypotheses generated throughout the term. The project also pilots the addition of a service learning option, a science outreach program to serve high-need schools in New York City, as a feature of the course.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;INTELLECTUAL MERIT: Students in these revised courses employ an interdisciplinary approach, relying upon modern genomic, molecular and cell biology methodologies, including RNA-Seq technology, to answer a well-defined biological question.  Interdisciplinary approaches are increasingly being emphasized in all STEM disciplines.  In addition the writing component represents a trend that is beginning to emerge as an effective way to improve student learning gains.  The results of the evaluation of this project should add to what is known about effective ways to improve undergraduate biology laboratories and for students and faculty to profit from introduction of research-based student laboratories.  Comparison of student scores on the Educational Testing Service Major Field Test in Biology are being used to assess effects on student learning, along with the use of surveys and focus groups, as well as the writing assignments to assess both learning and attitudinal changes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BROADER IMPACTS:  Piloting of the service learning component adds to the broader impacts of this project.  The project is participating in the CURE survey of Dr. Lopatto, thus contributing to a national data base concerning the outcomes of research-based student laboratories.  Results are being widely disseminated through regional and national workshops and disciplinary annual meetings and publications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is being jointly funded by the Directorate for Biological Sciences and the Directorate for Education and Human Resources, Division of Undergraduate Education as part of their efforts toward support of Vision and Change in Undergraduate Biology Education</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ There have been a plethora of national calls to increase undergraduate STEM graduation rates to meet the future demands in the STEM job market.  For example, the 2012 President?s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST) has charged undergraduate STEM faculty to adopt evidence-based, best practices in teaching and learning to increase the retention of STEM undergraduate majors from 40% to 50%.  The 2011 AAAS document, Vision and Change in Undergraduate Biology Education: A Call to Action provides undergraduate biology faculty and programs several recommendations to consider when updating their courses to enhance STEM student learning and retention.  An integral component of the call to enhance the retention and graduation of STEM majors is to incorporate authentic research experiences into undergraduate curricula.  To these ends, we created a year-long classroom undergraduate research experience (CURE) that was embedded into second-year, major core Genetics and Cellular and Molecular Biology (CMB) laboratory courses.  For the first course in our CURE, students identified genes important for environmental stress responses by the yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae using innovative molecular biology techniques.  The students were tasked with investigating the functions of those genes in the second CURE course.  In order to evaluate student learning gains, we employed three pre-test, post-test format Genetics and CMB exams and compared gains on the post-test versus the pre-tests to student laboratory final course grades.  Our results demonstrated that there was a significant correlation between students earning lower grades in the Genetics laboratory for both years of this study and gains on the Genetics post-test versus the pre-test.  We also demonstrated a correlation between students earning lower grades in the Genetics laboratory and gains on the CMB post-test versus the pre-test for year 1 of the study.  Students also demonstrated significant gains in identifying the variable properties of experimental subjects when assessed using a pre-test, post-test format exam to evaluate the development of experimental design skills in students.  Results from the administration of a survey developed to determine the students? perceptions of the CURE experience on their learning support these findings.  Our results suggest that a year-long CURE enables lower performing students to experience greater gains in their foundational skills for success in the STEM disciplines.  We believe that these results demonstrate that the CURE experience fosters the development of foundational content knowledge in the lower performing students so that they can begin to build their strengths in the higher-order skills required for research - such as understanding the primary literature and analyzing data.  Most studies that have evaluated CUREs to date do not provide direct measures of actual learning gains resulting from participation in research experiences.  The studies to date focus on reporting student perceived learning gains, enhanced STEM student retention, and enhanced STEM graduation rates resulting from participation in the undergraduate research experiences.  The broader impacts of the findings from this study support the literature in that CURE experiences provide opportunities for undergraduate students to make achievements in many of the activities required for success in the STEM professions.  However, our work takes one adds to the field as it highlights that CUREs enable lower performing students to be successful in STEM.  Lower performing students often leave STEM programs for other disciplines.  Our year-long CURE may motivate lower performing students to remain and be successful in STEM which will, in turn, help to meet the goals of the 2012 PCAST report.
