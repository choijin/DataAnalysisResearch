<AbstractNarration>Proteins are the molecular machines that are responsible for a vast array of functions that are necessary for life.  Understanding how they work is critical to both a better scientific understanding of the fundamental processes of life, and to modifying or improving their function.  Despite the fact that proteins are physically 3-dimensional structures of cooperating parts, the current state of the art for representing and studying proteins uses a description that is simply a sequential list of the parts used in their assembly.  This sequential-list style of description has biased the development of tools for protein analysis to accentuate the sequential properties of these molecules, and ignores the fact that the parts must work together in unison for the protein to function.  This work will broadly impact the study of proteins, improving a range of activities from basic scientific studies of function, to endeavors in protein engineering. The products of this project will be made freely available to the research community as online tools, and the methods will be incorporated into coursework and made available as lesson-plan material appropriate for both primary and secondary education.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will adapt a recently-developed statistical technique, the Conditional Random Field (CRF), that can quantitatively represent densely-connected networks of features, and a recently-developed visualization tool that enables interactive exploration of these networks, for the task of describing proteins.  Structurally, Conditional Random Fields appear to recapitulate the process by which evolution has selected for parts that cooperate in proteins, and protein descriptions based on CRFs will be able to predict whether a change to a protein - a mutation - would have been tolerated by evolution, or selected against as non-functional.  This information will aid in predicting the effect of a mutation, or multiple mutations to a protein, using much more of the available information, than is currently utilized by state-of-the-art tools. The "change in protein sequence to change in protein function" problem is a "model organism" for many other types of biological and non-biological systems where rich interactions between parts of the system demand a sophisticated statistical approach.  To-date, in most of these fields, models that are similarly limited to those currently used in proteins are the de-facto standard.  Developing the tools necessary for applying CRFs to protein data, and methods of establishing testable ground-truth in this system, will enhance the application of CRFs to many other domains where they may provide a significant advantage over current methods. This tool may make interdependencies between features visually explorable and modifications of these dependencies quantifiably predictable, and may promote more thorough consideration of the true complexity of data and systems in many domains. The products of this project will be made freely available to the research community as online tools. As the teachable component matures, products will be made available as lesson-plan material appropriate for both primary and secondary education.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Proteins are some of the most fundamental molecular machines responsible for the processes of life.  Despite their ubiquity and central necessity in living organisms, the rules by which nature determines the function of proteins remain elusive.  The lack of clarity regarding the rules places impediments on research and application that spans the gamut from engineering improvements into bacteria to increase biofuel production, to understanding which mutations cause disease.   Part of the reason that these rules are difficult to determine, stems from the necessity to use abstract representations of the proteins to talk and compute about them, and the fact that there are differences between the important features of the abstract representations, and important features of the proteins themselves.  In this project we have evaluated the benefit of using representations that are more closely aligned to the apparently important features of the proteins, to determine whether improved statistical models of proteins enable better insight into their function.   Proteins are fundamentally microscopic molecular machines.  They are built from only a handful (20 or so) different possible parts, assembled in an ordered string of anywhere from a few dozen, to many hundreds of parts in a row.  To become a functional protein, this ordered string folds up into a specific 3-dimensional shape which constitutes the functional molecular machine.   The representation that scientists use to talk and compute about proteins, is rooted in this ordered string of parts.  Ordered strings of symbols (representing parts) have been extensively studied in Computer Science, and there is a vast body of literature, experience and tools available for working with them, making this representation particularly appealing.  Tools that can walk down strings and determine whether each part can fit in the string are ubiquitous and well studied, and so these tools and approaches get used for studying proteins.   Unfortunately, proteins don't function as strings of parts.  They function as folded molecular machines, and functionality probably depends on how the parts fit into the folded molecular machine, rather than on how they fit into the string.  The vast library of existing computational tools that deal with strings, will never be able to speak to this question.   In this project we have evaluated the idea of inferring each part's requirements for fit into the folded molecular machine of a particular protein, from the different versions of that protein that are found across the tree of life.  Many of these requirements can be encoded into a statistical model called a Conditional Random Field (CRF).  CRFs are a relatively-recently-described approach to modeling data where "the parts have opinions about each other", but CRFs have, to date, seen only minimal real application due to a variety of implementation issues.  Our project applies unique tools to CRFs that enable us to study application by sidestepping some of the implementation issues.   Through the work performed in this project, we have determined that: Important functional features of proteins that are not apparent in a string/sequence representation can be inferred from co-evolving residue pairs in protein family data, and encoded in a CRF;  Computing upon these inferred CRFs can produce functional insight into proteins that is not attainable from sequence/string-based representations;  Strong co-evolutionary signals in a protein family are more valuable for predicting function than for predicting structure;  And, there is additional fine detail in co-evolutionary structure that cannot be encoded using the CRF formalism, suggesting the existence of a higher-level statistical structure/model that remains to be formalized.  In addition, we have demonstrated that the same tools that enable valuable computation on the "not really sequence" data of proteins, can be used to better understand other data that appears to be sequential at first glance, but that in reality has deeper interaction structure (for example, clinical outcome data after a treatment time course).
