<AbstractNarration>This multidisciplinary study of the ancient, historical, and contemporary harvest of harbor seals at icefloe pupping grounds near Hubbard Glacier in Yakutat Bay, Alaska models the reshaping of both an environment and a human hunting system in response to Late Holocene climate change. The project joins indigenous knowledge, language, and oral heritage with the material and chronometric evidence of archaeology, geology, and paleoenvironmental studies to document the cultural history and landscape of Yakutat Bay, where dramatic glacial recession after C. E. 1100 attracted major concentrations of harbor seals and opened the fiord for Sugpiaq, Eyak, Ahtna, and Tlingit settlement. The research team proposes that a clan-based system of local and external access rights developed around Yakutat sealing because of its economic centrality for peoples of the eastern Gulf of Alaska; that sealing camps shifted from the outer to the inner bay over time to follow the receding glacial front; and that the locations, artifact assemblages, faunal remains, and spatial layouts of camps express the cultural and social organization of hunting in different eras. They hypothesize that situated knowledge of Yakutat Bay's human and environmental history is encoded in living oral traditions and multilingual toponyms that richly delineate this nine-century cultural landscape, and that oral heritage can be chronologically correlated with archaeological and geological data. The study leads from the past to the present day, when the continuity of sealing and of the community's cultural and linguistic heritage are matters of urgent local concern. The methodologies and results of this study are highly relevant to questions of human adaptation and resiliency in the changing North and to the challenge of building coherence between indigenous and scientific knowledge systems.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goal of this project was to place the prehistoric, human history of the Yakutat Bay area into paleoenthree graduate students at the University of Alaska. vironmental context. My part of the project was to provide information abouyt glacial history in the surrounding region. Early on in the study, we found it necessary to look beyond the environs of Yakutat Bay to find long-term records of glacier advance and retreat. We adapted our part of the study by shifting the study focus southwards to the outer coast of Glacier Bay National Park where superb records of glacial geoloigy are preserved as a result of rapid tectonic uplift. We are currently in the process of writing a summary paper that pulls together everything that is known about the glacial history of the eastern Gulf of Alaska region from approximately 20,000 years ago to the present. Our most exciting finding involves the feasibility of the Northwest Coast Route for humam dispersal between Beringia and lowert latitude North America. Results of this study show that the coast was free of glaciers by 14,000 years ago and for the first time precisely map the extent of a major glacial readvance during the Younger Dryas cold period, which lasted from 12,800 to 11,700 years ago. This research has helped support three graduate students at the University of Alaska (UAF).  It has also provided summer employment and field experience to an Alaskan high school student and an undergraduate student at UAF.
