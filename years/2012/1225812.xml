<AbstractNarration>The leading hypothesis for the formation of drumlins--elongate hills that form beneath sediment-floored glaciers--is that they are nucleated where low pore-water pressure in the sediment bed inhibits its shear. These parts of the bed may resist erosion and prompt local deposition, causing hills to form. However, a drumlin field recently exposed by the retreat of the surge-type Icelandic glacier, Múlajökull, provides a compelling alternative hypothesis: that drumlins form in zones of low effective stress (total ice pressure minus pore-water pressure) associated with swarms of longitudinal crevasses in the glacier margin. These two hypotheses lead to predictions of effective-stress and bed-deformation patterns that are conspicuously different. During two field seasons, these patterns will be studied at Múlajökull by trenching drumlins and their intervening swales and then collecting intact till specimens for two kinds of analyses. Some samples will be compacted in consolidation tests, a well-established technique for inferring the past maximum effective stress on former glacier beds that has not yet been applied systematically to drumlins. Other samples will have their anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility (AMS) measured, and preferred orientations of susceptibility will be used to determine patterns of deformation in the drumlins and intervening areas. If past effective stresses were anomalously low in drumlins, the leading hypothesis for their formation would be contradicted, and the crevasse hypothesis would be supported. The same would be true if AMS patterns were either not related to drumlin morphology or indicated convergent shear of bed sediments toward the up-glacier ends of drumlins. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The origin of drumlins, which cover vast areas of Canada, Scandinavia, Britain, Ireland, and the northern U.S., is one of the longest standing problems in Earth science. Although drumlins have been the subject of over 1300 scientific contributions since their study began ~150 years ago, the origin of no drumlin field is known definitively. By focusing on a drumlin field that is "active" in the sense that it has been shaped by the current glacial regime and studying drumlin sediments in new ways, this research in central Iceland will help illuminate the processes that sculpt one of the most emblematic and mysterious of glacial landforms. Results will also provide guidance for predicting the distribution of drag at the beds of ice sheets, a fundamental factor in estimating their speeds. This project will support the education of two graduate students and will provide international independent study projects for six undergraduate students from underrepresented groups. A request will be made for a high school teacher, supported by the NSF-supported PolarTREC program, to participate in the field work. This teacher would stream his or her experiences daily back to multiple classrooms with the goals of exposing K-12 students to glacial geologic research and interactively answering their questions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is co-supported by the Geomorphology and Land Use Dynamics program and the Office of International Science and Engineering.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Drumlins are hills, usually comprised of sediment, that form hidden from view at the beds of ice sheets and some smaller glaciers and that are elongated in the direction of glacier flow.  Despite over 1000 publications on drumlins over the last ~150 years, data sufficiently definitive to falsify hypotheses for their formation have been rare, and so numerous explanations for drumlin formation&mdash;conceptual and quantitative&mdash;persist. In recent years mathematical models have been developed but have been grounded only loosely on observations. The goal of this project was to test hypotheses for drumlin formation by studying the basal till (i.e., sediment deposited from ice at the bottom of a glacier) within and adjacent to the drumlins of M&uacute;laj&ouml;kull, a shrinking surge-type glacier in Iceland that has recently exposed a rare group of modern drumlins (Fig. 1).  Study of the magnetic, geotechnical, and stratigraphic properties of the basal till, together with high resolution topographic (LiDAR) and ground-penetrating radars surveys of the drumlins, yielded the following scientific outcomes:  Demonstration that drumlin relief developed by both deposition on drumlins and erosion between them, during overall aggradation of the glacier forefield.   Demonstration that till deposition occurred during surges. Demonstration that till between drumlins was weaker than till within drumlins, the opposite of predictions of leading models of drumlin formation. Demonstration that till within drumlins was deposited in shear, rather than in compression, allowing some hypotheses for drumlin formation to be rejected.   Development of a new, physically-based, mathematical model of drumlin formation in which till is deposited everywhere in the glacier forefield during surges and eroded into drumlins during periods of normal flow between surges.  With multiple surge cycles, drumlins grow in height and migrate downglacier, with resultant stratigraphy in broad agreement with field observations.   Overall, the data from this study provide significantly improved criteria for judging existing models of drumlin growth and for formulating new models. The new model discussed herein is consistent with the data, but models developed subsequently may well provide a simpler, better explanation. Thus, the principal impact of this work on glacial geomorphology will be to provide a database that can potentially spawn a new  generation of drumlin models with better empirical grounding&mdash;models that get closer to both simulating drumlin evolution and getting the physics right.  Our findings also bear on the dynamics of the basal slip of glaciers&mdash;a longstanding focus in the field of glaciology because basal slip is usually responsible for fast glacier flow.  Drumlins have been imaged geophysically beneath fast flowing parts of the Antarctic ice sheet, and these hills that protrude upward into the ice may affect rates of basal motion. Leading models of drumlin growth predict that drumlins should function as so-called "sticky spots"&mdash;zones where basal drag is high, commonly inferred to be the result of locally strong till.

This conclusion has potential implications for how basal drag is treated in ice-sheet models, which in turn are one of the principal tools used to assess the  contribution of ice-sheet flow to sea-level rise.  This project has provided training for nine students and a postdoctoral researcher. Six undergraduates helped with the field work, three of whom did independent research projects at M&uacute;laj&ouml;kull. Three of these undergraduates have begun graduate research in the geosciences, and the other three are still working on their undergraduate degrees. Also, the project made possible the thesis research of three graduate students&mdash;all of whom finished their masterÆs degrees over the past year. These stud...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
