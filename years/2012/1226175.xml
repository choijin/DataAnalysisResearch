<AbstractNarration>This project expands the pedagogy of Application-Based Service-Learning (ABSL) from its focus in western Pennsylvania to eight institutions in Pennsylvania, Ohio, and New York.  This pedagogy uses five practices documented as having a high impact on student learning: learning communities, writing-intensive courses, collaborative projects, undergraduate research, and service learning.  Through ABSL all these practices are incorporated into courses in which students address a community-based problem, such as the possibility that feral cats carry pathogenic microbes, or that areas impacted by mining or manufacturing practices might have altered water quality or issues associated with their redevelopment for other uses.  As part of their course work, students collect samples to bring back to their classes for study, and their findings are shared not only within the class but with other ABSL classes and the community at large.  In addition to honing their scientific expertise, students learn important skills in written and oral communication and leadership. This project is being jointly funded by the Directorate for Biological Sciences and the Directorate for Education and Human Resources, Division of Undergraduate Education as part of their efforts toward Vision and Change in Undergraduate Biology Education.</AbstractNarration>
