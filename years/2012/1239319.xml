<AbstractNarration>This project is to develop a dynamical systems model of distributed computation motivated from recent work on the distributed computation of averages. The key idea is that static optimization problems (particularly convex optimization problems) can be solved by designing a dynamic system that stabilizes around the optimal solution of the problem. Moreover, when the optimization problem is separable, then the designed dynamic system decomposes into a set of locally-interacting dynamic systems. This is expected to open a door to a host of new computational approaches that take advantage of recent developments in control engineering including robust control (providing a mechanism for errors introduced by discretization), Markovian Jump Linear Systems (providing a mechanism for random discretization time), event-driven control (providing a mechanism for assured asynchronous execution), control over networks (providing a mechanism for improved performance of distributed computational systems in general). The new approach is essential in emerging applications, where the optimization runs on physically separated agents, operating in a noisy environment and communicating over unreliable channels.  As a test bed, the project will make use of a two-vehicle robotic system developed by the PI designed to monitor a crop of corn plants, where the dynamic systems perspective of this grant will, for example, allow for distributed optimal estimation toward the goal of optimal station-keeping.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By studying how natural systems can collectively compute and optimize, this research has potential to impact many disciplines involving networked systems, from controlling the electric power grid, to modeling the behavior of social, biological or economic systems.  It is directly applicable to cooperative networked multi-agent systems like robotic search and rescue missions and disaster-relief operations, distributed machine learning problems, and intelligent systems. An intriguing mix of motivating applications and theoretical problems offer a unique multidisciplinary educational opportunity to students who will be involved in the project, and provide exciting innovative material for courses and labs. Software developed will be distributed as open source via the CPS Virtual Organization.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Networked cyber physical systems often need to cooperatively perform control, estimation, optimization, or computational tasks with limited computational, power, and communication resources.  The distributed nature of such systems and the limited capability of the single subsystems (nodes or agents) force them to cooperate by exchanging information on the network, through alternative physical sensing and through their interaction with the environment. The information exchange is limited by the structure of the network, the nature of the interactions, and by various sources of uncertainty (e.g., noisy channels, packet drops, delays), but also by sensors? and actuators? limitations and unpredictable environment changes.  The main objective of this project has been to develop analysis and design methods for cooperative multi-agent systems over unreliable communication networks, and to develop new dynamical models of cooperative computing systems integrated with the physical dynamics of the networked systems.  The research conducted under this grant lead to the following main outcomes.  We have demonstrated how intermittent communication among computing/dynamical systems can lead to system fragility and to complex behavior in networked systems.  This result provides new insight into the possible mechanisms that lead to complex, unpredictable and unsafe behavior in networked systems.  We derived novel algorithms for solving distributed optimization problems resilient to typical communication uncertainty.  These algorithms allow for designing better networks of cooperative sensors, among other applications. In particular, we have developed novel networked distributed solvers of systems of linear equations resilient to communication noise. This is an important problem in science and engineering.  We have devised a continuous-time dynamical system that can solve Optimal Power Flow  (OPF) problems in a new distributed fashion at the electric bus level.   The OPF is an important problem that needs to be solved to maximize the efficiency of the power transmission grid.  We have provided conditions for checking the global optimality of the solution that generalizes existing ones. We have extended the approach and result to a large class of computationally challenging optimization problems that emerge in various engineering contexts.  We have developed a new controller design methodology applicable when the controller must act over unreliable communication networks.  The method also provides the limit of performance achievable for a given quality of service of the communication links, enabling more efficient joint design of the communication network and the control systems. The methodology extends to networked systems   the well-established linear quadratic optimal control design method and it is computationally efficient.     We have developed cyber physical system test-beds involving autonomous quadrotor control, micro-quadrotor swarm, and cooperative aerial and ground robotic platform, that have enabled education and research activities involving undergraduate and graduate students.
