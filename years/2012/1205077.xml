<AbstractNarration>The National Center for Convergence Technology (CTC) builds upon its partnership with businesses and educational institutions in North Texas and the network of partner and mentored colleges developed as a regional center.  The reach of the National Center is expanded to at least sixty community colleges nationwide by working through five partner colleges that mentor community colleges in their geographic region to implement high-demand convergence degree and certificate programs in the emerging technologies associated with the networking IT infrastructure, including mentoring feeder high school and four-year university programs in a 2+2+2 pathway.  The regional Business Industry Leadership Team (BILT) is expanded nationally to provide job task analyses to guide the nationwide network of community colleges to prepare their students for high-wage, high-demand jobs in IT infrastructure including mobile networks, cloud computing, mobile device integration, storage and network virtualization, and video integration. These are all expansions of convergence technology: voice, video, image, and data over a secure network.  The Center provides e-books and interactive on-line tools to support delivery of courses and professional development of faculty.  The Center focuses on increasing the number of degree/ certificate completers ready to meet workforce needs and on implementing nationally-known best practices for recruiting, retaining, and graduating underserved students.  A set of stackable certifications is created to expand career potential and allow for rapid reemployment.  An evaluation measures the effectiveness of the Center in developing mentored colleges that implement courses and programs that provide regional business with workplace ready employment candidates that have content skills to meet the latest changes in the industry as well as employability skills that ensure effective workplace behavior.  The evaluation also measures the effectiveness of the professional development of faculty and the content knowledge and employability skills of the students.   The methodologies include gathering numbers data, interviews, and surveys of students, faculty and BILT members.</AbstractNarration>

Seven schools presented pilot project evidence to their administration and six of those seven administrations planned to adopt their "Diversity Summit" strategies long-term going forward.

While 37% (40) of the presentations involved sharing the strategies and benefits of the BILT model, the CTC also presented on a wide range of topics, including stackable certificates, communities of practice, grant funding, student portfolios, recruiting and retention strategies, and IT technical topics and trends.<br /><br />Through a supplemental called the Centers Collaborative for Technical Assistance, five centers collaborated to provide technical assistance on key topics to DOL and NSF grantees through 37 webinars, 13 short videos, and 13 best practice summary documents.&nbsp; Over

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The National Convergence Technology Center (DUE 1205077) strengthened information technology and convergence networking infrastructure certificate and degree programs at colleges across the country by identifying and disseminating relevant resources and curriculum on emerging IT topics and trends.  This work was co-led by the CTC's National Business and Industry Leadership Team (BILT) consisting of 51 BILT members from over 40 organizations.  The BILT convened quarterly to provide expert co-leadership to accomplish grant goals.   The BILT used a unique and efficient voting system to provide a comprehensive, annual update of entry-level IT job skills they wanted to see in workforce ready graduates in the future.  These job skills updates help colleges better align their curriculum with employer needs.  The CTC's collaboration with the BILT and other resources were shared through a mesh network of community colleges and universities called the Convergence College Network (CCN) that grew from 25 colleges in 13 states in January 2013 to 73 colleges in 28 states.  The CCN is a robust community of practice, meeting quarterly in person and online to collectively solve shared problems and exchange know-how on a variety of technical and organizational topics.   The BILT also helped identify cutting-edge content for CTC's Working Connections faculty professional development events.  During the grant period, 23 Working Connections events were held, both on-line and in person, in four different states (Florida, Michigan, Texas, and Wisconsin) for 1238 duplicated attendees covering 57 technical and pedagogical topics.  Working Connections taught faculty attendees cutting-edge IT topics to be delivered to students in the next 12 months, either as a new course or as a supplement to an existing course.   All of this work involved collaboration with other ATE Centers and Projects including BATEC, CSSIA, The ICT Center, IWITTS, and MPICT.  NCWIT also collaborated on increasing women in IT.  Intellectual Merit: The National CTC built on the success of its previous regional ATE Regional Center grant.  CTC expanded its CCN to 73 colleges, officially creating new connections of collaboration and communication between faculty and administrators at these colleges across the country.  This work included the expansion of the CTC BILT's annual update process for entry-level IT job skills to other colleges, both in IT and other disciplines.  Working Connections (WC) professional development events also delivered totally new IT topics to faculty across the country. An average of 75% of WC attendees chose a topic they were not currently teaching, thereby delivering to the classroom a host of new skills.  Broader Impact: The National CTC focused on boosting recruiting, retaining, and completing underserved populations through a variety of initiatives, the most comprehensive of which was the "Diversity Summit" initiative.  Ten colleges sent teams (counselor, administrator, and faculty member) to a two-day event to learn best practices from national experts on recruiting and retaining underserved populations (especially women). "Diversity Summit" teams developed customized action plans of strategies to implement at their home school that included plans for tracking evidence of success so school administrations could be persuaded to continue the work after CTC grant support ended. Six schools reported success in meeting their goals and/or improving the institutional climate to better support diversity in recruiting and retention.

The CTC also helped expand the popularity and reach of virtual labs, which allow students 24/7 online access to IT lab exercises as an alternative to coming to campus in person during specific lab hours.  From fall 2015 to summer 2019, 7754 students at eleven CCN colleges and universities used the virtual labs.  Two of those schools leveraged their successful experience into convincing administrators to purchase the equipment directly for their students.  All of the CTC's best practices and resources were shared online via blog posts, social media engagement, and website tools.  CTC staff also disseminated via in-person presentations.
