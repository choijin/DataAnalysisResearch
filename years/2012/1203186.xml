<AbstractNarration>This project is jointly funded by the Electronic and Photonic Materials Program (EPM) in the Division of Materials Research (DMR) and the Energy, Power, and Adaptive Systems Program (EPAS) in the Division of Electrical, Communications and Cyber Systems (ECCS).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Description: Efficient optoelectronic active materials, based on confined germanium quantum dots and germanium/silicon quantum wires, promise enhanced photoconversion mechanisms useful for chip-compatible photodetectors and solar cells with broadband absorption. This project focuses on two interrelated classes of optoelectronic materials and devices: (1) a close-packed array of Ge quantum dots for high-efficiency photodetectors and (2) Ge/Si heteronanowires for tandem solar cells. Materials properties of Ge quantum dots (such as concentration, crystallinity and surface passivation) are directly correlated to optoelectronic functionalities and optimized to improve the photodetection speed while retaining high responsivity. The response time and gain mechanisms are studied using time-resolved measurements as well as theoretical modeling of charging and inter-quantum-dot hopping. For the second class of materials and devices, the Ge/Si nanowires are grown using the vapor-liquid-solid technique to overcome lattice mismatch limitations. The transport and optical response of individual heteronanowires are correlated with nanowire diameter, length, doping and composition, and are used to predict the collective behavior of dense nanowire arrays with improved spectral coverage and reduced reflectivity. Simulations are performed to match the short-circuit currents in the Ge and Si sections in order to achieve enhanced photoconversion efficiency.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Non-technical Description: This research project is on light-matter interactions in germanium-based nanostructures, including quantum dots and quantum wires. These nanostructures combine attractive physical properties enabled by more efficient light-matter interaction at the nanoscale. Specifically, the project seeks to use these nanomaterials for higher-efficiency photodetectors and broadband solar cells. The research has educational impact in and out of the classroom at Brown University. It includes long-term collaboration between faculty and graduate students at Brown University and scientists at the Los Alamos National Laboratory, on nanowire growth. Undergraduates also work on parts of the research. In addition, solar energy-based K-12 outreach activities are expanded and local high-school students participate in laboratory summer research.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ NSF-1203186: Outcomes  Germanium nanostructures for efficient silicon-compatible optoelectronics   Advances in the fabrication of germanium (Ge) nanostructures &ndash; either quantum dots or sections of quantum wires in which electrons are confined in two or three dimensions on the sub-50 nm length scale and therefore exhibit quantization effects &ndash; are enabling novel optoelectronic devices that retain compatibility with the dominant silicon (Si) technology.  In this project, we focused on two related but different classes of devices: photodetectors made from Ge quantum dots in an oxide matrix on top of Si and SiGe hetero-nanowire solar cells.  The photodetector thrust resulted in devices with high internal gain and therefore excellent sensitivity and noise performance for detecting radiation in the technologically relevant visible to near-infrared wavelength range.  The solar cell thrust resulted in Si nanowire solar cell arrays grown from dense arrays of metal seeds patterned by nanoimprint lithography that our simulations show would outperform standard thick Si wafer solar cells despite being orders of magnitude thinner and lighter, once the array pitch goes below 300 nm.      Intellectual merit: The key intellectual outcomes of this research project concerned the unexpectedly high performance of Ge quantum dot photodetectors as well as dense nanoimprinted nanowire solar cell arrays.  We have produced co-sputtered Ge quantum dot photodetector layers with a responsivity above 1 A/W at low bias and nearing 4 A/W at higher 10 V bias over the 400&ndash;1100 nm wavelength range.  These detectors have high internal gain, which we attribute to quantum dot charging by long-lived holes that promotes electron hopping through the quantum dot matrix, and relatively short response time (down to 40 ns).  They also exhibit excellent noise performance, with detectivity reaching 6&times;1012 cmHz1/2W&minus;1, comparable to or higher than commercially available Si and other experimental photodetectors working in the same spectral range.  In the solar cell array arena, we combined nanoimprint lithography with Si nanowire epitaxy (at NIST) to produce ultra-dense axial p-i-n Si nanowire solar cells with 8% external quantum efficiency &ndash; a promising result for nanowire solar cells and with a clear path towards higher performance by increasing the nanowire density further, as confirmed by finite-difference-time-domain simulations.  Even better results are predicted for heteronanowires integrating a Ge section.  Finally, the fabrication of Ge quantum dot layers generated an offshoot research project into the reflectance of ultrathin Ge films (down to 2 nm thickness), where we developed a modified Cody plot procedure capable of accurately characterizing the optical bandgap of ultrathin superlattices.     Broader impact: The main research thrust sponsored by this award has made a contribution to the silicon technology-compatible photodetector field.  There is a great deal of interest in integrating optical communication on-chip, which requires hybrid integration of optical sources (lasers or light-emitting diodes), modulators, optical waveguides, and cheap, responsive photodetectors &ndash; our work has highlighted one of the possible photodetector technologies that combines easy of fabrication with high performance.  The second project sponsored by this award has made initial progress on the dense nanowire solar cell array front as a potentially light and flexible high-performance photovoltaic source, but here follow-up research involving denser arrays of heteronanowires is urgently needed.    Finally, the research support has led to the graduation of three PhD students (all of whom remain in semiconductor device R&amp;D field in the US: Pei Liu, fully supported by this award, is with Globalfoundries in Malta, NY; Son T. Le and Peng Zhang, partially supported by this award, are respectively with NIST, Gaithersburg, MD and Sandisk in San Jose, CA) and got a fourth PhD student (Stylianos Siontas) started on the path to the PhD, co-advised by the PIs.  In addition, a woman undergraduate (Abigail Plummer) worked for a summer on nanoimprint lithography and has now moved to a PhD program at Harvard, supported by a prestigious Astronaut fellowship.
