<AbstractNarration>This award provides funding for a new Computing Research Infrastructure (CRI) project focused on acquisition of a LiDAR scanner, a GPS unit, and an omnidirectional video camera to collect indoor and outdoor 3D positional data and imagery at George Mason University (GMU). Several research and educational opportunities will be enabled by the requested infrastructure. The intellectual merit of this project revolves around enabling research on several CISE research fields at GMU, including three-dimensional (3D) mapping for robotic navigation and manipulation, semantic parsing, motion planning and visibility-based tracking under significant environmental uncertainties. The equipment also provides data sources for studying and evaluating important geometric algorithms under significant sensor uncertainties including data compression, scene segmentation, and object recognition. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this project, beyond enabling research in robotic navigation and manipulation, include support for research in other disciplines, and education. The new infrastructure will also enable multidisciplinary research teams at GMU to conduct research on important problems in homeland security, home and factory automation, disaster recovery, and environmental and infrastructure monitoring; and lead to enhanced research collaboration with other institutions. Research results, collected and processed geometric data, and software developed using this instrumentation will be made available to the wider research community. With strong institution support from GMU, the acquisition has sustainable management and maintenance plans to support STEM programs for underserved communities at GMU, activities in undergraduate and graduate courses and independent studies in robotics, computer vision, geometric computing, computer game design and GIS, and will help spawn student learning and interest in these cutting-edge technology areas.</AbstractNarration>

This project provided training and hand-on experience to process large amount of geometric data via commercial software tools. This project created many research collaboration activities within the Department of Computer Science. These collaboration activities include computer science related topics, such as semantic visual parsing, shape understanding via new 3D shape descriptors, shape segmentation, motion planning and visibility-based tracking under significant environmental uncertainties, three-dimension (3D) mapping for robotic navigation and manipulation. The proposed infrastructure has also enhanced the collaborations between the departments at GMU, include the departments of Computer Science, Geography, and Data science. 3D landscape analysis for geographic information systems (GIS). These collaborations included outdoor and indoor architecture reconstruction for simulation on transportation of pollutants and emergency responses evacuation. Eight top journal and conference papers and one thesis were published as a direct result of the project. The point cloud data collected by this developed system was used for projects beyond the original plans, such as reconstruction of road geometry for physically-based vehicle simulation. The acquired LiDAR systems have also inspired the researchers at GMU to develop a low-cost, sustainable and customizable platform to provide lifelong mobility assistance in both indoor and outdoor spaces for people with disability.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 07/24/2017<br>      Modified by: Jyh-Ming&nbsp;Lien</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1205260/1205260_10181297_1500903826736_LiDAR-3--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1205260/1205260_10181297_1500903826736_LiDAR-3--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Reconstructed 3D data"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1205260/1205260_10181297_1500903826736_LiDAR-3--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Reconstructed 3D data"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Reconstructed 3D point cloud obtained from the LiDAR system.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Lado Tonia</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Jyh-Ming&nbsp;Lien</div> <div class="imageTitle">Reconstructed 3D data</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1205260/1205260_10181297_1500903604451_LiDAR-4--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1205260/1205260_10181297_1500903604451_LiDAR-4--rgov-800width.jpg" title="LiDAR on a Power Wheelchair"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1205260/1205260_10181297_1500903604451_LiDAR-4--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="LiDAR on a Power Wheelchair"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">A photo from an indoor scanning session in the Engineering Building on George Mason University Fairfax campus.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Michael Burghold</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Jyh-Ming&nbsp;Lien</div> <div class="imageTitle">LiDAR on a Power Wheelchair</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1205260/1205260_10181297_1500903775893_LiDAR-2--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1205260/1205260_10181297_1500903775893_LiDAR-2--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Reconstructed 3D data"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1205260/1205260_10181297_1500903775893_LiDAR-2--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Reconstructed 3D data"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Reconstructed 3D point cloud obtained from the LiDAR system.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Lado Tonia</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Jyh-Ming&nbsp;Lien</div> <div class="imageTitle">Reconstructed 3D data</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1205260/1205260_10181297_1500903325905_LiDAR-system--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1205260/1205260_10181297_1500903325905_LiDAR-system--rgov-800width.jpg" title="LiDAR on a Golf Cart"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1205260/1205260_10181297_1500903325905_LiDAR-system--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="LiDAR on a Golf Cart"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Photo of the LiDAR system on a Golf Cart from a scanning session to capture the entire George Mason Fairfax Campus.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Jyh-Ming Lien</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Public Domain</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Jyh-Ming&nbsp;Lien</div> <div class="imageTitle">LiDAR on a Golf Cart</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
