<AbstractNarration>This Pan-American Advanced Studies Institutes (PASI), jointly supported by the NSF and the Department of Energy (DOE), will take place in La Serena, Chile, in 2013.  Dr. Christopher Scott (University of Arizona) will be joined in the organizing committee by scientists from Chile and the Inter-American Institute for Global Change Research.  The institute will focus on developing a cadre of multidisciplinary scientists with conceptual understanding, skills and tools to address the inter-linkage of water resources (primarily freshwater) and energy (electrical power and biofuels).  Regions experiencing scarcity of freshwater and inadequate availability of energy are especially vulnerable to global change.  The interrelationship between water and energy raises challenges for policy and planning.  This PASI will provide participants with diagnostic skills and water and energy co-management tools that maintain or increase resource-use productivity while enhancing adaptation outcomes.  Foci will be on tailoring new tools such as resource and efficiency inventories, analytical and computational models, and stakeholder engagement methods.  The PASI will train young researchers, agency personnel, and non-governmental organization staff.  The objectives are to provide participants with diagnostic skills and water and energy co-management tools that maintain or increase resource-use productivity while enhancing adaptation outcomes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This PASI will introduce U.S. students to many important techniques in the above subjects.  The PASI will also strengthen a regional knowledge network within the Americas for the inclusion of adaptive management principles in water and energy decision-making.  Participants will gain hands-on experience working with models in interaction with decision-makers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ With support from the U.S. National Science FoundationÃ†s Pan-American   Advanced Studies Institutes, a team led by Dr. Christopher Scott of the University of Arizona conducted a ten-day training for 28 early-career scientists and practitioners from across the Americas. Participants received hands-on analytical tools to address water and energy challenges, especially to address the water needs of electricity and biofuels energy development, and conversely the energy needs of water management (pumping, water treatment, etc.).  The training was held June 24 - July 3, 2013 in La Seren, Chile, under the   auspices of the AQUASEC Center of Excellence for Water Security.  AQUASEC  is a collaborative initiative of the University of Arizona,   Inter-American Institute for Global Change Research, Pontifical Catholic   University of Chile, Water Center for Arid and Semiarid Zones of Latin   America and the Caribbean, Stockholm Environment Institute, and the   International Hydrology Program of UNESCO, among others.  Intellectual Merit: The 10-day course was designed to advance conceptual and practical   training on Adaptive Water-Energy Management in the Arid Americas. The   training involved advanced conceptual and practical training by   international experts in the use and adoption of tools to address   linkages between water resources and conventional and non-conventional   energy, and interdisciplinary physical and social science approaches to   water and energy joint management. The Water Evaluation and Planning   System (WEAP) and Long-range Energy Alternatives Planning (LEAP) models   were used to strengthen diagnostic skills and support integrated   policy and co-management of water and energy.  Broader Impact: The project aimed to strengthen water and energy security through   joint management in the context of adaption to global change in the Arid   Americas.  Specific activities included the following:  Provide participants with tools to evaluate potential impacts of   energy development on water resources and energy demands associated with   water use; Integrate hydrological, climatic, social and economic development analyses; Enhance management options for energy and water sectors; Promote the use of decision-making tools in the management of water and energy under conditions of uncertainty; and Develop a regional knowledge network of experts in joint energy-water management.   Organizers included:  AQUASEC &ndash; Center of Excellence for Water Security  Christopher Scott, University of Arizona, USA Francisco Meza, Pontificia Universidad Cat&oacute;lica de Chile Sebastian Vicu&ntilde;a,Pontificia Universidad Cat&oacute;lica de Chile, Elma Monta&ntilde;a, Universidad Nacional Cuyo, CONICET, Argentina http://aquasec.org/   Inter-American Institute for Global Change Research (IAI)   Holm Tiessen, Director Marcella Ohira, Assistant Director for Capacity Building  Mariana Toledo, Assistant Capacity Building Division  http://www.iai.int   CAZALAC &ndash; Water Center for Arid and Semiarid Zones of Latin America and the Caribbean    Jorge Nu&ntilde;ez, Project Coordinator http://www.cazalac.org   Stockholm Environment Institute    Francisco Flores http://www.sei-us.org/   UNESCO &ndash; Hydrological Systems &amp; Global Change Section Division of Water Sciences -Natural Sciences Sector   Koen Verbist  http://www.unesco.org/new/en/santiago/home/      Outcomes:  The program imparted indepth, interdisciplinary, and hands-on training. The participants themselves achieved a remarkable degree of group integration, team spirit, and constructive engagement with trainers and local Chilean stakeholders who were invited to share water and energy challenges. Multiple outputs in the form of papers for peer-reviewed publication, websites and blogs, etc. resulted from the project.  Given that this is a training grant, all activities centered on skills building and capacity development. Additionally, because all participants were early-career s...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
