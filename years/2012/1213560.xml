<AbstractNarration>In this award, funded by the Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program of the Division of Chemistry, Professor Gordon Brown of Coker College and his undergraduate student researchers will be supported to study the intermolecular bonding in: (1)  van der Waals complexes between carbon dioxide and nitrogen heterocycles and (2) complexes between halogen-containing small molecules and Lewis bases.  The researchers will study these species with chirped-pulse Fourier transform microwave spectroscopy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Microwave spectroscopy is an important physical chemical method that gives precise information about molecular geometry and binding.  The classes of species that Professor Brown and his students will study will provide information on potential carbon-capture/storage materials as well as fundamental information about the intermolecular interactions between halogen-containing species.  The undergraduate students working on this project will gain useful experience in conducting physical chemical research with state-of-the-art equipment, and will be well-prepared for further study in the chemical sciences.</AbstractNarration>
