<AbstractNarration>Three-dimensional integrated circuits (3D-ICs) using through-silicon vias (TSVs) is an important new technology that overcomes barriers in interconnect scaling.  It provides significant advantages including increased functional density, higher performance, and lower power.  This research project will explore new ideas, concepts, and directions for test and repair of 3D-ICs which hold promise to significantly reduce test costs and improve yield.  The ability to select which dies/wafers are stacked together and in what order and with what rotational symmetry are degrees of freedom in constructing 3D-ICs that can be exploited.  New strategies for using this to reduce the cost and increase the effectiveness of defect tolerance techniques will be investigated.  To reduce test costs, new distributed test compression architectures will be developed which create a new paradigm for test scheduling enabling much greater flexibility and efficiency to shorten test time and improve product quality.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; This research project will generate new theory, concepts, and techniques for significantly improving test costs and yield for 3D-ICs.  This is a key factor for keeping down the manufacturing costs of 3D chips and allowing them to penetrate new markets and benefit society.  Knowledge and experience generated from this project will be incorporated into courses in VLSI design and test.  Students will be trained and prepared for the next generation semiconductor workforce.  Undergraduate students will be involved in the project, including those from underrepresented groups, through undergraduate research projects, senior design projects, and course projects based on this research.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ A major challenge for three-dimensional integrated circuits (3D-ICs) is increasing yield and reducing test costs.  The goal of this project was to investigate and develop new techniques and strategies for improving test and repair of 3D-ICs.  The work in this project has contributed techniques to reduce the cost and improve the effectiveness of defect tolerance for 3D-ICs to improve their yield by using the degree of freedom in ordering and rotating the die in the stack.  A technique for reducing the cost of repairing 3D stacked memories by providing an asymmetric layer repair capability was developed.  The idea is to design the repair circuitry so that it costs less to repair defects on some layers at the cost of making it more expensive to repair defects on other layers.  This can be exploited when constructing a 3D IC by placing the most defective die in the layers where the cost of repair is lower.  By careful ordering of die in the stack, it was shown that the overall yield achieved for a given level of redundancy could be significantly improved.  Another focus of the project has been on reducing test costs in 3D-ICs through improved test compression techniques.  By more efficiently compressing test data, it can be transported more quickly to different parts of the 3D-IC thereby reducing test time which in turn reduces test costs and allows more thorough testing to be performed to improve product quality.  Several new strategies for test compression in 3D-ICs were developed including a daisy-chained distributed test architecture which can reduce the number of test elevators between die in the stack while significantly improving overall compression.  Other new techniques included retaining non-pivot free variables during linear coding, using a scan feedforward methodology during decompression, and implementing test compression in software running on an embedded processor that is already present as part of the functional design.  Another challenge for test compression is dealing with unknown values in the output response which corrupts signatures.  A new architecture that uses a combination of masking and canceling of unknowns during output compaction was developed and shown to be very efficient.  Moreover, a methodology for using this architecture to exploit the high degree of correlation in the location of unknowns which is typically present in most designs was developed as well.  Both undergraduate and graduate students participated in the project and were trained with state-of-the-art tools while gaining valuable research experience looking at cutting-edge issues.  Two Ph.D. students have graduated and are employed by US-based companies, and two more are in the last year of their Ph.D.              Last Modified: 09/05/2016       Submitted by: Nur A Touba]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
