<AbstractNarration>The aim of the first part of the project is to redevelop Kirchberg WEP and QWEP theory over a coefficient algebra. The staring point is a detailed analysis of the scalar theory and a suitable adaption of the operator-valued version using tensor norms. The second part of the project concerns improved martingale inequalities for continuous time filtrations which has applications to semigroup theory and is related to problems in compressed sensing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the aims of this proposal is to combine cutting edge research in mathematics with experimental research in Quantum Information Theory. Although still in a developing phase  Quantum Information Theory can become an important tool in providing secure keys for communication. Some aspects of this proposal are concerned with the theoretical background calculating the security rates and quantum advantages. As long as testing quantum computers is difficult, the theoretical approach has to take the lead in exploring possibilities and constraints.  This work is highly interdisciplinary (experimental physics and computer science) and has the potential to make contribution to more secure information through the use of quantum mechanical tools. In this information based society this can become relevant.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ One of the motivations of Murray and von Neumann to develop the theory of operator algebras was to provide a solid mathematical foundation of quantum mechanics. Operator algebra theory has evolved dramatically over the last decades and now provides the foundation for new areas such as noncommutative geometry and quantum probability. In fact any mathematical theory which is interested in quantization and analysis should consult operator algebra theory.    A fascinating line of research in operator algebra theoryhas incorporated important mathematical concepts from Grothendieck's work on tensor norms. Although abstract in nature Grothendieck's program for operator algebras seems to lead to the right questions on approximation, and to a wealth of applications.     A major outcome of this work is the connection between Grothendieck's work and Shannon's notion of capacity for noisy channels. Using the a functorial approach (inspired by Grothendieck) it is discovered that the capacity rate of transmitting bits per use of channel corresponds exactly to capacity rate of qubits per use of quantum channels with unlimited assisted entanglement. This `translation process' even carries over to so-called Renyi-capacities which approach the actual capacity in the limit.      Many natural resources, such as fiber glass, have properties of quantum channels. Quantum channels usually exploit quantum mechanical properties to transmit information, just as noisy channels serve as a model to transmit information in Shannon's theory. The research performed during this project demonstrates that operator algebraic and functional analytic tools can successfully be used to obtain a better understanding of capacity and locality in quantum information theory.   On first sight the connection between operator algebras and classical harmonic analysis appears to be less obvious than the connection between operator algebras and quantum information theory. However, many classical tools in harmonic analysis such as probability and ergodic theory have been extended to the quantized setting for quite some time. A major achievement during the funding period of this grant consists in building the foundation in martingale theory, ergodic theory  and noncommutative function spaces which will enable the P.I. and his collaborators to perform harmonic analysis on noncommutative spaces. First results on convergence of non- commutative Fourier series have already been obtained, but there is still more to do.

A significant portion of the P.I.'s conference contribution were given to researchers from a variety of backgrounds. The same impression is conveyed in seminar activity for graduate students, and supported summer activity.  The impact of NSF funding for activities related to the core  research activity can not be overestimated, also in terms of diversity. Buildng the workforce for the 21-th century should include the training of mathematics stundents in different fields with a clear idea of the strength and weakness.
