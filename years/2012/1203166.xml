However, far less attention has been paid to "what works." What is distinctive about how couples in lasting relationships? How do they conceptualize and conduct their relationships? How do they develop attitudes and practices that facilitate enduring unions? This dissertation addresses these questions by comparing working- and middle-class black married couples. In doing so, the project shifts the focus towards how interpersonal relations, support networks and resources influence durability.  The project employs interviews with approximately 70 relationship experts and with couples, as well as observational data regarding the dynamics among couples as they tell their relationship stories.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;Family stability is a topic of interest to a broad set of stakeholders.  The general public, marriage professionals (counselors), as well as policy makers have expressed sustained interest in fostering an environment conducive to stabilizing families.  Findings from this study may inform public debate about these factors.  In addition, by focusing on strategies used by African American couples, this study seeks to complement extant work and contribute to our understanding of what helps relationships endure more generally.  Finally, insights from this research may enable us to formulate a range of "best practices" that can inform counseling and policy programs designed to foster an environment conducive to relationship longevity.</AbstractNarration>
