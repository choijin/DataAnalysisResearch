<AbstractNarration>This project provides infrastructure to support research concerning the investigation, design, and integration of reusable sensory-motor services that proactively monitor patient health status and provide flexible tools for intervention. The shortage of skilled allied healthcare professionals and their finite capacity prevents the continuous monitoring of patient vital statistics.  Leveraging an aging population?s preference to remain at home while managing chronic illness, this project enables research into the use of machine perception and sensory motor learning for recognition and intervention of degrading health status in a home care environment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigators are building a new infrastructure consisting of compute nodes, robotic platforms, sensing systems, and novel service framework for research and education in Machine Perception and Sensory Motor Learning for healthcare applications at Delaware State University.  By factoring perceptual systems and making them accessible services on the network, a robot becomes a virtual assemblage that recruits arbitrary resources at run-time.   Such service compositions provide a richer suite of perceptual and robotic services because it draws from the power-set of available sensory-motor apparatus.   Service compositions include methods, such as ensembles in machine learning, that construct high fidelity models for pattern learning by combining a number of simpler component models.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The infrastructure built from this project enables research in many areas, such as perceptual computing, robotics, and machine learning. The broader impact of the project includes more proactive tools for detection and intervention in healthcare and training of undergraduate and graduate students (including underrepresented students in STEM) in interdisciplinary research.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The shortage of skilled healthcare professionals and their finite capacity presents a practical imitation on the continuous monitoring of a patient's vital statistics. By leveraging increased availability of network connected sensors, an aging population may reduce cost while increasing quality of care by managing chronic illness at home.   Network accessible medical sensors in conjunction with mathematical models provide the eyes and ears that continually measure and access trends in patient health status.   Remotely operated robotic technologies provide the helping hands for making interventions in a patient's degrading health status.  Such tools satisfy an aging population's desire to remain at home to manage chronic illness and serves a dual benefit of increasing quality of care and reducing cost.  The principle investigator has successfully built a research infrastructure and capability that enables experimentation and prototype of new mathematical models for recognition of patient health status from medical sensors.  The principle investigator has also successfully integrated robotic technologies that serve as a platform for experimentation and prototype of algorithms for intervention in response to changes in patient health status.   The principle investigator has also developed a flexible distributed system framework that enables the construction of detection-and-intervention systems by assembling medical sensors, mathematical models, and robotic platforms as network accessible services.  Over the three-year period of performance, fifteen students have directly benefitted from the infrastructure through research training, design and execution of research experiments, and research mentoring.   The fifteen students consist of twelve underrepresented students in Science Technology Engineering and Mathematics (STEM).   This experience and training has resulted in student accomplishments of numerous awards, scholarships, and research publications.  A key outcome is a one hundred percent job placement rate for graduating undergraduate seniors.  The funded project has directly contributed to both increasing the US technical workforce and the number of underrepresented students in STEM.  Additionally, research from the project has been used in the classroom for two undergraduate courses (Systems Integration, Stochastic Computing) and one graduate course (Pattern Recognition) which are regular course offerings in the Department of Computer and Information Sciences at Delaware State University.  The resulting infrastructure and capability enabled by the funded project has also resulted in the principle investigator's successful pursuit of academic-industry partnerships that apply methods developed during the course of the project to industry problems.   These activities will positively impact growth in the US economy by transitioning research out of the academic research lab into the corporate enterprise resulting in increased corporate growth and hiring.  The principle investigator has developed an early prototype for a new software framework and approach that presents medical sensors, processes for pattern recognition, and robotic platforms as a network accessible services.  The principle investigator has also developed a new analytical method that has been demonstrated to be more effective in recognizing patterns in spectroscopy data-sets, specifically those where subtle differences matter.   These efforts have been published in the scientific research literature.  The impact of this new intellectual property has the potential of improving health care delivery for patients managing chronic illness in the home setting.    Results during the period of performance include a system that employs a humanoid robot as a tool for autism therapy.  The system guides a subject interactively in a Simon Says game.  This reinforces the subject's social interaction in addition to motor skills.   Additional results include a prototype servic...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
