<AbstractNarration>The funding from this grant will be used to support students and postdocs so they can attend the 2012 Multiphoton Processes Gordon Research Conference (the 16th in a series of biennial conferences), which will be held June 3-8, 2012 at the Mount Holyoke College in South Hadley, MA. This international conference is well-established, yet continuing advances in atomic, molecular, optical, and chemical (AMOC) science and related technology preserve its vibrancy. The 2012 meeting is structured around contributed posters and 8 sessions of invited talks that will focus on topics at the forefront of AMOC science including:  High Harmonic Spectroscopy; Attosecond Electron Dynamics; ATI and Photoelectrons; Strong Field Processes and Sources; Photoionization delay; X-Ray Imaging; and Free-Electron Laser Experiment and Theory.  The broad range of expertise and perspectives among attendees provides a unique and stimulating environment for the development of new ideas in these rapidly evolving areas.</AbstractNarration>

In designing the formal speakers program, emphasis was placed on current unpublished research and discussion of the future target areas in this field. There was a conscious effort to stimulate lively discussion about the key issues in the field today. Time for formal presentations was limited in the interest of group discussions. In order that more scientists could communicate their most recent results, poster presentation time was scheduled. Attached is a copy of the formal schedule and speaker program and the poster program. In addition to these formal interactions, "free time" was scheduled to allow informal discussions. Such discussions are fostering new collaborations and joint efforts in the field.          Thank you for your support of this Conference. As you know, in the interest of promoting the presentation of unpublished and frontier-breaking research, Gordon Research Conferences does not permit publication of meeting proceedings.
