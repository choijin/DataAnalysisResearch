<AbstractNarration>This project supports students to attend the Ninth Annual IEEE Communications Society&lt;br/&gt;Conference on Sensor, Mesh, and Ad Hoc Communications and Networks (SECON 2012) to be&lt;br/&gt;held in Seoul, South Korea in June 2012. SECON is a premier conference in the areas of sensor, ad&lt;br/&gt;hoc, and mesh networking, serving as a meeting point of researchers from academia and industry,&lt;br/&gt;as well as practitioners in diverse fields of wireless communications and networking. This project&lt;br/&gt;supports travel to the conference for US based graduate students who might not otherwise be able&lt;br/&gt;to attend for financial reasons. Students will be exposed to the conference, a technical forum that&lt;br/&gt;is critical for their professional maturity and development. Students will also be involved in various&lt;br/&gt;activities and work as volunteers to support these activities, increasing their level of involvement&lt;br/&gt;and connection to the conference and the research community.</AbstractNarration>
