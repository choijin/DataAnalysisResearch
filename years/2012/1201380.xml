<AbstractNarration>This project focuses on topics in Extremal Combinatorics, which investigate the relationships between useful parameters of discrete systems, and characterizes their extreme values over various families of those systems.  Such problems often have applications in Computer Science and other areas of Mathematics, but are also elegant and interesting in their own right.  The goal of this project is to further develop the toolbox of available approaches for attacking Combinatorial problems.  This goal will be achieved by studying certain families of problems which can be organized according to the methods used in their solutions. First, we examine applications of analytical (continuous) arguments to discrete problems.  Second, we study extremal problems related to set systems.  Finally, we explore the application of probabilistic methods to purely deterministic problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The field of combinatorics encompasses the rigorous mathematical study of discrete structures and processes, such as sets, networks, and even algorithms.  In the past, combinatorial problems were often solved by pure ingenuity. Today, however, a variety of powerful methods have emerged, which draw elements from many other branches of the mathematical sciences.  At the same time, the rapid development of Computer Science has substantially increased the demand for foundational results on discrete systems--these can provide the theoretical basis for future work.  The overarching objective of this project is to use a problem-driven philosophy to inspire innovations in the development of new techniques in Combinatorics.  Unifying the problems in this study is a theme of simple, elegant statements that inspire approaches which arise from across the mathematical spectrum.  Consequently, these problems also serve well as a platform for bringing young people into research.</AbstractNarration>

In addition to producing new research results, the PI mentored numerous students at both graduate and undergraduate levels, as well as two post-docs, assisting all at various stages of their professional development.  The PI widely disseminated the results by giving 36 research talks throughout the world, from major universities such as Stanford and MIT, to regional centers such as the University of Memphis, to far-reaching places such as international conferences in Beijing and the United Kingdom.  The PI was also heavily involved in outreach activities at the K-12 level, from coaching his local middle school's math team to serving as the national lead coach of the USA Math Olympiad team.  He makes it a point to combine his frequent research conference/collaboration travel with visits to local high schools, where he holds events to popularize mathematics.  All of these activities are helping to develop the future pipeline for STEM talent.  In addition, as the director of the national Math Olympiad Summer Program, the PI has transformed what was previously a pure high school math camp into a vertically integrated long-term enrichment program.  He managed its relocation to Carnegie Mellon University in 2015, where it plugged in to the full university's infrastructure, broadening the possibilities for enrichment.
