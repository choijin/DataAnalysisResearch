<AbstractNarration>The goal of this project is to improve understanding of how tropical convective systems influence high latitude Southern Hemisphere (SH) climate anomalies on seasonal, El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO), and anthropogenic change time scales.  Sensitivity of SH atmospheric structures to tropical forcing will be examined through observational analysis and a new modeling strategy.  The following hypothesis will be tested:  SH atmospheric structures are sensitive to the location and timing of outflow from deep convection in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere (UTLS), and  this modulation depends on season, phase of ENSO, and longer-term trends. A novel technique that avoids the complexity of modeling tropical convection by representing tropical convective anomalies with meridional outflow perturbations in the SH subtropical UTLS will be utilized in the study.  Monthly mean and ENSO mean basic states for the present (from global analyses) and for 2100 AD (from climate model forecasts) will be used as boundary conditions for ensembles of simulations with the University of Wisconsin Nonhydrostatic Modeling System (UWNMS).     &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An important component of this work is to integrate what is known about coupling between the tropics and Antarctica for dissemination to the public via images and text on a dedicated website. This outreach activity will help educate the public regarding how the tropics and Antarctica are coupled on seasonal, ENSO, and anthropogenic global change time scales.  This work will also help reduce uncertainty in seasonal ENSO forecasts for Antarctica and future climate simulations.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work has the potential to  improve seasonal forecasting of the influence of ENSO on Antarctica, via a careful analysis of ENSO and Antarctic surface data and high resolution UWNMS simulations.  This work will also improve our understanding of teleconnections and provide climatological descriptions of the relationship among subtropical UTLS anticyclones, synoptic Rossby wave breaking, and extratropical planetary waves.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ We sought to create new knowledge about how tropical convective systems influence the general circulation of the southern hemisphere (SH).  Tropical convective systems over Africa, Indonesia, and Amazonia cause divergent outflow in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere (UTLS), which can excite planetary wave patterns, that radiate into both hemispheres and influence our weather. This influence of tropical convection depends upon season and phase of the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO).   During El Nino convection is distributed across the Pacific, while during La Nina it is concentrated over Indonesia.  This causes an east-west shift in forcing of planetary waves and modulation of extratropical weather.  Our goals included 1) documenting ENSO influences on austral high latitude climatological anomalies, 2) creating a website for the public to better understand this phenomenon, and 3) trying to improve weather forecasting over Antarctica.  We have succeeded in creating new knowledge about the seasonal influence of ENSO on the general circulation of the extratropical SH and have created a website to describe both historical understanding and our research contributions.  However, we realized that our high-resolution simulations of Antarctic weather sequences, with a view toward favorable synoptic configurations for unusually cold air near Dome C, were compromised by an imbalance in net heating over complex surface conditions.  The primary result of our work is that during La Nina it tends to be colder in a region extending from the Ross Sea to East Antarctica.  A second salient result is that "spiral" and "split jet" structures in the SH are best understood as the superposition of the subtropical westerly, subpolar, and polar night jets.  A third conclusion is that the downward extention of the polar night jet to the surface depends on season and phase of ENSO.  This grant has provided support for the completion of two M.S. degrees, one of which focused on SH jets and will be published later this year (Nathaniel Loeb).   The other degree (Shellie Rowe) focused on numerical modeling of weather systems, which led to new work on the dynamics of the UTLS in midlatitude and tropical cyclones.  In support of our goal to present a digest of prior and new information for the public on our website, we offer this summary.   During La Nina, the following conditions tend to occur:  the maximum in column ozone (near 50S) is shifted westward ~50 degrees in longitude, the polar vortex is stronger, with an enhanced planetary wave one asymmetry, an enhanced low over the Ross Sea, and a cold barotropic vortex which extends from the Ross Sea to East Antarctica.   During El Nino, column ozone is shifted eastward ~50 degrees, the polar vortex is weaker, planetary wave one is weaker, and an area of barotropic high pressure is found near the Antarctic Peninsula and the Amundsen and Bellingshausen Seas.
