<AbstractNarration>This project is designed to offer approximately 75 scholarships over the course of five years to talented undergraduates who are in financial need and who are majoring in computer science (CS), computer engineering (CE), or mathematics. These students are being supported through their studies and assisted in their transition to the workforce by making use of communities - both the fostering of a community of peers within these disciplines to support scholarship students through to graduation, and the connection of these students with the community outside the university to support their transition to the workforce. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The university is using the scholarship program to create within the existing university infrastructure a new model for finding, recruiting, supporting, graduating and placing into the workforce a wide variety of students talented in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields. This model (1) seeks to identify STEM majors who may not have yet self-identified as such, (2) emphasizes to students the connection between undergraduate education and workforce placement, and (3) builds a network of peer support systems among undergraduates. This project is helping students maintain this network after graduation by using online social media (e.g. Facebook, LinkedIn) to create interest groups that connect students to each other and the wider business community. The project is working with the admissions department and with community partners to find talented students with unmet financial needs, with special attention to those from underrepresented demographics, including those who may not have self-identified as STEM majors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: Graduating a larger and more diverse workforce in computer science, computer engineering, and mathematics is leading to better problem-solving in these increasingly critical areas of STEM. Further, the university is leveraging the success of the project in graduating and placing students into the workforce to obtain long-term funding commitments from local and regional industry, education, and government partners to maintain the financial support necessary for the continuation of this program. The new paths within the university infrastructure being developed to recruit talented and diverse STEM students and to reduce attrition in these fields through more cohesive and coordinated support are permanently changing the university.</AbstractNarration>

Activities  Each year, we held a subset of the following events and activities for SPIN+ Scholars that were designed to provide opportunities for academic support, career preparation, community building, and mentoring.   Orientation: introduce new and returning scholars, meet the faculty mentors and graduate student mentor, and share their interests Resume and cover letter workshop Industry speakers Game night, undergraduate led with academic component Movie night, undergraduate led with academic component Holiday party, pot luck Jobs and internships Interviews and networking Events with Alumni Events with recruitment professionals from industry Career fairs End of year event, graduating seniors received graduation stoles Design your dream workspace Meetups in the SPIN+ study area ? room with white boards Workshop on organizational skills, study strategies Workshop on career finding One-on-one check-ins with graduate student mentor  ? throughout April Trip to Boston Science Museum Grace Hopper Conference Women Who Compute club events   Scholars took advantage of the Academic Skills Program on campus, which may include one-on-one sessions with an academic coach and a 1-credit course.

Only one respondent selected ?unsure? when asked about plans after graduation. Here are some of their supporting comments:  The mentors we have had throughout the years have been extremely helpful in making me feel like I am ready to graduate. The SPIN+ Scholarship not only kept me in line with good grades (minimum GPA requirement) but gave me the opportunity to exceed expectations with peers from the similar majors, and great networking options. I didn't really know anything about the SPIN program before coming in, but it was a really awesome resource for meeting other students and learning about career opportunities. The resources that were available to me, the helpful advice given to me by my advisors, and being able to make new friends with the other SPIN+ Scholars.   Broader impacts and conclusion  The goals of this program involve long-term interventions and transformations of STEM education related to: engagement and improved success in courses; recruitment, retention, and encouragement of students in STEM disciplines; and academic support and coaching. At the University of Rhode Island, this program is one small part of the cultural transformation that has taken place during the program period (2013-2019). Each of the PI?s and faculty mentors on this project are dedicated to the advancement of scientific research and economic development that can be achieved through high-quality, affordable, and accessible education for a diverse population in STEM disciplines.
