<AbstractNarration>The University of Houston Robert Noyce Scholarship Program is addressing the shortage of qualified physics and chemistry teachers through recruitment, preparation and retention of science majors for teacher certification in physics and chemistry. The program, built on the successes of the teachHOUSTON program, annually provides (1) 12 summer internships for lower division undergraduates to work with science master teachers at a middle school STEM camp for underserved students; (2) early field experiences to scholars in high need schools with established partner school districts; (3) $12,000 annual scholarships for 24 junior or senior level physics or chemistry majors or post baccalaureate students seeking physics or chemistry teacher certification who commit to teaching two years in a high-need school district for every year of scholarship support after graduation; and (4) a Physics By Inquiry Course that engages scholars and STEM majors in the teachHOUSTON program in effective inquiry-based teaching pedagogies for physics and chemistry.  This project has the potential to provide a total of 24 content knowledgeable physics and chemistry teachers to underserved schools in the Houston area, provide innovative methods for recruitment, preparation and retention of physics or chemistry teachers, and promote active inquiry based methods for teaching, training, and learning physics and chemistry. This program leads to improved teacher content knowledge and enhanced student learning resulting in an increase in the number of students, particularly those from underserved populations, entering into STEM-related professions. Dissemination of knowledge gained from this program is transmitted to STEM and education related conferences.</AbstractNarration>

Of the 34 graduates from the program, 38% are certified to teach Physics.  Due to the success of this course, a Biology/Biochemistry By Inquiry course and a similar courses for pre-service middle school teachers has been developed and implemented in the teachHOUSTON and the College of Education, respectively.   As part of the summer internship, pre-service teachers were exposed to early field based teaching experiences through hands-on experience with developing/implementing innovative lessons for STEM camps and professional development through the Noyce Internship Institute which offered interactive professional development sessions addressing emergent needs of secondary STEM teachers.    Noyce Scholars were afforded the opportunity to presented tools and techniques for interactive learning at regional and national conferences.  In addition, Noyce scholars were exposed to STEM Research through the STEM Teacher and Researcher Program Internship (STAR) program which placed them in National labs for a summer research experience or scholars were placed in research lab at the University of Houston.  Overall, this program has provided content knowledgeable physics and chemistry teachers to underserved schools in the Houston area, provide innovative methods for recruitment, preparation and retention of physics or chemistry teachers, and promote active inquiry based methods for teaching, training, and learning physics.
