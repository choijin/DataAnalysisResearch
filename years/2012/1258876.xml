<AbstractNarration>This award provides support for the Northeast National Ion Microprobe Facility (NENIMF) to operate as a multi-user facility serving the geoscience community. Since January 2010, the facility has accommodated sixty-six users from thirty-three different institutions. The analytical capabilities of the NENIMF provide a unique resource to the geoscience community in two key areas where we have a well-established track record: determination of magmatic volatile abundances in silicate glasses, and analysis of biogenic carbonates as records of climate change and its impacts on marine organisms.  NENIMF users have also worked on a range of topics that include Zr in rutile geospeedometry, Ti diffusion in quartz, and U-Th-Pb dating of monazite and zircon. Analytical protocols and standard materials for these and many other types of SIMS applications are available at the NENIMF. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Discovery and understanding are advanced while promoting teaching, training, and learning and participation of underrepresented groups is broadened through the involvement of undergraduates, graduate students and postdocs. Involvement of young scientists in SIMS-based research is encouraged through short-courses held once each year. Our exhibits at Fall AGU and Goldschmidt conferences introduce researchers in many different fields to the analytical capabilities of SIMS. Infrastructure for research and education are enhanced through making both our existing analytical platforms, and those to be developed by the NENIMF personnel, available to scientists and students from diverse disciplines. Research results are disseminated broadly to enhance scientific and technological understanding through an average of 15 publications per year that result from use of the NENIMF.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (SIMS) is a powerful micro-analytical tool for determining the elemental and isotopic compositions of solid materials that has broad applications to earth, ocean, and planetary sciences. Funds from this grant supported the operation of the Northeast National Ion Microprobe Facility (NENIMF) as a National SIMS Facility serving the geoscience community from March 2014 through February 2018. The principal strengths of SIMS relative to other micro-analytical techniques are its high spatial resolution and the capacity for high-precision measurements of both concentration and isotopic composition of light elements such as hydrogen, lithium, boron, carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen. The NENIMF is equipped with two Cameca SIMS instruments: an IMS 1280 and an IMS 3f. The IMS 1280 is a double focusing mass spectrometer with a large radius magnetic sector, and ion optics optimized to attain high mass resolving power without significant loss of secondary ion intensity. The IMS 3f is a double focusing mass spectrometer with a small radius magnetic sector that has been used for a wide spectrum of geochemical studies since 1978 and has been upgraded to Linux-based computer control of many components via Labview-based software (LabSIMS). The combination of these two instruments and the technical and scientific expertise of the NENIMF provides the geoscience community with a unique resource with analytical capabilities and expertise focused in two areas: determination of magmatic volatiles in silicate glasses and analysis of biogenic carbonates as records of climate change and its impacts on marine organisms, making the NENIMF a unique interdisciplinary resource to the geosciences community. Over the period supported by this grant the NENIMF accommodated 60 individual users from 28 different institutions. A total of 56 peer reviewed scientific papers were published using data collected at the NENIMF, for an average of 14 per year. Publications related to magmatic volatiles comprised 69% of the NENIMF total, while 13% were focused on biogenic carbonates. In addition to our areas of specialization, NENIMF users have taken advantage of the Cameca IMS 1280 to work on a range of topics that include B isotopes in MORB glasses and subduction zone minerals, Zr in rutile geospeedometry, Ti diffusion in quartz, and U-Th-Pb dating of monazite and zircon. New analytical protocols developed at the NENIMF over the past few years include high-precision analysis of the isotopic composition of boron in low concentration basaltic glasses, and determination of D/H in the accessory mineral apatite.
