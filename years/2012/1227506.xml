<AbstractNarration>This award funds research in game theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game theoretic reasoning is critical to a vast array of problems in economics, from the design of efficient auctions (e.g. to sell radio spectrum licenses), to the analysis of markets for health insurance. A fundamental tool for the analysis of such problems is Nash's 1950 concept of equilibrium, now called simply Nash equilibrium. Nash's idea has proven immensely useful and covers a lot of ground. However, applying it in contexts (such as auctions) where small changes in a player's behavior can have dramatic effects on his and/or on others' payoffs has been difficult. More precisely, the existence of a Nash equilibrium cannot always be guaranteed in discontinuous games. The first project is a continuation of the PI's previous work to identify discontinuous games that, despite the presence of discontinuities, admit Nash equilibria. This has already opened up large classes of games for analysis that were not previously covered by Nash's 1950 existence theorem. An important aspect of the new existence result for pure strategy equilibria that sought by the project is that it is ordinal, a property that most of the previous work in the area fails to satisfy. Ordinality means that the new result is independent of the arbitrary numerical scale that is used to define the players' payoffs in the game. Thus, the new result will not only expand the class of strategic games that we are able to analyze, it will provide a deeper foundation to our understanding of the question of existence of Nash equilibrium as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    While the first project focuses on strategic form games and discontinuities, the second project concerns games in extensive form, where information and dynamics are explicitly modeled. It has been about 30 years since Kreps and Wilson (1982) introduced the idea of a sequential equilibrium for finite extensive form games. Yet, we still do not have a working definition of sequential equilibrium for games with infinite action sets and arbitrary information structures. This is despite the fact that many dynamic economic models are formulated with infinite action spaces. Researchers analyzing such games must resort to using ad hoc solutions that do not correspond to the definition used for finite games. The second project of this proposal seeks to provide the missing definition of sequential equilibrium for such infinite-action extensive form games. The goal is to define a notion of sequential equilibrium that (i) permits an existence result whether or not the game is continuous -- in payoffs or in information -- and (ii) such that the definition coincides in a natural way with Kreps and Wilson's definition for finite games and (iii) yields the "natural equilibria" in a class of canonical examples. The ultimate goal is to provide a definition that is widely applicable, useful, and sensible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Because many areas of social science and computer science use game theory as a modeling tool, the research will have a significant interdisciplinary impact.</AbstractNarration>

The second part of the project seeks to extend Kreps and Wilson's (1982) concept of sequential equilibrium for finite games to games with infinite sets of actions and signals.  The central challenge in infinite games is how to test whether the players' behavior is rational off the equilibrium path of play. We test for rational behavior by considering, for every possible finite set of signals in the game outside a negligible set, a slightly perturbed strategy profile and a slightly perturbed probability function for nature that, together, give every signal in the finite set positive probability.  We define a strategy profile to be a conditional &epsilon;-equilibrium if, given the strategies of the other players, each player's continuation strategy is &epsilon;-optimal conditional on any positive probability set of signals.  We then define a strategy profile is defined to be a perfect conditional &epsilon;-equilibrium if for any finite set of signals in the game outside a negligible set, there is an arbitrarily small perturbation of nature's probability function and an arbitrarily small perturbation of the strategy profile such that, in the game with nature's perturbed probability function, the perturbed strategy profile gives every signal in the finite set positive probability and is a conditional &epsilon;-equilibrium.   A perfect conditional equilibrium distribution is defined as the limit of perfect conditional &epsilon;-equilibrium distributions on the terminal nodes (henceforth, outcomes) of the game as &epsilon;&rarr;0.  Perfect conditional &epsilon;-equilibria and perfect conditional equilibrium distributions are shown to exist for a large class of regular projective games and have attractive properties. In particular, in any standard finite game, a strategy profile is part of a sequential equilibrium if and only if, either, it is a perfect conditional &epsilon;-equilibrium for every &epsilon;&gt;0, or, it is the limit of perfect conditional &epsilon;-equilibria as &epsilon;&rarr;0. Consequently, in standard finite games, the perfect conditional equilibrium distributions defined here are precisely the distributions over outcomes that arise from sequential equilibria.
