<AbstractNarration>This award is made as part of the FY 2012 Mathematical Sciences Postdoctoral Research Fellowships Program. These fellowships support a research and training plan at a host institution in the mathematical sciences, including applications to other disciplines. The title of the research and training plan for this fellowship to Rina Foygel is "Low-rank matrix reconstruction in the presence of non-uniform sampling, logistic response, or sparsely-low-rank structure." The host institution for the fellowship is Stanford University, and the sponsoring scientist is Dr. Emmanuel Candes.</AbstractNarration>

Many modern applications can be characterized in this way, from fields such as genetics, image processing and compression, and many others.

In the corrupted sensing problem, limited measurements of a structured signal have been corrupted with some outliers - that is, some of the measurements are unreliable, but it is not known which measurements are reliable and which are corrupted.
