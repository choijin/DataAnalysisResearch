<AbstractNarration>The Enhancing Mathematics Teaching and Learning in Urban Elementary Schools project is working with all teachers in grades three through five in the Portland, OR Public Schools in order to test the feasibility and efficacy of the Mathematics Studio Model of professional development.  The model requires professional development to occur at the school level involving both teachers and principals.  The professional development is conducted at the school and is integrated with instruction.  The goal of the project is to improve students' engagement and learning in mathematics by fostering effective instruction.  Partners in the project include Teachers Development Group, Portland State University, Portland Public Schools and Horizon Research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The researchers are identifying the key ingredients that make the professional development successful.  They are using a cluster-randomized research design to examine the efficacy of their model.  They are using observational measures to identify successful teaching practices as well as student discourse patterns. They are studying the fidelity of implementation of the model and are looking for specific variables that may be particularly helpful for students who have not been successful in learning mathematics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is difficult to implement professional development at a large enough scale to make a significant difference in student achievement within a district.  This research is important because it tests the use of a practice-based, professional development model within a large, public school system, and documents the challenges of implementation as well as the variables that contribute to student learning of mathematics.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   BACKGROUND  Many school districts, particularly urban districts, struggle to serve all students well. One widespread problem is that, even when teachers participate in many hours of high quality mathematics workshops, courses, and/or seminars &ndash; i.e., the most commonly implemented professional development model &ndash; those teachers typically still struggle to substantively change their teaching practices to align with the pedagogy and content emphasized during the professional development.  The Enhancing Mathematics Teaching and Learning in Urban Elementary Schools project was a collaboration among Teachers Development Group (TDG), Portland State University, and Texas State University to design and conduct a randomized cluster study involving nearly all grades 3-5 teachers and students from 33 urban elementary schools in a rigorous test of the efficacy and effectiveness of TDG?s innovative, long-term, apprenticeship model of professional development, called Math Studio.  The goal of the Math Studio model is to foster a school-wide mathematical culture in which:  A set of carefully      defined, evidence-based practices (see below) are everyday norms for      teachers and learners.    Teacher practices: Mathematically       Productive Teaching Routines and embedded Catalytic       Teaching Habits Learner practices: Mathematical       Habits of Mind and Mathematical Habits of Interaction     Student      achievement increases because the above practices are implemented      continuously and with fidelity.   PROJECT GOALS &amp; INTELLECTUAL MERIT   The overarching goals of the Enhancing Mathematics Teaching and Learning in Urban Elementary Schools project were to:  1)     Refine and successfully implement the Math Studio model at scale in an urban school district.  2)     **Execute a rigorous scientific test of the feasibility and effectiveness of the Math Studio model in comparison to a "business-as-usual" (BAU) professional development approach, with both models implemented across 3 years.  3)     Generate new applied scientific knowledge and tools/instruments that have the potential to advance the field's understanding of how to improve elementary mathematics education.  **Note: The Math Studio model includes an annual high-quality but short-term summer professional development experience followed annually by five professional learning cycles that are situated within live classrooms and focused on effective implementation of the content of the summer professional development. The BAU approach includes only the annual high-quality, short-term summer professional development. Schools were assigned to either Math Studio or BAU using a cluster randomized model.  To address Goal 2 above, project researchers developed a large-scale study that was informed by small-scale models and themes that emerged from case studies.  This study focused on important teacher, student, and school variables and culminated in the following five major results that provide indicators of the effectiveness of Math Studio:  Teacher Level: Mathematical Knowledge      for Teaching increased in both forms of the professional development.   Teacher Level: Mathematical Quality of      Instruction only increased for teachers in Math Studio schools.   Teacher Level:  Teachers from Math Studio schools developed      significantly more robust understanding of justifying and generalizing      than the BAU teachers.   Student Level:  Number of years      in a Math Studio school is a      significant positive predictor of student achievement scores. Student Level: Multiple years in a Math Studio school or one year in the      classroom of a high-implementing teacher in a Math Studio school is a positive predictor of student      achievement.      BROADER IMPACT  In the process of establishing the efficacy and effectiveness of the Math Studio model, the Enhancing Mathematics Teaching and Learning in Urban Elementary Schools project research has produced intellectual knowledge and products that will be useful nationally in efforts to improve mathematics education. Following are several examples:  A      well-articulated, three-level, cross-listed HLM model that can be      leveraged for complex data in school settings.   A       "fidelity of implementation" measure &ndash; frequently overlooked in      large-scale models studying professional development effectiveness.   The Math      Habits &amp; Routines tablet application (with reporting tools)      that supports school leaders, teachers, math educators, and researchers in      understanding, analyzing, and/or effectively implementing Mathematically      Productive Teaching Routines and Catalytic Teaching      Habits to ensure students engage productively in Mathematical      Habits of Mind and Mathematical Habits of Interaction.   Evidence      that, when teachers and students continuously implement the above habits      and routines and teachers engage in professional development that spans      time and provides classroom-based support for fidelity of implementation,      student performance in mathematics increases.   A      database with 651 catalogued video recordings of mathematics lessons,      together with coding and reporting tools, available for data sharing.   Evidence-based      improvements to the design, tools, and facilitation of the Math      Studio model.  These      improvements are now central elements of TDG's Math Studio work with teachers and leaders nationwide.      Additionally, these improvements have application in any mathematics      professional development model that holds similar tenets about mathematics      learning, teaching, and leadership.
