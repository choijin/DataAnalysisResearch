<AbstractNarration>Vitaly Rassolov of the University of South Carolina is supported by the Chemical Theory, Models and Computational Methods program in the Chemistry Division to develop  a novel  approach  for modeling electron correlation effects as averages over two-particle universal linear operators.  This approach, complementary to the increasingly popular Density Functional Theory (DFT) and comparable to it in computational complexity and rigor,  may have advantages over  DFT: (i) the operators describe excited states with the same level of accuracy as ground states; (ii) it is a natural formalism to model intermolecular forces; (iii) it is compatible with multireference methods, necessary to describe such phenomena as chemical bond-breaking, magnetic interactions in transition metals, and excited states. Rigorous description of correlation interaction via linear operators involves complicated mathematics, thus limiting the approach to small systems.   The PI overcomes this by expanding the operators in Gaussian functions, which are a staple in the electronic structure field.  The expansions are performed using exact analytic expressions, leaving electronic structure codes with an easy task of working with Gaussians.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research improves and expands computational tools for better understanding and control of chemical reactions, understanding and prediction of intermolecular forces, and description of excited electronic states which are essential for solar energy conversion.  Implementation of novel ideas from this research in established software packages will widen their availability to the large community of scientists, in many fields, who utilize quantum chemistry software.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Vitaly Rassolov of the University of South Carolina is investigating new ways  to describe quantum mechanical electron interaction, known as ``electron  correlation'', in computation of molecular properties.  The existing methods  work well in molecules with weak electron correlation spread over all molecules (a ``dynamic correlation''), and in molecules where specific electronic configurations interact strongly (a ``static correlation''), but not both.  In  Rassolov's approach, electron correlation is described via a two-particle  operator.  It was computed accurately for small systems, then fit into a simple mathematical form, then was used in computation of the challenging molecules.  Specifically, excitation energies of diatomic molecules, including radicals,  were used as a test set.  The molecules with transition metals and main-group  only elements were studied separately. Geometric properties and vibrational  frequencies were also studied.  Rassolov group found that the method is promising and efficient in small  systems, such as atoms.  In molecules, some forms of ``static correlation''  lead to inferior accuracy of the new approach of modeling electron correlation  with simple ``correlation operator'', and future work is needed for an efficient  and accurate method based on the correlation operator`.  In particular, the dependence on the virtual orbitals (these are the orbitals that do not have  electrons in a standard, or ``mean-filed'' picture), known to be important in  the description of electron correlation, is needed.    Additionally, three graduate students were trained in electronic structure  computations as a result of this project.  Also, computation of molecules for  experimental studies by other groups in the USC were also performed by the PI and by the students.
