<AbstractNarration>A symmetric function is a multi-variate polynomial  F(x1,x2,...,xn) which is invariant under any permutation of the variables.  In recent years such functions have become quite important to several fields of mathematics, and the representation theoretic, analytic, algebraic, geometric, and combinatorial properties of different families of symmetric functions form active areas of current research.  Under this proposal the PI will investigate the combinatorial properties of various families of symmetric functions and other objects of relevance to representation theory and algebra.  One particularly important family of symmetric functions central to the PI's research program is the family of Macdonald polynomials.  These are symmetric functions in a set of variables {x1,...,xn} which depend on two additional parameters q,t and also on an integer partition.  Macdonald polynomials have found many significant applications to date, but there are also several captivating open problems associated with them, particularly with their combinatorial properties.  They are closely related to the space of diagonal harmonics, an important topic in algebraic combinatorics and algebraic geometry.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Symmetric functions are becoming increasingly important as tools for researchers in mathematics and mathematical physics.  Through the work of Haiman, Cherednik and many others, Macdonald polynomials and diagonal harmonics are linked to mainstream topics such as the Hilbert Scheme from algebraic geometry and the double affine Hecke algebra.  New developments in the combinatorics of Macdonald polynomials and other symmetric functions, and related objects such as the Hilbert series of diagonal harmonics, are potentially applicable to many areas of mathematics and science.  The explicit and concrete nature of recent combinatorial advances in Macdonald polynomials and the space of diagonal harmonics makes these subjects accessible to a broad range of researchers and students.  Thus problems with connections to advanced theoretical mathematics can be attacked using techniques from more concrete and accessible areas such as bijective combinatorics. The PI currently has three Ph. D. students, and maintains collaborations with faculty at primarily undergraduate institutions.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Project Outcomes for NSF award "Combinatorics of Symmetric Functions"     The primary goal of this project was to expand our knowledge of two related topics within the theory of symmetric functions, namely     (1) the study of the combinatorics of the character of diagonal harmonics   and  (2) the study of Macdonald polynomials and related functions.     Topic (1) was originated by Prof.  A. Garsia of UC San Diego and Prof. M. Haiman of UC Berkeley in the early 1990's.  Haiman and others have shown that it is closely connected to the study of the HIlbert scheme from algebraic geometry and also Cherednik algebras, two of the more advanced objects in modern algebra. Recent work has also connected it to the Elliptic Hall algebra and also string theory and knot invariants.  In particular, E. Gorsky has shown that the superpolynomial knot invariant for the (n+1,n) torus knot is essentially the generating function for hook shapes in (1).  In 2004 the author derived a purely combinatorial expression for this function in terms of weighted lattice paths, and there are now several intriguing conjectures which extend this combinatorial construction to the general (m,n) torus knot case.    One of the main outcomes from the PI's project is the formulation of what we call the Delta conjecture.  This conjecture gives more refined combinatorics for the (n+1,n) case, and leads to several new and interesting combinatorial identities.  The Delta conjecture is the subject of a paper that is currently being written, which is joint work between the PI and Prof. J. Remmel of UC San Diego, and also Andrew Wilson, a student of Remmel who just received his Ph.D.  (Wilson recently arrived at Penn, where he will be studying with the PI for three years while supported by an NSF Postdoctoral Reserch Fellowship).  In 2008 the PI published a 167-page book on topic (1), which also included some new material on topic (2).    The book is part of the American Math Society University Lecture series.  Partly due to this book, over the past few years the PI has received several requests for expository accounts of material connected to (1) and (2), and part of the outcomes from this award involve the following three expository accounts written by the PI;  (a)  "Catalan Paths and q,t-Enumeration", (65 pages) to appear as a chapter in the upcoming Handbook of Enumerative Combinatorics, CRC Press.  (b)  "The combinatorics of knot invariants arising from the study of Macdonald polynomials", (20 pages) to appear as a chapter in the upcoming Institute of Mathematics and its Applications (IMA) Volume titled Recent Trends in Combinatorics.  (c) "Combinatorial Aspects of Macdonald and Related Polynomials", (50 pages) to appear as a chapter in the planned Askey-Bateman project, Cambridge University Press.     Another significant outcome from the grant was the discovery of a purely combinatorial formula for (1), by starting with Haiman's formula in terms of Macdonald polynomials, and gradually unravelling it into an expression involving so-called "Tesler matrics".  (These simple objects were shown to be connected to the Hilbert series for (1) by the PI in 2011, and are also the subject of continuing research projects involving the PI, WIlson, and others.)   An article by the PI and Garsia on this will be appearing in the journal Annals of Combinatorics.  Other papers of the PI created during the period of the grant include "Constant term methods in the theory of Tesler matrices and Macdonald polynomial operators" (Annals of Combinatorics, 26 pages, joint with Garsia and G. Xin), "Some new applicatoins of the Stanley-Macdonald Pieri Rules" (submitted, 25 pages, joint with Garsia, G. Xin, and M. Zabrocki), and "Properties of the nonsymmetric Robinson-Schensted-Knuth algorithm" (J. Algebraic Combinatorics, 42 pages, joint with Remmel and S. Mason).
