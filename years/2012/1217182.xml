<AbstractNarration>Although the team's lab and others have demonstrated the capacity to use molecular affinities to control the rate of release of drugs, these observations have not been translated to commercial or clinical successes. The novelty of this work is that at the completion of the proposed research the concept of affinity-based delivery will be closer to commercial reality as it will address some of the barriers to customer acceptance, such as separating the delivery technology from the implanted device. This work will be transformative in assisting future researchers in tuning drug delivery rates to those much slower than currently available. Primarily this will be toward delivery of antibiotics, but the team is poised toward application in other delivery areas. The proposed research also has relevance to pharmaceutics and pharmacology, chemistry and biomaterials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every year there are about 21 million acute surgical wounds, 500,000 burns with 100,000 requiring hospitalization, 6 million chronic wounds and 1.5 million diabetic foot ulcers.  In spite of the many advances in wound care products, the impact of infections and related complications just in burn patients result in 12,000 deaths and an $11billion impact upon the US healthcare system annually.  The novel film of the team's drug delivery polymer will reduce wound infections and provide hospitals with an alternative that will lower costs and decrease patient suffering. In addition to directly addressing the significant problem of infections, the team's film CD solution will be able to multiplex other therapeutics such as growth factors and other critical molecules in a sustained tunable delivery system. Films incorporating therapeutics will have applications in orthopedics, cardiovascular and oral indications. Currently there are no similar products so film CD-therapeutics will be first in class.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In this award we received support to investigate translating basic science discoveries from our lab into commercial products.  For the intellectual merit, our lab has pioneered the use of molecular interactions to control the rate of release of therapeutic drugs beyond that capable of diffusion alone.  We had explored the use of this platform technology for the delivery of several different therapeutics, and over the course of this I-Corps award settled on delivery of antibiotics to prevent infection of hernia repair meshes.  This final objective was decided upon by over 100 interviews with "customers" and other stakeholders in the field, probing for need, market size, etc.  While our company had previously already been founded, we very rapidly recieved other support in the form of an NIH SBIR on the next leg of this project; an NSF project on a different project based on related technologies; and a second NIH SBIR, also on a different but related project.  From this latter SBIR we were chosed to participate in an NIH version of the I-Corps program.  Broader Impacts for this work included training several team members over the course of the past few years, as well as participating as a teacher/guest lecturer in another I-corps program, as well as providing lectures at Case Western Reserve University both in the Weatherhead School of Management and in the Department of Biomedical Engineering.
