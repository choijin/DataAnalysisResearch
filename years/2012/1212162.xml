<AbstractNarration>This is part of a collaborative project to search for low-frequency narrowly beamed, highly circular polarized radio emission from "hot Jupiter" extrasolar planets, as part of the HJUDE project.  This emission is predicted to be bright enough to be detected by the newly commissioned LWA1 (Long Wavelength Array) radio telescope, and thus the detections (or upper limits) will be used to test planetary magnetospheric physics models.  As part of the project, the PIs will train undergraduate and graduate students and a postdoctoral researcher in instrumentation, computational expertise and data reduction and analysis techniques.  They will also make the software spectrometer available to other scientists in the community.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ At low frequencies (below 30 MHz), Jupiter exhibits strong outbursts which can go on for hours.  When in outburst, Jupiter is over a 1000 times brighter than the brightest steady radio sources (the quiet sun, Cassiopeia A supernova remnant, and the radio galaxy Cygnus A).  The source of the outbursts are the strong magnetic fields of Jupiter which trap high-energy particles from the solar wind and its moon, Io.  Depending on the orientation of Jupiter, Io and the Earth the timing of these outbursts can be predicted with some confidence.    UNM is responsible for operating LWA1 (the first station of the Long Wavelength Array).  The Long Wavelength Array (LWA) is an innovative radio telescope that is opening up a new window on the Universe by observing in the frequency range of 4-88 MHz.  This frequency range has been largely ignored in the past, but thanks to innovations in digital processing, is now accessible by combining large arrays of dipoles (256 stands each) together.  With the LWA we are learning about: the magnetic storms on the Sun and planets, the first stars and galaxies, pulsars, radio pulses from meteors, and our own ionosphere to name just a few topics.   Given the strength of the outbursts from Jupiter, we established a program to use the LWA1 to search for radio outbursts from known planets in other solar systems.  Such a detection would demonstrate a new method to search for exoplanets, and would also provide a way to measure the magnetic field strength of known exoplanets.  Initially we concentrated on finding emission from "Hot Jupiters" or those Jovian planets that are on orbits close-in to their host star.  The thought is that these outbursts could be stronger than that of Jupiter due to the stronger solar wind.  We observed about ten such systems for a total of 933 hours, but did not detect any.  A problem with Hot Jupiters is that they are fairly rare and thus are more distant from Earth, making them dimmer.  For this reason we switched to a campaign to look at 20 nearby Jovian planets.  We searched for a total of 4282 hours but again did not find any convincing detections.   While our attempts to detect extra-solar planets by way of their low frequency bursts were not successful, we have placed stringent limits on how bright this emission can be.  These limits will be useful in designing future experiments aimed at detecting exoplanets.          Last Modified: 10/11/2015       Submitted by: Gregory B Taylor]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
