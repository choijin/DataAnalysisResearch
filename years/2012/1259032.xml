<AbstractNarration>This project awards scholarships up to $6,000 per year to 34 students over a two and one-half year period to pursue the following STEM degree programs at Owensboro Community and Technical College (OCTC): Science, Biotechnology, Mechatronics, Machine Tool Technology, Computer Aided Drafting, Industrial Maintenance, Welding, Engineering Technology, and Information Technology. The project provides support services that promote the success and retention of participating scholars to complete an associate degree and/or transfer to a four-year institution to continue pursuit of a baccalaureate degree in a STEM area.  Scholars are also provide with industry experiences through targeted strategies with assistance from established partnerships that support the successful transition of participating scholars to employment in STEM technical areas upon successful postsecondary completion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A recruitment plan is to be implemented to target potential scholars, particularly underrepresented groups, with awardees selected by a committee, comprised of grant PI and co-PIs, relevant OCTC personnel, and industry partners. The project increases participation of academically-talented, financially-disadvantaged students in postsecondary opportunities in STEM areas of demand in Kentucky and the nation. Data collected through project evaluation has the potential to be of interest to the greater academic community by providing additional insight on the effectiveness of high impact practices on the experiences of underserved students in differing STEM areas.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In 2013, Owensboro Community and Technical College (OCTC) received a grant award from the National Science Foundation (NSF) Scholarships in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (S-STEM) program to implement the OCTC ACCESS to STEM project.  As a result, 60 OCTC students in four cohorts pursuing two-year degrees in STEM received scholarships of up to $6,000 per year over a two and one-half year period.  Targeted STEM programs included: Science, Biotechnology, Mechatronics, Machine Tool Technology, Computer Aided Drafting, Industrial Maintenance, Welding, Engineering Technology, and Information Technology.   The project focused on encouraging students typically underrepresented in STEM to apply for the scholarship, including low-income, first-generation, minority, female, and/or disabled individuals.  In addition, to support student retention through degree completion, high-impact strategies were implemented with an aim to positively influence the success of participating STEM Scholars.  Specific retention strategies implemented included services traditionally offered to OCTC students (counseling, transfer services, and internships), as well as those that were project-specific, high-impact practices including: STEM-specific first- year seminar course, learning communities, service learning projects, intensive advising/mentorship, and industry connections.  The grant project team was comprised of faculty from each STEM area, most of whom possessed prior experience implementing programs to successfully attract and serve underrepresented students as co-principal investigators on two previous NSF Advanced Technological Education (ATE) grants (DUE 0702960 and DUE 1103605). Additionally, the PI and three of four co-PIs working with the project were female, serving as role models/mentors for female students in STEM areas.  Objectives of the grant were to:   Increase participation of academically talented, financially disadvantaged students, particularly underrepresented groups, in postsecondary opportunities in STEM areas of demand in Kentucky and the nation.      Provide support services that promote the success and retention of participating scholars to complete an associate degree and/or transfer to a four-year institution to pursue a baccalaureate degree in a STEM area.      Provide industry experiences through targeted strategies with assistance of established partnerships that support the successful transition of participating scholars to employment in STEM technical areas upon successful postsecondary completion.
