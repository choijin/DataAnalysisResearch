<AbstractNarration>This action funds Alexander James Smith of Northwestern University to conduct a research project, entitled "Layer-by-layer stamping of solution-processed organic solar cells," during the summer of 2012 at Academia Sinica in Taipei, Taiwan.  The host scientist is Chih-Wei Chu.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Intellectual Merit of the research project is to improve the processing conditions of organic photovoltaics through the use of layer-by-layer stamping techniques that are compatible with high-throughput manufacturing processes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.  These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ My EAPSI Taiwan tenure was primarily spent in the lab of Dr. Lian-Jong Li at the Institute for Atomic and Molecular Sciences in Academia Sinica, which is located on the campus of National Taiwan University. Additionally, I spend time in the lab of Dr. Chih-Wei Chu on Academia Sinica's Nangang campus.      Cultural Activities:  My first week of the EAPSI program was spent completing the Summer Institute in Taiwan (SIT), an excellent introduction to the culture, heritage, and language of Taiwain. My fellow participants and I enjoyed calligraphy, pottery session, a visit to a night market, a trip to a Hakka cultural center, and a brief Chinese course.

The friends I made during SIT, both with Taiwanese and American students, became my cultural activity partners for the remainder of the EAPSI program.     Hydrogen generation research:  Hydrogen has been proposed as a viable alternative to burning fossil fuels for electricity generation and transportation. As a result, the ability to efficiently produce hydrogen by splitting water has been pursued vigorously in recent years.
