<AbstractNarration>Kabe Moen&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The overall goal of this project is to study the theory of weights in harmonic analysis and partial differential equations. There are two distinct main themes that share the theory of weights as a common thread.  The first theme aims to further develop the theory of weighted inequalities in the multilinear setting.  This theory, while still in its adolescence, is expected to have significant ramifications to several multilinear operators.  For example it may be used to improve the known bounds of the bilinear Hilbert transform and related bilinear maximal function; an emphasis of study will be to develop multilinear extrapolation techniques.  The second theme focuses on the regularity of solutions to degenerate p-Laplacian equations. Such equations arise naturally in the study of mappings of bounded distortion (quasiconformal mappings) and more generally mappings of finite distortion.  Considering distortion functions that belong to certain classes of weights allows one to work below the natural size assumptions, yet still obtain interesting regularity results.  The common thread between the two motifs is the theory of weights.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This mathematics research project contributes to the long-standing synergy between the two fields of harmonic analysis and partial differential equations, in particular to the study of nonlinear quantities. In the present setting such nonlinear terms correspond to mappings of finite distortion that are relevant within the pure mathematics realm and also have far-reaching applications to other sciences, such as physics and engineering; materials sciences; hydrodynamics; and medical imaging. Moen will continue to establish fruitful collaborations both nationally and abroad, and the outcomes will be disseminated through publications of research articles, as well as presentations at professional meetings. Moen will integrate this research project with education, mentoring, and community outreach. In particular, he plans to continue his community involvement by establishing outreach programs that will connect local grade schools with the University of Alabama-Tuscaloosa.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The general scope of the project falls under the broad area of harmonic analysis and partial differential equations.  Results for bilinear operators have been applied to several areas outside harmonic analysis, particularly PDE, we they can be used to handle nonlinearities in which products of functions.  At the simplest level the bilinear analysis analyzes how two functions or signals interact.  The PI was able to prove several significant results for bilinear operators that involved a change density for such operators.  Several significant results disseminated from this research.    Nonlinear distortion was also studied.  This field has found several applications within mathematics, such as dynamical systems and calculus of variations.  They have also found far reaching concrete applications in physics and engineering.  For example, in materials sciences such as elasticity, in hydrodynamics such as fluid flow, and in medical imaging.  The PI was able to obtain results that showed that such distortions must satisfy a certain amount of regularity.    The PI's research was integrated with his teaching, mentoring and community outreach.  He provide research activities for undergraduates and graduate Ph.D. students at his institution.  During the project the PI supervised two Masters students and two PhD students.  In addition he was involved in several community outreach programs: organizing the annual statewide high school mathematics tournament and volunteering at local elementary schools.  In addition the PI worked with several underrepresented groups in mathematics including women and minorities.          Last Modified: 11/17/2015       Submitted by: Kabe A Moen]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
