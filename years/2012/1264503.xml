<AbstractNarration>1264503 Kloxin&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is a critical need to create more effective hydroxide exchange membranes to enable a new generation of alkaline fuel cells.  Membranes must exhibit acceptable conductivity, alkaline stability, and easy fabrication to make the relatively inexpensive hydroxide exchange fuel cell (HEFC) a viable energy option.  Although proton exchange fuel cells (PEFCs) have garnered much of the recent attention, the reaction of hydrogen to protons commonly requires expensive precious metal catalysts, such as platinum, which is both uneconomical and unsustainable for large-scale applications.  By changing the operation of the fuel cell such that hydroxide is produced at the cathode and passed through the membrane, the PIs can employ cheaper catalysts, such as nickel alloy.  The focus of this project is a synergistic collaboration between two PIs, having complementary skills in fuel cells and polymer networks.  Together they plan to create a novel photo-cured, alkaline-stable, and inexpensive membrane material with high hydroxide conductivity.  Specifically, the aims of the project are fourfold: 1) synthesize, crosslink, and characterize monomers and polymers having quaternary phosphonium pendant functional groups as well as photo-induced crosslinking capability using novel chemical schemes; 2) formulate these novel monomer and polymer compositions to optimize their membrane properties, such as swelling, mechanical strength, alkaline degradation resistance, and hydroxide conductivity for each of the three hydroxide exchange fuel-cell membrane layers: cathode, membrane, and anode; 3) create a membrane electrode assembly with the optimized materials, exploiting their spatiotemporal crosslinking control to fabricate complex HEFC designs as well as demonstrate the capability of these materials in device miniaturization and cell fabrication multiplexing; and 4) train a diverse group of undergraduate and graduate students in chemical synthesis, polymer chemistry, and membrane separations.  Photo-mediated crosslinking will not only provide a dimensionally stable membrane, which is critical in HEFCs, but also enable a new method for fabricating complex membrane electrode assemblies.  The results of this project will increase the understanding of how molecular composition influences membrane performance and properties.  The proposed synthetic strategy allows the geometric configuration and membrane structure to be precisely tuned, which will provide insight into the complex interplay between hydroxide conductivity, gas exchange, and transport within a dimensionally stable membrane.  Broader Impacts.  Diverse personnel will be involved in a unique combination of chemical reactions and engineering, polymer engineering, and next-generation energy applications.  The lead PIs are involved in outreach activities such as the University of Delaware Engineering Discovery Program, which targets K-12 students and parents.  The PIs will develop a demonstration module to explain membranes to K-12 student and parents.  The potential transformational aspect of the project is the fabrication of materials that will play a significant role in the realization of lower cost membranes for alkaline fuel cells, leading to an energy source with a low-carbon footprint.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Development of hydrogen fuels cell technology is critical in the evolution of energy towards ever-lower carbon-content fuel sources.  The general design of a hydrogen fuel cell separates the oxygen and hydrogen feed streams using an ion-conducting membrane.  Hydroxide exchange-based fuel cells (HEFCs) have previously suffered from multiple materials-based issues, most notably poor conductivity or alkaline stability of membrane.  Nevertheless, the materials (i.e., catalysts) necessary to operate a fuel cell are orders of magnitude cheaper in HEFCs as compared with other fuel cell designs (for example, the cost of the platinum catalyst often implemented in proton exchange fuel cells).  Therefore, an inexpensive, chemically stable, hydroxide conducting membrane would enable the creation of a low-cost hydrogen fuel cell for low-carbon energy applications.   This project proposes to design and synthesize new ion conducting membranes using light-triggered æclickÆ chemical reactions.  These reactions are highly efficient and easy to implement.  Moreover, these light-triggered reactions are rapid (completely reacted within 1 minute) and perform in the absence of solvent (environmentally friendly).  The overall outcome of this project is the fabrication of ion-conducting, chemically stable membranes starting from a light-triggered reaction of liquid precursors.  Not only does this enable ease of membrane manufacturing and processing, but the properties of the membrane are readily tuned.    In our first publication in the Journal of the Electrochemical Society we demonstrate that we can readily modulate the conductivity and properties (modulus) of a chemically stable membrane.  While we only use a few components, the simple nature of the chemistry and approach enables a vast chemical palette from which we can explore a near-infinite combination of compositions to explore and enhance the membraneÆs conductivity and properties.  In a subsequent publication (in preparation), we demonstrate the versatility of this approach by chemically incorporating a large range of organic salts (i.e., ionic liquids) into a polymer scaffold.  The intellectual merit of this project is that we now have fundamental understanding of how each component affects the membrane formation rates and the final material properties, including its conductivity.  We have identified several trends in properties based on specific attributes of the molecular structure.  This further provides a route to design materials from the basic molecular constituents, allowing us to rapidly fabricate new materials with application specific properties.   There are several broader impacts that reach beyond the research objectives of this project, not the least of which is the training of one PhD student and two undergraduate researchers.  Not only did the PhD student get extensive experience with a range of chemistry and materials characterization techniques, but they learned how to be a research mentor.  One undergraduate researcher (from an underrepresented group) was a co-author on a peer review publication and will likely have an additional publication related to her senior thesis.  Moreover, these students participated in numerous outreach activities, from science demonstrations to the K-12 UD summer camp.  Finally, these students learned other æsoftÆ skills such as how to communicate and disseminate information in a variety for formats, from delivering talks at national conferences to writing up their work in peer-reviewed publications.  The major impact of this project is both the fundamental understanding of how molecular structure affect the property though a novel materials synthesis approach and the research skills and career development of the supported students.
