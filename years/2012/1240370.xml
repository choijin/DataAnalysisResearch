<AbstractNarration>The 2012 Midwest Geometry Conference will take place May 12-13, 2012 at the University of Oklahoma, located in Norman, Oklahoma. The conference will highlight recent developments and new research directions in a number of areas that include (but are not limited to): p-harmonic geometry, minimal varieties, geometric flows, complex and Riemannian geometry, conformal geometry, geometry of submanifolds, convex geometry, stochastic geometry, algebraic geometry, geometric measure theory, metric geometry, partial differential equations, several complex variables, Finsler geometry, mathematical physics, and related problems. They represents a wide spectrum of the topic. As a complement of the talks in the conference, the participants will have considerable opportunities to have discussions with the speakers and each other. The Midwest Geometry Conference had been an annual meeting since its founding in 1991 until 2007. This 2012 conference is committed to revive the Midwest Geometry Conference, in addition to bring in researchers of national and international statue, and students around the world to discuss their research and to interact with mathematicians and students from the Midwest and other regions at all levels. Summaries of talks are publicly reported.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is a wonderful event or phenomenon in mathematics that the results of one discipline of thought have startling and unexpected consequences in another. The conference is a valuable networking opportunity, as well as a great venue for dialogue on mathematical concepts, ideas, methods, problems, collaborations, and the direction of mathematics. By design, the Midwest Geometry Conference has two high-impact foci. First, the conference makes it possible for the exchange of ideas among members of the geometry community in the Midwest, as well as dissemination of important recent advances, nationwide and worldwide, in differential geometry, geometric analysis, integral geometry, and related fields in the broad sense. This helps cement research collaborations, brother-sister-hood, and mathematical contact. Second, the conference is committed to create a focused environment, conducive to a lively exchange of ideas, in which members of this regional community can benefit from each other's ideas, and from contact with leading geometers from outside the region. The intent of the conference is to be a top-drawer, cutting-edge research conference, attempting (as much as resources permit) to bring in the appropriate speakers at all levels, independent of where they are based. The conference will reflect, complement, or interact the main areas of focus of geometers in the Midwest. Funds will be used to for the travel and hosting costs for speakers, and participants. Minorities, women, persons with disabilities, graduate students, and junior faculty are especially encouraged to participate and to apply for support. Prior to the conference, experienced conference participants will present one or more introductory warm-up talks for interested graduate and undergraduate students. Public talks will address audiences for the public at large. Other events include Professor Shihshu Walter Wei's third (volunteer) graduate course without extra pay, Math 6683 Differential Geometry II at the University of Oklahoma in the spring of 2012, providing a general background for the conference. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More details for the conference can be found at www2.math.ou.edu/~wwei/mgc2012.html</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Geometry has played an indispensable role in human civilizations and the development of the natural sciences from the earliest times to the present day. Eratosthenes used elementary geometry to take the measure of the earth. Issac Newton explained the motion of the planets around the sun by means of the calculus. EinsteinÆs theory of relativity is heavily dependent on a four-dimensional geometric formalism. In fact, the relativity theory of Einstein would not have been possible without the Differential Geometry developed fifty years before him by Levi-Civita. Recent advances in our understanding of molecular and nuclear structure, elementary particle physics, quantum theory and the nature of the universe could not have been made without the essential dependence on an advance mathematical machinery, especially geometric concepts, ideas, methods and tools. Recent mathematical developments in geometric analysis have had a major impact on the foundations of gravitation theory. The Principal Investigator (PI) feels it is fair to say that geometry has provided the foundations for a significant number of great advances in science and technology, and our present understanding of the natural sciences could not have been reached without the underpinning which geometry provides.  The Midwest Geometry Conference is an annual meeting that started in 1991, and operated until 2007, when it ended due to the loss of key stakeholders.  As the PI was part of the conference's founding group and the only active cofounder-organizer of the conference who remains in the Midwest, the PI is committed to lead its revival.  This revival helps in creating and maintaining a cohesive research infrastructure in the middle of the country.     The award supports the 2012 Midwest Geometry Conference  http://www2.math.ou.edu/~wwei/mgc2012.html  and the 2013 Midwest Geometry Conference  https://www.math.okstate.edu/~wli/MidwestGeo2013/conf13.html  The revival of the Midwest Geometry Conference is extremely significant and indispensable, as in the Midwest, several hundred kilometers typically separate one research department from another, formal measures must be taken. The revival has also led to the conference proceedings that will be published in the Contemporary Mathematics Volume Series of the American Mathematics Society.  The 2012 and 2013 Conferences have made it possible for the exchange of ideas among members of the geometry community in the Midwest, as well as the dissemination of important recent advances worldwide, in differential geometry, geometric analysis, and related fields. This helps cement research collaborations and brother-sister-hood. The conferences are committed to create a focused environment, conducive to a lively exchange of ideas, in which members of this regional community can benefit from each other's ideas, and from contact with leading geometers from outside the region.

It helps broaden graduate studentsÆ research and offers insight into the understanding of geometric analysis of interdisciplinary nature, diversity, and interconnectedness. A presentation that a student made at the 2012 conference helped her to network with other scholars in her field, and much of the recent progress she made in her research has been thanks to such national(and international) collaboration with scholar she has met at the conference.  The conference also helps in keeping abreast of the "live" scene of what the state-of-arts are. Prior to the conference, experienced participants presented introductory warm-up talks for interested students.
