<AbstractNarration>Opportunities to address new scientific questions at continental scales have been growing enormously over the past decade or so, as new networks and knowledgebases are developed and deployed at a rapid rate. While ecosystem ecologists are used to addressing questions on such scales (productivity of biomes, global nitrogen cycles), population and community ecologists have less experience working at these spatial scales. The award provides funds to support two joint, co-occurring workshops, one for early-career population and community ecologists to develop research plans for continental scale questions on population and community ecology, and the other for undergraduate students to explore ways to apply continental and regional scale knowledgebases and tools to environmental policy issues. The proposed workshops would bring large scale data and analytical tools to the attention of young career scientists and undergraduates in population and community ecology.  Practitioners at landscape and ecosystem levels are more comfortable with these tools, but population and community ecologists need to be encourages to explore questions at larger scales than plots and transects. The award will enable a broader movement in ecology towards the use of networks, global knowledgebases and distributed public data. The workshops will provide training, ideas, and collaborative network for students and early career scientists who wish to 'scale-up' in the questions addressed in community and population ecology.</AbstractNarration>

Through the student workshop, "Scaling Up: Future of Environmental Decisions, A Workshop for Students," participants were introduced to the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) infrastructure project, provided opportunities to gain 21st century skills in data/mapping technologies and public communications, network with local organizations, and explore potential ecology and environmental science careers.  Further, ESA partnered with the Quantitative Undergraduate Biology Education and Synthesis (QUBES) project and recruited faculty especially from minority-serving institutions and primarily undergraduate institutions to implement the concept of ecological scale in undergraduate education through 1) existing teaching resources from ESA?s Teaching Issues and Experiments in Ecology (TIEE) education journal and 2) the development of new teaching resources that will be submitted to TIEE for publication.  These resources provide models for curriculum that will utilize NEON data in education in the near future.   Both the student workshop and the faculty mentoring networks resulted in deeper appreciation related to data use, including: data management, data relevance, data scale, data skepticism and data tools. In particular, nearly 96% of all participants in the Scaling Up student workshop indicated they learned how NEON data will be able to help address environmental management solutions.

In conclusion, these combined workshops provided students a valuable opportunity to learn how to use large scale data and understand its practical applications, and gave researchers accustomed to working at relatively small spatial scales a new understanding of how to scale up their research to continental levels, and helped them form new research collaborations.
