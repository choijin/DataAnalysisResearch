<AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit: The border between the interior and exterior of a living cell is a membrane that is only a few nanometers thick.  Proteins embedded in cell membranes are the molecular machines that control the flow of matter, energy and information across the border of the cell, and understanding their structures helps to understand how they function. Unfortunately, structural techniques like crystallography and NMR don't work as well for membrane proteins, so new methods are needed.  This research project will develop new molecular probes and experimental methods that will provide information on protein structure. The new probes take advantage of the remarkable magnetic properties of ions of the element gadolinium (Gd3+), which are already used to enhance contrast in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). When excited by a laser inside a very high magnetic field, gadolinium ions precess (wobble) like tops at a frequency of 240 billion cycles per second (240 gigahertz); this occurs about 20,000 times before relaxing most of the way to thermal equilibrium.  When a Gd3+ ion is close to another, it relaxes more quickly. Moreover, when the two are less than 10 nanometers apart, the precession amplitude oscillates between the two ions at a "beat frequency" that varies sensitively with the distance between the ions. Together, the relaxation times, precession frequencies, and beat frequency give distance (and ultimately structural) information. These parameters will be measured using newly developed electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectrometers at UC Santa Barbara (240 gigahertz) and the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel (95 gigahertz).  To calibrate the new methodologies, measurements of the distance between gadolinium ions will be performed on "ruler" compounds consisting of Gd3+ ions separated by a stiff, linear polymer to known distances between 2 and 12 nm. Distance measurements will then be performed between carefully-chosen sites on proteorhodopsin.  Proteorhodopsin is a light-activated proton pump isolated from a marine bacterium and is similar in structure to membrane proteins that occur in all other organisms.       &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts: The project is a new interdisciplinary international collaboration between the U. S. (Song-I Han and Mark Sherwin, UC Santa Barbara), Israel (Daniella Goldfarb, Weizmann Institute of Science), and Germany (Adelheidt Godt, University of Bielefeld, probe synthesis).  The collaborators and co-PI are female physicists with considerable expertise in developing new technology.  This proposal will support two graduate students and one undergraduate.  These students are cross-trained by shuttling between the Han lab (physical chemistry and biochemistry) and the Sherwin lab (experimental physics), and are thus immersed in the science of "soft matter," magnetic resonance, proteins, microwave electronics, terahertz science and technology, and visible optics. Students also will perform experiments in the remarkable magnetic resonance community at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel, greatly enriching their training with an international scientific experience.  The Gd3+ spin labels and high-field electron paramagnetic resonance techniques that the students develop will enable new studies of membrane proteins in life-like environments by many other scientists.  These labels are stable enough to be used inside the complex environment of living cells, where measurements of protein structure and dynamics are most interesting but also most challenging.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Proteins are molecular machines that enable life as we know it.    The last two decades have seen a revolution in humanity's understanding of the structure of proteins&mdash;more than 100,000 3-D protein structures are now stored in a publicly accessible protein data bank.  One can think of these structures as blueprints, or still photographs, of proteins.  While structures are necessary to understanding how proteins function, they are not sufficient.  Imagine that one had a photograph of a sewing machine, but had never seen one in action.  It would be rather challenging to figure out how it worked.  A movie would be much more illuminating.  An important frontier in molecular biology is to understand how proteins move while they are performing their functions in a life-like environment.   Membrane proteins, which control the flow of matter, energy and information between the interior and exterior of a cell, are particularly interesting.  The primary motivation for the research performed with this award was to develop a new research tool  that will, eventually, enable "filming" proteins in action.  This problem is as challenging as it is important.  The challenges of "filming" proteins include their tiny size&mdash;proteins are hundreds of times smaller than the wavelength of visible light, so a light microscope will not help-- and the complexity of their natural environment, which is crowded with other proteins as well as water, fatty material, and other biological molecules.     Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) is a powerful technique for studying the local environment of paramagnetic centers, which can be either electrons that are not participating in an atomic bond, or magnetic atoms like Iron. In order to study structure and motion of proteins using EPR, small label molecules containing paramagnetic centers are attached to one or two locations on the protein.  Research performed under this award has expanded the capabilities of EPR by working at high magnetic fields, where the technique is more sensitive, but where technical challenges have historically slowed progress.  Graduate students working with support from this award have shown that new paramagnetic labels based on gadolinium ions (Gd) are exceptionally well-suited for use at high magnetic fields. When used in pairs, Gd labels couple like tiny bar magnets brought close together. By measuring the strength of this coupling with EPR, it is possible to infer the distance between the labels and hence the distance between two locations on the protein to which the labels are attached.   With Gd-based labels and the simplest form of high-field EPR, work supported by this award has shown that distances of more than 3 nm can be measured, which is about twice as far as was possible previously. More importantly, these distance measurements also work at room temperature, and, as shown by others, Gd labels are stable even in cells.  Work supported by this award has thus laid important groundwork for the ultimate goal of using high-field EPR to "film" proteins in action.
