<AbstractNarration>Mosses, liverworts and hornworts (bryophytes) are modern representatives of the earliest plants that colonized land approximately 500 million years ago; they remain key components of modern ecosystems.  Scientists from two biological disciplines approach the study of bryophytes in very different ways, with evolutionary biologists focusing on understanding diversity of all bryophytes and plant genomicists focusing on a single genetic model species within bryophytes to better understand gene function.  Cross-disciplinary efforts are challenging yet they lead to a synthetic understanding of the evolution of both genes and species, greatly advancing our understanding of the origins of biodiversity.  This award supports student participation in a joint conference on the evolution and genomics of bryophytes, and will engage early career scientists in activities that lay the groundwork for future cross-disciplinary collaborations.  Additionally, it will engage teachers of grades 4-12 in a professional development day, and provide them with expertise and tools to advance the understanding of biology in their students.</AbstractNarration>
