<AbstractNarration>The research objective of this grant is to understand the fundamental process of aging of glassy materials from a statistical and microscopic point of view.  Aging of glassy materials is a long standing problem:  a glass is an out-of-equilibrium material, so its mechanical and electrical properties change over time, but the microscopic reasons for this are still unknown.  Understanding aging has implications for extending the lifetime of products made from glassy materials (both "regular" glass and plastics).  This project involves simulations of glassy systems and will employ novel statistical techniques to reconstruct local elastic properties of the material.  We will learn how these properties change during the aging process.  Complementary experiments will be conducted on colloidal glasses, a well-characterized model system which exhibits aging.  Due to the limited amount of data the experiments can obtain - and more fundamentally, the limited data one can obtain before a system ages into a new state - we will need to extend statistical techniques from bioinformatics and econometrics to be able to the relevant information from our data.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The developed statistical techniques will be useful in a variety of applications beyond aging or materials science.  Of equal importance is understanding the fundamental mechanisms of aging in glassy systems, which may have a long-term impact on how glassy materials are produced.  The students involved in this project will gain interdisciplinary experience, as the project merges physics and engineering, statistics and soft materials, statistical mechanics theory and microscopy experiments.  Outreach efforts will target Pittsburgh area high schools with under-represented populations and will target Atlanta area K-12 students via "Squishy Physics" field trips.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Glass is an unusual material:  the molecules in a glass are disordered like a liquid, yet glass is a solid.  Additionally, glass is out of equilibrium:  the properties of a glassy material, such as its density, slowly change over a very long time.  This slow changing of a glass is known as aging.  The goal of this project has been to understand how glasses are formed and how they age.  One major thrust of this project was the study of "energy landscapes."  Consider a regular landscape on Earth:  the height above sea-level could be considered as a mathematical function of latitude and longitude.  Knowing this function allows someone to predict that a ball placed at a given latitude and longitude would roll downhill by moving in a specific direction.  In the 1960?s Martin Goldstein extended this idea by noting that the energy of a system could be expressed in terms of the coordinates of all of the atoms in the system.  Like a ball seeking the lowest height, the system tries to minimize its energy.  However, all the coordinates of all the atoms is a much larger set of coordinates than latitude and longitude.  Indeed, while Goldstein?s idea has been quite useful for scientists, it is not something that can be visualized -- unlike a topographic map of an ordinary landscape.  Nonetheless, scientists thinking about glassy materials find the idea of an energy landscape quite useful.  For example, an aging glass which is slowly changing its properties can be thought of as the system exploring the landscape and finding progressively deeper valleys, in an attempt to minimize its energy.  In our work, we investigated the energy landscape of a simple model system consisting of three particles that could only move two-dimensionally.  By noting certain mathematical properties of the system we could fully describe the system with just one coordinate.  Simplifying the description let us visualize the energy landscape in a simple way, something impossible for more complicated systems.  Our energy landscape had two "valleys" separated by a "peak."  If we considered the system at a hot temperature, the system could move between the two valleys by crossing the peak.  We could also change the density of our system in such a way that we could increase the peak height and thus make it harder to change valleys.  We thus directly showed a connection between the energy landscape and the system behavior.  By making the system denser or lowering the temperature, we showed how the changes in the energy landscape lead to glassy behavior in our simple system.  A second major thrust was an investigation comparing two-dimensional and three-dimensional glasses, and in particular comparing the glass transition:  how such samples behave as they are cooled and become glassy.  Phase transitions (like water freezing into ice) significantly differ between two-dimensional and three-dimensional systems, but the influence of dimensionality on the glass transition is unresolved.  We used colloids as a model of the glass transition:  these samples are composed of micron-sized particles in a liquid, and the particles diffuse due to Brownian motion.  At sufficiently high concentration, the particle diffusion is negligible and the sample is considered glassy.  We used microscopy to study colloidal systems as they approach their glass transitions at high concentrations.  In particular, we had some samples that were three dimensional, and others where the particles were in a flat two-dimensional layer.  We found differences between 2D and 3D. In 2D particles can undergo large displacements without changing their position relative to their neighbors, in contrast with 3D.  We showed that this is related to a well-known fluctuations seen in 2D solids, the Mermin-Wagner long-wavelength fluctuations, which influence phase transitions in 2D.  When we changed our analysis to ignore these fluctuations, 2D and 3D have similar behavior as the glass transition is approached.  Our work shows that the long wavelength fluctuations do not cause a fundamental distinction between 2D and 3D glass transitions.  That is, 2D samples have this interesting extra behavior (the Mermin-Wagner fluctuations) but this does not have anything to do with the glass transition.  Additionally, during the course of this grant period we conducted several field trips where first grade students visited our laboratory.  When the students visited, they played with soft "glassy" materials such as corn starch and water; they did experiments studying sand; and they filmed interesting phenomena using our high-speed video camera (such as lighting a match).  We also had one field trip of high school students who came to visit.  Several undergraduates were involved with the research.  Two plan to go to physics graduate school, and one is currently working in industry.  Of the Ph.D. students involved in this research, several are still at Emory and plan to graduate soon, and one is a postdoctoral fellow at another university.
