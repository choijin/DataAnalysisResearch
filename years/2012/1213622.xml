<AbstractNarration>With support from the Chemical Measurement and Imaging (CMI) and Macromolecular, Supramolecular, and Nanochemistry (MSN) Programs in the Division of Chemistry, Professor Michael Strano at Massachusetts Institute of Technology and his group will develop new chemical tools to recognize and communicate the binding of molecules to the nanotube interface using non-covalent approaches.  Specifically, the investigator plans to 1) study several molecular recognition interactions through structure/property relationships of absorbed amphiphilic polymer; 2) construct a visible/near infrared dual channel single molecule imaging microscope to study molecular recognition at the nanotube surface; 3) synthesize new polymeric recognition sites based on an amphiphilic loop structure as a means of molecular recognition, such as boronic acid-poly ethylene glycol polymer brushes and a looped PEG motif; and 4) explore variants of a Ni2+ chelator-based protein recognition approach to extend to glycoprotein detection and profiling.  The proposed research, if successful, will advance understanding about how chemical interfaces at the carbon nanotube surface influence exciton radiative recombination, and the learned knowledge will impact biosensing, bioimaging, as well fields beyond life science research.  In addition to engaging undergraduate students in research and education, Professor Strano also proposes to disseminate research results through public media and continuously collaborate with a high school teach to broaden impacts at the K-12 level.</AbstractNarration>
