<AbstractNarration>Doctoral Dissertation Research: Legal Culture and Compliance&lt;br/&gt;Elizabeth Boyle&lt;br/&gt;Wenjie Liao&lt;br/&gt;University of Minnesota&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Despite China's numerous recent transitions and low level of democracy, the Chinese people trust and embrace &lt;br/&gt;their courts and legal system above any other social institutions. This research examines how and why people &lt;br/&gt;in an authoritarian and changing society understand, valorize, and obey the law. While some suggest &lt;br/&gt;that either coercion or legitimacy is the central explanation, we go further to test the interrelationship &lt;br/&gt;of these factors. We hypothesize that the precise role each plays will vary with the type of law considered.&lt;br/&gt;To better understand the role of societal transitions on support for law, we explore how memories of important &lt;br/&gt;historical events and figures affect the level and nature of support for law. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research design combines a social survey and in-depth interviews in a major provincial capital city, Chengdu,&lt;br/&gt;in southwest inland China. The survey will inquire about people's tendency toward legal (non-)compliance &lt;br/&gt;and their evaluation of different types of laws in terms of their legitimacy (i.e., how much they think each law &lt;br/&gt;reflects social values they support)and associated punishments (i.e., how likely they think the violation of &lt;br/&gt;certain laws will entail harsh punishment).  The survey also inquires about memories of important events and &lt;br/&gt;figures in Chinese history.  The survey will be followed by semi-structured interviews with a subsample&lt;br/&gt;of the respondents. The interviews will uncover the mechanisms that shape people's perceptions of laws' legitimacy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: This project expands legal compliance research beyond the boundaries of the Western world.&lt;br/&gt;With a quarter of the world's population, China constitutes one of the largest and most influential&lt;br/&gt;societies in transition. A careful look into legal compliance in China will deepen understanding of how power and &lt;br/&gt;authority shape individuals' minds. It will produce data for more comprehensive insight into Chinese society and &lt;br/&gt;culture that will be shared in scholarly communities inside and outside of China.</AbstractNarration>
