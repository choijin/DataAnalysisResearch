<AbstractNarration>Tanana Chiefs Conference (TCC) is a Native non-profit organization that is actively engaged in a variety of educational and land management programs through which it delivers federally funded government services to highly disadvantaged indigenous Athabaskan tribes and individuals in Alaska.  The proposed project is an extension of a TCC developed innovative program that increases educational outcomes for at-risk youth through the medium of archaeological field research.  The TCC approach combines student participation in weeklong scientific expeditions with guided study in Alaskan wilderness settings.  By design, the field and learning situation are emotionally intense, in a way that kindles individual commitment and nurture small-group social solidarity.  Also by design, TCC draws the student and instructor cohorts from a multi-ethnic, multi-cultural demographic pool.  In this way, students gather and synthesize effective learning styles from a range of worldviews and behavioral expectations.  This approach also advances a second,TCC goal, the management of cultural resources mandate under the National Historic Preservation Act through archaeological research.  Under TCCs present proposal, these goal related activities will expand by offering more sessions each summer to secondary and undergraduate students from a greater number of educational institutions in Alaska.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Over the three year project period, seven organized sessions with secondary students were convened at prehistoric archaeological sites in Interior Alaska where young investigators experienced original discovery, backcountry living and academic learning. Curriculum for each of the sessions included standard methods of scientific recordation, frontier literature focused on Northern cultures and life-ways, and outdoor living in self-managed wilderness camps. Participating students were integrated into the planning process, implementation of logistics and mobilization and follow-through of individual projects based on the academic instruction and out-of-doors experiences. The project broadened participation in science among disadvantaged youth drawn from alternative urban high schools and secondary students from rural villages, largely represented by Alaska Native peoples. The archaeological field school program emphasized original discovery through experiential learning by following systematic methodologies.</p> <p>Students were drawn from broad institutional organizations including conventional public school districts and a unique university-sponsored summer school immersion program for high school students originating from small remote villages throughout Alaska. The body of student participants spanned a diverse range of social, cultural, economic, ethnic, educational and religious backgrounds. Secondary students were immersed in remote camp settings with limited outside influence and were mentored in small teams through original scientific discoveries at prehistoric archaeological sites. The combined themes of cooperation nurtured through mentoring in small groups, formal academic instruction, interpersonal conflict resolution and wilderness living emerged an outcome of teaching tolerance.</p> <p>Scientific data obtained through formal excavation provided novel information about prehistoric human adaptations in Interior Alaska. Students were challenged to perform at the level of university field school standards and some participants achieved skills that could lead to summer employment as archaeological technicians. A substantive body of data obtained during project activities supported a PhD dissertation project by one of the senior project personnel. Archaeological sites explored during the project include the Linda&rsquo;s Point site at Healy Lake in the Upper Tanana River region of Interior Alaska, the David site located near Calico Bluff on the Upper Yukon River and the Tochak McGrath Discovery site in the village of McGrath on the upper Kuskokwim River. These sites yielded archaeological data relevant to the study of the First Americans, prehistoric movement of toolstone through the headwaters region of the Yukon River basin and novel observations on human biology and archaeological faunal remains reflecting subsistence practices only a couple of centuries before western contact on the Kukoskwim River.</p> <p>The principal investigators on the project developed further relations among scientific colleagues conducting related investigations on prehistoric human adaptations to the subarctic region of Alaska. Project activities led to collaboration and information sharing among Alaska Native organizations and peoples across Interior Alaska. Specific activities conducted under the grant led to collaboration with another NSF funded project (Grant 1521501) on the prehistory of Interior Alaska with a strong education component that directly links to the outcome of this project.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 10/12/2017<br>      Modified by: Robert&nbsp;A&nbsp;Sattler</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1216401/1216401_10211483_1507841192719_RAHI_Younie_LindasPoint--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1216401/1216401_10211483_1507841192719_RAHI_Younie_LindasPoint--rgov-800width.jpg" title="RAHI Students at Linda's Point site"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1216401/1216401_10211483_1507841192719_RAHI_Younie_LindasPoint--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="RAHI Students at Linda's Point site"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Gathering of Rural Alaska Honors Institute students around the excavation block for instruction by Angela Younie (in foreground, right).
