<AbstractNarration>****Technical Abstract****&lt;br/&gt;This collaborative project between Mount Holyoke College and the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, explores magnetic states in ferromagnetic nanostructures by applying a local circular field generated by passing current through the tip of an atomic force microscope, as well as applying current pulses through the AFM tip or fabricated leads on the sample.  These techniques will allow for separate control over the vortex and vortex core of magnetic disks, as well as manipulation of individual domain walls (DWs) in wires to investigate the physics of different types of DWs and interactions between them.  Sufficiently thin ferromagnetic nanorings are predicted to have unique states that consist of pairs of 360 degrees domain walls (DWs) when switching between vortex states in an applied circular field.  Understanding DWs and circular nano-structures will inform the next generation of data storage devices.  This work will involve the undergraduate women at Mount Holyoke College, as well as post-docs and graduate students, fostering frequent interaction between the two institutions.  Furthermore, curricular material on magnetism will be developed for established programs with K12 teachers and the nearby Springfield Technical Community College, and a local Science Café will be created, bringing experts in science and technology to speak with the general public in an informal setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;****Non-Technical Abstract****&lt;br/&gt;Computer hard drives presently store information in binary bits of "1" and "0" that are encoded in what are effectively little bar magnets with either the north or south pole pointing up.  There are a variety of proposals for improved data storage devices, including circular nanostructures that could store the "1" and "0" in a unique clockwise or counterclockwise "vortex" state, and devices that store information in the domain walls that form between oppositely magnetized sections of a wire.  Traditionally, magnetization has been studied using uniform external fields.  This collaborative project between Mount Holyoke College (MHC) and the University of Massachusetts, Amherst (UMass), uses a recently developed technique to investigate magnetic states by generating a local non-uniform, circular magnetic field by precisely positioning a tiny wire and passing a current through the wire that creates the magnetic field. This work will involve the undergraduate women at Mount Holyoke College, as well as post-docs and graduate students, fostering frequent interaction between the two institutions.  Curricular material on magnetism will be developed for established programs with K12 teachers and the nearby Springfield Technical Community College and a Science Café will be created, bringing experts in science and technology to speak with the general public in an informal setting.</AbstractNarration>

A circular field allows us to study the switching behavior between these vortex states.  We have developed an experimental technique to apply a local circular field by passing current through the tip of an atomic force microscope.  We predict novel states that consist of 360 degree domain walls that arise from both energy minimization and topological constraints.    Typical data storage is accomplished with a two-state system, corresponding to "1" and "0" and storing information in binary.  We have proposed a multi-level data storage device that would enable potentially five states to be stored on one bit.  An alternative data storage device involves "racetrack memory" which requires densely packing domain walls along a ferromagnetic strip.  We have explored the physics of closely packed 360 degree domain walls and proposed a method to experimentally investigate these structures in the laboratory.    Undergraduates have been a critical part of this research effort, including the female students from Mount Holyoke College (a women?s college), enabling positive interactions between the undergraduates, graduate students, and post docs at Mount Holyoke College and the University of Massachusetts, Amherst.        The PI founded SciTech Caf&eacute;, which held its inaugural event in September of 2012.  We are now in our 5th year, holding eight events a year with an audience of over 100 people.  SciTech Caf&eacute; strives to share the excitement that scientists feel about their work with people who have little or no background by bringing various guest speaker scientists to interact with the public in an informal setting.   Questions are strongly encouraged, and are what make SciTech Caf&eacute; a truly unique event among typical popular science opportunities for non-scientists.  The audience ranges in age from 4-yr-olds to retired persons, with questions being asked across the generations.  The PI promotes the events on a local radio show, talking about science for 2 &ndash; 10 minutes once a month on the radio.
