<AbstractNarration>In robotics activities, students are theorized to benefit from "learning-by-doing" activities where they set their own goals, but in practice, these activities have failed to produce the expected effects on STEM outcomes. To improve learning from robotics, this project will leverage teachable agent technologies, where students learn about a domain by teaching a computer agent. The agent interacts with students to expose misconceptions and encourage them to persist in the face of failure. By integrating the structure of teachable agents with the exploratory and engaging features of learning from robotics, the project will enhance the benefits of both approaches. The investigators will implement a robot that students can teach about the concepts they are learning in their middle school mathematics class. They will engage in design exercises with teachers and students to identify features of the robot that might be particularly important for improving student motivation and learning. Finally, they will conduct two studies, one in the laboratory and one in the classroom, to explore how students react to the robot in a realistic setting. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit: The project will improve understanding of what features students respond to in a teachable robot for mathematics, and of the potential educational benefits such a robot might have. The project will make a technological contribution by inventing methods for integrating teachable agents and robotic learning environments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts:  The project will impact middle school students from underrepresented groups who will help design and test the teachable robot, exposing them to new technologies and engaging aspects of STEM careers.  The project will also lead to a better understanding of the impact of teachable robots in the classroom and pave the way for these technologies to be adopted more widely in education.</AbstractNarration>
