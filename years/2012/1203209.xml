<AbstractNarration>This award supports the travel of three language scholars, Dr. Seikman, Dr. Thorne, and Dr. John and graduate student Ms. Sikorski, to participate in the 3rd International Conference on Language Education and Diversity in New Zealand.  The group will be participating in the conference and presenting their research on language immersion programs among the Yup?ik of southwestern Alaska.  Dr. John and Ms. Sikorski are Alaska Natives and language scholars of Yup?ik and Gwich?in.  The research presented will inform the linguistics community about indigenous models of language acquisition and the award supports the science careers of two scholars from underrepresented groups and early career faculty through participation in this global conference on language education and diversity.</AbstractNarration>
