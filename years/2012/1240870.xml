<AbstractNarration>Human activities have dramatically increased nitrogen inputs into many rivers and lakes, causing algal blooms that threaten economic and recreational uses of those waters. Lake Taihu, the third largest lake in China, experiences damaging blooms of toxic cyanobacteria as a result of excessive nutrient inputs. The identities, nitrogen processing capabilities, and activities of microbial communities in Lake Taihu will be examined to determine if nitrogen processing can be predicted from knowledge of the identity and genetic makeup of those communities. Various components of the nitrogen cycle will be measured and linked to representative molecular markers which, coupled with high throughput genetic sequencing, will provide a genetic database of nitrogen-cycling processes in freshwater ecosystems. A goal of the project will be to link microbial taxonomic, genetic, and functional data in a model that can predict how reduction of nutrient inputs will affect toxic cyanobacterial blooms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will have broad applicability to the management of aquatic systems that are threatened by excessive nutrient inputs, a problem that is increasing worldwide. Additional broader impacts will include training of high school, undergraduate, and graduate students, international student exchanges, training of a postdoctoral researcher, and incorporation of science journalism students into field studies to promote adult scientific literacy.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Research in Lake Tai (Taihu) China has focused on how environmental factors drive the formation and maintenance of blooms by the toxic cyanobacterium Microcystis. High-throughput RNA sequencing has revealed that populations of Microcystis use multiple strategies to dominate microbial communities in this lake during warm summer months, and then a subsequence suite of parallel strategies to maintain their dominance.  The research has shown that Microcystis uses active transport systems for multiple forms of phosphorus and nitrogen (including urea) during bloom events. Moreover, efforts have demonstrated that the ability of Microcystis to both drive up the pH of the system then to dominate growth at higher pHs is a leading factor in its success.  Parallel efforts have also demonstrated that the activity of the entire microbial community is important in the formation of bloom events.  Heterotrophic bacteria in regions of Taihu contribute to nitrogen cycling in the lake: this includes the fixation of N gas by these bacteria.  Finally, work has shown that abundant viruses in this system can infect and potentially lyse Microcystis populations, moving toxin from the particulate phase to the continuum of dissolved-particulate material that makes up viral lysates.  In contrast, the presence of a large populations of lysogenized Microcystis has resulted in the generation of new hypotheses regarding the proliferation of microbial cells at high densities in the presence of viruses: observations that provide new insight into the ecological success of Microcystis and other microbial bloom formers.
