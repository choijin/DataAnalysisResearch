<AbstractNarration>The project will repeat a field campaign that was previously funded but could not be completed due to technical problems with the AUV Sentry. The objective is to establish a geomagnetic record for the Hawaiian Jurassic Basin by collecting high-resolution near-bottom magnetic data. Using this record, along with pre-existing data from the Japanese lineation set, the proposed work will determine whether geomagnetic field behavior was globally coherent during the Mid-Jurassic, enabling construction of a more robust geomagnetic polarity time scale for this period. Upgrades to the AUV Sentry are planned to ensure that the project does not experience the same problems that confounded the original expedition. The project will support a female early career investigator. Following on the success of outreach and education efforts on the original cruise, the investigators will recruit and mentor graduate and undergraduate student watchstanders. Data and results will be made available to scientists and the public via papers and presentations, WHOI outreach facilities, the lab groups website, and the Marine Geoscience Data System</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This award supported us to demonstrate for the first time the cause of the Jurassic Quiet Zone (JQZ), a feature of the oldest magnetic anomalies over the ocean basins.  As the question of what caused the JQZ has been a long-standing, unresolved problem and because of the unique characteristics of the JQZ and its implications for the behavior of the geomagnetic field, we believe our results to be of wide interest to a broader community.   Our proposed study is based on magnetic field data acquired in the western Pacific seafloor over two magnetic anomaly lineation sets, the Japanese lineations and the Hawaiian lineations.  Our previously published data from the Japanese lineations showed magnetic anomalies with decreasing amplitudes going backwards in time into the Jurassic, reaching a minimum in a zone termed the "low amplitude zone" (LAZ) and increasing once again on the other side.  A critical problem with prior data was that with a record from only one location, it was unclear whether the changes in anomaly character represent global magnetic field phenomena or local tectonic complications.   With this award, we successfully obtained new data from the Hawaiian magnetic lineations (i.e., a different location) that display analogous behavior sailing on R/V Sikuliaq cruise SKQ201402S. We have trained one early career female scientist, 7 graduate and undergraduate students from 4 different institutions.  Based on our study, magnetic anomaly amplitudes decrease backwards in time to the LAZ, which is now recognized in two locations, and increase once again going farther back in time.  By showing this consistent magnetic anomaly behavior in two widely separated locations, we demonstrate that the magnetic anomalies show geomagnetic field behavior rather than tectonic complications.  Furthermore, the LAZ in both anomaly sets is a region where the magnetic anomalies are very small compared with common magnetic anomalies elsewhere in the geomagnetic polarity time scale. Independent observations in rock record indicate that the Jurassic was a time of low magnetic field intensity and that magnetic reversals were occurring, so the tiny magnetic anomalies around the LAZ indicate a time of low field intensity with rapid reversal rate. We assume that the JQZ represents different planetary activities that generate geomagnetic dipole field: an end-member state of the geomagnetic field behavior with low intensity with frequent reversals or a period in which non-dipole fields dominate (i.e., a field with ill-defined polarity).
