<AbstractNarration>This award provides student support for the Twenty-Third International Solid Freeform Fabrication Symposium to be held August 6-8, 2012 in Austin, Texas. The meeting is comprised of plenary and parallel session technical presentations and a poster session. There is ample time allotted for informal interactions of world-class researchers and students in formal meeting settings and also at informal social events during the meeting. Approximately 150 persons will attend, with approximately 50 of these participants being students. The two "FAME" awards will be given for the fourth time. The first is a senior award called the "Freeform and Additive Manufacturing Excellence" (FAME) Award. The second is an award to recognize researchers early in their career, the Award for "Outstanding Young Research in Freeform and Additive Manufacturing". There will also be a special session on sustainability and additive manufacturing. The conference will bring together world experts in the area to update and extend their understanding of advances in the technology. All meeting papers will be published in a conference proceedings to be distributed to all participants including students. The award will support approximately 50 students. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This conference is a mechanism for transfer and dissemination of knowledge and understanding in the field of additive, freeform manufacturing. It is a model for advancing discovery and understanding while promoting teaching, training and learning. The networking of world-class researchers with students is strong. The meeting is a pinion for research infrastructure. Through the heavily cited proceedings, information is widely disseminated to an extensive network of researchers and students around the world. The societal impact includes identification of pre-commercial technologies and sharing of information pertaining to freeform fabrication that will eventually be developed and implemented into machines and processes that will enhance domestic productivity.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This grant helped to support student participation in the Twenty-Third International Solid Freeform Fabrication (SFF) Symposium.  The symposium took place on August 6-8, 2012 in Austin, Texas at The University of Texas at Austin.  It included papers on computer interfaces with SFF, materials processing and properties associated with SFF and machine design and process development for SFF.   Funds offset student registrations which enabled students to come and participate.  There were 46 students at the meeting which represented approximately 27% of the entire meeting participation.  The meeting had 96 oral presentations and 18 poster presentations.  Seventy nine papers were included in the proceedings.  Authors had an option to have their papers peer reviewed prior to publication.  The Twenty-Third International Solid Freeform Fabrication Symposium, held at The University of Texas at Austin on August 6-8, 2012, was attended by 169 national and international researchers. The Symposium was organized in a manner to allow the multidisciplinary nature of the SFF research to be presented coherently, with various sessions emphasizing computer interfacing and modeling, machine and process development and materials and materials processing for SFF.  The three-day event was completely composed of individual oral presentations to accommodate the demand for this dissemination format.  The parallel sessions were split into three sessions to meet demand, and a poster session allowed researchers to present in this format.  We believe that documenting the changing state of the art in additive manufacturing as represented by the meeting proceedings serves both the people presently involved in this fruitful technical area as well as the flux of new researchers and users entering the field.  In 2012, a special plenary session was organized on the societal impact of additive manufacturing.  Speakers were leading experts in the field.  The session was introduced by Terry Wohlers of Wohlers Associates, a leading expert in the AM market.  Overview presentations were made on the impact of AM in the United Kingdom, China and the United States.  Several university technology transitioning programs were presented, including efforts by the University of Texas at El Paso to reach out to minorities, Georgia TechÆs MENTOR Program targeted for high school students and a jointly developed AM design curriculum at The University of Texas at Austin and Virginia Tech.  There was a presentation by the Chair of the ASTM F42 Additive Manufacturing Technical Committee (Stucker) on the impact standards are making in society.  The session closed with a perspective presentation by Ian Gibson, a professor at the National University of Singapore, Regional Editor of the Rapid Prototyping Journal and longtime member of the AM community.  Information on the SFF Symposium was made available through the worldwide web at http://utwired.engr.utexas.edu.lff/.  On-line registration forms, hotel information, general information brochure, proceedings order form, maps and the previous yearÆs talk titles were all available.  The SFF Symposium mailing address is sffsymp@uts.cc.utexas.edu.       Last Modified: 05/03/2013       Submitted by: David L Bourell]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
