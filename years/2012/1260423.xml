<AbstractNarration>This award satisfies Division B, Title V, Sec. 543 of the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act of 2013 (P.L. 113-6, enacted on March 26, 2013).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project examines the efforts of the US government to influence countries around the world to fight human trafficking. The project's intellectual impact is to improve our understanding of diplomacy and of how the international community can encourage governments to undertake domestic reforms through different strategies such as persuasion, shaming and economic pressure. The project thus contributes to core questions about power and mechanisms of influence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The US has a strong program against trafficking in persons: every year since 2001 the US State Department has reported publically on the efforts of countries around the world to combat human trafficking. The reports themselves are similar to other State Department reports on freedom of religion or human rights, but they differ in one important respect: the issuance of a grade for each country. The State Department uses the reports and the grades to shame and praise countries and issue recommendations, and, backed by national legislation, to threaten recalcitrant states with sanctions. In each country, US embassy staff engage with officials, non-governmental and intergovernmental organizations, and encourage countries to create national anti-trafficking action plans, pass laws, or build shelters. The US also requires national authorities to provide data about their efforts, and criticizes them if they do not. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After ten years, opinions of the program are mixed. This project examines the global reactions to the TIP program and its contribution to promoting some of its recommended anti-trafficking policies in countries around the world. Has the US been able to advance its preferred policies and if so, which states have been most or least responsive, what strategies have worked and which have backfired? The project will rely on multiple sources and methods. The author has gathered over 9000 documents related to diplomacy, news and organizational reports and has also built a database of about 500 relevant NGOs around the world. The research will combine quantitative analysis with content analysis of documents, extensive interviews, and case studies to trace the developments on the ground. The project will proceed at three levels. Level one seeks to explain variation in how countries react to receiving bad grades. Level two focuses on a sub-component of US efforts to push for domestic anti-trafficking laws, and will use both a global quantitative study and a detailed analysis of 26 countries for which the documentary record on the issue is particularly rich. Level three goes deeper using only 7-8 countries to analyze the effect of the entirety of US efforts in the context of other local and international actors. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts will be twofold. First is the practical policy impact: Trafficking is a human rights tragedy that destroys the lives of more than 2.4 million men, women and children every year. Because data on trafficking are still unreliable, this project cannot assess whether the current policy solutions reduce trafficking volume, but it can assess whether diplomatic efforts are succeeding in getting countries to bolster their anti-trafficking efforts and offer prescriptions for improvements. This can be relevant far beyond the specific focus of this project to other efforts to promote policies such as democracy, human rights and various political reforms. The second impact is on education: The project will involve students in teaching and research opportunities, and disseminate project findings widely through conferences, lectures, publications and, with the PI in a school of public policy, also concerted policy engagement.</AbstractNarration>

In particular, how can the international community influence the behavior of countries to comply with political and human rights? The question of influence, or power, has been the holy grail of international relations research. Strategies of influence are difficult to study, however. Often by necessity, much of the research consists of valuable, but unique, historical case studies. Rarely do we have the opportunity to compare how shaming, sanctions, socialization and other efforts to exert influence on a fixed topic might play out in different countries and thus to derive broader insights into the great debates about the relative merits of the different mechanisms of influence. This research project, Scorecard Diplomacy, used a unique opportunity to probe this question. After joining other nations to create the UN Trafficking in Persons (TIP) Protocol in 2000, the United States set itself a distinct goal to combat the growing atrocity of human trafficking. &nbsp;</p> <p><strong>What is human trafficking?</strong></p> <p>Human trafficking is the sale and exploitation of human beings. It differs from smuggling, which illegally moves people across borders at their request. In some ways, the problem is old, linked to traditional forms of slavery going back thousands of years to a time when such exploitation was normal and even legal. The terms &ldquo;human trafficking&rdquo; or &ldquo;trafficking in persons&rdquo; apply to the modern and more varied and hidden forms of severe exploitation of human beings.

In each country, US embassy staff engage with officials, NGOs and IGOs, often funding their work and encouraging countries to take specific actions such as creating national action plans, passing laws, or building shelters.

It explored variation in how countries react to receiving bad grades by systematically analyzing the content of the diplomatic documents across all countries to provide rare, but broad, micro-level evidence on states&rsquo; concern about their reputation and US threats to withdraw aid. The project also focused on a sub-component of US efforts and explored when and how US efforts contributed to domestic criminalization of trafficking. This analysis centered on statistical analysis, as well as a comparison of dozens of countries for which the documentary record on the issue was particularly rich.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>What did we learn?</strong></p> <p>The project showed that &mdash; despite lacking traditional force&mdash;public grades are potent symbols that can evoke countries&rsquo; concerns about their reputations and motivate them to address the problem.&nbsp;It described how this happened, and revealed a fascinating world of diplomacy hitherto entirely unknown outside the State Department. The project developed a framework for analysis called &ldquo;The cycle of Scorecard Diplomacy&rdquo; (Figure 2)</p> <p>The research found that countries react frequently and strongly to the report and ratings with anything from anger to embarrassment to cooperation. &nbsp;Countries included in the TIP Report are more likely to criminalize human trafficking, and this is especially true the harsher their ratings. Scorecard diplomacy influenced their behavior, especially in leading to the criminalization of human trafficking. &nbsp;However, it&rsquo;s not just about criminalization. The US policy also influenced domestic institutions and the implementation of laws in nearly as many instances. The influence was weakest on human trafficking norms, yet a moderate US influence could be traced in at least three cases and a weaker one in seven others. Compared to 2008, the number of prosecutions has increased by 25 percent, and convictions by 58 percent. Compared with 2003, 43 percent more victims are identified. Many countries also now have some designated national agency or commission in charge of anti- TIP efforts. Scorecard diplomacy has a mixed record: it only works sometimes. Much remains to be accomplished. Understanding when countries respond to reputational concerns is important. The research found that whether it works in a given country depends on (1) the country&rsquo;s sensitivity to reputational costs, (2) its exposure to criticisms, and (3) its ability to prioritize the issue.
