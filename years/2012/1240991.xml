<AbstractNarration>As computing systems move to exascale, they will be dominated by energy-efficiency.  This project investigates three aspects related to enabling graphics procesing units (GPUs) to do general purpose computing under this energy-dominated regime.  First, simple architectural innovations allow inter-processor communication.  Second, this mechanism is exposed to the programming API.  Finally, we address domain specific compilation of dense stencil computations.  The project advances architecture, programmability and compilation for energy constrained computation, and also contributes to the foundations of compiling domain specific languages (DSLs) for these platforms through the mathematically rigorous program transformation techniques known as the polyhedral model.  The research also makes secondary contributions to other broad areas relevant to exascale: end-user programmer productivity through the use of DSLs, impacting the future architecture of exascale computers, and exploration of the tradeoff between special-purpose vs general purpose computing.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The objective of the project was to do a preliminary investigation of a novel architecture for very high speed "computation accelerators" called the Stencil Processing Unit.  These processors are specialized to execute an important class of programs called Stencil Computations.  We were able to demonstrate that our proposal had a good potential for saving energy.     We also developed mathematical models and formulae that allow us to predict the energy consumed by such a program.  This allows tools like compilers to quickly estimate the savings of alternative strategies, without actually having to run the program and measuring the energy.  As a result, future comilers will be made much more ecfficient.  The intellectual merit of the project was that it explored a very novel approach to energy efficiency by proposing a completely new architecture for future manchines.  It advanced the foundations of compiling domain specific languages (DSLs) for these platforms through mathematically rigorous program transformation techniques of what is known as the polyhedral model.  The broader impact of the research make contributions to a number of areas relevant to exascale: end-user programmer productivity through the use of DSLs, impacting the future architecture of exascale computers, exploration of the tradeoff between special-purpose vs general purpose computing.
