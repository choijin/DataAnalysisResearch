<AbstractNarration>This award supports the renewal of the Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site at the University of Colorado/JILA.   The intellectual focus of this REU program is physics, and undergraduate students are paired up with preeminent faculty to do cutting-edge research in many fields of physics, including atomic, molecular, and optical physics, biophysics, condensed matter, high energy physics, plasma physics, and physics education research.   Examples of potential  REU projects include theoretical simulation of the interaction of an atom with ultrashort laser pulses, performing microwave spectroscopy of ammonia molecules, fabricating patterned membrane microresonators, imaging biological  structures with atomic force microscopy, using optical tweezers to manipulate and study bacteria cell-to-cell communications, building a magnetic susceptometer for measurements of the superconducting critical temperature of high temperature superconductors, developing and testing of prototype muon detectors, characterizing performance of an electrostatic dust accelerator, and researching the effectiveness of teaching strategies. While the main emphasis of the summer is centered on each student?s individual research lab, where the students are expected to master at least a part of a large task, a variety of other activities take place during the program. These include ethics, electronics, and machining classes, a one-day "Getting Into Grad School" program, as well as lab tours and science seminars aimed at undergraduate students. The program culminates with a day of presentations given by each of the REU students.  This award is supported by the Division of Physics and the Division of Materials Research within the National Science Foundation.</AbstractNarration>

Our program was titled "Research Experience for Undergraduates at   Physics/JILA" and is centered at the University of Colorado Boulder.  Our program website is:  http://www.colorado.edu/physics/Web/reu.  This grant ran for three years and supported nine, eleven and ten undergraduate students during the ten-week summer periods of 2013, 2014, and 2015, respectively. Additionally, eighteen students total (six per year) were supported by the Liquid Crystal MRSEC but joined all of the activities that we organized. Therefore, we effectively had nice-sized groups for all of our group activities, numbering fifteen in 2013, seventeen in 2014, and nineteen students in 2015.  The intellectual focus of this REU   program is physics. Undergraduate students were paired up with pre-eminent   faculty to do cutting-edge research in essentially all fields of physics.   Fields in which the students worked included: Atomic Molecular and Optical   Physics, Condensed Matter Physics, Plasma Physics, Particle Physics, and   Physics Education Research. Every week of the program, one of the   participating professors gave a lecture and a lab tour about their specific   research project. We also had machine shop classes, electronics classes,   ethics lectures, a program on 'getting into grad school', and a number of   social activities.
