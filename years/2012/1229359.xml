<AbstractNarration>The protein purification system that is requested with this proposal is an essential piece of equipment for research characterizing and bioengineering light sensitive proteins from cyanobacteria. It is necessary to separate proteins from the E.coli expression system that are used for bioengineering proteins. The focus of The Spiller Lab is to engineer a small, bright red fluorescent protein tag for in vivo microscopy. Undergraduate, post baccalaureate and glide-year students at Mills College are engaged in the laboratory work.</AbstractNarration>

Our pet name for it is SmuRF protein (Small unexpected Red Fluorescent). The equipment will be shared for our common goals to crystallize and determine the structure of the bioengineered protein that we have isolated at Mills. Protein purification is a very important part of the crystallization process. The project provided opportunities for training and professional development for Mills students. These students gained experience with a cutting edge research project in a well-equipped laboratory. Mills undergraduates participated in many poster sessions at national society meetings and at Mills College. If they go into scientific research in an academic or business or an industrial setting they will have relevant training.</p> <p>Susan C.
