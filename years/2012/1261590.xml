<AbstractNarration>This grant provides funds to help organize the 2013 US National Congress on Computational Mechanics (USNCCM).  The conference will take place on October 10-12, 2011 at Raleigh, North Carolina. The USNCCM conference facilitates the exchange of information on all aspects of computational engineering and science and provides a forum for discussion, education, and recognition of the talents of the computational engineering and science community. The USNCCM conference promotes the development and strengthening of the interfaces between various disciplines in engineering, sciences, and mathematics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 2012 2013 US National Congress on Computational Mechanics will host a student paper/presentation contest and actively seek the participation of groups underrepresented in science and engineering for participation.  The funds provided will support undergraduate, graduate, and post-doctoral students.</AbstractNarration>
