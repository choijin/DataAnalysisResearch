<AbstractNarration>The overarching goal of this award is to study, together with the other coordinated PENGUIn projects, the multi-scale, complex global solar wind-magnetosphere-ionosphere electrodynamic natural system that can impact a variety of human technological systems in space and on the ground. To forecast and thus mitigate that impact, it is necessary to develop accurate physical models of the Sun-Earth system, which is a major goal of the National Space Weather Program. This goal is hampered, however, by the lack of sufficient data to validate global models, particularly in the Southern hemisphere. Therefore, deploying closely-spaced chain of geophysical instruments in the Antarctic makes possible geomagnetically conjugate multi-instrument studies utilizing data with high temporal and spatial resolution from both the Southern and Northern hemispheres. Important aspects of this investigation include (1) the utilization of a collaborative federation of space research instrument operators in both polar regions to improve spatial coverage and access to global data sets, (2) the deployment of autonomous low-power instrument systems along the 40 degree geomagnetic meridian in the Antarctic to improve the spatial distribution of the federated instrument arrays, and (3) near real-time access to the remote Antarctic station measurements through satellite telemetry. The developed technology could be used to support measurement programs in other geophysical disciplines. The project's data are important to several major research initiatives of national importance, including the NSF's GEM and CEDAR programs, the NASA's "Living With a Star" and THEMIS satellite programs, as well as the National Space Weather Program. The data sets will be made available to scientists worldwide via the World Wide Web access while stored in the PENGUIn program and THEMIS satellite databases. The project will train graduate students and post-docs with the development and operation of the deployed instruments, as well as with space weather science investigations. Use of these data to validate space weather models can provide benefit to society as a whole as it aides to protect various navigation, communications, and defense technologies from severe space weather events.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual merit  ASTRA?s main role in this collaborative project was to provide advice and help with data analysis.  ASTRA used data from Antarctica and the northern polar region to investigate three different topics: (1) Understand how GPS TEC near South Pole relates to the larger picture across Antarctica; (2) Show that HF propagation in Antarctica is degraded or lost during D-region absorption events measured by riometers; (3) Understand what are the physical mechanisms causing ionospheric irregularities at high latitudes that cause phase scintillation in GPS receivers.  We studied a phenomenon called Storm Enhanced Density (SED), in which the ionospheric F-layer electron density is enhanced over the polar regions, due to the transport of high density plasma from the dayside midlatitude region. We managed to capture the global structure and evolution of an SED in March 2013, by assimilating both ground-based and space-based data, including ground-based TEC from Antarctica and in-situ Ne measurements from an NSF-funded Cubesat called DICE. This event was unusual in that SEDs were observed simultaneously in both the northern and southern hemispheres. We also produced an assimilative map of the high latitude electrodynamics in both hemispheres for the event, and showed that the plumes of plasma in both hemispheres appear to be related to enhanced electric fields at mid-latitude on the dayside.  We have collected HF radio propagation data since 2012, and showed that for various events, the propagation is degraded or denied during D-region absorption events as measured by riometers. We developed a new D-region absorption model that predicts HF absorption remarkably well in the events studied, although more work is needed.  In collaboration with CUBoulder, we have helped a PhD student to define and complete a PhD thesis focused on understanding the physical mechanisms causing ionospheric irregularities at high latitudes that cause phase scintillation in GPS receivers.  Specifically, GPS scintillation measured by ASTRA receivers in Alaska was compared with data from the Poker Flat Incoherent Scatter Radar. The ISR data revealed spatial and temporal gradients in the ionosphere caused by auroral particle precipitation. In turn, these irregularities caused phase scintillation on the GPS signals. The locations of the scintillation events were superposed on all-sky images of the aurora, and the correlation with auroral images confirmed the relationship between the particle precipitation and the occurrence of phase scintillation.   Broader Impacts  Publications and other output from the project include a book chapter, 6 published papers, 20 conference presentations, and contributions to two PhD theses.  At the same time, we have contributed to education of the broader technical community by giving talks at the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), the US Civil GPS Service Interface Committee, and to a State Congressman from Colorado.  We have also been invited to participate in various US Space Weather Action Plan (SWAP) activities (led by OSTP), including development of the ionospheric section.

Our findings from this project may help engineers to improve their designs for GPS/GNSS systems, or systems that depend on the availability of GPS/GNSS. Similarly, understanding HF propagation, especially absorption, is increasingly important for high latitude communications in airplanes and shipping vessels, especially as the Arctic is opened up due to reduced sea ice.  Collection of the Antarctic GPS and HF datasets at high latitudes is a valuable and rare resource. This dataset will be available for future studies of the ionosphere and of HF propagation in the polar regions. This is increasingly important as the polar ice caps melt and increased shipping and aircraft traffic are present in those regions.  For operational purposes, there is a need to more accurately simulate HF propagation, including the effects of D-region absorption.  The new D-region model developed as part of this project may provide an improvement over current D-region models, enabling more accurate HF propagation prediction, and more reliable HF systems.
