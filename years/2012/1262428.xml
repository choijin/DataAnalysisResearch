<AbstractNarration>This project aims to contribute to numerical algebraic geometry by developing and implementing new algorithms used to solve polynomial systems arising in many applications.  One goal is the development of an algorithm for solving large-scale structured polynomial systems which naturally arise in computing overconstrained mechanisms as well as computing real and singular points on algebraic sets.  This algorithm will utilize the regeneration method, developed by Hauenstein, Sommese, and Wampler, which computes the solutions of a polynomial system by building from the solutions of smaller polynomial systems.  Regeneration together with the exploitation of structure will allow one to solve many naturally occurring polynomial systems which are beyond the reach of current methods.  Another goal is the training of one or more undergraduate students in this area. The students will also help with the development of some of the algorithms and testing of the software developed by this proposal.  Additionally, as a group, we will apply the newly developed algorithms to new problems arising from applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Polynomial systems naturally arise in many areas of science, engineering, economics, and biology with their solutions, for example, describing the design of specialized robots, equilibria of chemical reactions and economic models, and describing the stability of tumors.  The real solutions to these polynomial systems are often of particular interest to researchers as they often describe the physically meaningful solutions, e.g., a constructible robot.  The new algorithms and software developed will allow a broad range of scientists, engineers, and economists who encounter polynomial systems to compute physically meaningful solutions to systems which are beyond the reach of current solving techniques. Additionally, the students involved in this project will gain knowledge and research experience in the mathematical sciences.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Polynomial systems arise in many areas of science and engineering with their solutions describing many interesting phenomena.  This overarching goal of this project was to develop new approaches for solving large-scale polynomial systems and approaches for computing real solutions, which are often the solutions which are physically meaningful.  This project also developed new approaches for handling singular and other ill-posed problems which, for example, allow for one to handle singular real curves on real surfaces so that they can be 3D printed.  Software which implements these new algorithms has been developed and has been used to solve many interesting problems in mathematics, science, and engineering.     The intellectual merits of this project include the development of a new solving algorithm for large-scale structured polynomial systems and its application to computational real algebraic geometry and problems arising in engineering.  The application of this new solving algorithm to compute real solutions of a polynomial system is advances numerical algebraic geometry in the field of computational real algebraic geometry.   The broader impacts of this project include the creation of software which implements the new algorithms developed, the advancement of numerical algebraic geometry into computational real algebraic geometry, and a further interplay between engineering and numerical methods in algebraic geometry.  These new tools and resulting software will expand the use of numerical algebraic geometry in many areas of mathematics, science, and engineering providing many researchers new tools for inquiry, especially in the wide range of areas where large-scale structured polynomial system naturally arise.  This project has also contributed to the human capital on the US by training undergraduate and graduate students in the development of mathematical and computational tools for solving nonlinear systems along with their many applications.
