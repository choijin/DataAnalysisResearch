<AbstractNarration>Planning Grant for an I/UCRC for Freeform Optics (CeFO) &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1238264 University of Rochester; Jannick Rolland &lt;br/&gt;1238278 University of North Carolina at Charlotte; Angela Davies &lt;br/&gt;1238271 Pennsylvania State University; Eric Marsh &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed Center for Freeform Optics aims to advance research and education on the science, engineering and applications of freeform optics through a dedicated, continuing industrial partnership. The research efforts will be anchored by the University of Rochester (UR) as the lead institution, partnered with the Pennsylvania State University (PSU) and the University of North Carolina at Charlotte (UNCC). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed Center will focus on three main research thrusts that include: Fundamentals of Freeform Optics, Advanced Materials for Fabrication and Manufacturing of Freeform Optics, and Optical Testing for Freeform Optics. This Center constitutes a unique research environment combining the strengths of three top-tier research universities with the experiences, insights, and needs of international industrial talent specialized in building systems supporting the manufacturing, integration, and implementation of advanced optical systems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Optical systems with freeform surfaces will usher in the next generation of innovation in sensing, imaging, visualization and diagnostic instrumentation by directing light in not 1-D, but 3-D. Novel designs with 3-D light paths will allow compact optical systems to replace the current in-line designs (packaged by flat fold mirrors) using freeform optics. Applications are emerging that require innovative surface geometries with tight form-accuracy to increase imaging and sensing capabilities and overall optical performance. The participating universities in CeFO are dedicated to the recruitment and retention of female and students from under-represented groups. The aggressive recruitment of students from under-represented groups is one of the Center's top priorities. The primary goal of active student involvement in the Center's research activities is to accelerate the understanding of this new horizon in optical technology by advancing research and education on the engineering and science of freeform optics. Students will work directly with Center industrial members to communicate and transfer key enabling technologies including design, fabrication, assembly, testing, and integration.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This was a planning grant to establish a new Industry/University Collaborative Research Center on Freeform Optics.  Freeform optics are an emerging advanced technology that will allow optical systems to be compact and affordable, with high performance characteristics.  They will lead to advanced systems for industries such as remote sensing, medical devices, lighting, and mobile displays.  This grant allowed us to carry out the planning stage for the new Center, meaning we (i) planned and executed a workshop, (ii) recruited Center members, and (iii) developed and submitted a full proposal to NSF for the future Center.  (i)  Conducted a workshop with potential members and the NSF.  The workshop was held September 20-21, 2012 in the Eastman House in Rochester over 1.5 days. Three academic institutions, the University of Rochester, UNC-Charlotte, and Penn State co-organized and participated in the event. Over 40 companies and organizations attended as potential affiliates (members) of the proposed Center.  (ii) Talked to and worked to recruit more than 40 organizations and companies to the Center.  At the time of full-proposal submission, nine companies agreed to join the future Center and submitted Letters of Commitment to the effect.   (iii)  University of Rochester and UNC-Charlotte partnered on the full proposal and provided the letters of commitment secured from both universities.  In late July, we received the announcement from NSF that the full proposal was awarded.  The I/UCRC Center for Freeform Optics (CeFO) will launch August 1, 2013 and the first IAB meeting will be held in the fall, 2013.  We have developed a website for CeFO - www.optics.rochester.edu/CeFO - where we have disseminated two pdf documents that were published in Optics and Photonics News. In addition the Center director (Dr. Jannick Rolland) gave several invited talks about freeform optics and CeFO at two local OSA chapters, one in Boston and the one in Rochester, and also gave an invited presentation at the University of Arizona, the attendees of  which expressed great interest in the future of freeform optics and in joining the Center. Also the Center director gave an invited talk on freeform optics, June 26, 2013 at COSI, an OSA conference on computational optics and the future of optics.
