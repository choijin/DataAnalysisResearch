<AbstractNarration>Iridescent is a not-for-profit company that develops and implements informal science and engineering experiences for students by facilitating the translation of the work that scientists and engineers do in a way that makes that work accessible to families. The proposal expands the Iridescent outreach activities funded by the Office of Naval Research, to provide a blended combination of in-person and online support to the families of underrepresented populations. The project is producing twenty videos of scientists and engineers presenting their research that are closely aligned with one hundred scientific inquiry and engineering design-based experiments and lesson plans. These digital resources, collectively called the Curiosity Machine, provide opportunities for parents and children to engage in scientific inquiry and engineering design in multiple face-to-face and online environments, including mobile technologies. The evaluation findings from this project provide a model of how to engage STEM education practitioners, teachers and online communities, to substantively connect underserved communities, in both informal and more formal learning environments to develop experiences with engineering design and to improve students' perspectives about and motivations to prepare for STEM careers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Curiosity Machine portal is designed to present scientists and engineers explaining the work that they do in a way that makes it accessible to parents and students. Iridescent is working at three sites across the country in South Los Angeles, the South Bronx in New York City, and San Francisco. Students and their families have multiple access points to the science and engineering videos and materials through after school activities, Family Science Nights and summer camps. The project is piloting the use of electronic badges, similar to those offered in the Boy and Girl Scouts as a mechanism to enhance the engagement and persistence of students in the online activities. The project is developing ways to evaluate student engagement and performance through the analysis of the products that students submit online in response to particular science and engineering challenges. Students can also gain extra credit at school for their participation in the Curiosity Machine activities. The materials that the Curiosity Machine activities and challenges use are those that are commonly available to families, and the project provides access to mobile technology to facilitate participation by families. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Student access to out of school science and engineering experiences is limited by the resources in terms of time and availability science centers have available. This project develops the resources and tools to bridge the in-school and out of school activities for students through the use of videos and online participation in ways that expand the opportunity of students from underserved populations to continue to engage in substantive science and engineering experiences beyond what they might get during an intermittent visit to a science center. The research and evaluation that is part of this study provides information about how new forms of extrinsic motivation might be used to support student engagement and persistence in learning about science and engineering.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   Iridescent is a STEM education nonprofit with the mission to equip and inspire underserved youth to develop curiosity, creativity and persistence through a powerful science, engineering and technology education. Iridescent connects families in underserved communities with scientists and engineers from academia and industry and nurtures these relationships over time with the help of technology. Through this project Iridescent created an online curriculum and mentoring platform www.Curiosity Machine.org through which a child can complete and upload a photo or video of her own design challenge and receive feedback from a trained STEM mentor, at every stage of the engineering design process.   The main goal of IridescentÆs Curiosity Machine project was to develop a blended model of online and in-person STEM learning support that equipped underserved families to design, build, create, engineer and invent over many years.    It accomplishes this by providing: 1) a scalable, customized, cost-effective, technology-based solution for providing deeper and more engaging support to individual students; 2) a tried and tested template for scientists to communicate their research to the public in a way that inspires self-directed experimentation, exploration and discovery; 3) a robust system of online incentives and badges that motivates students to move beyond passive learning and to work hard, tackle big problems and develop the critical thinking skills to solve them.  Demo Video: https://youtu.be/XBAE46x2qio  Through this project, Iridescent  launched two versions of the Curiosity Machine web platform, developed a set of STEM, evidence-based badges and accompanying rubric, received 4327 uploads to that platform, published 80 design challenges, trained and engaged 147 mentors, and reached a total of 1805 participants through Curiosity Courses and Summer Camps (in-person program).   The first version of the platform can be seen here: http://beta2.curiositymachine.org/index.php?r=activity/index. Based on extensive user testing and external evaluations, we improved the user interface to be more intuitive and user-friendly in the second version (https://www.curiositymachine.org/home/).    Partnering with Dr. Daniel T. Hickey from Learning Sciences at Indiana University for our evaluations, we learned that 40% of program participants reported doing design challenges at home indicating that the programs were partly successful in encouraging learners to continue learning outside in-person programs. We also learned that students and families reported being quite satisfied with the Curiosity Machine, design challenges and the mentors. (All the families rated their experience to be higher than 4 out of 5 Likert scale.) Of note was that learners did not find the feedback from the mentors as useful in refining solutions to the design challenges as anticipated. Children liked getting feedback and found it motivating, but there was little evidence it was used to refine solutions or to redesign. A possible reason could be the delayed feedback mechanism (average of 48 hours).    We have taken the project findings into consideration to implement better training mechanisms for mentors, parents and educators so that they have more guidance on how best to interact with one another as well as the students. For instance we have aligned the design challenges with the Next Generation Science Standards and created scaffolded engineering design units (https://www.curiositymachine.org/units/) that educators can use to gradually increase the complexity of content for their students. Each unit includes Educator Guides, Student Workbooks, and sample lesson plans.  Additionally, parents receive a combination of online and in-person training to run Curiosity Machine Courses at their school. The curriculum consists of 6 online modules (~20 hours) that cover the basics of physics concepts as well as pedagogical concepts such as: Fixed Mindset (or a belief in innate abil...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
