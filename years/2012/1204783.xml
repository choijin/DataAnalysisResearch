The overarching question is how to incorporate this additional piece of information into an algorithm. The approach taken here is rooted in data-driven Koopman spectral analysis, which uses the existence of a linear but infinite dimensional operator to efficiently represent data from a nonlinear dynamical system.   The theory behind Koopman spectral analysis has a long history that reaches back to the early 20th century, but it is only recently that data-driven approximations have been pursued. One of the more popular methods is Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD), which was introduced in 2008 and connected to the Koopman operator in 2009.

Our data-fusion project attempts to solve a common problem, which is how to use easily obtained measurements to estimate the values of difficult to obtain ones, and is accomplished by using the Koopman eigenfunctions as a set of intrinsic variables that remain unchanged provided the underlying dynamics do not change. The second application we explored is coherent set identification, which segments the data into clusters that "do not mix" as time advances; in effect, this is the dynamically inspired version of the clustering problem alluded to e...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
