<AbstractNarration>In the past thirty years super-massive black holes (millions or billions of times the mass of our sun) have been observed in the centers of numerous galaxies. Many stars orbit these black holes and emit gravitational radiation which causes the star to spiral inward and eventually to be swallowed by the super-massive black hole. The characteristics of the gravitational radiation, from both the inspiral and the eventual in-fall of a star, will be theoretically determined. The analysis of data from future gravitational radiation observations will then provide tremendous insight and understanding of strong gravitational fields, the stars in the centers of galaxies and the super-massive black hole itself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our place in the universe can only be studied via physics and astronomy. These fundamental sciences catch the attention of the best and the brightest of students. As they see for themselves how mathematics coupled with careful experiments or observations drives the progress in fascinating areas of science, such as black holes and gravitational radiation, these best and brightest will become the next generation of leaders in science and industry.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    The detection of gravitational waves, whether on Earth or in space, is beginning to open a new window into the universe. Parameter estimation from such detections allows new tests of our current theory of gravity when it is applied to the most extreme systems imaginable. Likely sources of these waves include not only binary systems of black holes, but also neutron stars, and solar mass objects orbiting and eventually spiralling into very massive black holes (a thousand to ten billion times the mass of our Sun). These sources include some of the most surprising objects in the universe. We have carried out new analysis able to help describe the spacetime dynamics of systems of compact objects evolving through the emission of gravitational waves.  In particular, we have compared our results with those from the Post-Newtonian computational scheme, and we have shown that our results agree.  Black holes, often very massive, seem to reside at the center of every known galaxy.  The understanding of how these form by coalesence from less massive objects is still incomplete.  However, we now know from LIGO observations, that isolated black holes up to 60 solar masses can have existed for over a billion years.  One of these falling into an already massive galactic black hole could be part of a coalesence chain.  By itself, it would cause only a fairly small disruption of the already massive black hole but, in the process, gravitational waves would be emitted whose properties and behavior might be calculated perturbatively.  We have carried out calculations which will eventually help us model such gravitational wave emissions.    Previous Post-Newtonian descriptions of binary sources of gravitational waves, based on approximations of small speeds and weak gravitational fields, begin to break down as the objects approach their final stage of coalescence. This breakdown occurs precisely when the physical system is at its most interesting. For a black hole system, other approximation schemes can provide insight into both the process of gravitational wave generation and the shape of the waveform itself. Our perturbative calculations, valid for high speeds and strong gravity, are one example.  Because they are only perturbative, our results, too, can break down when the infalling body is relatively massive, or when the the inspiral process is too long lasting.  Thus, we are still in the process of obtaining results to second order in the mass ratio of the two bodies, in order to supplement our perturbative calculations.    We anticipate that experimental efforts in both the detection of gravitational waves and the analysis of the source characteristics, will both directly benefit from the detailed comparisons of different approaches for calculating charactreistic features of the orbital trajectories and of the resultant gravitational waves.  Ultimately, our research will have a broad impact upon mankind's understanding of the applications of General Relativity to extreme astrophysical systems, upon science education, and upon the understanding and appreciation of science by the public.    With our leadership, graduate students and undergraduates have been developing sophisticated computational skills, and have experienced the rigors of research in fundamental science. Upon graduation, our current graduate students will have the opportunity to turn their experiences and learning into a productive future, just as our former graduate students have been successful at using their skills for employment in a variety of scientific and technical arenas.
