<AbstractNarration>The overall goal of the Morgan State University IT-Catalyst proposal is to create an equitable and satisfying work environment for all faculty, particularly women in the STEM disciplines.  The specific aims are designed to use both quantitative and qualitative data to inform the examination of policies and practices affecting retention and professional advancement.  Several specific key elements related to the project include, but are not limited to: a job satisfaction survey and evidence-based and data-driven approaches to gender equity at Morgan State University (MSU).  Overall, this project is expected to provide Morgan with strategic plans for increasing the number of underrepresented, women faculty in the STEM fields while also providing robust dissemination of project results that allow the institution to serve as a model for other HBCUs and minority serving institutions nationwide.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Morgan GEMS funding supported a faculty climate survey and initial understanding of the Morgan environment.  Two primary goals of the grant were to assess faculty perceptions regarding mentoring, research participation, and leadership opportunities as well as review policies that thwarted academic and scientific leadership of female faculty.   Key findings included the importance of mentoring, the role of internal and external mentors, and an indication that, at the time of the survey, responding faculty members were strongly committed to the mission and strategic goals of the institution.    Of those who had on campus mentors, the responses indicate the ways in which their mentor supported their careers.  These mentors primarily served a role models (74.6%), advocates (65.1%), and advisors of campus politics (60.3%).   In general, respondents indicated that the on-campus mentor supported their career advancement (44.5%).  Given these findings, more formal mechanisms will be implemented to support faculty at all levels.  Additionally, Better opportunity could have been used to support the leadership development through attendance in a national oriented program (e.g., Higher Education Resources Services (HERS), or Project Kaleidoscope (PKAL) Leadership Institute).  However, several female faculty members through means of their own participated in other NSF-funded leadership opportunities.  Funds were also leverage to support faculty concerns regarding salary inequity, for which senior leadership engaged the Office of Human Resources.  Findings found no overall gender inequity, but inequity based on discipline and time in service.           Last Modified: 05/23/2016       Submitted by: Pamela Scott-Johnson]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
