<AbstractNarration>Technical Description: The goal of this research project is to develop a novel method to place controlled amounts of substitutional impurities into graphene grown on SiC, to physically and electronically characterize the doped structures, and to evaluate the changes in the film's properties. Impurities are implanted into a SiC wafer prior to graphene formation. The wafer is annealed to bring the impurity distribution near the surface. Then graphene is grown by sublimation of Si, simultaneously driving the impurities into the graphene film. After this process, the impurity distribution is characterized by surface analytical techniques as well as by electrical transport measurements. If successful, the method can also be applied to other two-dimensional materials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Non-technical Description: Graphene, a single layer of carbon atoms bound together in a honeycomb lattice structure, has unique electrical and mechanical properties. Effective use of these properties requires the inclusion of predetermined amounts of impurity atoms (doping) in the films. The project develops a new method to incorporate controlled amounts of atoms into a single atomic layer of graphene, and provides graduate student training in an interdisciplinary environment. In addition, undergraduate students at the University of Minnesota and at Rutgers University, as well as high school teachers working at Georgia Tech, obtain direct hands-on research experience in the project as well as study materials and new understanding resulting from the project in courses taught by the principal investigators.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ For a number of years now, there has been been an explosion of scientific efforts to develop graphene as an electronic material to replace silicon.  Graphene is a sheet of carbon atoms in a hexagonal lattice (like a chicken-wire lattice) that is one atomic layer thick.  It has the remarkable property that electrons move as if they had zero atomic mass, leading to the possibility, for example, of being able to support very fast electronic switches.  However, other properties of pure graphene prevent these switches from turning off completely.  This project, which is a collaboration between the University of Minnesota (P.I. Cohen), Rutgers University (L.C. Feldman) and Georgia Institute of Technology (E.H. Conrad) has developed a way to modify the properties of graphene so that switches could have the desired properties of being both very conducting or very insulating, depending on the application of a voltage.  The collaboration studied two-dimensional graphene films that could be prepared on top of a silicon carbide support material.  It found that by placing small amounts of nitrogen at the interface between the silicon carbide and the graphene, the graphene would be strained and form nanoscale ripples.  The strain modifies the electronic structure of graphene giving it what is known as a bandgap.  This bandgap was observed using analytical techniques called angle resolved photoemission and scanning tunelling spectroscopy.  The films, when prepared with this small amount of nitrogen, were not perfectly ordered and so measurements of the performance of the material in the on state of a switch showed only modest electrical conduction.  The team is now attempting to prepare strained graphene that is well ordered so as to preserve the highly conducting state, enabling ultrasmall, fast electronic switches.    This project developed the expertise of five graduate students, including one female student, and one undergraduate student.  The results were communicated in two invited and five contributed talks by members of the collaboration.  Two papers were published in peer reviewed journals and one additional paper is in the submission process.    At Minnesota, we were involved in a camp for girls, teaching elementary electronics.  We also assisted the University Solar Vehicle project in their races in the U.S. and Australia.  At Georgia, a high school teacher worked in the laboratory and we were involved in the Georgia Tech Step Up program to introduce teachers in different careers in science.  At Rutgers a team member was successful at hiring four faculty in underrepresented groups.       Last Modified: 08/03/2015       Submitted by: Philip I Cohen]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
