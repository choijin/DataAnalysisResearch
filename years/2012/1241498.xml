<AbstractNarration>This research is a component of a broad community experiment named SOAS (Southern Oxidant and Aerosol Study) designed to further investigate the oxidation of the emissions (biogenic volatile organic compounds; BVOCs) of plants in the context of the atmospheric environment of the Southeast United States. The project will investigate the effects of organic amines on secondary organic aerosol (SOA) formation processes. Amines, along with ammonia, are the dominant organic base compounds in the atmosphere. They are invariably present in aerosol particles, and may contribute to SOA formation through condensation of their oxidation products, or by the formation of salts with more acidic aerosol particles.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Amines and their oxidation products may have adverse health effects and directly impact air quality, and visibility. At present, measurements of gas-phase amines, especially in biogenic environments in the southeastern United States, are lacking. This project will make ground-based measurements of amines with a fast-time response chemical ionization mass spectrometer (CIMS) during the 2013 SOAS campaign to better investigate the effects of amines on secondary aerosol formation processes.</AbstractNarration>

We improved our CIMS to measure pptv and sub-pptv level of trace amines and ammonia with 1 min time integration.  This is so far one of the only less than 5 instruments in the world that have such capabilities, to our knowledge.  In collaboration with other researchers co-located at the same site, we found that amines and ammonia participate in gas to particle conversion strongly, with nearly two orders of magnitude lower concentrations in the gas phase than in the aerosol phases.  We also found that even in the rural Southern U.S. forest, biomass burning is the major emission source of amines and ammonia.  We observed that new particle formation does not occur during the summer in the isoprene-dominated forest.  Two graduate students and two postdoctoral fellows were involved in this project, and they had the opportunities to learn state of the art mass spectrometry and particle measurement techniques and participated in the SOAS campaign.  There are numerous conference presentations given by postdoctoral fellows and PI.  Three journal publications were generated from our SOAS data in collaboration with other research groups, first authored by students and postdoctoral fellow.  Our data are archived in NOAA SOS ftp server and have been shared with the community members for their publication and calibration of their instruments.
