<AbstractNarration>TECHNICAL SUMMARY: &lt;br/&gt;The objective of this Materials World Network project is to investigate the fundamentals of nonpolar and semipolar GaN growth on low cost Si and sapphire substrates with the aim of understanding the mechanisms governing defect formation and constituent/impurity incorporation as well as processes responsible for radiative recombination. Insight into mechanisms responsible for the defect formation will make it possible to devise approaches for reducing the defect density, particularly the stacking faults and partial dislocations, and produce high-optical-quality material for light-emitting diodes with enhanced brightness and potentially for laser diodes. The absence of polarization in nonpolar GaN and substantially reduced polarization in semipolar GaN will allow higher recombination efficiencies and eliminate the dependence of emission energy on injection level. After interrogating cleanly the optical matrix elements, In and Mg incorporation, and Mg activation energy in optimized GaN films, systematic studies of oscillator strengths and radiative recombination rates in nonpolar and semipolar InGaN/GaN and GaN/AlGaN quantum wells and double heterostructures will be undertaken to answer the critical question which non-polar and semipolar GaN orientation has the potential to provide higher efficiency light emitters than polar c-plane GaN.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:&lt;br/&gt;A multi-institutional/multidisciplinary international program bringing together the unique expertise in growth, available at the Virginia Commonwealth University, extensive capabilities of precise optical measurements at the University of Magdeburg (Germany), and demonstrated experience in theoretical modeling at the University of Montpellier 2 (France) will be undertaken in an effort to understand the synthesis and properties of transformative nonpolar and semipolar nitride semiconductor structures for high efficiency light emitters. This approach will shed the much needed light into the fundamentals of defect formation, impurity incorporation, and optical processes and thus will lay the critical groundwork for attainment of bright light sources for solid-state lighting, as well as lasers and detectors for consumer and military applications. This Materials World Network project will allow a broad perspective of materials science, engineering, and semiconductor theory and provide a fertile ground for teaching graduate and undergraduate students the intricacies of science and soft skills necessary for success in the global, cyber-enabled nanotechnology workforce, with the additional benefit of exposure to cultures of science in the US, Germany, and France. Cross training of graduate students by leading international groups, research experiences for undergraduate students, and expansion of outreach programs for middle school students in the fields of materials science and semiconductor devices will go a long way for training the future skilled workforce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is supported by the Electronic and Photonic Materials program and Office of Special Programs, Division of Materials Research.</AbstractNarration>

Although energy-saving GaN-based light emitting diodes have been remarkably successful in revolutionizing our lives, the mainstay for the technological development of LEDs has been the structures having (0001) polar orientation, which suffer from built-in polarization electric fields and limited solubility of indium. These drawbacks prevent further improvement of energy efficiency, particularly for devices operating in the green spectral range. Structures of nonpolar and semipolar GaN orientations address the aforementioned issues by eliminating polarization fields and enhancing indium incorporation, and therefore, hold great promise for the production of high efficiency LEDs, including devices emitting in green, with the added benefit of longer lifetimes and lower maintenance cost.</p> <p>The aim of this program was to investigate mechanisms of defect formation, impurity incorporation, and radiative recombination in nonpolar and semipolar GaN, with the focus on (1) mechanisms of formation and propagation of extended defects to establish growth conditions leading to high-quality nonpolar and semipolar GaN on Si and sapphire; (2) incorporation of indium into nonpolar and semipolar GaN; (3) theoretical and experimental investigation of radiative recombination in nonpolar and semipolar GaN/AlGaN and InGaN/GaN heterostructures and quantum wells; and (4) creation of an educational environment for cross-disciplinary training of students in advanced growth methods, solid-state theory, and cutting-edge structural and optical characterization techniques, allowing concurrent observation of optical activity of defects and their distribution with nanoscale spatial resolution.</p> <p>We established the growth of nonpolar <em>m</em>-plane and semipolar &nbsp;GaN on patterned Si (112) and (100) substrates, respectively, and semipolar &nbsp;GaN on planar m-plane sapphire. Our studies performed in collaboration with Otto-von-Guericke University of Magdeburg (Germany) on semipolar &nbsp;GaN grown on patterned Si(001) revealed a new mechanism of threading-dislocation blocking by rows of stacking faults. Consequently, we achieved semiopolar material with low defect density and high optical quality, comparable to the state-of-the-art polar variety.

Semipolar &nbsp;InGaN LEDs grown on nano-ELO GaN templates exhibited significantly enhanced (by 3-4 at %) indium incorporation as compared to polar structures.
