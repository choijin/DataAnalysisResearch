<AbstractNarration>Free and open source software (FOSS) is created by individuals and organizations that make the resulting software freely available for anyone to use, study, modify, or re-distribute.  FOSS has become a major part of the software industry and is producing many world-class products.  Among these products are Humanitarian Free and Open Source Software products (HFOSS) that create social benefit in areas such as disaster relief, economic development, and health care.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Experience with undergraduate participation in HFOSS demonstrates a potential to motivate students, create excellent learning opportunities, and attract and retain female students in computing disciplines.  However, many instructors need professional development and a supporting community to bring HFOSS into their classes.  The Open Source Faculty Expertise (OpenFE) project is expanding the community of faculty with expertise in HFOSS and is also creating, organizing, and evaluating learning materials needed to integrate HFOSS into computing curricula in diverse settings including community colleges.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OpenFE is building on prior NSF-funded work to reach a larger and more diverse student population.  Group informatics is being tested as an approach for creating and supporting instructor learning groups.  OpenFE is also incorporating FOSS community learning strategies such as Legitimate Peripheral Participation to create an innovative application of professional learning strategies to undergraduate computing education.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OpenFE is a collaborative project involving Drexel University, Western New England University and Nassau Community College.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Preparing students to work as software professionals requires that they develop software skills and knowledge that extend well beyond programming assignments done by students individually.  Challenges in software development mostly relate to scale and complexity of software products, communication and coordination needed to work in teams, demands of attracting and supporting a client base, and the restrictions of evolving a product over time rather than starting each project with a clean slate.  Teaching students about the challenges of software development is difficult unless they have direct experience with large software projects.  Lacking that experience, the students cannot easily grasp the details of the challenges, and they are less motivated to learn about solutions.  Instructors are always looking for ways to overcome this gap between the classroom and actual practice, but finding suitable examples is very difficult, partly because so much software work has been proprietary.   Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) is developed by collaborating individuals or organizations with the software source code, and also documentation, plans, and other artifacts made publicly available and free to use.  Many FOSS projects also welcome participation by additional people, including students.  The rapid growth of FOSS in recent years presents an excellent potential source of material for instructors teaching the challenges of professional software development.  Within FOSS, there is a subset of projects, called Humanitarian FOSS or HFOSS, that exist to provide societal benefit in areas like healthcare, economic development, disaster management, and education.  Student participation in these projects has the added benefit of helping students see the positive impact of computing.  Research has shown that seeing practical societal benefit of computing is helpful in attracting women to computing, which can help solve the large shortage of women students choosing to study computing.   The opportunity to appeal to women students, combined with the excellent materials for teaching about software development, makes HFOSS projects very attractive for instructors to adopt in class.  At the same time, teaching students by participating in HFOSS projects is challenging for instructors and has a significant learning curve.   NSF has funded a series of projects to explore use of HFOSS in education.  This project, OpenFE, focused specifically on developing Faculty Expertise in teaching with HFOSS.   Results  Major results of the project can be summarized in three areas:  Professional Development for Faculty &ndash; The project team collaborated with Red Hat, Inc. to help faculty prepare to teach HFOSS.  This effort built on a prior workshop called POSSE (Professors? Open Source Software Experience) and created a three-stage process including online learning, an in-person workshop, and small support groups.  Over 130 faculty from over 100 institutions participated in POSSE under this grant.  Course Materials &ndash; OpenFE provided support to create a web site supporting faculty teaching HFOSS.  As part of that effort, over 100 learning activities have been developed and made available on the site.  See http://foss2serve.org  Community &ndash; Even with professional development and shared course materials, faculty benefit from a community to discuss issues and provide additional mutual support for teaching HFOSS.  OpenFE supported a series of additional workshops where faculty developed and shared course materials and discussed pedagogy for teaching HFOSS.  Members of the OpenFE team also assumed leadership of a second web site and email list that helps instructors interested in teaching students to participate in open source.  The email list has about 400 members including a mix of faculty and open source practitioners.  The web site was completely rebuilt with support from Red Hat.  See http://teachingopensource.org  Intellectual Merit and Broader Impacts  OpenFE has expanded concepts and practice of teaching HFOSS, which is a novel approach to giving students experience with the challenges of professional software development, exposure to an international community of developers, and to experience computing as a collaborative activity with direct societal impact.  Journal and conference publications from the project team document the positive impact on learning, student insight into the nature of computing careers, and positive appeal to women students.  Faculty who attended POSSE are teaching HFOSS in their classes and impacting hundreds of students.  Students have worked on HFOSS projects including OpenMRS (healthcare), Ushahidi (citizen participation), Sahana (disaster management), and the Gnome Accessibility Projects (web accessibility).  Our successes have allowed us to establish additional relationships including collaboration and financial support by Google, collaboration on student open source clubs with Mozilla, and a member project relationship for Teaching Open Source with the Software Freedom Conservancy.  Extensions of this project were also supported by a CRA-W CREU project titled "Analyzing Student-Community Coaching Interactions within Humanitarian Free and Open Source Software (HFOSS) Projects".  This expanding set of collaborations provide the beginning of a foundation for the long-term sustainability of this effort.  The OpenFE efforts are continuing with additional support from NSF under the IUSE program.       Last Modified: 11/21/2017       Submitted by: Herman Jackson]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
