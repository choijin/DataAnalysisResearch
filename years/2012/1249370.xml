<AbstractNarration>Food web structure is an important indicator of ecosystem health because it reflects both species richness and functional diversity. Recent attempts to use compound-specific stable isotopes rather than bulk-tissue techniques to evaluate food webs promise to improve understanding of food web dynamics and trophic interactions. These new methods, which rely on amino acid isotope analyses, need to be validated experimentally before this promising advance can be applied to natural food webs. This study relies on a laboratory multi-level food chain experiment to compare the ecological sensitivity and the costs and benefits of new amino acid techniques and common bulk-tissue methods. The researchers will create a realistic, four-level food chain in the laboratory that allows consumers to integrate prey isotopic signatures into their tissues.  At the end of the experiment, both amino acid and bulk tissue stable isotopes will be analyzed to determine whether amino acids provide a more accurate measure of trophic position than bulk tissue methods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this project lie primarily in advancing a new method for evaluating natural food webs. If successful, the method could eventually be applied to terrestrial and aquatic communities, and would advance the general field of food web ecology. It also could be applied to museum specimens, allowing researchers to examine historical as well as contemporary food webs.</AbstractNarration>
