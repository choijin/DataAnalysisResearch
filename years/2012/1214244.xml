<AbstractNarration>The International Workshop on Computational Electronics (IWCE) covers all aspects of&lt;br/&gt;advanced simulation of electronic transport and optoelectronic processes in semiconductors&lt;br/&gt;and semiconductor devices based on both inorganic and organic materials. The scientific&lt;br/&gt;program consists of invited lectures, contributed talks, and poster presentations. The workshop&lt;br/&gt;is held in a single-session format and is intended to be an international forum for discussions on&lt;br/&gt;the current trends and future directions of computational electronics. The 15th International&lt;br/&gt;Workshop on Computational Electronics (IWCE 2012) will be held between May 22 and May&lt;br/&gt;25, 2012 at the University of Wisconsin ? Madison. In recent years, the IWCE community has&lt;br/&gt;been increasingly active in the field of energy harvesting, especially thermoelectrics. Therefore,&lt;br/&gt;at IWCE 2012 there will be a companion two-day "School on Phonon Dynamics, Heat Transfer,&lt;br/&gt;and Thermoelectric Phenomena in Nanostructures" held May 21-22, 2012 before the workshop.&lt;br/&gt;Funding is requested to support student participation at the IWCE conference and the&lt;br/&gt;Phonon School. The grant will be used to issue student travel awards that will cover lodging&lt;br/&gt;and registration fees up to $750 per student. Awards for 20 students will be provided by this&lt;br/&gt;grant. Following the program committee's review of all submitted abstracts, authors of the top&lt;br/&gt;ranked student abstracts will be selected as the travel award recipients. In the case of multiple&lt;br/&gt;similarly ranked abstracts, priority for the travel award will be given to an underrepresented&lt;br/&gt;minority student or a female student.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit. IWCE 2012 will draw particular attention to the frontiers of computational&lt;br/&gt;electronics that connect to materials science, physics, and energy applications. Three focus&lt;br/&gt;sessions, with only invited talks, and the Phonon School will offer an infusion of potential new&lt;br/&gt;research directions for the whole community. There is a lot of challenging computational work to&lt;br/&gt;be done in spintronics, thermal transport in nanostructures, and materials for energy&lt;br/&gt;applications. This workshop will serve as a starting point for many exciting avenues and an&lt;br/&gt;evolution of the topics addressed by the computational electronics community. In addition, with&lt;br/&gt;a strong focus on thermal and thermoelectric phenomena, IWCE is poised to make a bridge&lt;br/&gt;between the heat transfer and electronics communities, which will strengthen both in the quest&lt;br/&gt;for nanomaterials solutions to energy problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts. By enabling students to take part in the conference, we will be help the new&lt;br/&gt;generations of researchers to come onto the stage early in their career and be recognized for&lt;br/&gt;their work among peers and senior researchers. This grant will enable 20 students to attend the&lt;br/&gt;conference, thereby increasing student participation, improving their exposure in the&lt;br/&gt;professional community, and benefiting their careers in the long term. We will ensure&lt;br/&gt;participation of women and underrepresented minority scientists as invited speakers at the&lt;br/&gt;event. Prominence of these role models will have a beneficial effect on the female and minority&lt;br/&gt;students whose participation at the IWCE will be supported by this grant.</AbstractNarration>
