<AbstractNarration>The project is developing a multidisciplinary, multi-campus program minor in 'energy science, technology, and policy', through a unique regional partnership consisting of public and private four-year and two-year colleges. Project objectives include: 1) successful design and implementation of a multi-institution energy education program that is leveraging institutional academic strengths and access to student populations at the different campuses; 2) design of a program valuable for students in both technical (i.e. architecture, engineering, and science) and non-technical (i.e. business, accounting, and general studies) majors, at both two-year and four-year colleges; 3) enhancement of STEM learning through multidisciplinary curricula, experiential learning through&lt;br/&gt;internships and research, and incorporation of stakeholder input in course and program development; and 4) recruitment and retention of students from underrepresented and underserved populations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is enhancing collaboration with STEM education community and  is helping to promote the two- to four-year college transition and beyond. By coordinating the program across multiple campuses, the project is facilitating articulation among institutions. Several of the schools involved have large populations of students traditionally underrepresented in STEM fields, and all have significant programs aimed at recruitment and retention. The project is working to increase participation from those groups significantly.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  Over the past three years, the energy minor course at Farmingdale State College ENV 101 has attracted a significant number of students mainly due to the increased awareness among students in our campus of opportunities in the field of energy and related technologies. Our efforts under this NSF supported grant have played an important role in increasing awareness. ENV 101 was offered during fall of 2015, spring of 2016 and summer of 2016. The total enrollment exceeded 100 students.     Farmingdale State College faculty members with an interest in energy related areas have expanded collaborations with faculty from other institutions resulting in several joint research projects involving undergraduate students.         Equipment for this laboratory was acquired with partial support from this grant after a requested budget modification was approved. This equipment includes thermal evaporator for thin film deposition; ultrasonic dispersion system for nanoparticles and quantom dots; fume hoods and equipment for chemical synthesis of nanomaterials; and spin coater for organics and photoresists. The above mentioned equipment will enhance our fabrication capabilities and supplement already existing equipment for electrical, optical and mechanical characterization of nanomaterials. Therefore students will be able to work and be trained in the full spectrum of material processing and characterization.   Students were encouraged to create e-portfolios and share their experiences with other colleagues.   Developed a website to assist in the dissemination of information on the energy minor and sustainable energy, internships, and related activities of the consortium   Several consortium meetings were held to assess progress, discuss obstacles, and collect information on cross-registration and course development.
