<AbstractNarration>The University of West Georgia campus, in Carrollton, Georgia, will be the site of a Research Experiences for Undergraduates program for eight weeks during the summers of 2014, 2015, and 2016. Eight students will be invited each year, with one student coming from within the University of West Georgia by means of a competitive selection process. The program will be led by Professors Bruce Landman and Abdollah Khodkar, and involve research in the areas of combinatorics, number theory, and graph theory. The research problems will stem from the main areas of interest of the two faculty mentors, combinatorial Ramsey theory and graph theory.  The problems presented to students will represent active and recent areas in these disciplines. Both graph theory and the area of combinatorial number theory are well-suited for the undergraduate student to begin the exploration into their own research activities, as very minimal background is needed to work on the problems. Furthermore, these are relevant, active areas of mathematical research with many applications and connections to other branches of the mathematical sciences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The participants will work in teams of two or three students, with each student being a member of two different teams. The program will include weekly seminars in which the students will give presentations concerning the problems they are working on and their progress on these problems. The students will be encouraged and guided, incrementally over the 8-week period, toward more independent work. However, demonstration of the value of effective communication among the students, working in small teams on research problems, will be one of the main goals of the program. The program is designed to introduce the students to mathematical research, and to give them the ability to pose and prove original conjectures, to learn independently, to collaborate with others on research projects, and to effectively communicate their findings, both orally and in writing. The program is intended to help prepare students for graduate study or employment in a mathematical career.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ We received between 120 and 200 applications for each of the three summer REU programs.   In 2014,  eight students participated in the program; in 2015, nine participated (one was a non-citizen/permanent resident who was not supported by the grant); and in 2016, eight students participated.  Of the twenty-five students who participated in the program, thirteen were females and twelve were males.   In each summer program, the students were introduced to a total of eight open research problems during the first week of the program. From these eight problems, six of the problems were chosen to be worked on during the program. Three of the problems were in graph theory, and three were in the area of combinatorial number theory. The students were divided up into six teams (corresponding to the six problems), with each team having between two and four members. Each student was a member of two different teams. The students obtained experience conducting research both as an indivudual, and also as a member of a research team.   Once per week, each team would give a short presentation on the progress they had made on their work, with each member of the team giving part of the presentation.  All students were required to learn to use LaTex. Each student submitted a written progress report every two weeks. By the end of the program, each team submitted a final "paper," which was a formal write-up of all of their findings, and was written in the form of a research paper (with abstract, introduction, references, etc.).  Each summer, the Department of Mathematics was able to contribute to the students' experiences by hosting several talks by senior research mathematicians. During the 2014 and 2015 summer programs, our REU group spent a day serving as hosts for the REU group from another university - with talks given by students from both programs; this gave all students more experience interacting with other young researchers.  Without exception, the students said that they found the program very valuable to them in learning what mathematical research is about and, more generally, in preparing them for graduate study and/or their future career objectives.  Most have decided to pursue a graduate degree in the mathematical sciences.  As evidence of the effectiveness of the program, a number of research papers have been completed, or are still being written:  3 articles have already been accepted, one article is being revised, one has been submitted, and three others are in preparation.  For the five articles that have been accepted or submitted, there are ten different students who are co-authors; an additional seven students who are involved in the papers that are under preparation. In addition, several of the students have presented their results at conferences.          Last Modified: 10/26/2016       Submitted by: Bruce Landman]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
