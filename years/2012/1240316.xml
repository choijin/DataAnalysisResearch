<AbstractNarration>This engineering education research initiation grant makes a comparative study of situated learning between the two professions of nursing and engineering.  Situated learning takes place when learners are placed in an authentic context such as engineering internships.  The researchers plan to study how situated learning impacts students ability to construct complex ideas and how it motivates them to continue in their chosen discipline.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader significance and importance of this project will be to inform other programs on the effects of situated learning, which is increasingly used in engineering degree programs.  By understanding the effects of situated learning, it will be possible to better transition students from degree programs into the workforce.  This project overlaps with NSF's strategic goals of transforming the frontiers through preparation of an engineering workforce with new capabilities and expertise.  Additionally NSF's goal of innovating for society is enabled by creating results and research that are useful for society by informing educational policy and practices.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Nursing and engineering have many commonalities that make comparing their pedagogies relevant.  They are both professional disciplines where students learn how to improve peopleÆs lives and can practice their professions with their undergraduate degrees. Moreover, the accreditation outcomes of both nursing and engineering are very similar. The most striking tradeoff between nursing and engineering is in their distinctly different approaches for garnering practical experience. Nursing students are exposed to consistent, structured, and supervised experiences, whereas engineering students have ad hoc immersive and simulated real-world experiences. To better understand how these different approaches may impact students, we examined studentsÆ cognitive complexity and motivation to learn. Cognitive complexity represents studentsÆ abilities to handle ambiguity, adjust to changes, and function independently. Motivation to learn encompasses studentsÆ interests in learning new concepts and skills, as well as their belief that this learning is possible. These two outcomes were selected because they align with recommendations from external influences, such as accrediting bodies and experts in student-centered learning, and are impacted by the learning environment designed by faculty.
