<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project expanded what is known about a variety of objects in low-dimensional topology.  The questions in this area are straighforward and can be understood without many prerequisites.  For example, do two fractal ("fuzzy" at all scales) pictures intersect?  Or, is it possible to draw a curve in the plane which avoids certain points such that this curve must intersect any other curve drawn avoiding those points?  Or, if a collection of disks are glued together in a known, but complicated, way, it is possible to find a hidden "nice" subset?  This project resolved these questions and others, in many cases from a computational perspective that yielded constructive answers and understandable results.  In addition, several of the new techniques are concrete enough to implement as algorithms on a computer.  They can be run to produce examples or rigorously certify that an "approximate" picture, such as a drawing of a fractal, is actually correct in some way, in the sense that the fractal really does have some property that it appears to have in the picture.  Although basic, these kinds of questions arise in many areas of math, and in many cases are related to other fields of science.  Several of the outcomes stimulated significant subsequent interest and work by many people.       Last Modified: 08/20/2021       Submitted by: Alden K Walker]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
