<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project proposes the development, testing and commercialization of a collaborative educational game aimed at middle-school physical science students that will improve educational outcomes and increase interest in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math) fields across a broad spectrum of students.  Martha Madison's Marvelous Machines, a serious game based on pedagogical best practices, correlated to curricular standards and supported by lesson plans, challenges students to work as a team to solve progressively harder physical science problems.  Sophisticated scaffolding guides learners and helps them achieve full potential by encouraging exploration yet minimizing frustration without giving the answer away.  By tracking play mechanics, the game will test for student engagement, enhancement of scientific inquiry skills and knowledge of physical science principles.   The game will cover a full year of physical science curriculum.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project addresses a need to ignite interest in STEM study and careers at a critical time in students' education.  There is a current lack of research-based, efficacy proven innovative digital STEM teaching materials.  Research shows that middle school is a pivotal time for encouraging students to pursue math and science related fields.  If interest and engagement in science are not maintained through middle and high school, successful pursuit of STEM fields drops significantly.  Math and science assessment test results show that U.S. students consistently perform lower than international counterparts.  In addition, women are significantly underrepresented in STEM careers, filling only 24% of STEM jobs while they hold 48% of all jobs in the U.S.  Educational games provide a goal-driven, social framework for thinking about relevant topics and practicing skills.  Through play and experimentation, games can provoke curiosity, enthusiasm and creativity about content.  While games' merits for increasing engagement are clear, their role in improving educational content is even more important.  As a scalable solution to a persistent problem, Martha Madison's Marvelous Machines has the potential to significantly impact U.S. learning and achievement in science.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Martha Madison is a suite of web-based games targeted at critical topics in middle school physical science.  It has been correlated to the Next Generation Science Standards, Common Core ELA, 21st Century Skills standards and the science and engineering standards for the following states, New York, California, Massachusetts, North Carolina and Texas.   The product features 8 multi-level games which can be played collaboratively or as a single player, a full suite of classroom implementation materials for teachers, and a progress dashboard for parents, teachers, students and administrators.  In addition, most games include a maker space where student can design their own levels to demonstrate their mastery of key concepts and practice essential engineering skills.   The Martha Madison game suite was intended address attrition in STEM and to encourage student persistence in the STEM disciplines at a pivotal point in their academic careers.  A review of the research literature illustrates that if interest and engagement are not maintained through middle school and high school, successful pursuit of STEM fields drops significantly.  Math assessment test results show that US students consistently perform in the bottom twenty percent of developed nations and that science assessment is below average. In addition, women and minorities are consistently underrepresented in STEM degree completion and in STEM career persistence and advancement.  The game suite and curriculum has been tested in public urban, suburban and rural districts, charter schools and a small number of private schools.  Non-identifyng demographic data, STEM affiliation inventories, and pre-post data on content area knowledge were collected.  This information was analyzed in conjunction with in-game data.  Significant positive outcomes were noted among all target populations and research is on-going.  The game is being made available through established commercial channels for both the formal K12 education market and the consumer marketplace.  Dissemination of research outcomes is ongoing and has included poster talks, conference panels, white papers and a book chapter.
