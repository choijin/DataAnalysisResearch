<AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit:&lt;br/&gt;A Workshop on Frontiers in Electronics (WOFE-11) is to be held in San Juan, Puerto Rico during 18-21 December 2011. The Workshop has high intellectual merit and embodies technological exchange and discussion of new ideas and emerging trends in the current rapid evolution of electronic technology. The Workshop focuses on a merger of the major technical areas including low-power digital electronics, microwave power circuits, and optoelectronics, which collectively have become the foundation of today's electronic technology. It aims at fostering an active cross-fertilization of these different areas by gathering experts from academia, industry, and government agencies to review the recent developments. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: &lt;br/&gt;This workshop will promote exchange of scientific ideas and will make an impact on future science and technology in electronics. It will provide a special forum for leading researchers to review the most recent and exciting breakthroughs in various areas of electronics. Emphasis will be placed on inviting women and members of the under representative minorities. These activities will help to establish future programs for training graduate/ undergraduate students to become the next generation of electronics scientists and engineers.</AbstractNarration>

The Workshop aims at encouraging active cross-fertilization of the different "species" in this electronic planet. The WOFE will gather experts from academia, industry, and government agencies to review the recent exciting breakthroughs and their underlying physical mechanisms.     The aim of the workshop was to to bring together leading scientists and engineers who are at the frontiers of electronic device and circuit research and development. Ultra low power digital electronics, microwave power circuits, and optoelectronics have become the foundation of today's electronics technology. Yet, they emerged from traditionally separated fields and are still largely pursued by specialists trained in different areas.   However, the rapid pace of electronic technology evolution is propelling a merger of the traditionally separated fields. Evidence is not hard to find around us. Wireless communication is just one example. It is time to encourage active cross-fertilization of the different "species" in this electronic planet and to call for leadership in bringing together the resources and expertise in these fields.   This advanced workshop was  a special forum to gather some of the most creative minds and leading experts from academia, industry, and government agencies, and to review the most recent and exciting breakthroughs in the fields, the underlying physical mechanisms that link these advancements, and to exchange views on future trends and directions, the market pulls and the necessary policy and infrastructure changes.  The workshop topics will included: Microelectronics/nanoelectronics: short term (2-4 years) versus long term (10 -20 years) R&amp;D, Sensors, NEMS and integrated systems, cyber physical systems Carbon electronics, Bioelectronics and Biomagnetism, Wide band gap technology for high power and UV photonics, Terahertz and infrared electronics and photonics, Beyond MooreÃ†s Law, Thin film transistors, giant area and printed electronics, Innovative memory devices, Flexible electronics and Spin electronics. In most of these topic areas, the role of nanotechnology will be emphasized.  The WOFE-2011 will paid special attention to attracting students and post doctoral associates, and young faculty.     The workshop Proceedings were published as Special Issue of the IJHSES will be also re-published as a hard cover book by World Scientific, Inc.
