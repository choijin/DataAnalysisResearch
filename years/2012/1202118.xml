<AbstractNarration>The objective of this research is to develop ultrasonic imaging methods using the ubiquitously available but rarely exploited broad band thermal-mechanical noise in electromechanical systems. The theoretical approach is based on Green's function retrieval from diffuse noise sources and deep sub-wavelength resolution imaging with evanescent waves on engineered propagation surfaces. Micromachined ultrasonic transducers are used to record thermal-mechanical noise and provide a tunable microscale engineered surface for evanescent waves, forming the experimental platform to achieve sub-wavelength resolution imaging. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Optimal configurations for controlling evanescent wave velocity, hence the effective sub-wavelength resolution, will be investigated and implemented through microscale engineering. Effects of noise field characteristics on the wave excitation and detection, and imaging performance will be explored. Feasibility of high resolution ultrasonic imaging within the diffraction limit (F-number 0.1-0.5) will be demonstrated in the 3-10MHz range using micromachined arrays integrated with low noise electronics. The results would impact design and implementation of microsystems for bio-imaging and bio-microfluidics.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will impact integrated low-power biomedical systems such as medical implants through imaging and monitoring mechanical properties down to the cellular level. Noise-based high-frequency ultrasonics using microscale engineered surfaces can provide a transformative tool for many imaging applications requiring high resolution at lower frequencies. The project involves science teachers from predominantly minority enrolled high schools to create modular curriculum materials in physics and provides opportunities for student site visits to university laboratories. It will also lead to modular curriculum materials for undergraduate classes, and an interdisciplinary component for graduate classes taught by the PIs.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This project explored novel ways of ultrasound imaging using microscale membrane structures in two different ways. In one method, instead of using conventional transmit/receive pulse-echo imaging, the imaging data is collected by recording the noise in the environment due to thermal fluctuations. This recorded noise is then cross correlated to form a three-dimensional image. The advantage of this method is that one does not need a transmit pulser and can image the entire volume without any saturation due to transmit pulse leaking into the receive signal. This method was demonstrated experimentally using a capacitive micromachined ultrasonic transducer (CMUT) array integrated with low noise electronics working in the 15-20MHz range, suitable for medical imaging in arteries, for example. In the second method, the microscale membrane array is used as a metamaterial surface with interesting properties. Essentially, acoustic waves propagating over this surface can be significantly slower than waves in bulk volumes. Therefore, one can use these waves for imaging with resolution beyond the diffraction limit, called superresolution imaging. This method was also experimentally demonstrated for the first time at ultrasonic frequencies in water. The implication of this result is that one can achieve the resolution that can be obtained at 100-250MHz range by using waves in the 10-20MHz range which are much less attenuated. This can lead to large area imaging of cells and other biological layers with micrometer or less resolution. Finally, the analysis methods developed in this project enables simulation of imaging systems consisting of thousands of membranes with complex acoustic interactions for the first time.
