<AbstractNarration>Forced networks of oscillating neurons are ubiquitous in the nervous system.  Although forced unitary oscillators have been heavily studied, there are very few studies of the effects of periodic forcing on networks of oscillators with multiple internal degrees of freedom.  Understanding such systems is an essential step in understanding how the brain makes use of its rhythmic dynamics to communicate signals among regions. The networks in this project have an almost universal property of networks of neurons: there is exponentially decaying inhibition that feeds back to the excitatory cells of the network. In these projects, the decaying nature of the inhibition is important for the emergence of lower-dimensional dynamics and the ability to produce and analyze simplified models of network phenomena. The initial three subprojects concern noise, multiple periodic inputs, and intrinsic currents providing extra timescales that interact with periodic forcing.  The work will relate the properties of network interaction, such as the decaying inhibition, to geometric ideas of invariant manifold theory.  The aim is to produce a level of mathematical clarity that is not generally a part of initial modeling work, and to expand the set of tools and concepts available for further study of forced networks.  The project focuses on networks producing gamma (30-80 Hz) oscillations and beta (12-30 Hz) oscillations, with physiological descriptions of the neurons appropriate to those rhythms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The dynamics of the nervous system are central to cognitive function, but how the brain makes use of its dynamics is barely beginning to be understood.  Rhythms of the nervous system have long been known to be highly associated with cognitive processes including sensory coding, attention, learning, memory, and motor planning.  The study of such rhythms, and their use in brain communication, is an excellent bridge between physiology and function. This project deals with the response of networks of neurons to periodic and other input, as would be seen from signals arriving from other parts of the brain. The purpose of the project is to understand how brain networks process their temporally and spatially coded inputs. This work is being done in the context of a broad initiative to study the origin and significance of brain rhythms.  Kopell is the founder and current head of the Cognitive Rhythms Collaborative, a group of over two dozen Boston-based senior investigators interested in the physiological and dynamical mechanisms of neural activity, their importance in cognition, and their pathology in neurological diseases including schizophrenia, Parkinson's disease and epilepsy, as well as their changes in anesthesia; it includes experimentalists working in vivo and in vitro, mathematicians, statisticians and medical personnel, who are already incorporating ideas from the mathematical research into clinical practice.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Final Outcomes  Oscillatory neural activity has long been a subject of mathematical interest and has been studied with a range of mathematical tools including phase reduction and phase response curves.

We defined a "singular phase response curve", which describes the response of this system to a strong forcing pulse in the limiting case of well-separated time scales of membrane dynamics and inhibitory decay. Using geometric singular perturbation theory, we demonstrated that this function "persists," i.e., continues to provide a quantitatively accurate description of phase locking and stability, for an IBR in a nonsingular regime. We used this function to prove that, when this model is forced by pulses on an intermediate time scale, it is sensitive to pulse coherence to a degree that cannot be reproduced in a one-dimensional phase reduction. This analysis clarifies the role of the time scale separation in coincidence detection and emphasizes the importance of using model reductions that preserve the mathematical structure underlying the relevant physiology.  Phase response curves  are commonly used to model the dynamics of single oscillators. In work with Amanda Serenevy,  I constructed  an analogue of such curves called the "timing map," which models the dynamics in an arbitrarily large network of mutually inhibitory oscillators, forced by heterogeneous drives with identical periods. The timing map uses the time of one network spiking episode (relative to the phase of the drive) to predict the time of the next spiking episode.

Heterogeneity enables the network to dynamically select the appropriate number of neurons for participation in spiking episodes, thereby creating sufficient inhibition in the network to facilitate locking to the period of the drive.  In work with Joh Mitry, Martin Wechselberger and Michelle McCarthy, I investigated firing threshold manifolds in a mathematical model of an excitable neuron. The model analyzed investigated the phenomenon of post-inhibitory rebound spiking due to propofol anesthesia and was adapted from a previous model of M.  McCarthy et al.   Propofol modulates the decay time-scale of an inhibitory GABAa synaptic current. Interestingly, this system gives rise to rebound spiking within a specific range of propofol doses.

We then compared the analyses of dynamic and static synaptic inhibition, showing how the firing threshold manifolds of each relate, and why a current step approach is unable to fully capture the behavior of this model.  With Yujia Zhou and Theo V, I started work on forcing of a single cell with an inhibitory synapse.  The cell has currents with multiple time scales and the forcing also has multiple time scales.  The work is showing that the slow forcing and the slow intrinsic current can be important in how the target responds to fast forcing.  Other current work also supported by the grant was with Alex Gelstopoulus, on a small network modeling a part of parietal cortex, and including three kinds of  inhibitory interneurons.  The work is showing  that activation of the so-called VIP interneuons can alter the interaction of the superficial and deep (output) layers, allowing for interaction or shunting of signals.  Finally, all the work of this grant was done in the context of mentoring of multiple students and postdoctoral associates.  I also headed the Cognitive Rhythms Collaborative, a NSF-supported network of labs working on brain rhyhtms associated with cognition.
