<AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT &lt;br/&gt;#1238398&lt;br/&gt;Fisher, John P.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have tremendous therapeutic potential as they are capable of differentiating into various mesenchymal lineages such as bone, adipose, and cartilage. However, MSCs represent only a fraction of the cells that are found in the bone marrow and lack unique identifying markers, proving them difficult to isolate precisely. There are several limitations to traditional plastic&lt;br/&gt;adherence, including potentially harmful interactions between MSCs and the other cell types within the bone marrow, possible loss of late-adhering MSCs, and the undesired expansion of non-MSC adherent cells found in the bone marrow. The goal of this proposal is two-fold. First to overcome the limitations of traditional plastic adherence by designing a unique material with tuned mechanical and surface properties to strongly and selectively adhere MSCs in a heterogeneous population. Second, to culture and differentiate the enriched captured MSC population on the same material.</AbstractNarration>
