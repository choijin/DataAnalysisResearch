<AbstractNarration>Autonomous navigation in unknown and dynamic environments has been a major challenge for synthetic mobile robotic agents. On the other hand, insects can easily solve such complex navigational problems and demonstrate remarkably stable and optimized locomotion skills in almost any environment. This project aims to develop a mobile sensor network where insects are used as mobile biological-robotic (biobotic) nodes. Insects, in fact, build a "natural" sensor network through the use of their biological sensing organs and release of chemical, mechanical and optical cues to communicate the information to the rest of the group. In the scope of this project, a novel cyber-physical communication network will be established among the individual insect in addition to the aforementioned natural one. For this, insects will be equipped with synthetic electronic sensors to sense additional cues, neuromuscular stimulation systems to direct the control of the insect and microcontrollers with radios to establish an RF link between the insects. This novel network will enable operation of insect biobots in complicated and uncertain dynamic environments for applications such as environmental sensing and search-and-rescue operations after natural disasters. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The unique interdisciplinary nature of this project will help engineers to reach to younger generations and train them to be able to look at engineering problems from a cyberphysical systems point of view. Planned activities include development of lab modules and demos by undergraduate and graduate students to teach K-12 students and their teachers through our on-going collaborations with educational partners. These demos will also be instrumental during nation level efforts to promote graduate education to underrepresented minority students.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The project titled "CPS: Synergy: Collaborative Research: Cyborg Insect Networks for Exploration and Mapping (CINEMa)" was executed under three PIs from Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at North Carolina State University. Prof. Alper Y Bozkurt is an expert in neural interfaces and stimulation; Prof. Edgar Lobaton?s research focuses on mapping and localization and Prof.  Mihail L Sichitiu handled the sensor networks aspect of the project.  The overarching goal of this project was to enhance the technological infrastructure for Cyber&shy;Physical Systems by establishing the fundamental physical and algorithmic building blocks of a biobotic swarm and producing a cyber&shy;physical sensor network among the individuals of non&shy;eusocial insects such as cockroaches and moths with an aim of searching and rescuing victims after natural disasters such as earthquakes.  The research tasks towards achieving this goal were:  Backpack development for biobots Biobotic control design Tracking of locomotion-controlled insect biobots Learning biobotic motion models Individual and swarm biobotic control Hybrid MAC design with the radio carried by the backpacks Localization of the backpack radios Hybrid mapping and exploration using backpack radios and on-board inertial measurement units and acoustic devices   The very exciting research outcomes of these tasks were disseminated through 2 Ph.D. disserations, 5 published peer reviewed journal articles and 15 peer-reviewed conference articles.
