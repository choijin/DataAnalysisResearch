<AbstractNarration>1219451     &lt;br/&gt;This project supports a workshop proposal by Dr. Tarek Saadawi, CUNY City College, New York, NY for a US-Egypt Workshop: Cyber Security, Cairo, Egypt, December 2012.  The Egyptian co-organizer is Dr. Ayman El-Dessouki, Electronics Research Institute, Cairo, Egypt.  Many cyber security schemes are based solely on preventive or reactive, rather than proactive, measures such as patching of software or detecting already occurred attacks. Most of the network and information system security configurations are performed manually and require experts to monitor, tune security devices and recover from attacks. On the other hand, attacks are getting more sophisticated and highly automated which gives the attackers an advantage in this arms race. The workshop is to address important issues in cyber security and the protection of information systems and network infrastructure. The workshop will bring together leading researchers from academia, industry and the government for a comprehensive update on security and risk management research and development issues. The workshop will have scientists from USA and Egypt. The specific objectives of the proposed workshop are : To convene a gathering of US and Egypt scientists in the areas of cyber security in a workshop setting to explore the synergy between: o The current state-of-the-art in cyber security covering cryptology, network security and intrusion detection, software and operating system security, and software forensic techniques and tools;  The current state-of-the-art in collaborative support technologies as they pertain to the support of collaborations between US and Egypt scientists;  To identify specific US/Egypt institutions for faculty and graduate student exchange programs, with the intent that such initial institutions serve as models for wider exchanges;  To identify specific areas of Undergraduate and Graduate Education which might be beneficial in the development of young scientists with specific interest in the Workshop areas; To disseminate the outcomes of the Workshop via the Internet and digital hardcopy (CDROM/DVD).&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merits: The research problems addressed in this workshop by leading scientists from US and Egypt will advance the research in this area. This workshop will help to identify specific US/Egypt institutions for faculty and graduate student exchange programs, with the intent that such initial institutions serve as models for wider exchanges.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: Research outcomes of this workshop will greatly benefit industries and educational institutes not only in the US and Egypt but other countries in the world as well. Students trained will acquire unique skills and expertise in the aspects of collaborations. The problems addressed in this project pertain to cyber security in general and information assurance and network security in particular. Thus the outcomes of this project can impact the society in the near future. The applications we target are very vital to the humans and the society. This proposal is supported under the US-Egypt Joint Fund Program where NSF supports the US side and the Government of Egypt funds the Egyptian side.</AbstractNarration>
