<AbstractNarration>All animals that have evolved in the deep sea are under similar selective pressures as a result of the environmental extremes (e.g., little to no penetrable sunlight, high atmospheric pressure). This extreme habitat has led to massive convergence in animal morphology and behavior across deep-sea organisms ranging from the production and emission of light (bioluminescence) to the evolution of enlarged fangs and gaping mouths. This multidisciplinary project will investigate the processes that have impacted the evolution of deep-sea fishes and their success in this fascinating aquatic realm. This study integrates phylogenetic relationships based on genetic and morphological data, comparative morphology, ecology, and evolutionary biology in an effort to broaden our understanding of fishes that have evolved, thrived, and diversified in the deep sea. &lt;br/&gt; This research will increase our understanding of a diverse array of deep-sea evolutionary adaptations, including bioluminescent structures that are used for predation, defense, species recognition, and sexual selection. These novel morphologies and behaviors have never before been studied within the context of a robust evolutionary framework based on molecular and morphological data. The resulting hypotheses will include a temporal component based on the fossil record that will allow us to explore, for the first time, whether these specializations are having potential effects on speciation in the deep sea. This project will support the training of postdoctoral, graduate, undergraduate, and high school students in marine biology, systematics, and evolutionary biology at the University of Kansas and American Museum of Natural History. Findings from this work will continue to augment a new bioluminescence exhibit created and curated by PI Sparks and co-PI Smith (Creatures of Light).</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The deep sea is a vast dark and poorly studied environment with few obvious genetic isolating barriers, such as are commonly encountered in terrestrial systems, and little is known regarding the evolutionary processes that have shaped present-day biodiversity in the deep sea. Bioluminescence is the production and emission of light from a living organism via a chemical reaction. Bioluminescence is primarily a marine phenomenon and is hypothesized to occur in approximately 80% of the eukaryotic life that inhabits the deep sea, that is, water deeper than 200 meters. Although it is frequently cited that bioluminescence has evolved as many as 40 times across the entire tree of life, when examined in the context of a taxonomically comprehensive phylogeny, research conducted under this award shows that bioluminescence has evolved at least 27 times in marine bony fishes alone, plus multiple times in cartilaginous lineages (sharks).&nbsp;<br />Our research also shows, for the first time, that deep-sea fishes, as well as some inshore groups, that possess species-specific bioluminescent structures are diversifying into new species at a more rapid rate than groups that utilize bioluminescence in ways that would not promote the isolation of populations, for example for camouflage or predation. Our research reveals that shallow water and deep-sea fish lineages that exhibit species-specific luminescent structures (e.g., species-specific lateral photophore patterns in myctophid lanternfishes and species-specific chin barbels in stomiid dragonfishes) are far more species rich given their evolutionary age than lineages that lack species-specific luminescent structures and that are hypothesized to use bioluminescence solely for ventral counterillumination (camouflage) or to facilitate prey capture. How species diversify in the deep open ocean, a region without light and obvious barriers to reproduction, has continued to perplex marine biologists. Our study provides insight into one such mechanism, species-specific bioluminescence signaling, that might facilitate diversification in this perpetually dark and poorly understood environment.<br />The ultra low-light underwater cameras that we have designed and built have allowed us to capture the first evidence of synchronized schooling behavior in fishes based entirely on bioluminescent light, in flashlight fishes (Anomalopidae) from the Solomon Islands. In general, fishes school using sensory (lateral line) and visual cues, and lose their schooling ability after dark. The observation that schooling behavior in fishes can be facilitated solely by bioluminescent light is novel. These studies add to our understanding of how life thrives and evolution shaped present-day biodiversity in the deep sea, the largest and arguably least explored habitat on earth, and specifically how bioluminescence signaling facilitates diversification in marine systems.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 05/22/2020<br>      Modified by: John&nbsp;S&nbsp;Sparks</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1257555/1257555_10281607_1590174937681_Flashlightfish--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1257555/1257555_10281607_1590174937681_Flashlightfish--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Flashlight fish"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1257555/1257555_10281607_1590174937681_Flashlightfish--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Flashlight fish"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Flashlight fish from the Solomon Islands (Anomalops katoptron) that was shown to school based solely on bioluminescent signaling.
