<AbstractNarration>This Project will support the web-based data sharing of high-resolution, high-quality, whole mouse brain data obtained from an innovative 3D microscopy technology called Knife-Edge Scanning Microscopy (KESM). Furthermore, the data from KESM will be linked to other existing, complementary data sets such as the Allen Brain Atlas containing extensive gene expression data, effectively multiplying the utility of the resource for neuroscientists studying the brain by relating structural data (microstructure) to functional data (gene expression).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The central goal of this project is to devise a web-based data dissemination framework to link and to deliver massive amounts of mouse brain data (up to 2 terabytes per brain) to the neuroscience research community in an easily accessible form. To this end, the research team will design and develop a light-weight, web-based 3D visualization and annotation framework so that the KESM data can be viewed, annotated, and analyzed at multiple resolutions (imagine Google Maps in full 3D). The project is expected to result in a unique resource that provides an unprecedented look into the wiring of the entire mouse brain in the context of large-scale gene expression data.  Such a resource can help scientists begin to unravel the intricate functions of the brain, and in the long term enable the construction of intelligent artifacts based on such an understanding. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will involve graduate and undergraduate researchers, and a simplified version of the resource will be created to kindle interest and fascination for brain science in K12 students and in the general public.  The framework developed in this project is expected to have broader application in geology, meteorology, and even in astronomy where huge amounts of 3D data are gathered routinely yet the access limited due to the massiveness and 3D nature of the data. All data and software resulting from this project will be released in the public domain, available in full at http://kesm.org.</AbstractNarration>

The Knife-Edge Scanning Microscope (KESM), developed and hosted in the project team's lab, is one of the first such instruments to generate whole-brain-scale data at sub-micrometer resolution. In a previous project funded by NSF, the research team built a web-based 3D brain atlas platform for their mouse brain neuronal (Golgi-stained) and blood vessel (India ink-stained) data.  In the current project, the research team extended both the data set and the web-based 3D atlas features and capabilities, with support for data from external sources other than their KESM data.  The outcomes of this data sharing project are as follows.  1. New Data: (1) Whole mouse brain, in Nissl (showing all cell bodies, KESM); (2) Whole mouse brain, in Golgi (additional data, showing neuronal morphology, KESM); and (3) Small volume of mouse brain data (multiple molecular labels, Array Tomography, about 100^3 um^3).  2. Enhanced atlas features: (1) Open Layers API, instead of Google Maps API, for performance enhancements (faster download and display); (2) Registration to the rodent-standard Waxholm space (KESM Nissl data), for cross-linking different mouse brain data sources; (3) Registration to the Allen Brain Atlas (KESM Nissl data), for importing annotations, gene expression data, and connectivity data; (4) All three orientations supported (horizontal, coronal, and sagittal), for improved visual exploration; (5) Algorithms for tracing (both automated and manual), for quantitative analysis; (6) Enhanced unit-volume viewer integrated into the web environment (using OpenGL), for detailed visual exploration; and (7) A turn-key mirroring facility, for off-line and online browsing and dissemination.  3. Educational outcomes: (1) 1 Ph.D. student (graduated) and (2) 7 M.S. students were trained (graduated) through participation in this project. (3) Four undergraduate students participated in the project as well.  4. Dissemination: The project resulted in (1) one conference publication, (2) one book chapter, (3) three conference presentations (abstracts), (4) 1 Ph.D. dissertation, and (5) 7 M.S. theses. Data and source code from the project are made available from the project web site. The research team also shipped their data and code on hard drives to five different research labs around the world (3 in the US, 1 in Germany, 1 in Saudi Arabia). Data from the project were featured in a public exhibit at San Francisco's Exploratorium (Spring 2015).  Scientific merit: The platform developed in this project allows neuroscience researchers to quickly browse the mouse brain data sets using a web-based interface, and inspect manageably sized unit volumes for visualization and analysis on their local system. Full volumes at max resolution are made available for download or shipping on hard drive (turn-key mirroring).  Since the data are available for the whole brain at microscopic detail, a truly quantitative study can be conducted, which, when coupled with other atlases such as gene expression atlases (e.g., from the Allen Institute), can help explain the variability in neuronal and vascular morphology and the genes that cause such variability.  Broader impact: The project involved graduate and undergraduate researchers, and the data and web-based interface can be used for activities involving K12 and the general public (e.g., the data were featured in a public science exhibit).
