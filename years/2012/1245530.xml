<AbstractNarration>The project is developing a multidisciplinary, multi-campus program minor in 'energy science, technology, and policy', through a unique regional partnership consisting of public and private four-year and two-year colleges. Project objectives include: 1) successful design and implementation of a multi-institution energy education program that is leveraging institutional academic strengths and access to student populations at the different campuses; 2) design of a program valuable for students in both technical (i.e. architecture, engineering, and science) and non-technical (i.e. business, accounting, and general studies) majors, at both two-year and four-year colleges; 3) enhancement of STEM learning through multidisciplinary curricula, experiential learning through&lt;br/&gt;internships and research, and incorporation of stakeholder input in course and program development; and 4) recruitment and retention of students from underrepresented and underserved populations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is enhancing collaboration with STEM education community and  is helping to promote the two- to four-year college transition and beyond. By coordinating the program across multiple campuses, the project is facilitating articulation among institutions. Several of the schools involved have large populations of students traditionally underrepresented in STEM fields, and all have significant programs aimed at recruitment and retention. The project is working to increase participation from those groups significantly.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This collaboration is the beginning of a broad multi-institution interdisciplinary focus on energy and related issues for a variety of career paths.  A major goal of the collaboration is to establish a multi-disciplinary academic curriculum in energy, designed to provide both technical and managerial skills necessary to evaluate alternative energy sources, conduct market analysis and forecasts, and/or improve the efficiency in residential, commercial and industrial buildings.  The program is valuable for students in both technical (i.e. architecture, engineering, and science) and non-technical (i.e. business, accounting, and general studies) programs.. The ultimate goal is to boost the Long Island economy and contribute infrastructure jobs in the energy sector.  The participants in the project are all members of the Long Island Alternative Energy Consortium (LIAEC), a cooperative effort by seven public and private colleges and universities (Stony Brook University, Farmingdale State College, SUNY Old Westbury, SUNY Maritime, New York Institute of Technology, Suffolk County Community College and Nassau County Community College), working with public entities (including Brookhaven National Laboratory) and private companies, to ensure that students get the education and training they need to work in the emerging and rapidly evolving industries of renewable and alternative energies.  Preparing students to master the many facets of an industry that is constantly changing requires more than a prescribed set of skills.  For students to analyze energy policy decisions, follow the dynamics of various energy markets, or understand how to use and manage emergent energy technologies, the smart grid and future infrastructure systems, they will need an interdisciplinary education supported by a diverse set of perspectives, including practical experiences and multidisciplinary approaches.  Ultimately, to respond to the skilled workforce development needs of industry as well as the need to develop a generation of graduates who understand the sustainable, system-based approach to energy research and development, we require a successful energy education paradigm focused on industry, academia, research and policy-making, while at the same time, leveraging the resources of a consortium of colleges, from community colleges to four year and research intensive universities.  This project has provided extremely valuable experience on the development of multi-institution educational programs, in particular in the field of undergraduate energy education.  Methodologies (and roadblocks) to cross-registration and curriculum development have been explored, as well as methodologies for private/public institution partnerships in academic program development.  Identification of key learning needs and objectives, with input from stakeholders (including industry and policy making bodies), has allowed participating academic institutions to develop a curriculum with real-world applicability and relevance to work-force development in the energy sector.  This partnership with other universities represents an invaluable resource for academic collaboration across campuses.  Through the project, faculty and staff have been able to collaborate on the development of multi-institutional educational programs, in particular in the field of energy education at the undergraduate level.
