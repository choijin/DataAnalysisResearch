<AbstractNarration>This award from the Division of Chemistry at the National Science Foundation supports a Research Experiences for Undergraduate (REU) Site led by Professors Andrew Greenberg and Robert Hamers, both at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. The REU Site entitled "Chemistry of Materials for Renewable Energy" (CMRE REU) will fund 11 to 12 undergraduate students for a 10 week summer research experiences. Students will conduct individual research projects focused on chemical research applied to problems in renewable energy. The CMRE REU program will help students to strengthen their written and oral communication skills through proposal presentations, mid-experience report writing, and poster presentations. A novel aspect of the CMRE REU program is the encouragement of students to participate in an outreach experience with the Institute for Chemical Education's (ICE) "Fun with Chemistry Camp" to teach 5th-8th students about solar energy. To ensure proper mentoring and development of CMRE REU students, this project includes a mentoring workshop for graduate students, post-doctoral fellows, and faculty working directly with the REU Program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts of the award involves young scientists who will be exposed to modern research methods and tools as part of their training. This REU site aims to provide cutting-edge research training in the chemical sciences to these students who might not otherwise have this opportunity. The research projects in chemistry will have an impact in the areas of energy and sustainability. The diverse student cohort participating in research at this site will be well-prepared for graduate school, and eventual employment as part of the country's technical workforce.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Chemistry of Materials for Renewable Energy Research Experience for Undergraduates program ran four summers from 2014-2017.  The program fully or partially supported 43 undergraduate students to preform renewable energy related research in the labs of faculty at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. As is the goal of the REU program a high percentage of REU students chose to pursue advanced degrees in science or engineering, 82%. Included during the summer program were professional development activities that helped prepare students for future careers in science and engineering disciplines.  The project director worked closely with the Museum of Science Boston to develop and present a series of science communication workshops designed to teach undergraduate students the required communication skills for a professional scientist or engineer.  The outcomes of the workshops were sent to similar research programs around the country. Students used their gained communication skills in a series of program assignments including presentations and posters of the work accomplished during their time working in the laboratories.  In addition to research work and communication skills this project had a direct impact on the training of graduate students and post doctoral scholars who served as direct mentors for the undergraduate REU students.  Mentors participated in a eight mentor training seminar that taught mentors appropriate approaches to mentoring young scientists and engineers.  Participants in the mentoring seminar gained valuable skills they will use beyond their time participating as mentor in the REU program.  Trained mentors will have a long term impact on training of future scientists and engineers.              Last Modified: 01/19/2018       Submitted by: Andrew Greenberg]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
