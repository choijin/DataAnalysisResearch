<AbstractNarration>TECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports research in condensed matter physics and materials theory that focuses on understanding the coupling between spin and other internal degrees of freedom and environmental factors in spin-orbit coupled molecular nanostructures.  Both quantum-mechanical computer simulations based on first-principles computations and model Hamiltonian approaches will be employed to achieve this goal. Spin degrees of freedom in nanostructures provide both complexity and control knobs of properties of nanostructures. They can be coupled to other internal degrees of freedom, and are very susceptible to external perturbations such as temperature, pressure, mechanical stretching, current, or magnetic field, at the nanometer scale. This coupling and response to perturbations can be used to manipulate properties of nanostructures for effective, efficient nanoscale devices. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To study physical properties of nanostructures, it is customary to rely on either large-scale computer simulations or theoretical models. However, the coupling and response to perturbations in nanostructures turn out to be so subtle that either quantum-mechanical simulations or a model Hamiltonian approach with arbitrary parameter values alone cannot provide a comprehensive picture of the coupling and its consequences in properties of nanostructures. The specific objectives of the research to be carried out are as follows: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(1) To clarify coupling mechanisms and to quantify the strengths of coupling of spin to other degrees of freedom and external environmental factors such as substrate and current, using quantum-mechanical simulations (density-functional theory including spin-orbit coupling). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(2) To investigate responses of spin degrees of freedom and its coupling to the environmental factors using a model Hamiltonian approach with parameter values obtained from the quantum-mechanical simulations.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results of the proposed research will be compared with experiments via international and national collaborations. The outcomes of the research will shed light on new ways to greatly increase spin transfer/transport and spin polarization in molecular nanostructures, and to build energy-saving new spin-based devices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award also supports education of undergraduate and graduate students and a postdoctoral researcher by engaging them in research at the forefront of nanoscience and high-performance computing.  To integrate the proposed research efforts into education, the PI will incorporate the outcomes of the proposed research into a new 4000-level course, "Nanomaterials and Devices", designed for a new Nanoscience undergraduate degree program in the College of Science. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports research in condensed matter physics and materials theory that focuses on understanding the coupling between different quantum-mechanical degrees of freedom and its consequences in molecular nano-structures that are approximately one millionth the size of the human hair.  Among those degrees of freedom, the electron "spin" is of particular interest because it provides both complexity and control knobs to manipulate various properties of molecular nano-structures. Spin degrees of freedom can interact with other internal degrees of freedom, and they are very susceptible to environmental factors such as temperature, pressure, mechanical stretching, current, or magnetic field, at the nanometer scale.  This coupling and response to environmental factors can be used to manipulate properties of nanostructures to build new energy-saving tiny devices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To study physical properties of nanostructures, it is customary to rely on either large-scale computer simulations or theoretical models. However, the coupling and response to environmental factors in nanostructures turn out to be so subtle that either computer simulations or mathematical models alone cannot provide a comprehensive picture of the coupling and its consequences in properties of nano-structures. In this research, the PI will use both approaches to achieve the following objectives:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(1) Using large-scale computer simulations, the mechanisms through which spin couples to other degrees of freedom and external environmental factors will be clarified and the relevant coupling strengths will be quantified. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(2) Using mathematical models with parameter values obtained from the simulations, the response of spin degrees of freedom to various environmental factors will be investigated. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results of the proposed research will be compared with experiments via international and national collaborations. The outcomes of the research will shed light on new ways to greatly increase spin transport in molecular nanostructures, and to build new energy-saving devices at the nanoscale.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award also supports education of undergraduate and graduate students and a postdoctoral researcher by engaging them in research at the forefront of nanoscience and high-performance computing.

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit:  Recent discoveries of new quantum phases of matter and breakthroughs in local probes and control of nanoscale systems opens new pathways to understanding critical roles of coupling between electron spin and orbital degrees of freedom and its applications for spintronics and quantum computation. When this coupling is applied to other microscopic or macroscopic quantum effects, it can induce new topological phases of matter which are robust against environmental factors.  During the entire award period, the PI investigated effects of coupling between electron spin and other internal degrees of freedom or environmental factors in nanoscale systems or heterotsturctures, by combining first-principles-based computer simulations with effective mathematical models.  Nanoscale magnetic molecules have net magnetic moments several or several tens as large as the electron spin moment, yet they show quantum properties. Such molecules can be fabricated within single-molecule transistor set-ups. We found that such molecules can have significant interactions with a substrate which modify the magnetic properties of the molecules, and that when the vibrational modes of the molecules are strongly coupled to tunneling electrons in a single-molecule transistor, current is highly suppressed even at low bias. Furthermore, when the magnetic anisotropy type of the molecule is varied upon charging the molecule, current can be also blocked at low bias, without strong coupling to the vibrational modes.  The strong coupling between electric charge and spin also induces new quantum state of matter, i.e., topological insulators or metals, where topological properties (i.e. Dirac cones with spin-momentum locking) are robust against local perturbations which is ideal for stable device applications. To build devices, robustness of these properties in heterostructures needs to be understood. We found that charge transfer at the interfaces is inevitable independently of substrate type, and that it can change the Dirac cone at the interface with modified spin textures, depending on the symmetry of the interface.  Despite these changes, there seems to be descendent states which have some properties similar to the topological surface states.    Broader impacts:  Our findings provide the mechanism of the interactions between the interfaces or environmental factors and the electric charge/spin degrees of freedom in strongly spin-orbit coupled nanostructures, and they will shed light into actual device fabrications. We developed effective models for several nanostructure systems where the parameter values were obtained from first-principles-based simulations.
