<AbstractNarration>This project will engage five study components in sequence: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Conduct a needs assessment focused on (a) faculty members' use of evidenced-based instructional practices, and (b) faculty members' attitudes toward the use of evidence-based instructional practices to determine the current state of evidence-based instructional practices in STEM-related core courses for STEM majors and non-majors, &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2. Carry out a phenomenological study of faculty members' justifications for instructional choices to better understand the rationale underlying the pedagogical approaches to the teaching of STEM-related core courses, &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3. Conduct a curriculum mapping of the STEM-related core courses to document the focus of faculty members' instructional practices to better understand the relationship between the knowledge and skills taught within and across STEM-related core courses for STEM majors and non-majors, &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;4. Conduct an outcomes assessment of students' (a) learning of essential content, (b) complex cognition, and (c) epistemological belief to understand the practical outcomes of evidence-based instructional practices for STEM majors and non-majors in STEM-related core courses, &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;5. Design, develop, and implement a pilot program based on the findings of the needs assessment, phenomenological study, curriculum mapping, and outcomes assessments.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ A well-rounded education makes a good citizenry. This was the central tenet of this project, which sought to determine the state of current evidence-based instructional strategies, curricular structure, and student learning outcomes in Curriculum for a Liberal Education courses. Engineering literacy was defined along the lines of problem-solving and decision making, with engineering knowledge as a key component in discussing and offering critical perspectives about issues that surround social needs. Students and citizens in an engineering literacy course can learn why engineering is relevant to non-engineering fields, but also how non-engineering fields are important for engineering.     Following the completion of the literature review, an engineering literacy survey was  developed in order to determine and individual?s understanding of basic engineering ideas  concepts and skills. The engineering literacy literature review identified three basic areas of  interest: knowledge of basic engineering ideas and concepts, thinking and acting like an engineer, and basic skills and basic technologies in mathematics. These core ideas were used to construct a survey, consisting of 21 items.     The survey was administered to 120 STEM faculty members, some who teach general education and some who do not. The primary question being addressed was, "How do STEM faculty perceive engineering literacy, and do STEM faculty members who teach general education courses perceive engineering literacy differently than those who do not?" After analyzing the survey results interviews were conducted to understand of faculty members' perceptions of engineering literacy as it related to knowledge, skills, and attitudes that would be  appropriate for all Virginia Tech students to learn. Ultimately, it was our goal to be able to  delineate which aspects of engineering literacy faculty believe would be beneficial for all  students, of which aspects they have concerns, and whether they would see a role for engineering  literacy in Virginia Tech's new general education program. Of the twenty contacted individuals,  twelve (12) responded to the call for recruitment. Three of those twelve were unable to participate, so nine faculty members were interviewed.     As a result of the quantitative and qualitative analysis a new engineering course was developed and offered to introduce non-engineers to the profession via a combination of artistic endeavors, social science analyses, engineering design thinking, and community practice. The course introduces a new concept, "citizen engineering," borrowed from a tradition of citizen science in which community members ("non-experts") identify scientific questions and proceed through a formal process, such as participatory action research, to seek answers to their questions by defining and driving their own processes of inquiry and analysis, sometimes but not always with the cooperation of trained scientists.      The course introduced multiple definitions of engineering and citizenship for critical discussion, develops the idea of citizen engineering from citizen science, and then proceeds to a unit on Making where students ponder through examination of examples from art exhibits and popular media what kinds of activities might constitute Making, and which might constitute citizen engineering, and why. The students engage in various Making activities including a short project in which they design and build prototypes of an artifact to improve dorm life. After this, students gain an introduction to engineering studies through analysis of the co-construction of technology and society, and through examining the roles of citizens in large engineering projects such as nuclear power or gas pipelines. Throughout the course there is an underlying argument that non-engineers can and should engage engineering, problematizing the notion of engineering expertise as unique. A series of short essays encourage students to analyze engineering as a profession and consider their own roles as citizen engineers with the power to intervene as non-experts in engineering activities that impact society.      In this first iteration of the course, one of the authors served as a participant-observer and ethnographer focused on student learning. The observer witnessed student engagement with course topics and with one another, and interviewed all the students in the class (n=5) individually.  Using the observer?s analysis of his observation notes and interview responses, and using the instructors? analysis of student work and course feedback, we reflect on the outcomes of this first iteration of the course and consider avenues for improvement.     Although the course was designed for non-engineers and particularly students outside of STEM fields, those who enrolled for this iteration were three seniors majoring in the sciences, and three first year students who intend to major in engineering but are not yet admitted to the engineering college. This population of students struggled with critical analysis and in particular with the central argument of the course that engineering ought to be democratized, that non-engineers can make crucial contributions that improve engineering practice and hold engineering accountable for its roles in society.
