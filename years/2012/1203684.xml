<AbstractNarration>The Magnolia grandiFLORA project, named in honor of the official state tree and flower of Mississippi, will develop digital databases of images, labels, and georeferenced locality data for more than 250,000 vascular plant specimens from herbaria at Mississippi State University, University of Mississippi, Delta State University, University of Southern Mississippi, Gulf Coast Research Laboratory, Mississippi Museum of Natural Science, and Institute for Botanical Exploration. A web interface that allows for integrated database searches will be established through the High Performance Computing Collaboratory at Mississippi State University. Specimen imaging and label digitization will provide worldwide access to the collections, biological and geographical metadata for broad-scale studies based on plants, and a permanent back-up of specimen data in the event of natural or other disasters. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The resulting high quality data set will provide tools for plant identification and information on plant distributions in Mississippi to government agencies, researchers, and the general public. These data have applications in tracking rare and invasive species, developing environmental policy, increasing citizen knowledge of the natural history of Mississippi, and enhancing K-12 science education with interactive tools. The data will contribute to the development of a comprehensive list of plants in Mississippi and national efforts to catalog and map plant diversity. Numerous undergraduate and graduate students will be involved in the project.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>As a part of the North American Coastal Plain biodiversity hotspot, Mississippi has a rich flora but did not have a vouchered checklist of its plant species or an atlas documenting their distribution. Project <em>Magnolia grandiFLORA</em> was conceived as a collaborative effort of six institutions in Mississippi to digitize plant museum (herbarium) specimens in order to facilitate the preparation of a checklist and atlas of its plants. As part of this collaboration, the University of Southern Mississippi imaged, databased, and georeferenced all the plant specimens in its herbarium (25,624), representing about 4000 different species, and has made those images and data available through the online SERNEC portal (<a href="http://sernecportal.org/">http://sernecportal.org</a>). The University also digitized the specimens of the Gulf Coast Research Laboratory and collections of the Mississippi Military Department from Camp Shelby and Camp McCain, representing 10,000 additional specimens. These specimens have highlighted the importance of regional collections, because some of the species known from Mississippi in these collections were underrepresented or not represented at all in larger herbaria or in larger scale floras. Using these specimens and augmenting them with additional collections, the collaborators began a draft checklist of the state&rsquo;s plant species, an ongoing project. Two graduate students and six undergraduate students were directly involved in the digitization effort, including two women, two African Americans, and one Latina, and an additional six undergraduate students completed research projects that directly utilized data from the digitization. This experience introduced students to biodiversity surveys, herbarium/museum curation, photography, databasing, georeferencing, data curation, and online bioinformatics tools. In total, the project facilitated the completion of one master&rsquo;s thesis, six undergraduate Honors theses, seven peer-reviewed scientific papers, five book chapters, and 11 presentations at state, regional, national, and international conferences. Led by the education department of the Mississippi Museum of Natural Science, a series of workshops for K-12 educators were given, and sets of educational plant identification cards were developed for distribution with those teachers focusing on plants of the various physiographic regions of Mississippi, plants used for their beauty, carnivorous plants, common trees, and invasive species. This project has thus provided easily accessible data for scientific research, has provided the foundation for ongoing projects on the flora of Mississippi, has trained students in the uses and tools of biodiversity research, and has engaged with educators to build interest among the state&rsquo;s youth in its rich plant diversity.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 02/01/2021<br>      Modified by: Mac&nbsp;H&nbsp;Alford</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Image         </div> <div class="galControls onePhoto" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation onePhoto" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1203684/1203684_10181556_1612223504395_Magnolia_grandiFLORA_IBC2017_poster--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1203684/1203684_10181556_1612223504395_Magnolia_grandiFLORA_IBC2017_poster--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Project Magnolia grandiFLORA"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1203684/1203684_10181556_1612223504395_Magnolia_grandiFLORA_IBC2017_poster--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Project Magnolia grandiFLORA"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">International Botanical Congress Conference Poster (2017)</div> <div class="imageCredit">Lisa Wallace and Mac Alford</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Royalty-free (restricted use - cannot be shared)</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Mac&nbsp;H&nbsp;Alford</div> <div class="imageTitle">Project Magnolia grandiFLORA</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
