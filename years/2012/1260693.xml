<AbstractNarration>The spatial structure and dynamics of coastal marine fish populations are strongly influenced by the transport and recruitment of larvae. However, the scale and patterns of larval dispersal are among the most difficult demographic parameters to quantify in marine systems, due to the inability to tag and track the movement of larvae. In particular, the extent of local retention of larvae versus regional dispersal to other locations and populations is currently a hotly debated topic in the field of marine ecology and has profound implications for the design and effectiveness of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs). The research will identify patterns of larval dispersal and use those patterns to test predictions of dispersal generated by state-of-the-art circulation models. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI team brings together ecologists, geneticists, statisticians, and oceanographers with expertise in population demography and field sampling, mark/recapture data from genetic tags, and empirical and model-based evaluation of oceanographic processes to answer the following questions.  1. Do observed patterns of dispersal and connectivity of larval kelp rockfish correspond to patterns predicted by high spatial resolution regional ocean circulation models? Model predictions will be tested empirically using larval settlement samples. Parentage analysis will be used to verify the occurrence of larvae derived from genetically tagged source populations. 2. Is there evidence for local retention of larval kelp rockfish within the study area? To test the hypothesis that local retention of juvenile kelp rockfish from source populations is greater than expected by existing larval transport models, the PIs will compare the proportion of recruits that are genetically identified to have been produced from within three focal sites with the proportion of larval production that was tagged in those sites. 3. Is the relative recruitment of recently settled kelp rockfish to focal sites in the study region proportionate to the relative larval production of those focal sites? The PIs will compare the proportion of tagged recruits with the proportion of larval production generated from tagged adults at varying spatial scales. They will use goodness of fit models to compare expected and observed connectivity matrices under varying hypotheses of larval dispersal. Alternatively, if the relative contribution of focal sites to larval replenishment of themselves, one another, and more distant populations is disproportionate to their relative production, can this discrepancy be explained by oceanographic processes that could facilitate particular trajectories of larval dispersal? To determine if differences in self recruitment and connectivity can be attributed to local oceanographic features, the PIs will examine spatial and temporal correlations between these features and the spatial distribution and timing of recruitment. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: These include three elements: graduate and undergraduate interdisciplinary training, public outreach, and informing fisheries and conservation managers and policy makers. Graduate training in interdisciplinary science will be achieved through co-mentoring by PIs with expertise in population genetics, ecology and oceanography. Undergraduates will assist graduate students and faculty in all aspects of the study. Results will be disseminated to the general public through collaboration with the local University outreach center. Outreach to the fishing community will be through their involvement in the sampling program and through workshops facilitated by the Sea Grant advisor and the state collaborative fisheries program. Based on the PI's relationships with state and federal agencies, managers and policy makers will be directly informed of the results and their implications for management decisions.</AbstractNarration>

Therefore, replenishment of local populations is dependent on both the transport of young produced elsewhere, and the retention of young in their native location. The relative contribution of these sources of young to replenishment of local populations has profound consequences for the ecology, evolution and management of marine species.

We estimated the density of adults at each population from visual diver surveys each year and multiplied those densities by the area of rocky reef from high resolution seafloor maps to estimate the size of each adult population. &nbsp;The resulting estimates of adult population size relative to the numbers of adults and young sampled, and parent-offspring matches detected in each year and each population allowed us to determine the contribution each population made to replenishing itself and other populations.</p> <p dir="ltr"><span> </span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>We identified a total of nine parent-offspring pairs, which were distributed throughout the study area.

However, this contribution varied markedly among the four years (0 to 13%). At the scale of subregions, approximating local populations, we detected self-replenishment at only one population (North Carmel Bay) in only one year (2014); however, the level of self-replenishment (8%) was surprisingly high for a species of such long larval duration along the open coast.</span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span> </span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>We also found 31 pairs of recently settled full siblings that were similarly spread throughout the study area.
