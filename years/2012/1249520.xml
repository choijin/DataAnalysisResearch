<AbstractNarration>This grant will enhance participation in the fourth Midwest Verification Day 2012 (MVD 12), an informal workshop with the goal of developing a regional research network in the broad area of verification and formal methods. The long-term intention is to make MVD a regular annual event, rotating between universities in the Midwest that have representation in the relevant research areas. A major focus of MVD is to provide undergraduate and graduate students a means for becoming familiar with ongoing research in the Midwest region in the application of formal methods in hardware and software analysis. The workshop also aims to afford students a relaxed, non-competitive forum for presenting their own research to industrial participants and to students and faculty from neighboring universities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For the significant number of graduate and undergraduate students who originate in the Midwest, such an event can help build the connections and the confidence to go on to graduate school, or advance further in academia. This helps strengthen the domestic talent pool for formal methods. MVD 12 will also strengthen the regional connections between academia and industry, which, over the long term, can have a potent regional economic effect.</AbstractNarration>

MVD'12 was held September 20-21 on the campus of The Universty of Kansas hosted by The Information and Telecommunication Technology Center.  Topics covered included theorem proving, model checking, SAT/SMT solving, verification, synthesis, formal methods education and format methods tools.  Its primary goals were providing a supporting environments for students to present new ideas; providing an opportunity for midwestern formal methods researchers to form collaborations; and introducing students to companies interested in their work.  MVD'12 included 23 student presentations, an invited keynote presentation by Dr. Lee Pike from Galois, Inc, and an invited industrial presentation by Dr. Ray Richards and Dr. David Hardin of Rockwell Collins.  NSF funding provided travel and accommodation support for all student presenters not local to the venue and for our keynote speaker.  We were able to leverage our NSF funding to receive contributions from Rockwell Collins and ITTC allowing us to offer the workshop at no cost to the participants.  A number of our speakers were from underrepresented groups and most were presenting their work publicly for the first time.  Although MVD does not produce referreed proceedings, several papers on topics at MVD'12 were subsequently published in conference proceedings and journals.
