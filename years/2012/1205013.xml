<AbstractNarration>Kingsborough Community College and Brooklyn College collaboratively promote biotechnology education in New York City through 1) basic and advanced Summer Institutes in which middle and high school science teachers expand their knowledge of biotechnology and ability to engage students;  2) development of a graduate course in teaching biotechnology in which pre-service teachers focus on real-world learning; 3) opportunities for middle and high school students to perform experiments in a college laboratory and in their own schools via a new lending laboratory; and 4) creation and implementation of embedded virtual enterprise simulations in which college biotechnology majors improve their workforce skills.  Activities are guided by input from biotechnology industry representatives. Improvements in skills, knowledge and attitudes are evaluated. The project's methodology and outcomes are disseminated through local and national conferences, articles, an on-line e-community, and a capstone conference.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The On Campus Discoveries in Science (OCDS) project at Kingsborough Community College (KCC) was designed to strengthen science teaching and broaden the pipeline of qualified science students through professional development opportunities for high school teachers as well as providing KCC biotechnology majors experiences designed to make them more competitive in the job market. From 2012-2016, 51 high school teachers participated in two summer workshops workshops, entitled Gene Transfer and Genomics and Gene Cloning and Proteomics, facilitated by KCC Biology faculty who teach in the biotechnology program.  Upon completion of the summer experience, high school teachers were given supplies to conduct biotechnology experiments with their students.  Based on the results of a post-survey, teachers reported the greatest obstacles to incorporating biotechnology experiments into their courses were lack of equipment, lab space, and time.  In response, this project gave teachers access to a lending lab of equipment as well as a trained KCC Biotechnology student who worked with the high school class and assisted the teacher in carrying out engaging laboratory experiments.  The KCC Biotechnology students also participated in virtual enterprise (VE) experience in which they applied their scientific knowledge to develop a product that could be sold by a biotechnology company.   In a survey, KCC students reported they believed the VE experience contributed to their understanding of the course content as well as the interdisciplinary nature of science.     OCDS responded to numerous high profile reports, such as Vision and Change in Undergraduate Education:  A Call to Action and Engage to Excel, pointing out gaps in achievement for U.S. students and calling for improved preparation of teachers through professional development.  High school and college students gained a better understanding of biotechnology so that these urban students gained a greater vision of possible STEM careers. The project?s activities addressed the need to increase the STEM talent pool, particularly among underrepresented groups.
