<AbstractNarration>The objective of this award is the development of optimization models, solution methods for those models, and insights that will enable organizations to perform workforce planning while recognizing the near and long-term effects of human learning.  These optimization models will be based on descriptive, quantitative models of human learning.  Developed by the organizational psychology community, the (nonlinear) shape of these learning models makes them a challenge to use in optimization. This work overcomes this challenge by encoding the nonlinear relationship between experience level and learning into a parameter that can be computed outside of the optimization.  Having mitigated the challenge of the learning curves, the work will develop more realistic optimization models that recognize operational considerations, the potential of training and cross-training activities, and uncertainty in learning parameters and future tasks to be performed.  The improved realism of our workforce planning models will bring new computational challenges, and the research will develop new solution methods.  Computational experiments and analysis will be performed to derive insights into how learning impacts workforce planning and strategies for using these insights for maximum benefit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, this research will produce tools that organizations can use to enhance their competitiveness in the near term and to position their workforce to take advantage of future opportunities.  These tools will help organizations make decisions involving hiring and training activities, as well as understand the tradeoffs between hiring and training/re-training.  Further, developed solution methods, particularly those related to linearizing nonlinear functions, are applicable in other contexts. The multi-disciplinary nature of the project, which if successful, will yield publications in both operations management/research and organizational psychology journals could bridge the gap between those disciplines.</AbstractNarration>

Our work then incorporated the technique into the development of additional new optimization techniques for solving workforce planning problems, and notably problems that account for random demand.  One such development is a mathheuristic for solving two-stage stochastic programming models of workforce planning models that incorporate human learning and demand uncertainty.  This matheuristic is the first solution approach for solving stochastic workforce planning problems wherein heterogeneous workers learn.       Our work also introduces an approximate dynamic programming approach, specifically a value function approximation, for the problem of scheduling technicians to jobs over a long horizon in which demand is uncertain.  We show that, while the problem does not possess the properties (e.g. monotonicity, concavity/convexity) often exploited in ADP approaches, a linear value-function approximation still offers good approximations despite the nonlinearity.        As part of simulations performed in the testing of the models and algorithms, the work identified several results that are of interest to managers who must hire and schedule workers.  Our most important contribution is to show the value an organization can achieve by sacrificing productivity in the near-term to appropriately position its workforce with respect to experience.
