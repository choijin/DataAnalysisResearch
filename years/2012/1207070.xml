<AbstractNarration>TECHNICAL SUMMARY: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The work is a fundamental investigation of the viscoelastic response of ultrathin polymer films in two different conditions. The work will compare, contrast, and seek origins of differences between the nanobubble inflation method developed by the PI at Texas Tech University and the liquid dewetting method developed by Bodiguel and Fretigny in Paris (which are the only methods currently available to measure the viscoelastic response of unsupported films).  The two techniques had shown substantial differences in glass transition temperatures as functions of film thickness.  The two methods differ in that one measures films with free surfaces and the other measures films floating on a mobile substrate. The planned research will examine the effects of changing substrate, molecular weight, and molecular architecture on the viscoelastic properties of ultrathin polymer films. It will explore the hypothesis that the relevant differences in confinement behavior are related to very subtle differences in surface energy/surface interactions and will provide new data focused on the understanding of how surfaces and interfaces impact the dynamics of polymers confined to the nanometer size scale.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The dramatic influence of nanoscale confinement on material behavior is exemplified by the response of ultrathin polymer films that show tremendous property changes, for example, in freely suspended films having nanometer thicknesses.  Yet the origins of these changes are not yet elucidated.  The present work probes these changes using two novel nanomechanical test methods.  The work compares and contrasts mechanical properties of a series of polymers having different molecular characteristics. In addition, because there is such a strong apparent effect of the environment seen by the film surface, the work probes the behavior of the ultrathin polymer films exposed to liquids having different properties. The research provides new data in the understanding of how surfaces and interfaces impact the mechanics of polymers confined to the nanometer size scale.  The project also has an important component that trains graduate students and, in addition to their scientific training, involves them in a STEM outreach program to young girls through the "Science: It's a Girl Thing" Program at Texas Tech University.</AbstractNarration>

They also show weaker dependence than films supported on rigid substrates such as silica. Hence, it is demonstrated that the liquid mobility at the surface of the film is not the sole determinant of the Tg reduction but that interfacial energies must play an important role.              In our development of the liquid dewetting experiment for our own laboratory, we made the observation that, because the Tg increases as film thickness increases, one can carry out "temperature step dewetting" experiments to obtain the glass transition temperature as a function of film thickness for multiple film thicknesses in a single experiment. This is done by stepping the temperature from below the Tg of an initially very thin film to above the Tg at that thickness. The film, then, spontaneously shrinks due to the dewetting stresses. Because the Tg increases as the dewetting film thickens, the rate of shrinkage tends towards zero at a thickness with the Tg of the set temperature. By repeating the temperature step process multiple film thicknesses and their Tg values can be determined from the single original sample. Unlike prior work, which requires a Tg determination for every film thickness as a new film preparation, this method offers a much more efficient means of studying the thickness dependence of the Tg than had been previously available.              By investigating multiple materials using the bubble inflation method we discovered that ultrathin polymer films exhibit extreme stiffening in their behavior when above the Tg. We were able to correlate the rubbery stiffening index S with the macroscopic segmental or alpha-relaxation behavior. And we find that S is correlated with both the dynamic fragility index m for the temperature dependence of the glassy dynamics and with the coupling parameter na .  We found this was true of the organic polymers tested as well as for amorphous selenium above its glass transition temperature.              Finally, one of the exciting aspects of National Science Foundation support is that it is directed to the formation of students.  In the Department of Chemical Engineering at Texas Tech University the Ph.D. qualifying exam is an open ended question that the aspiring student takes 6 to 8 weeks to answer and defend before their Ph.D. committee. Sometimes the problem is posed so well and the student responds so well that the question actually can turn into a Ph.D. thesis. This happened with this project for one student (Jing Zhao) who began by answering a question about tempera...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
