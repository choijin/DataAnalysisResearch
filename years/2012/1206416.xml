<AbstractNarration>This award by the Biomaterials program in the Division of Materials Research to Yeshiva University is cofunded by the Biomolecular Dynamics, Structure, and Function program in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences, the Directorate for Biological Sciences. The goal of this project is to better understand the role of chirality in the phase behavior of globular proteins. Chirality is central to protein function, but its relation to protein phase behavior has yet to be investigated thoroughly. The phase behavior of several globular proteins will be examined in the presence of chiral additives by determining the solubility of the protein-additive crystalline complexes and by characterizing the liquid phases of protein-additive mixtures. For each protein, both enantiomers of the additive will be studied separately and as a racemic mixture. In addition to the experimental work, molecular dynamics simulations will be carried out to elucidate the details of the protein-chiral additive interactions. As a knowledge of protein phase behavior is central to understanding many biophysical phenomena, the proposed activity would develop our understanding of protein crystallization and biomaterial design through the use of chirality to control protein self-assembly, and this knowledge base may directly benefit society in potential biomedical applications. An additional impact of this project is its educational aspect in a primarily undergraduate institution. The proposed research will be carried out solely with undergraduate students, who will become proficient in biophysical lab techniques such as ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy, high-performance liquid chromatography, and static and dynamic light scattering among others.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is to understand how proteins pack together into different arrangements by making use of the built-in handedness of proteins, which is known as chirality. If we knew how to pack proteins into whatever arrangement we wanted, many scientific advances would become possible. For example, we could use protein crystals to figure out the structure and then the function of any protein. Also, the researcher plans to design new materials made out of protein or purify proteins rapidly and reliably on an industrial scale. In this project, a combination of experiments and computer simulations will be used to discover how the handedness (chirality) of protein controls their packing arrangement (known as "the phase behavior"). In addition to the research component, there are important educational and outreach aspects to this project. The work will be carried out only with undergraduate students who will learn science by carrying out cutting-edge research. These students are expected to become proficient in advanced research techniques and they will be trained to pursue careers in science and engineering. Also, new physics courses will be offered to first-year, intermediate and advanced students. Finally, activities designed to stimulate the interest of non-science majors in science will be organized, such as a periodic lecture series for general audiences that explains the work behind the Nobel Prizes in Physiology and Medicine, Physics, Chemistry, Literature, Peace and Economics.</AbstractNarration>
