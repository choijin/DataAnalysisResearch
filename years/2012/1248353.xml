<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project concerns the design and high-throughput and low-cost manufacturing of metal-based miniature gas chromatograph (mGC) sensor structures.  The proposed mGC sensor design and manufacturing is unique and offers competitive advantages as compared to current "micro GC" devices/systems on the market.  Miniaturized GC Sensors are envisioned to become the building blocks for future GC instruments, in which each mGC module can perform a separate analytical function.  Analytical instruments containing multiple mGCs can be tailored to provide analyses of compounds with widely different chemical characteristics.  Such instruments may become "niche analyzers" for field analytical use not possible with current capabilities.  Design and efficient fabrication of high-reliability, low-cost, metal-based, mGC sensors are critical for establishing the technical and commercial feasibility of such devices.  The project team combines extensive expertise on GC design, testing, and applications as well as microfabrication of metal-based high-aspect-ratio microscale structures (HARMS).  Fabrication of metallic HARMS by molding replication, combined with efficient microscale bonding, promises low-cost, high-throughput, mGC device production with high reliability.  The proposed methodology offers competitive advantages compared to silicon-based integrated-circuit processing techniques and represents a good opportunity for pushing metal-based mGC sensors to commercially-viable products.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is multifaceted and significant.  Miniature GC sensor modules can be a device that promotes efficiency and improvements throughout industry and society.  For example, better monitoring improves the quality of chemical products.  On-site monitoring and processing of multi-point compositional information improves chemical plant efficiencies and the control of process upsets.  Early detection of emissions from leaks prevents pollution, and helps industry meet clean air compliance requirements.  Effective monitoring assures water quality and alleviates public health concerns.  The availability of mGC sensors will eliminate many field sampling activities connected to laboratory analysis.  Real-time monitoring lowers compliance cost of environmental regulations and fines, and accelerates the permit process.  Increased security at airports and public facilities lessens public apprehension and reduce time delays.  Detection of disease earlier and more cheaply improves health care.  As such, significant market interest exists for the proposed technology.  The proposed mGC sensors may enable many new and yet unrealized applications. This is where the mGC sensor modules will have it greatest potential for market expansion.  By focusing on such market expansion opportunities, the presently proposed project combines technical innovation with commercial promise.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This short document describes the final outcome of the NSF SBIR Phase I project, "Design and cost effective manufacturing of miniature gas chromatograph sensors", NSF IIP-1248353, 01/2013-06/2013.  The project is executed by Enervana Technologies LLC of Baton Rouge, Louisiana, in collaboration with Louisiana State University as the project subawardee.   The project goal is to demonstrate the feasibilty of fabricating key components of Al-based, fast, versatile, miniature gas chromatograph (mGC) sensors with alternative micromanufacturing technologies that promise high reliability, high throughput, and low cost.  These Al-based mGC sensors could function as stand-alone, hand-held devices with excellent analytical selectivity and compound discriminating ability.  These sensors, or arrays of sensors, may find wide-ranging applications, from process monitoring in petrochemical industries to fast diagnostics in medical care industries.   The overall project goal is accomplished through the successful completion of seven individual R&amp;D tasks: 1) demonstrate the feasibility of fabricating high-strength, high-aspect-ratio microscale mold inserts; 2) demonstrate the feasibility of using molding replication to fabricate Al-based microcolumns suitable for building mGC chips; 3) demonstrate the feasibility of using transient liquid phase bonding to fabricate enclosed Al microcolumns; 4) demonstrate fabrication of connections from mGC microcolumns to external devices; 5) use existing GC testing platforms to characterize gas flow through Al microcolumn chips; 6) demonstrating the feasibility of modification and passivation of Al microcolumn internal surfaces; 7) coat the Al mGC microcolumn with active phases and demonstrate chromatographic separation.   Within the duration of the Enervana Phase I project, all seven R&amp;D tasks have been accomplished.  On the intellectual front, the feasibility of using high-throughput molding replication, transient liquid phase bonding, and proper assembly techniques to build functional Al-based mGC chips has been demonstrated.  Chromatographic separation of standard hydrocarbon gases through coated Al mGC chips has been shown.  In addition, an electrochemical method has been utilized to create conformal aluminum oxide layers with controllable morphologies on internal surfaces of aluminum microcolumns.  Taken together, this SBIR Phase I project has shown the promise of using EnervanaÆs patent protected manufacturing technologies to create compact and functional Al-based mGC chips.  The broader impact of the present Phase I project lies in the applicability of compact and functional Al-based mGC chips to a wide range of industries, including the petrochemical, medical, and defense industries.   In summary, Enervana has performed all R&amp;D tasks and met all milestones as proposed in the original Phase I proposal.  We have successfully managed the Phase I project, demonstrated the requisite technical feasibility, and are now ready for the follow-on Phase II project from the technology development standpoint.
