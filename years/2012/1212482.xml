<AbstractNarration>We will build upon the latest advances in atomic and optical physics to  develop novel approaches to quantum information processing with neutral  atoms. We will study the feasibility of realizing basic elements of quantum computing architecture, such as quantum gates  and long-lived quantum memory with divalent atoms held in specially-engineered  "magic"  optical traps.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will be carried out in Nevada, one of the EPSCoR (Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research) states, underrepresented in the scientific enterprise.  The work will fulfill one of the  strategic goals of the NSF to "broaden participation and enhance diversity in NSF programs."</AbstractNarration>
