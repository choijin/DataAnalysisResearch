<AbstractNarration>The investigator will focus on two projects. First, a program to extend the current description of the subgroup structure of the finite simple groups, and to use that information to establish a negative answer to an important question in universal algebra, open for over thirty years: Is each finite lattice an interval in the lattice of subgroups of a finite group? Second, a program to classify the simple saturated 2-fusion systems of component type. One consequence of the second project should be a simplification of the proof of the theorem classifying the finite simple groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The classification of the finite simple groups is one of the premiere achievements of modern mathematics, providing the algebraic foundation for the study of the symmetry of finite objects. Unfortunately the proof is very long and complicated, consisting of as many as ten thousand pages, spread amongst hundreds of articles. There are at least two books, aimed at a lay audience, describing the human aspects of the effort. An emerging area of mathematics, studying objects called fusion systems, offers hope of simplifying the proof of the classification using an innovative approach.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The project involves groups, fusion systems, and lattices.  Groups are algebraic objects that are the basis for the study of symmetry. The classification of the finite simple groups is one of the premier achievements of modern mathematics, and the basis for many applications of finite group theory in various branches of mathematics. However the proof of the classification theorem is very long and complicated, so it calls out for simplification.  The theory of fusion systems is an emerging area of mathematics on the boundary of algebra and topology. Aschbacher approaches fusion systems from an algebraic point of view. He is in the midst of a program to classify a certain large class of  2-fusion systems, and to use this result to simplify the proof of the theorem classifying the finite simple groups.  In order to apply the classification of simple groups, one needs deep information about the subgroup structure of such groups. Part of the itellectual merit of the project derives from new theorems proved by Aschbacher on the lattice of  subgroups of finite simple groups. Aschbacher is also attempting to use such results, together with the classification of the simple groups, to settle in the negative an important question in universal algebra dating to 1980: is every finite lattice an interval in the subgroup lattice of a finite group?  Broader impact was achieved by mentoriing two students in the Caltech Summer Undergraduate Research Program. The students proved theorems related to the programs, and in the process were introduced to mathematical research.
