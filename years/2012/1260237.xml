<AbstractNarration>The primary goal of this project is to constrain the complex forcing functions tying evolution and preservation of the margin stratigraphic record to base-level changes. These processes include eustasy, climatic and paleooceanographic variations, tectonism, compaction and rates of sediment supply. Existing borehole data will provide lithostratigraphy, geochronology and paleobathymetry. Geomorphology revealed by horizontal slices (among other 3D imaging tools) will identify diagnostic features such as river systems, shorelines, delta channels, sediment failure scars, etc., none of which can be resolved in existing 2D seismic data to the degree required to map shifting shallow-water depositional settings in the vicinity of clinoform rollovers. For the general benefit of a broad user community the PIs will coordinate and acquire a 3D seismic data encompassing the three IODP drillsites on the inner-middle shelf of the New Jersey (NJ) continental margin on R/V Marcus Langseth. Data will be made available to the engaged scientific community to use as the foundation of follow-on, PI- driven proposals that improve understanding of factors shaping the NJ margin in particular, and that imprint the sedimentary record at continental margins in general. 3D seismic imaging can now be applied to the NJ margin to put these sampled records in a spatially accurate, stratigraphically meaningful context. Such imagery will allow researchers to map sequences around drill sites with a resolution and confidence previously unattainable, and to analyze their spatial/temporal evolution. Objectives include: 1) establishing the impact of known Ice House base-level changes on the stratigraphic record; 2) providing greater understanding of the response of near-shore environments to changes in elevation of global sea level (with special relevance to the current relentless rise), and 3) determining the amplitudes/timing of global sea-level changes during the mid-Cenozoic, which should help humanity put anthropogenic base-level change in a proper long-term context. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will collaboratively engage the scientific community and generate widely accessible data for all users. Students and early-career scientists will be mentored and involved in the cruise. The PIs will produce exhibits and/or lectures hosted by the Rutgers Geology Museum. Since the source of the sedimentary record offshore New Jersey fed a similar pulse of sediments into the Gulf of Mexico, increasing knowledge of the evolution of the NJ shelf may help improve strategies for hydrocarbon exploration in the Gulf.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ We acquired 3D acoustic images of sediments beneath the New Jersey continental shelf that reveal a long history of vertical changes in sea-level and lateral migrations of the shoreline. These images are geologic sonograms of the Earth located across 3 sites where sediments in 2009 were sampled to 750 m below the seafloor by Expedition 313 of the Integrated Ocean Discovery Program.  Those samples revealed the composition, age and depositional environment of ancient non-marine soils, brackish bay muds, beach sands, mixed delta deposits and continental shelf materials deposited in an open marine setting.  Our acoustic images are of extraordinarily high resolution and when ground-truthed with these samples will identify and trace the development of such morphologic features as onshore river systems, shorelines, delta channels, offshore sand waves, submarine canyons, and more.  None of these features can be resolved with existing acoustic data to the degree needed to map shifting shallow-water depositional environments.  Existing data on today's New Jersey shelf are good but are simply vertical 2D profiles much like X-Ray images.  We've collected the equivalent of a set of MRI images that provide a nearly limitless number of views at any orientation through a solid 3D object.  Future research based on studies that combine the sediment cores with our 3D images will yield a greatly improved understanding of the long-term history of global sea-level change and shoreline migration.  Such knowledge is critical along this heavily populated east coast of the United States.  Roughly 10% of humanity lives along continental margins within reach of encroaching shorelines, making this knowledge of the interaction of sea-level change and shoreline position highly relevant to coastline communities across the globe.  Our 3D survey was carried out on the R/V Marcus G. Langseth using a towed acoustic source designed to preserve high frequencies and resolve buried features with roughly 5 m vertical resolution.  To achieve this degree of resolution we had to measure the velocity of sound in the target sediments, and this was accomplished by towing a long single streamer containing 192 hydrophones and recording sub-seafloor acoustic reflections as far as 3 km behind the ship.  To achieve the intended lateral resolution of roughly 3 to 6 m we simultaneously towed twenty-four 50-m streamers each 12.5 apart.  This resulted in roughly 30 million sub-seafloor acoustic reflections along 1600 50-km survey lines, representing the largest high-resolution 3D acoustic survey yet acquired in the academic community.  Seven graduate students from 5 Universities sailed on the cruise, stood scientific watches, helped deploy and retrieve over-the-side gear, performed preliminary shipboard data processing, and by hands-on experience learned skills needed to lead a modern research cruise.

This will provide a foundation to build on and improve understanding factors that have shaped the sedimentary evolution of the New Jersey margin in particular, and that influence the sedimentary record at continental margins in general.
