<AbstractNarration>This project funds travel for graduate students and speakers to participate in PerCom 2012 to be held in Lugano, Switzerland in March 2012. PerCom is the flagship international conference in pervasive computing. Students will participate in an organized PhD Forum, both before and during the conference, demonstrate their work in a Poster Session, give presentations about their research, and be mentored by senior researchers. The funded speakers will participate in a featured panel where they will explore, with each other and with the audience, controversial issues realted to pervasive computing.</AbstractNarration>
