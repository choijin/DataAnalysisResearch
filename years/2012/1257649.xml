<AbstractNarration>This award to Florida State University is to develop a workable 'proof of concept' X-ray diffractometer to take advantage of the new 25T split-coil magnet at the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory (NHMFL).  X-ray diffraction and scattering techniques in high magnetic fields will be used to investigate spin-lattice coupling, magnetostriction, and orbital ordering effects in strongly correlated materials.  This 'proof of concept' system will address the effects of large fringe fields on detectors, X-ray sources, and mechanical components. Potential materials to be investigated will include, multiferroic, magnetoelectric, and, thermomagnetic materials, spin-cross-over systems, and geometrically frustrated magnetic systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 'proof of concept' X-ray diffractometer will be the first available at steady state magnetic fields above 13T.  It will provide a unique capability to probe the magnetic responses in materials and is expected to lead to new science.  The new instrument will pave the way for a next generation diffraction system with enhanced capabilities open to the scientific community through the NHMFL.</AbstractNarration>
