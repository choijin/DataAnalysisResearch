<AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit: The overall understanding of the larger-scale physics of the inner shelf has advanced notably in the past few years, but there has been little work on the shallow nearshore regions where stratified inner shelf waters interact with the shore. Limited observations to date, including work in Monterey Bay and Mamala Bay, suggest that transient mixing and stratification events, presumably associated with the shoaling and breaking of internal wave fields present offshore, dramatically alter the physical environment in this ecologically important part of the ocean.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this project, detailed observations of periodic turbulent bores and fronts will be conducted in 10 to 30 m water in southern Monterey Bay using a set of Acoustic Doppler Velocimeters (ADV) and fast Conductivity/Temperature sensors to describe the behavior of nearshore turbulent mixing and stratification events. The ADVs will be mounted on an 8m high tower and cabled to shore, to measure turbulence variables including Reynolds stresses, turbulence dissipation and buoyancy fluxes. This tower will be supplemented by an array of Acoustic Doppler Current Profilers and thermistor chains centered on it to provide a detailed spatial and temporal view of these flows, including diagnosing their dynamics. An Automated Underwater Vehicle will be used to map larger-scale variations in temperature and salinity. The project is designed to accomplish two related goals that could substantially advance current understanding of flows in the nearshore: (1) Show how these bore-like features interact with topography and other (e.g. tidal) flows, and (2) Examine the turbulence produced during this interaction in light of existing dynamical frameworks of boundary layer and stratified shear turbulence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The local dynamics of the bore/relaxation front pattern that has been often reported in the literature can be the dominant source of variability in an ecologically important class of physical environments. This is significant for several reasons: (1) The bores/fronts appears to be an important mechanism by which deeper offshore waters are supplied to nearshore environments in shelf regions of coastal upwelling systems. Because of the interaction between these bottom derived waters and surface process affected waters in nearshore ecosystems, this is important for understanding how climate change will affect these ecosystems since these waters are low in dissolved oxygen and have high acidity. (2) These bores/fronts are thought to be an important mechanism for the exchange of organisms between the nearshore and the outermost regions of the inner shelf. (3) Vertical turbulent mixing is critical to many ecological processes such as benthic grazing and primary production by phytoplankton.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project's investigators will be experimenting with how to best use coastal ocean observing systems and, through their participation in Stanford's Center for Ocean Solutions, how to connect their use with the data and information needs of policy makers as well as those of other marine ecologists and geochemists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From an educational standpoint, the proposed work will be labor intensive and thus will engage a number of Stanford graduate and undergraduate students. Besides the two students directly involved in the project, at least four other graduate students will likely be involved in the field work, including two women Ph.D. students working with the investigators. As part of this project, a graduate field methods class that will be built around the May 2013 experiment will be taught. Finally, the investigators will also develop a microdocumentary (see http://microdocs.org/) on the importance of internal bores to nutrient fluxes, and nearshore ecosystem production. In conjunction with this video, they will visit several local area high schools in largely underrepresented districts to make short (30 min) presentations on oceanography, ocean health, and ocean career opportunities during which the microdocumentary will be presented to the classroom.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual merit  A key feature of flows in the ocean is the way they are influenced by the presence of density stratification, i.e., by the presence of lighter (warmer and/or fresher) waters over denser (colder and/or saltier) waters. In particular, vertical mixing of heat, salt, nutrients, and non-swimming plankton can be strongly suppressed by the presence of stratification. Conversely, stratification also supports the presence of internal waves, waves that ride on the differing layers of density. In nearshore coastal regions these internal waves can shoal and break (like waves on beaches), producing additional turbulent mixing.  This project addressed the turbulence and mixing produced by breaking of these shoaling internal waves, with the goals of (a) quantifying the importance of this process to the nearshore physical environment of Monterey Bay and (b) using this environment as a laboratory for studying stratified turbulence so as to produce general descriptions of stratified turbulence that can be used in models of ocean circulation and climate.   We carried out two 1 month long field experiments in southern Monterey Bay, during which time we deployed instruments to measure mean currents and temperatures as well as deploying a set of turbulence instruments mounted on an 8m high tower (Figure 1) in 15m of water that was cabled to shore using the "Kelp Forest Array" (KFA), a nearshore observatory operated by Stanford University and MBARI .  Throughout these experiments, the field site experienced large amplitude, breaking, tidal period internal waves ("bores") whose behavior was strongly dependent on regional wind forcing through the variations in thermocline depth they create (Figure 2). Overall,  these bore events contribute to the majority of the variance in cross-shelf exchange and transport in the nearshore, and play a strong role in determining dissolved oxygen (DO) variability with individual bores creating shock-like drops in DO whereas extended upwelling periods with reduced bore activity produce longer duration low DO (hypoxic) events.  Our stratified turbulence measurements provide a nearly continuous data set of turbulent velocity and density fluctuations, and thus a unique look at the stratified turbulence field, showing that individual bores can drive substantial changes in local turbulence and mixing dynamics. Most importantly, our observations show that the efficiency by which mechanical energy mixes heat (a parameter known as the flux Richardson number) declines significantly when stratification is weak (or turbulence is strong) such that the common assumption of constant efficiency irrespective of turbulence/stratification strength leads to significant overestimates in computed rates of vertical mixing due to turbulence (Figure 3).   In summary, our results make two strong points: (1) We need to understand internal wave climatology to properly predict nearshsore flows; (2) A reassessment of global mixing by internal waves should be done using a variable dependent mixing efficiency.     Broader Impacts  More generally, our results show that from a  marine ecology perspective, understanding the dynamics of shoaling internal waves is central to predicting the occurrence of hypoxia  in nearshore benthic communities. Additionally the successful use of the cabled nearshore system for data acquisition during our two turbulence experiments provides strong endorsement for its use for studying nearshore ecosystem processes, with real time data streams enabling targeted sampling, e.g. during hypoxic events, that would enable us to better connect physical forcing and biological response in nearshore ecosytems such as kelp forests.   Finally, from an educational perspective, this project formed the basis of two PhD theses and involved 6 other PhD students (including 2 women, and 1 studying marine ecology whose own thesis work on hypoxia builds strongly on this study).
