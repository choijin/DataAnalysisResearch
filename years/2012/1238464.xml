<AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit:&lt;br/&gt;This award funds a workshop that focuses on the impact of rapidly evolving information and communications technology, i.e., cyber-infrastructures, on the activities of discovery, innovation, and learning. Cyber-infrastructure in discovery and learning is of significant current interest. Paradigm shifts that have impacted many industries appear poised to transform higher education and the academic research environment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goals of the workshop are to set an agenda for how to transform the what, the how, and who participates in discovery and learning; to personalize and broaden participation in discovery and learning; and to accelerate discovery and the transfer from discovery to innovative use. The specific workshop objectives are to: 1) explore and articulate key research questions, likely game-changers, and possible paradigm shifts, 2) frame an interdisciplinary research agenda for the next decade, and 3) identify possible research programs, experiments, and organizational structures that would best meet the needs of the nation in this rapidly changing environment. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:&lt;br/&gt;New paradigms are rapidly emerging for learning and education that challenge the use of cyber-infrastructure as a platform for enhancing knowledge communities and for expanding their scope and participation unconstrained by time and distance. Our world has entered a period of rapid and profound economic, social, and political transformation driven by knowledge and innovation. Much of this workshop focus is to set an agenda for understanding the rapidly changing needs of society for workforce learning and skills, new knowledge, research, innovation, and creativity in a world increasingly integrated and transformed by digital technology. The impact of demographic change, workplace needs (adaptive, ubiquitous, and lifelong learning opportunities), and learning structures (explicit, tacit, and intuitive knowledge) are considered as well as redesigns for learning systems at the K-12, higher education, workplace, and lifelong learning. And, the discussion and products of this workshop will likely be useful in the pursuit of new science.</AbstractNarration>

Although emerging technologies such as MOOCs and analytics have received great attention as possible game changers, the researchers, scholars, educators, and university leaders participating in these events caution that there was still a very great need for rigorous experimentation and measurement before more conventional approaches to teaching, research, and engagement with society were set aside.
