<AbstractNarration>1201603 &lt;br/&gt;Khwaja&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Description:  This project by the Dr. Asim Khwaja, Harvard Kennedy School, Harvard University is to catalyze collaboration with scientists in Pakistan in the area of Evaluation and Strengthening Private Schools for the Rural Poor in Pakistan.  The foreign collaborator is Ali Asjad Naqvi, Research Director at the Center for Economic Research in Pakistan (CERP). The emergence of low-cost, for-profit private schools serving the rural poor has transformed the education sector in Pakistan and low-income countries across the globe. Small rural private schools are among the fastest growing segments of the small-to-medium-sized enterprise (SME) sector in Pakistan. Recent research has demonstrated the power of these schools as they (i) serve the rural poor; (ii) employ, teach, and empower women; and (iii) outperform government schools in math, Urdu, English learning outcomes, in addition to (iv) producing higher levels of civic values among students. Despite the demonstrated strengths of private schools, constraints to continued growth of this sector are emerging.   The PI plans a series of activities that will lay the groundwork for a rigorous empirical evaluation of new models for providing financing and education support to private schools in emerging economies. The project builds on existing work by the PI supported by NSF (SES 0962504: ?Understanding Education Markets Experimental and Observational Evidence from Pakistan?) and expands into the specific area of low-cost private schools. Research results have revealed that, in spite of their relative low cost, private schools in Pakistan outperform government schools, but they face constraints to continued growth and quality improvements. Motivated by a dearth of evidence on how best to support this dynamic sector, The PI will conduct the preliminary work that is needed to design, implement, and evaluate models to support private education entrepreneurs through the provision of financial, educational and operational support. This entails engaging with key international stakeholders and utilizing additional data sources to design a set of interventions and associated project evaluation methodology to support the sector and identify implementation partners for the interventions. Dr. Naqvi will play a key role in partnership development, designing project activities and providing local input to inform the research evaluation. &lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: Cognizant of both the rapid rise of low-cost private schooling and the emerging constraints this sector faces, the PIs aim to fill a gap in the existing knowledge: how to interface, support, and enable the success of the private education sector. They plan to address a number questions still left unanswered by existing literature. What needs of private schools are the greatest, or which constraints are binding? What are the returns to investments in the low-cost private education sector, in terms of profitability and social outcomes? What financial mechanism (grants, loans, or equity investments) will generate the maximum return on investment and improvement in social outcomes? And finally, what is the optimal combination of financial and access to educational support to further strengthen this dynamic sector? &lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: The empirical evidence generated by this study has the potential to make unique contributions to academia, and to also generate significant reaction among policymakers and practitioners in the NGO and private sectors. Should the model prove sustainable and generate the envisioned results, the limits for potential impact extend well beyond the evaluation areas. There is a potential for these models to be replicated, sustained, and scaled to similar contexts where un- and under-served school age children can be supported by unleashing the power of markets and these free enterprises to dramatically improve education outcomes across the country and ultimately across similar countries globally.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Description of Project  The schooling environment in developing countries is increasingly a rich educational marketplace where multiple schools and providers &mdash; both public and private &mdash; offer a varied menu of prices and quality. This trend is characterized by the rapid rise of private schools around the world, not just for the elite but also for the general population (Tooley, 2001, 2008; Andrabi et al., 2008). These private schools operate as for-profit, small-to-medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), which respond to market signals and achieve financial sustainability through their capacity to deliver quality fee-based services to their client base (i.e. parents).  Our previous research has revealed that, even given their relative low cost, private schools in Pakistan outperform government schools in terms of quality, learning levels, gender empowerment, and imparting of civic values. Still, they face constraints to continued growth and quality improvements. In addition, there is a gap in our knowledge of how to interface, support, and enable the success of the private education sector in serving the rural poor, given the schoolsÆ considerable needs.  The activities under this grants were designed to explore these constraints facing the rural private education sector and address them by developing potential interventions in collaboration with various stakeholders.   Outcomes  In the past year, we have made remarkable progress towards fulfilling the aims of this award.  First, through various discussions with stakeholders, we have built consensus around education reform in Pakistan particularly around the need to support the private sector.  We have also identified and successfully partnered with in-country stakeholders to collaborate with on the design and implementation of interventions.  Aman Foundation, a local foundation in Pakistan the funds various social service projects, has agreed to provide 250,000 USD in funding towards intervention and personnel costs. Furthermore, after discussions with many microfinance institutions, we have decided to partner with Tameer Microfinance Bank Ltd (TMFB) for the design and delivery of financial products. TMFB has extensive reach on the ground with 104 business locations in both Sindh and Punjab (as of December 2011).

We will experiment with product features (such as collateral requirements, interest rates, loan tenure and size) and processes (such as monitoring requirements) to design products that are amenable to the financial institution as well as responds to the needs of rural private schools.
