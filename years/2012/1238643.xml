<AbstractNarration>The Center for Technology and School Change (CTSC) at Teachers College, Columbia University and the Center for Environmental Research and Conservation (CERC) at Columbia University's Earth Institute are working in partnership with three STEM focused New York City schools (K-8) to develop a systemic, transformative approach for interdisciplinary STEM teaching and learning. The planned model prepares teachers to design innovative, authentic STEM projects, and supports administrators in leading such efforts.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CTSC has identified key elements of a robust design process to help teachers move from business- as-usual pedagogy to dramatically new practices in content, pedagogy, and technology use. The program also identifies an interdisciplinary STEM perspective, supported with experts from CERC who provide STEM fieldwork expertise as part of the overall design. Moreover, the project creates research and educational collaborations with diverse, community-based groups (e.g., urban nature centers). The project uses a mobile learning platform to leverage social networking among schools, teachers, students, STEM experts, parents and the community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the grant is to establish a culture of inquiry with all partners in order to develop interdiciplinary, authentic STEM learning environments. Design-based research provides iterative cycles of implementation to explore and refine the approach as a transformative model for STEM programs. The model supports a sustainable approach by building the capacity of schools to focus on design issues related to content, pedagogy, and leadership.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ STEM teacher development "continues to occupy a pivotal position in the discursive and pragmatic formulation of national education reform policy" (Fore, Feldhaus, Sorge, Agarwal, Varahramyan, 2015, p. 101). Preparing and retaining effective STEM teachers remains a critical need, particularly in light of the fact that teacher guidance is crucial to students? entry into STEM majors and careers. Teachers in high-need, urban populations are especially underprepared to teach STEM subjects (Coble, Smith, Berry, Collins, &amp; Gillespie, 2009; Ingersoll &amp; Perda, 2006; Johnson, Berg, &amp; Donaldson, 2005. With the U.S. struggling to stay competitive in STEM fields globally and to meet the diverse needs of students in areas of STEM, preparing all U.S. teachers to take full advantage of their positions as torchbearers for STEM careers is paramount.  It is this need that motivated the Center for Technology and School Change (CTSC), a research and development center at Teachers College, Columbia University, to propose and implement an NSF planning grant, Systemic Transformation of Inquiry Learning Environments (STILE) for STEM (Award No. DRL-1238643), during which project partners developed, investigated and refined a transformative approach for developing STEM teachers.  Throughout the project term, design-based implementation research (DBIR) helped to refine a particular STEM approach--based on CTSC?s more general professional development model, Innovating Instruction--for engaging teachers and administrators in project-based design work and the creation of authentic learning environments. Findings from the initial grant indicate that the STILE approach supports and sustains an understanding of transdisciplinary STEM by teachers and administrators, resulting in new instructional practices and increased collaboration for STEM teaching and learning, and structural changes in the school to support ongoing STEM learning.     Addressing Critical STEM Educational Needs  There is general agreement in the educational field that more emphasis is needed on Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM), but what this new entity--STEM--really means and how it should be implemented is far from clear (National Research Council, 2011). STILE uses a transdisciplinary perspective (Vasquez, 2014), and proposes that educators use STEM to think from a new perspective about teaching and learning. The transdisciplinary perspective embraces STEM as a "meta-discipline," with a focus on conceptual understandings across the disciplines (Vasquez, 2014).    This more sophisticated understanding of STEM highlights the need for a new process to move teachers through STEM curricular development. Addressing teachers? STEM professional development needs requires a thoughtful, multi-faceted, research-based professional development approach to address teachers? beliefs, their classroom approaches, and their use of materials (Fullan, 2007) to achieve a transformative and sustainable program for STEM teachers and administrators.  The STILE approach supports student inquiry in the context of authentic community-based concerns, transforming teachers' thinking about STEM, and resulting in increasingly sophisticated STEM projects that catapult transdisciplinary STEM as a critical driver of content design.     Developing STILE as an Approach to STEM Teacher Development  Research shows an emerging consensus regarding the characteristics of impactful teacher professional development (Desimone, 2009), and yet teacher learning remains "unpredictable" as individuals understandably react differently to the same intervention (Opfer &amp; Pedder, 2011). While the bulk of research tends to fall short of explicating "under what conditions" teachers learn (Opfer &amp; Pedder, 2011, p.378), emerging frameworks for implementing teacher learning systems are becoming increasingly contextual and reform-oriented(Penuel, Fishman, Yamaguchi &amp; Gallagher, 2007).    STILE took the initial steps in understanding what works in STEM teacher development, but further research is needed regarding what specific components had the most impact on teachers and administrators and in what context. STILE showed promise in supporting schools and teachers to make the instructional shifts necessary for addressing transdisciplinary STEM.  Findings from the STILE study in two New York City public schools indicated the following (CTSC, 2015):  The schools made significant shifts in the      sophistication and rigor of STEM teaching and learning, and the      administrators made structural changes in their schools to insure ongoing      support. Transdisciplinary approaches were modeled for the teachers in      both schools as teachers were taught to design transdisciplinary STEM      projects. .   The STILE Facilitator played a primary role in      developing each school?s capacity for--and investment in--building      authentic STEM learning environments. The STILE Facilitators      modeled an inquiry stance perspective (Cochran-Smith &amp; Lytle,      2009), and over time, teachers began exhibiting      greater awareness of their learning process (identifying what they know      and what they do not know); and making connections between disciplines to      design authentic learning opportunities.   The STILE model built teachers?      capacities as 'leaders,' and enabled them to scale-up their STEM work both      within and beyond their institutions.  The STILE principals played an essential role in      initiating and sustaining systemic and structural changes for STEM      teaching and learning.   These findings indicate promise for the STILE approach. Moving forward, the research team proposes implementing STILE with a broader teacher audience, in an effort to examine the across multiple teacher orientations and contexts.
