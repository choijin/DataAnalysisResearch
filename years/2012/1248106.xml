<AbstractNarration>PI:  Michael Freeling (University of California - Berkeley)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This two year project leverages previous work and uses computational tools, along with published sequence and data on levels of mRNA, to hypothesize specific function for noncoding sequences in higher plants.  The project takes advantage of the recent release of two important paleopolyploid genomes, maize and Brassica rapa (Chinese cabbage).   Having diverged approximately 12 million years ago, each of these ancient polyploids has close relative genomes that can serve as outgroups - sorghum and the other grasses for maize and Arabidopsis, and several recently sequenced crucifers for the cabbages. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are four objectives with the goal of developing a better understanding of the function of enhancers and cis-acting modules, those sequences that regulate gene expression in plants:  1) to develop a new application for CoGe that brings motifs and transcription factor binding sites into view when comparing the sequences of chromosomal segments.  CoGe is a popular, public toolbox for visualizing and comparing sequences; 2) to discover genes with new regulatory capabilities by finding rare cases of new sequence corresponding to new patterns of expression.  Finding genes that switch their patterns of genome dominance should relate to this aim; 3) to find the means by which plant regulatory DNA evolves into non-detectability without losing its function, a process known as "binding site turnover" in mammals; and, 4) to elucidate enhancer evaluation in plants by using the natural process of fractionation mutagenesis to generate specific sequences with specific functions using computational data only.  Hypotheses based on the predicted enhancers will be tested using transient and stable expression of engineered reporter genes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader aims of the project include a summer internship program for underserved, local high school students, and continued development of the popular CoGe website (http://genomevolution.org/CoGe/) containing applications that help find meaning when genes and genomes are compared.  This project will host one or two students each summer.  Additionally, this project involves improvements to the CoGe suite of free, on-the fly applications now powered by iPlant (http://www.iplantcollaborative.org/) that will provide broad access to the broader scientific community.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Outcomes     This project was the final extension of a two-year renewal of a five-year grant studying, under intellectual merit,  the gene regulatory properties of that part of  plant genomes that does not code for proteins.  This space is called "noncoding space".  Noncoding space includes 1) dead transposable elements&mdash;often called "junk DNA"-- , 2) DNA sequences that function, as inferred only from their high level of sequence conservation over millions of years providing expectations for divergence [conserved noncoding sequences (CNSs)]  and 3)  known cis-acting binding sites for regulatory molecules.  However, the exact functions of noncoding chromosomal DNA or chromosomal space are largely not known.  We had two publications illuminating some of the functions of noncoding DNA during this year.   1)  In the journal Molec. Plant, we provide a fresh hypothetical function for "junk DNA", and how junk functioning as ballast  and ballast only explains the "C-value paradox", a fundamental unanswered (until now) question as to why closely related genomes-- with the same number of genes and the level of morphological/physiological "complexity"-- often have manifold different amounts of noncoding DNA.  2.  We argue that "junk " DNA functions by down-regulating nearby genes and, when located near the centromere, to slow the movement of chromosomes to the poles during cell division.    In the journal Curr. Opinion Pl. Biol., we released the definitive list of arabidopsis CNSs. ( Arabidopsis is the most experimentally powerful model plant system, and knowledge of this model informs all plant and agricultural research. ) We obtained this list by merging the  CNS pipeline outputs from three laboratories representing three countries.   This merged list of 171,723 CNSs,  called "PHV",  is proved to be superior to any one or two of the three CNS lists alone.   CNS DNA sequence markers are important for all who want to locate by mapping the location of traits or features  in the noncoding regions of chromosomes.   --    In addition, we have continued to augment, enhance  and promote the experimental power of CoGe, an on-line comparative genomics toolbox developed and managed by my ex-student Dr. Eric Lyons at U. Arizona and iPlant. The content of the Comparative Genomics website (CoGe) is  a world-wide-popular research and educational toolbox full of useful applications, workflows, pipelines and space t set-up individual experiments.   The programmers coding CoGe were funded by NSF during the early years of this project.  CoGe is free to all, and makes ever-increasing broader impacts on data infrastructure, career development, educational (CoGePedia and Tutorials) and,  especially,  comparative whole-genome research. Using my own lab as an example, the data providing the results substantiating the 66 publications mentioned in the next paragraph derived from research conducted  using CoGe applications online.        Over the past 8 years, NSF has supported the mother project of this final (8th) year, serving as the far-and-away largest grant financing Freeling Lab research/publications from 2007 through October, 2015.  There are currently  66 such publications in Google Scholar Citations for Freeling as PI.  The content of his unbiased record of impact comprises the intellectual contribution of this overall project;  this last-year Outcomes report is just for the wrapping-up.
