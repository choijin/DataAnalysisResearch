<AbstractNarration>The records of precipitation and stream water amount and chemistry collected at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest in the White Mountains of New Hampshire are now the longest continuous biogeochemical records of this type in the world. As such, they represent a treasure trove of information relevant to current environmental problems, such as acid rain, nitrogen deposition, forest growth, and rising levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide.  The first five years of this decadal project focused primarily on the effect of disturbance and environmental change, including the continued decline in acid rain and the changing climate within the Hubbard Brook Valley.  A number of surprises have emerged, including the disappearance of an early climate change effect on stream water temperature, decreased ice cover duration on Mirror Lake, and the impacts of acid rain on soil chemical changes that are now affecting forest growth.  A major surprise seen from a synthesis and extrapolation of long-term trends in precipitation and stream water chemistry was that a relentless dilution of surface waters is occurring throughout the Hubbard Brook Valley and that surface waters are likely to approximate demineralized (extremely dilute) water in the near future.  This suggests that future baseline conditions may be more dilute than thought for the time before the industrial revolution, apparently because of the depletion of soil nutrients by acid rain and the impacts of federal air pollution regulations on precipitation chemistry.  This has important implications for the structure, function and management of northern hardwood forests and their associated aquatic ecosystems in the near future.  It is expected that important answers to many of the questions pursued during the past five years will be obtained or made clearer during the final five years of this long-term project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For researchers and decision makers grappling with solutions to major environmental issues, such carefully documented and synthesized, long-term data are essential for providing an accurate and quantitative perspective on chemical changes in our atmosphere and in our forest and aquatic ecosystems, as well as to advance the theoretical underpinnings of ecology.  In addition, numerous students are engaged in this research and the data are made freely available for other uses.</AbstractNarration>

They had a simple idea. By comparing watershed inputs in precipitation to watershed outputs from streams, they could quantify the response of entire ecosystems to atmospheric pollution or forestry practices. The record that they began in 1963 has been added to every single week up to the present day. Insights gained from studying this long-term chemical record led to the discovery of acid rain in North America, documented the effectiveness of cap and trade programs for reducing coal-fired power plant emissions, and provided a scientific basis for the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (</span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: bold; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Figure 2A</span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">).

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[In 1963, four scientists (Gene E. Likens, F. Herbert Bormann, Robert S. Pierce, and Noye M. Johnson) began collecting and analyzing streamwater and precipitation (rain and snow) at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest in the White Mountains of New Hampshire (Figure 1). They had a simple idea. By comparing watershed inputs in precipitation to watershed outputs from streams, they could quantify the response of entire ecosystems to atmospheric pollution or forestry practices. The record that they began in 1963 has been added to every single week up to the present day. Insights gained from studying this long-term chemical record led to the discovery of acid rain in North America, documented the effectiveness of cap and trade programs for reducing coal-fired power plant emissions, and provided a scientific basis for the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (Figure 2A). The record documents a long-term decline in stream solute concentrations  as a result of acid deposition, with the ionic strength of streamwater approaching deionized water (Figure 2C). In addition, the record includes investigation of the outputs from Mirror Lake and a long-term record of ice on and ice off (Figure 3).  The ice record demonstrates that in the past 55 years that the duration of ice cover on the lake has steadily declined, while at the same time the variability in ice cover from year to year has markedly increased.     This record was instrumental in the development of the ?watershed approach? in Ecosystem Science and the use of watershed solute flux as an indicator of terrestrial nutrient limitation, and coupled terrestrial-aquatic dynamics.  This 56-year long-term streamwater and precipitation record, hereafter referred to as HB-WatER, has been key to: evaluating the long-term biogeochemical consequences of deforestation (Figure 1B)  and acid remediation experiments (Figure 1C) at Hubbard Brook and has been used to measure how water chemistry and streamflow respond to climate change and forest disturbance. The suite of analyses that is performed on each sample has expanded over time, and for the past decade, this grant supported measurement of pH, conductivity, and temperature and the concentrations of dissolved inorganic and organic carbon, major anions, major cations, nutrients, and trace elements in precipitation and streamwater.     The HBEF is a valuable site for monitoring atmospheric pollutants in the northeastern U.S. because of the long record, location ?downwind? of major sources, natural sensitivity and lack of local, major pollution sources. Data collected for this project demonstrate that atmospheric deposition, streamwater concentrations, and the output of SO42- at HBEF are significantly correlated with emissions of SO2 from the source area for HBEF.  In the last decade of research, as sulfur emissions have declined, the relationship between deposition and streamwater export of SO42- continues to be robust and extends the range into the low end of deposition and streamwater export. Atmospheric N deposition continues to decline as well. As a result of the US Clean Air Act precipitation acidity declined nationally. At the HBEF precipitation pH has increased by nearly 0.8 units (Figure 2A).     Our record of ice cover at Mirror Lake began in 1968 and the duration of ice cover on Mirror Lake declined at a significant rate of about &#8210;0.44 days yr-1. This record complements other long-term records of climate change in the Hubbard Brook Valley and White Mountains Region. This trend results from earlier ice OUT rather than later ice IN dates (Figure 3) . Since about 1995 the duration of ice cover has become much more variable with 2010-2019 showing the highest interannual variability recorded.    Dozens of publications, including 4 books, that rely on these data have been published over the last decade. More than 100 talks on these data were given during this period. Three postdoctoral associates, two graduate students; 5 NSF-supported REU students; and a team of undergraduate researchers through Duke?s Data+ program have been involved with synthesis and publication of these long-term data.
