<AbstractNarration>This project addresses the role of nitric oxide in generating flexibility in neuronal communication in the central nervous system.  Nitric oxide is a gaseous signaling molecule that is generated by the enzyme nitric oxide synthase in response to neuronal activity.  Communication between neurons occurs at synapses and the activity of neurons and neuronal circuits are dependent upon the balance of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic interactions.  Inhibition is dependent upon the concentration of chloride in the neuronal cytoplasm and it has been demonstrated that nitric oxide increases chloride concentration in the cytoplasm.  Increasing cytosolic chloride has the effect of either reducing inhibition or converting it into excitation.  Hence, nitric oxide can switch inhibition to excitation and alter the activity of neuronal circuits. This project will determine the sources of internal chloride that can be released by nitric oxide and the mechanisms involved in the release. The goals of the project will be achieved using a combination of electrophysiology and molecular biology. This work is fundamental to our understanding of nervous system function because control of cytosolic chloride by nitric oxide is a previously undiscovered mechanism that dramatically increases the flexibility of normally inhibitory synapses. Furthermore, the project explores the nitric oxide release of internal chloride in a retinal neuron but this chloride release has also been demonstrated in neurons from elsewhere in the brain.  As such, these results will have important ramifications for regulation of synaptic function in multiple regions of the central nervous system.  The broader impacts include participation by graduate students and undergraduates in the PI's laboratory.  The PI will  participate in the College of Science Louisiana Biomedical Research Network Summer Research Program, and the LSU Howard Hughes Medical Institute Undergraduate Summer Research Program.  In these programs, the PI will recruit underrepresented minorities and women. In addition, the PI is a mentor at the Louisiana Math and Science Teacher Institute, which provides additional science education for local public school teachers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In the nervous system, neurons convey information by interacting with other neurons at synapses.  The effect of synaptic activity depends on the balance of excitatory synaptic activity and inhibitory synaptic activity.  GABA and glycine are usually considered to be inhibitory neurotransmitters and this is because they activate receptors that function as Cl- channels.  The idea is that when GABA (for example) binds its receptor, the Cl- conducting channel opens and the net movement of Cl- is into the cell which keeps the membrane voltage of the cell negative so that it cannot fire an action potential and is thus "inhibited".  The movement of Cl- across the cell's membrane through Cl- channels is governed by the electrochemical gradient for Cl- between the cytoplasm and the outside of the cell.  Typically, the gradient for Cl- is inward but if cytoplasmic Cl- is elevated, Cl- can leave and this can cause excitation rather than inhibition at the synapse.  Previous experiments testing the role of the gaseous signaling molecule nitric oxide (NO) in regulating synaptic function revealed that NO can transiently convert GABA-mediated inhibition to excitation. NO achieves this by causing release of Cl- from an internal sub-cellular compartment into the cytoplasm. Under this award, we have made three major discoveries.  First we have demonstrated that the sub-cellular compartments from which Cl- is released are acidic compartments.  Cells have numerous compartments that are acidified for their normal cellular function and these include endosomes, lysosomes and synaptic vesicles.  We have also discovered that the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), a Cl- channel, is required for the exit of Cl- from internal acidic compartments. The CFTR has been well studied in epithelial cells where its dis-function underlies the major symptoms of cystic fibrosis.  With our recent results, we now demonstrate a new role for CFTR in neurons. Finally, we have discovered that synaptic vesicles can contribute Cl- to the cytosol and thus affect synaptic transmission in a highly localized fashion.  In the field of neuroscience, our research is revealing a novel mechanism by which synaptic transmission can be regulated.
