<AbstractNarration>This project will examine community response to abrupt environmental change through analysis of animal remains as they reflect subsistence practices and environmental conditions, from Tse-whit-zen, a previously excavated Lower Elwha Klallam village on the northwest coast of Washington, with occupation beginning around 2700 years ago and intensifying between about 1800-100 years ago.  This time period spans several high-magnitude earthquakes, the Little Ice Age and Medieval Climatic Anomaly, and a gradual increase in sheltered intertidal habitat.  The research team will explore how these events affected animal resources and different people within households and larger communities over time, using predictions drawn from foraging theory. The extraordinary integrity of the deposits, the detailed geoarchaeological field recording of deposits, the large and rigorously collected faunal samples from 7 time periods, and volumetrically comparable samples of birds, fish, shellfish, and mammals at Tse-whit-zen offer a high-resolution record of past human use of animal resources that is unparalleled in the North Pacific.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research project will provide models, methods and results of direct relevance to scholars working on Arctic systems and processes, given the parallels and direct linkages between the Northwest Coast and areas to the north. In both regions, boat-mobile foragers with maritime subsistence focused on fish, shellfish, and marine mammals, have adapted to complex, dynamic coastlines affected by periodic environmental, geomorphic and climatic changes.  Global circulation patterns link the North Pacific and Arctic Oceans and migratory species bridge the two areas. Our project also provides an ideal comparative case study for the Global Human Ecodynamics Alliance, an NSF funded initiative developed to link Arctic Polar Ecodynamics to the broader global context.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will be valuable to the Lower Elwha Klallam Tribe who were integrally involved in the excavation of the Tse-whit-zen site, are concerned about the future of the site and the collection. The researchers will share faunal data, publications and professional insights with tribal educators, wildlife managers, and cultural specialists involved in planning a museum. They will also be collaborating with local and state governmental agencies that will develop educational materials from our results, to meet a growing need to prepare the public for future earthquake-related events. The researchers anticipate that their work documenting fine-scale animal response to earthquakes, climate change, local shoreline change, and human exploitation strategies for several ?species of concern? (e.g. salmonids, ground fish, sea mammals) will assist current wildlife management efforts.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In 2004, Ciwicen (pronounced ch-WHEET-son), a traditional village of the Lower Elwha Klallam Tribe (LEKT) in northwest Washington State, U.S.A. (Figure 1), was excavated as part of a Washington Department of Transportation project.  Extensive excavation documented multiple plankhouses spanning the last 2,700 years and resulted in recovery of one of the largest collections of animal remains on the North Pacific Coast.  Bones and teeth of mammals, fish, birds, and shells from invertebrates such as clams, mussels, and urchins are the residue from everyday meals, ritual feasts, and tool making.  Knowing the types of animals people relied on as part of their lives for thousands of years, provides insights into the human story as well as past environments.         Our NSF funded analysis of a sample of the Ciwicen animal remains and their geological context is an important case study in Human Ecodynamics, which uses archaeological and other knowledge (from geology, history, animal biology and ecology) to study the ways animals, and in turn people, are affected by environmental change over time.  The inhabitants relied on over 100 species of shellfish, fish, birds, and mammals over millennia spanning large-magnitude earthquakes, tsunamis, periods of climate change, and changes in nearshore habitat.     Close analysis of geo-cultural laying of deposits joined with over 100 radiocarbon dates (half funded from NSF) allowed for detailed reconstruction of human occupational history.  To relate animal remains to time periods and environmental changes, seven chronostratigraphic zones spanning 2150 years were defined.  Radiocarbon dates from the site helped determine how the beach landform and lagoon in the shelter of Ediz Hook grew over time (Figure 2).  Evidence shows that people expanded their activities as the beach area grew, and house construction followed beach ridge stabilization (Figure 3).  Stratigraphic markers of tsunami such as sands, backwash, and erosion were noted that correlate temporally with five earthquake events/tsunami in the Cascade Subduction Zone region.   We were interested in the response of animals and people to tsunami overtopping Ediz Hook and the village multiple times.  Shellfish were most affected, followed by fish, while impacts on mammals and birds were minimal.  Despite multiple inundations and one dramatic case of structural collapse (Figure 4 shows fallen planks correlating to a regionally recognized tsunami), village occupants were persistent at this location; using the same house platforms for 100s of years, rebuilding as necessary.           Resilience of the ancestors of the LEKT was bolstered by strong social connection, both within and between individual (autonomous) households.  After one tsunami, two households show greater similarity in shellfish gathering than before, suggesting increased cooperation and resource sharing.  At the same time, fishing practices diverged more after the event, suggesting economic specialization in fishing was a viable strategy.  Occupants of one house used greater amounts of sablefish (a.k.a. black cod, or Anoplopoma fimbria), a known prestige item. Rates of fragmentation and burning of bones also differed between the households indicating that one household more consistently used bone as additive to wood fuel or processed bones for grease, useful for a variety of practical or ritual purposes.      Our methods, models employed, and results are relevant to researchers working in the North Pacific and beyond.  Reconstructing body size of sablefish and Pacific cod (Gadus macrocephalus) from vertebrae showed that Ciwicen residents targeted juvenile sablefish, which do not occur in the site vicinity today.  Further Pacific cod are now about 50 mm smaller (on average) than those from Ciwicen, likely due to intensive fishing.  Our study of mammal bone fragmentation is unique for the Pacific Northwest; results show that people intensively used bone for fuel, tool making and grease, which supported ritual activities.  Detailed investigation of sediment layers, maps of activity areas, and the extensive catalog of radiocarbon dates, have been integrated into a Geographical Information System (GIS) database, providing powerful spatial analysis capabilities and laying the groundwork for future analyses from the vast Ciwicen artifact collection.     Broader impacts of our project include more detailed knowledge about tsunami inundation within Port Angeles Harbor, which will help support community hazard preparedness.  More generally, understanding the economic consequences of tsunami has relevance for any society living along coastal margins of the Pacific Rim and other seismically active regions.  Our long-term animal record will be useful to the LEKT and City of Port Angeles who seek to restore the severely degraded Port Angeles Harbor.  Project team members visited with tribal members at the LEKT Reservation multiple times and will continue to share all information to support tribal education and wildlife management efforts.  Tribal leaders have joined us at two professional conferences to share their perspectives about Ciwicen to a wider community.  We have also presented our findings at public talks.  Dozens of undergraduate and graduate students contributed to lab analysis, resulting in five master's theses; two of these students are pursuing their PhDs.
