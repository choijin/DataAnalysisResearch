<AbstractNarration>The requested funding will be used to continue providing guidance on major ocean-related science, engineering, and policy issues to the federal ocean agencies, including the National Science Foundation. The Ocean Studies Board (OSB) is the focal point within the NRC for ocean-related science, engineering, and policy issues. The board explores the science, policies, and infrastructure needed to understand, manage, protect, and restore coastal and marine environments and resources. The board exercises leadership within the ocean community by helping identify and communicate the needs of the field, responds to specific requests from government agencies and Congress, and oversees a variety a study projects related to ocean science and engineering and their impacts on policy. The operations of OSB are funded by a number of federal agencies, including the ONR, NOAA, USGS, and NASA. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The OSB strives to increase public awareness of ocean issues, to support ocean science education, and to enhance the dissemination and impact of OSB reports. The OSB also supports the recruitment of minorities into the earth sciences through participation in mentoring and fellowship programs. To further outreach and dissemination, the OSB prepares a 2-4 page nontechnical overview of each new report that is broadly distributed in print and electronically. In addition, the booklets that comprise the Ocean Science Series are intended to help readers interpret information about the state of our oceans and to better understand the role of ocean science.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine enlists the nationÆs foremost scientists, engineers, health professionals, and other experts to address the scientific and technical aspects of societyÆs most pressing problems. The results of studies are documented in peer-reviewed, published NRC reports. NRC reports are viewed as being valuable and credible because of their reputation for providing advice with high standards of scientific and technical quality and independence.  Within the Academies, the Ocean Studies Board (OSB) serves as the oversight body for studies that explore the science, policies, and infrastructure needed to understand, manage, and conserve coastal and marine environments and resources. In addition to exercising leadership within the ocean community, the Board undertakes studies at the request of federal agencies, Congress, or other sponsors, or upon its own initiative.  OSB meetings serve as an opportunity for dialog among scientists in academia, government, and the private sector to explore emerging ocean issues.

Sea Change addresses the strategic investments necessary at NSF to ensure a robust ocean scientific enterprise over the next decade.

Climate Intervention: Carbon Dioxide Removal and Reliable Sequestration (DOE, NASA, NOAA, NAS, and the intelligence community, 2015) (with the Board on Atmospheric Sciences and Climate)   Description: The report introduces possible carbon dioxide removal approaches and then discusses them in depth. It examines the pros and cons of these options and estimates possible rates of removal and total amounts that might be removed via these methods to inform debate and decision making to address the increased atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide.  Enhancing the Value and Sustainability of Field Stations and Marine Laboratories in the 21st Century (NSF, 2014) (with the Board on Life Sciences)   Description: This report summarizes field stations' value to science, education, and outreach and evaluates their contributions to research, innovation, and education. The intellectual and natural capital of today's field stations present a solid platform, but many need enhancements of infrastructure and dynamic leadership if they are to meet the challenges of the complex environmental problems facing our world.   Responding to Oil Spills in the U.S. Arctic Marine Environment (U.S. ARC; API; USCG; BOEM; BSEE; Mammal Commission; NOAA; OSRI; and NAS, 2014)(with the Polar Research Board and Transportation Research Board)  Description: This report reviews the current state of the science regarding oil spill response and environmental assessment in the Arctic region north of the Bering Strait, with emphasis on the potential impacts in U.S. waters. It concludes that the full range of proven oil spill response technologies is needed in order to minimize the impacts on people and sensitive ecosystems. This report identifies key oil spill research priorities, critical data and monitoring needs, mitigation strategies, and important operational and logistical issues.
