<AbstractNarration>This award will enable collaborative work by Duke University and the University of Minnesota Duluth's neutrino research groups on the Helium and Lead Observatory (HALO). This is a new experiment designed to detect neutrinos originating in a core-collapse supernova within our own galaxy. The deaths of massive stars which cause these cataclysmic events occur every few decades somewhere in the MilkyWay and emit 99% of their energy in the form of a short burst of neutrinos. Existing detectors are primarily sensitive to electron antineutrinos. Use of lead for its target nuclei allows HALO to be sensitive to electron neutrinos, as well as to all flavor components of the burst flux via neutral current interactions. The effort for this funding cycle will center on upgrading HALO with redundant, fast-failover data acquisition systems. This award will provide modest hardware and personnel contributions to this effort.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of this award include the excellent experimental training for students and postdoctoral researchers. They have been very successful in involving students and postdocs in the past. This project offers a range of experiences, from simulation through detector construction, with operations and data analysis to commence soon. HALO will also be a contributor to SNEWS (SuperNova Early Warning System), which has an intrinsic outreach component.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Helium and Lead Observatory (HALO) at SNOLAB is a dedicated long-term, low-maintenance, and high-live-time detector sensitive to the burst of neutrinos from a stellar collapse in the Milky Way.  Neutrinos from a supernova burst are detected via neutrons emitted from lead, in He-3-based detectors left over from the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory at SNOLAB.  A few dozen neutrino interactions are expected for a center-of-Galaxy core-collapse supernova.  The data from HALO will be complementary to that from other supernova neutrino detectors, and it will contribute to an alert to the astronomical community through the Supernova Early Warning System (SNEWS).   As part of the activities of this award, redundant high voltage and data acquisition systems were installed to improve robustness of the experiment.  HALO was fully commissioned and connected to the SNEWS in 2015, and has been running smoothly since that time.  Award activities included also improvements to the detector simulation software.  HALO physics sensitivity studies were completed, including development of Bayesian unfolding techniques which will enable extraction of supernova model information from a supernova-neutrino-induced neutron observation by HALO.   Several undergraduate students and a postdoctoral researcher gained experience in experimental hardware and in software work as part of the broader impacts of this award.
