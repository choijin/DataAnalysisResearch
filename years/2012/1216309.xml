<AbstractNarration>The charismatic predatory insect group of praying mantises (order Mantodea) includes over 2,400 described species that exhibit an incredibly rich diversity of morphology and life history strategies.  Despite the long tradition of ecological, behavioral, and physiological research focused on the group, mantises have received limited taxonomic attention and the current classification scheme does not reflect genetically based, evolutionary relationships.  This project will unify traditional and modern morphological and genetically based systematic methods to reconstruct the evolutionary relationships for all praying mantises, which will guide the construction of a natural classification that reflects true evolutionary groups.  This research will also produce two species-level taxonomic monographs (representing about 21% of the praying mantis diversity) while building new museum collections, describing numerous new species, producing online, interactive identification keys for mantis genera, and producing a publicly accessible database of taxonomic information and scientific literature references.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will represent a significant first step in modernizing the systematics of these insects that are often used to control such pests as aphids. The project will also provide a model for future revisions of other insect groups.  This research will impact the broader community by: 1) producing high-quality images of mantises and their morphology, organized in an evolutionary framework that will facilitate community identifications through online, interactive taxonomic keys; 2) opening annually scheduled workshops to include university students, high school teachers, and the public, which will provide information and training in praying mantis taxonomy, morphology, and biology; 3) providing new scientific training at the post-doctoral, graduate, and undergraduate student levels; and 4) immediately complementing current comparative research in mantis sexual ecology, prey recognition physiology, and auditory evolution by providing a stable and predictive classification.</AbstractNarration>

These unnatural groups were created based on external features related to camouflage. With the appearance of praying mantises approximately 200 million years ago, their distribution across the globe was heavily influenced by the movement of the continental plates. After major lineages were isolated within separate continents, they began to adapt as flowering plants became more abundant and diverse. These adaptations drove specializations in both behavior and camouflage, which led to unrelated praying mantis groups evolving similar life strategies in response to similar habitats. Addressing the disparity between true evolutionary relationship and the inaccurate classification system was paramount to understanding their patterns of adaptation and diversification. This project was the first to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of praying mantis morphology and genetics to build robust estimates of evolutionary relationship. This effort resulted in a new classification systems for nearly 30 percent of praying mantis diversity. These new systems present accurate tools for identification, robust descriptions and illustrations to stabilize the taxonomy, and images that represent exemplar forms of genera and species. </span><span>This project has served as a catalyst to advance modernization across the systematics community working with praying mantises.</span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>Building accurate measures of relationship has allowed development of numerous projects related to the evolution of behaviors, morphology, and physiology within the praying mantises. Results from our systematics work was leveraged to address questions related to camouflage evolution in horned mantises and orchid mantises as well as the timing and diversification of ecological strategy within the Neotropical praying mantises. These studies challenged conventional evolutionary thought and led to the realization that praying mantises are an ideal model to study morphological diversification and camouflage evolution. Orchid mantis females were found to simulate flowers to attract and feed on pollinating insects. In addition, females were much larger than their male counterparts, but the size increase appears to be caused by predatory selective pressure rather than an increase in female fecundity, which is the typical explanation for arthropod sexual size dimorphism. The finding was unique for arthropods and suggests predation success has influenced the evolution of life history strategy in some praying mantis groups. The evolution of features that contribute to camouflage in the praying mantis group Vatinae (horned praying mantises) followed a unique pattern of loss and recovery that has not been demonstrated in Mantodea.

The largest digital collection of historical Mantodea systematics literature has been assembled and improves accessibility.

The dissemination of research results was accomplished through 25 conference presentations given by students and project personnel as well as 27 research publications in international, peer-reviewed journals co-authored by project personnel, students, and international collaborators. The marketing efforts of the CMNH to publicize project-based results led to 18 featured stories in high profile media outlets including National Public Radio, the New York Times, National Geographic, and Science Magazine. In addition, a systematics themed TV episode was produced by the Wild Kratts PBS show, which was focused on a new species of praying mantis named for the Kratt brothers. This exposure is exemplary of the positive attention that leads to greater public awareness about the importance of biodiversity research. The project personnel also worked with education staff at the CMNH to develop novel education programming for the Museum&rsquo;s award winning Interactive Video Conferencing program.</span></p> </span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 04/06/2017<br>      Modified by: Gavin&nbsp;J&nbsp;Svenson</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1216309/1216309_10072826_1488993094696_HymenopodidaePoster--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1216309/1216309_10072826_1488993094696_HymenopodidaePoster--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Phylogeny of Flower Mantises"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1216309/1216309_10072826_1488993094696_HymenopodidaePoster--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Phylogeny of Flower Mantises"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Summary phylogeny of Hymenopodidae, Empusidae, and Galinthiadidae from Svenson et al. 2016.
