<AbstractNarration>This proposal aims at answering pertinent questions to identifying sparse subsets of high dimensional covariate spaces, in the context of regularization methods, when simple least square loss functions are not well suited. The broad goal is to understand the fundamental interactions between nonlinear and/or censored structure of the statistical model, the regularization scheme and the intrinsic dimensionality of the problem. Specifically, the PI aims at (1) Identifying new statistical problems and regularization schemes, with complex nonlinear and time-to-event structure with high dimensional covariate space that are tuned to the characteristics of the data; (2) Developing novel non-asymptotic oracle bounds on the behavior of regularized estimators where techniques of random matrix theory, especially high probability bounds on various matrix norms, and approximation theory, will be utilized to enhance understanding of the effects of dimensionality on the non-asymptotic properties; (3) Investigating  new non-asymptotic  bounds on risk of  semiparametric methods  where the statistical model is possibly misspecified; (4) Analyzing and developing models that use special interplay between censoring rate, sample size and dimensionality of the problem and importantly  (5) Introducing new algorithms that optimally and efficiently solve the investigated large scale problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Explosion of microarray technologies has lead to vast number of large-scale   genome-wide association studies where simultaneous analysis of a large number of SNPs is pertinent to discovering genetic identification of complex diseases. Presence and importance of time to event component calls for significant advances in statistical methodology for both NP dimensionality and censored structure. This research proposal aims at developing innovative and effective statistical methods for such complex data with special impact in genetic, public health and bioinformatic sciences, where censoring and vast number of gene interactions make identification of misbehaving genes very difficult. Moreover, the developments of this inter-disciplinary project will enhance new scientific discoveries, make new collaborative connections with practitioners and will promote teaching and training of graduate students on the contemporary state-of-the-art machine learning techniques applied to semiparametric models and censored data. To promote the progress of science, PI will make explicit collaborations of department of Mathematics, Biostatistics division of the Medical School at UCSD and Supercomputer Center in San Diego. Through dissemination of the results of this proposal, PI plans to expose biology to mathematics majors and promote science among underrepresented groups and women in mathematics.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[We often think of genes and genetic information   static and unmoving. In fact, genes  are constantly changing, adapting and responding to the incoming information about their environment and in particular tissue changes that are the result of the malignant behavior.   One type of change to which genes are sensible to is the  one-location change that stops or breaks the cancerous mutations.    We are interested in a class of statistical models, called high-dimensional learning problems, which serve to  model and learn  the changes in the behavior of genes in response to the treatment or cancer changes. Though these micro-changes, ofter only seen at the snp levels,  were first characterized a  few years ago, they remain largely not well understood, especially when one wants to differentiate between successful and less successful treatment plans.    The research supported by this award was designed to study how many genes interact  together and lead to  better survival rates of cancer patients.      The results of our study, has led to a number of new statistical models and theory results that were disseminated in scientific journals. In particular, our new models   gave us a number of new insights into how different treatment effects  are  perceived by the individual genes and by  their group and network interactions In particular, we build models that were able to identify new  groups of genes that control the effect of cancer. This now enables biologists to go and perform controlled experiments on the subset of genes that we have identified. We believe this will lead to better treatment designs in the future.
