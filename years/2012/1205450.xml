<AbstractNarration>Prosody is a critical component of spoken communication. Loosely defined, prosody is ?how words are spoken?, as opposed to ?what words are said?. Prosody is typically defined to include pitch, intensity, and timing -- and systematic variation in these parameters can reinforce or augment a speaker?s intended meaning. Prosody provides important information at every linguistic level, disambiguating syntax, augmenting semantics and pragmatic information, e.g. by conveying information about phrasal grouping and phrase-level prominence. Emotions and other speaker-state information are also communicated through a speaker?s prosody. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although this aspect of speech is important, it remains under-investigated. A major limiting factor is the lack of large sample of prosodically labeled speech. Prosody researchers at CUNY, Columbia and MIT are developing Reciprosody, a web source of prosodically annotated data and tools for analysis. Reciprosody makes critical resources for the study and teaching of prosody available to a growing and diverse population of researchers, students, and technologists. This website hosts data in any language, annotated under any prosody standard. The only restriction for hosting data in the repository is that it must be made freely available for academic and educational activities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Reciprosody is not merely a passive repository, but an active resource for researchers and educators to communicate with each other on a regular basis. This enables the resource to be a center not only for annotated data, but information and support related to ongoing prosody research.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Prosody -- whether speakers produce sentences as questions or statements, whether they emphasize one word or another -- makes a major contribution to how listeners understand what we say.  For example, in Standard American English, "Newton is dead." spoken with falling intonation Is interpreted by listeners as conveying a fact the speaker believes to be true, while "Newton is dead?" spoken with rising intonation is interpreted as questioning that fact.  If a speaker says "John only introduced Mary to Sue" a listerner will understand that Mary is the only one John introduced to Sue.  But if Sue is emphasized instead ("John only introduced Mary to Sue"), the speaker means that Sue is the only person John introduced Mary to.  Prosodic information is a critical part of human communication as well as one of the major factors influencing listeners perception of the synthetic speech that comes from our phones and other electronic devices.  However, there is extraordinarily little labeled training data to use for training human-sounding speech generation systems in most of the approximately 6500 languages spoken in the world.  The Reciprosody Project addressed this deficiency in several ways.  First, the project produced a web resource, "Reciprosody: a repository of prosodically annotated material" (http://reciprosody.org/) that allows researchers on prosody to share labeled data in any language and tools to help in the labeling and analysis of speech data.  These tools include tools for automatically identifying prosody which can be adapted from models in one language (e.g. English, French, Portuguese) with small amounts of labeled data to identify prosody in other languages (e.g. Mandarin, German).  The website also provides useful pointers to other tools and data repositories.    Second, the project organized a workshop and a number of activities designed to train graduate students in prosody research and to identify wider needs of the prosody research community.  Seventeen graduate students and faculty collaborators participated in a workshop early in the project in 2013 to identify community needs for tools and data.  Several graduate students also attended summer schools and participated in reading groups to enhance their knowledge of prosody research, with the ultimate goal of increasing the pool of experts in this area.  By enlarging the community of researchers who understand prosodic information and how important it is to human-human and human-machine communication, we will enable more and better spoken dialogue systems and speech to speech translation systems in more and more of the world's languages.
