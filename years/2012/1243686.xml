<AbstractNarration>****Technical Abstract****&lt;br/&gt;This project provides partial support for the National Research Council's (NRC) Condensed Matter and Materials Research Committee (CMMRC). The CMMRC is a multidisciplinary group with membership drawn from universities, industry, and government laboratories. The areas of expertise represented on the committee are intended to cover the breadth of the condensed matter and materials research fields. Nominees for committee membership have been and will continue to be selected on the basis of demonstrated intellectual leadership in these areas and thoughtful consideration of cross-cutting issues. The operating guidelines of CMMRC include the following objectives: (1) to respond to requests for technical information and assistance, both from within the National Academies and from outside federal research agencies; (2) to initiate and oversee ad hoc studies in these fields and their multidisciplinary connections to other fields of science and technology; (3) to serve as long-term stewards for studies initiated under CMMRC's direction; (4) to act as an educational resource for the condensed matter and materials research communities and the agencies that support them; and (5) to provide a forum for discussion among condensed matter and materials scientists and Washington D.C. policymakers. To carry out those objectives, CMMRC meets on an annual basis and between those meetings, conducts its business through telephone conferences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;****Non-technical Abstract****&lt;br/&gt;CMMRC's impact goes beyond the confines of the condensed matter and materials research communities. First, these activities engage a group of leading scientists from across the subfields of condensed matter and materials science in joint deliberations and provide a learning environment for that body regarding the public-policy process for science and the position of those fields in the broader context of the physical sciences. Second, CMMRC activities lead to an improved understanding of condensed matter and materials science by the broader scientific and policy-making communities. By holding workshops and town hall meetings, and initiating studies, CMMRC will continue to educate researchers, policy makers, and the general public about advances in condensed matter and materials science and their beneficial impact in other fields of science and technology and for society, in general.</AbstractNarration>

The CMMRC is one of five standing committees of the National AcademiesÆ Board on Physics and Astronomy and is charged with assisting the Board in achieving its goals&mdash;monitoring the health of physics and astronomy, identifying important new developments at the scientific forefronts, fostering interactions with other fields, strengthening connections to technology, facilitating effective service to the nation, and enhancing education in physics. The committee carries out its functions in several ways - providing expert advice to the BPA in monitoring the health of condensed matter and materials research and providing perspective on issues that arise in those fields; assisting other National AcademiesÆ boards in developing proposals and initiating studies that impact these fields; providing long-term stewardship of National Academies reports that it has played a role in initiating and that are of importance to the condensed matter and materials research communities, and providing a means for dialog with federal agencies on these and related fields.   To carry out its objectives, CMMRC meets face-to-face on an annual basis and between those meetings, conducts its business through telephone conferences.  At the annual meeting conducted during the 1-year covered by this grant, CMMRC met with representatives of agencies that support condensed matter and materials research and discussed outstanding issues facing the condensed matter and materials research science community, and then conducted a focus session on perovskite photovoltaics.  Following the meeting, the committee prepared a summary of the presentations and discussions that took place during that focus session and provided that to the sponsoring agencies.
