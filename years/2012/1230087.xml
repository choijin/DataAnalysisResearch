<AbstractNarration>Characteristic scales and structures of precipitation particle distributions have generally been explored over dimensions considerably larger than 1 km, yet for several reasons it is important to characterize their variability on far smaller scales. These include the need to: (1) optimize interpretation of observations made by simple rain gages and disdrometers and the translation of such measurements to much larger scales, as needed for validation of numerical weather forecasts and flood warnings; (2) better understand drop interactions and evolution in a multi-dimensional context rather than just the classical time dependent treatment in the vertical for falling precipitation (as has often been considered adequate for representation of processes including raindrop collision, coalescence and break-up); (3) achieve a more complete description of how radar-emitted microwaves interact with rain; and (4) ultimate connection and perhaps translation of 1-D observations of drop size distributions to larger 2-D domains.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this project derives from quantification of small-scale precipitation structures via combined use of a 2-D video disdrometer in conjunction with a networked array of optical disdrometers, through which investigators will calculate pair-correlation functions in rain to derive improved measures of any given precipitation field's horizontal geometry.  Disdrometer observations (whose horizontal separation may be readily adjusted) will also allow examination a wide range of distances for possible scaling, self-similarity and functional structures of drop size distributions so as to better connect with remote-sensor measurements of precipitation covering large areas.  The over-arching objective of this work is to collect and analyze time-series observations of rainfall over horizontal scales ranging from centimeters (as observed using a 2-D video disdrometer) up to several tens to perhaps a hundred meters or more.  Broader Impacts will come through potential contributions to improved flood prediction and monitoring as well as better processes relevant to soil erosion, through support of hands-on student involvement in, and through improved observational infrastructure at an undergraduate institution serving underrepresented groups.</AbstractNarration>

The outcomes from this project are:  A method was developed to      extract more of the information contained in the time series of drop      counts in rain which can then be expressed over large 2D areas for use in      radar-rainfall rate validations and other studies. It was shown that the      rainfall rate is much more strongly correlated to the total number of      drops than to the mean drop size Network observations      revealed signi?cant differences between spatial and temporal structures      suggesting that temporal observations of clustering cannot be used to      infer spatial and that temporal fluctuations occur independently of      spatial fluctuations It was also shown that      there is a linear relation between 1-min averages of the rainfall rate R      over the network and the average total number of drops N. Temporal and      spatial size distributions and their variabilities are not equivalent. The DSD is the product of      the total number of drops N times the probability size distributions      (PSDs). The average PSD fails to characterize its true variability over an      area. This variability of the PSD increases with the expansion of the      network size and with increasing drop diameter with a saturation level in      the variability occurring for dimensions larger than around 1 km. While the importance of      PSDs looms large for small domains used in past studies, over domains      larger than around 1 km, it is the variability of the total number of      drops that dominates the variability of R regardless of the PSD.
