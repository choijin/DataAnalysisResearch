<AbstractNarration>This award is made as part of the FY 2012 Mathematical Sciences Postdoctoral Research Fellowships Program. These fellowships support a research and training plan at a host institution in the mathematical sciences, including applications to other disciplines. The title of the research and training plan for this fellowship to Douglas Rizzolo is "Excursion theory of Brownian motion." The host institution for the fellowship is University of Washington, and the sponsoring scientist is Dr. Krzysztof Burdzy.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project investigated random processes related to Brownian motion.  One of the primary outcomes was the development of a robust method for finding scaling limits of random trees.  This project produced three papers in this direction.  Random trees are used to model a number of real world phenomena, for example as models of genealogical trees.  Studying scaling limits allows allows us to determine the large-scale properties of such trees.  In this project, we developed general frameworks for establishing such scaling limits and used these frameworks to establish limit theorem for several models of interest in combinatorics and population genetics.  In particular, we focused on models of Markov branching trees, which model genealogies where the number of offspring of a child is independent of the offspring of the parent.  In addition to models of genealogies, these types of trees also appear in atomic as well was quantum physics.  The methods we developed also proved useful in studying pattern-avoiding permutations, which are important in computer science among other fields.  Two papers were produced in this direction establishing fundamental connections between pattern-avoiding permutations and Brownian excursion. This particular project was joint with a graduate student and working on this project helped him complete his dissertation and obtain a post doctoral position.  A second outcome was a series of two papers investigating the motion of a randomly reflecting particle in an external field.  Many models in probability are motivated by physical phenomena such as randomly reflecting particles and this series extended these to include the presence of an external field, such as gravity.  This project was also joint with a graduate student and working on this project helped him complete his dissertation.  In addition to these results, this project supported research trips to several States as well as to Canada an China.  These trips and the connected talks helped disseminate the work done in this project.       Last Modified: 09/27/2015       Submitted by: Douglas Rizzolo]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
