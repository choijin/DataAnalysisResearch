<AbstractNarration>The Astronomical Society of the Pacific (ASP) and its collaborators are conducting a set of research and development activities focusing on early childhood astronomy in the first field-wide effort to increase the capacity of informal science education (ISE) institutions to effectively engage their youngest visitors (ages 3 - 5) in astronomy.   Leading the project is an Action Research Group comprised of the ASP; experts in cognitive development, early childhood, and astronomy learning progressions from UC Santa Cruz, Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, and Penn State; and the Lawrence Hall of Science at UC Berkeley, Children?s Discovery Museum of San Jose, and San Luis Obispo Children?s Museum as sites for research, field testing, and implementation.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The project will identify critical areas of focus for early childhood astronomy and will test the hypothesis that early astronomy learning is not only possible but may contribute to a more sophisticated understanding of the domain. A key question is: How can the ISE field scaffold children's early curiosity and ideas about astronomy to position them for greater understanding and interest in the topic?  The results of the research and the materials that are created for educators will receive broad distribution nationally.</AbstractNarration>

This research extends our understanding of the use of science practices in informal settings with young children. Most informal science educators are able to describe ways young children may engage in science practices in their venues (Plummer, Crowl, &amp; Tanis Ozcelik, in review).  Yet, when we observed informal science educators with preschool-age audiences, we found practitioners ranged from offering no opportunities to engage audiences in science practices to those who provided extensive opportunities through investigations of science phenomena. This points to the importance of our professional development opportunities and MST activities designed to support science practices. Findings from a study of an expert informal science educator implementing four My Sky Tonight activities - designed to support young children's investigation of astronomical phenomena - found that 3-to-5 year old children co-constructed evidence-based explanations for science phenomena and used evidence to support modeling practices across all activities (Plummer &amp; Ricketts, 2018).</span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>My Sky Tonight research also extends our understanding of children's engagement with astronomy and other science-related ideas in their spontaneous conversations at home, in museum visits with their families, and in preschool settings.

We also found that parents varied in how likely they were to spontaneously engage in forms of science-related talk with their children, but that this variation is not necessarily predicted by factors such as the parents' educational background (Castaneda, Rodriguez-Gutierrez, Callanan, &amp; Jipson, under review).

The ASP has published this book, and in addition to individuals purchasing the book, we have also distributed it to hundreds of museums and parks across the U.S. We've also incorporated the book into our research studies. Our research in progress is exploring the role of storybooks in encouraging families' conversations about astronomy.
