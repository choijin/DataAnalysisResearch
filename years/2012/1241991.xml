<AbstractNarration>This Pan-American Advanced Studies Institutes (PASI) award, jointly supported by the NSF and the Department of Energy (DOE), will take place in July 14-25, 2014 in BÃºzios, State of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.  Organized by Dr. Peter Guttorp, a professor of Statistics, Quantitative Ecology &amp; Resource Management, and Urban Design &amp; Planning at the , University of Washington in Seattle, Washington, the institute will focus on spatial and spatio-temporal models and their statistical analysis, with lectures in theory and applications as well as practical computing exercises.  The content will be linked together with advanced applications in climatology, ecology and environmental health and provide a comprehensive software archive for these methods, most of which have not been publicly available. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This PASI will introduce participants to many important techniques, including state-of-the-art methods in modeling.  The activity will also foster international collaboration among researchers from the US and the Americas.  The educational content of the institute and its materials will be disseminated through an integrated web site, containing presentations, software, annotated bibliography and a variety of resource links.  In addition, institute participants will receive guidance in producing white papers for publication.</AbstractNarration>

The main feature of the Institute was a summer school, divided into seven topics. Each topic had a theoretical overview lecture,  a practicum where participants learned to use software to analyze data, and an applied lecture, All lectures and parcticaare available online.  In addition to the summer school, there were two workshops, one on nonstationary covariance models and one on multivariate spatial statistics.  One afternoon was dedicated to student/postdoc presentations of their research, and one to senior researcher presentations.  The post-conference assessment indicated that the practica wee considered particularly useful. Another aspect of the Institute considered particularly useful was the opportunity to network, both with instructors and with other students.
