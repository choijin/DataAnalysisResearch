<AbstractNarration>This project will provide funding to the University of Washington to hold a three-day workshop that will bring together a diverse group of expert scholars and students to explore long-term human-environmental dynamics through the Holocene in the North Pacific with a focus on the Kuril and Aleutian islands. The reason for focusing on these island regions is that these archipelagos constitute model ecosystems for tracking migration, human-environmental interactions and adaptations. Over the past decade, in both areas of the North Pacific, interdisciplinary teams of archaeologists, biologists, geologists, chemists, and modelers have worked to better understand environmental and human dynamics. These teams have developed innovative methods for exploring the intersection of geological, paleoenvironmental, biological, and cultural histories of these island environments. However, as the PI states, substantial research questions, methodologies, and data sets for both regions remain disparate and nonintegrated and are subsequently underutilized. The purpose of this workshop is to bring these diverse groups of scholars and their students together to compare data, methods, and analyses in order to start a synthesis of the North Pacific human-environmental ecodynamics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop will be hosted by the University of Washington in early November, 2012 and will attended by approximately 35 participants, including scholars from the Unitied States, Canada, Russia, and Japan. In addition, the organizers envision a robust role for students; the proposal includes funds for up 10 students (graduate/undergraduate) to participate in the workshop from around the U.S. In return for travel, boarding and per diem, the students will be expected to play active roles in the management and intellectual activities of the workshop. A dedicated component of the workshop will be periodic student discussant presentations, in which students will be encouraged to reflect on the proceedings. Finally, careful planning and follow-up with the broader team of synthesis leaders will ensure the prompt preparation and publication of workshop results, preparation of the workshop report and white paper.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This award supported a workshop comparing the archaeological and environmental dynamics in the remote, volcanically active Aleutian and Kuril Islands chains.  Both island groups have been studied internally with respect to how relative isolation, ecological diversity, and climate have interacted with human sustainability.  This workshop sought to bring the research communities together to explore the similarities and differences in long term human-environmental dynamics in the histories of these two island chains.  Intellectual Merit:  Participants of the workshop compared findings and explored methods for better understanding the long term history of linked cultural, climatic and ecological systems in the remote North Pacific.  The goal was to stimulate a collective approach to human eco-dynamic research in the region.  During as well as following the workshop many participants joined forces to figure out how to implement just such an outcome through 1) increased sharing of information, including the archiving of legacy data files in locations of greater shared accessibility, 2) pursuing methods not previously exercized in some areas to generate larger scale, standardized, and comparable information, and 3) greater utilization of new data management and synthesis resources.  Broader Impacts: The workshop had several benefits to science, education, and international collaboration.  Scientifically, the pressing issues facing our world today require inter-disciplinary skills and understanding.  This workshop challenged participants to think about connections between disciplines and to evaluate possible similarities and differences between geographically similar yet also different regions.  Seventeen students participated in the workshop, learning how to think across disciplines, and developing strong networks with the each other and with the more senior researchers/faculty in the workshop.  The close collaborative relationship that emerged between Russian, Japanese, and American scholars and students, represents a great example of the value of research to bring people together for opportunities to learn new ways of thinking and conducting research.  The most significant outcome of the workshop was an energized community of international scholars and students eager to work together and share data to fill gaps in understanding that - at present - prevent full synthesis.  Several participants of the workshop have joined forces to expand research breadth in their regions and to bring buried legacy data to light where it can inform contemporary researchers.
