<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes to develop a technology that enables a rapid DNA assembly system for synthetic biology. Wedding recent advances in DNA assembly methods, and the software algorithms used to design those DNA assemblies, the company will develop a platform technology for facilitating an optimized combination of direct synthesis DNA assembly to make large combinatorial libraries. The proposed technology is an enabling technology that will allow scientists to direct their resources to conducting experiments that address primary issues.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will be to accelerate the pace of microbe development for companies and organizations that develop valuable proteins, advanced enzymes for industry, or therapeutic medicines. DNA cloning is an everyday practice in the course of both Industrial and University based research. Cloning technology has remained largely unchanged for the last 20 years. As a consequence, researchers waste an inordinate amount of time and money designing and constructing DNA, rather than on designing and conducting experiments. Over the past few years, standardized experimental DNA construction methods have been developed that lend themselves well to automation and rapid assembly of DNA. Process automation is progressing from luxury to necessity, as target applications demand the fabrication of large combinatorial DNA libraries in the search for better antibodies, faster enzymes, and more productive microbial strains. The proposed technology will allow rapid forward engineered biological libraries of recombinant DNA. The commercial availability of this technology will provide a low cost alternative to current methods.</AbstractNarration>
