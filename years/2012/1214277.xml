<AbstractNarration>The University of Miami Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Sciences&lt;br/&gt;(RSMAS) is awarded first year funding of a new five-year cooperative agreement to operate the R/V F. G. Walton Smith in support of NSF funded research in CY 2012. R/V Walton Smith is owned by the University of Miami and is a 96-foot catamaran research vessel which operates as a University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System ship. R/V Walton Smith's prime area of operation is off coastal Florida, both in the Atlantic and in the Gulf of Mexico, and the Bahamas. In CY 2012 the ship will support NSF funded researchers for 38 days at sea, out of a 150-day operating schedule. The primary focus for NSF-funded research in CY 2012 are biological and physical oceanography.  R/V Walton Smith adheres to all the UNOLS safety standards and NSF inspections.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual and Technical Merit&lt;br/&gt;R/V F.G Walton Smith is a modern, well-equipped research vessel with an experienced and well-trained crew, and classified as a local class ship under the UNOLS classification. The research being conducted on R/V Walton Smith will contribute to the understanding of important issues in its area of operations. Studies will be conducted on harmful algal blooms, and population dynamics that contribute to these blooms.  R/V F.G Walton Smith provides a desirable platform for scuba diving operations for octocoral research and sponge ecosystem studies.  The successes of fieldwork by the oceanographic research communities are dependent on having reliable, well-equipped research vessels with capable supporting shore-side infrastructure. It is imperative that the costs be minimized without sacrificing safety or quality. The oceanographic vessels have been able and willing, in general, to provide new technical advances for the oceanographic community when they become widely available. These platforms are essential to advance understanding of ocean processes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts:&lt;br/&gt;Ship operations play a vital role at the University of Miamis Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science (RSMAS) with respect to the Schools outreach and education missions.  The School is committed to improving scientific and environmental literacy among students and adults, regionally, nationally and internationally.  Internships and undergraduate training are offered to numerous students each year. Summer teaching and student training programs are also run each summer. Graduate and undergraduate students from UM, USF, FIT, NOVA, and FIU are routinely taken on the  Walton Smith cruises to participate in at-sea oceanographic research. Occasionally one-day cruises are taken as part of graduate or undergraduate classes. The School's outreach mechanisms included media releases, magazine articles, TV interviews, and has continuous website news in which the ship is featured. Tours of the vessel are regularly given to elementary, middle and high school classes; most frequently to the adjacent Miami-Dade County Marine and Atmospheric Science and Technology (MAST) school as well as part of the summer camp experience for younger children. The University of Miami/ RSMAS continues the partnership with Royal Caribbean Cruise Line, NSF, NOAA and NASA through which graduate fellowships are annually made available, research is sponsored and a major volunteer observing ship effort has been supported. This  has permitted testing and development of technologies later employed aboard the RV F.G. Walton Smith.  For the past eleven years, this effort aboard the Explorer of the Sea has exposed more than 2500 passengers a week to marine and atmospheric research at The University of Miami RSMAS.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The vessel, the F.G. WALTON SMITH is an aluminum catamaran research vessel has unique capabilities including shallow draft, controllable pitch propellers for precise sea keeping and the ability to load a significant amount of gear aboard her decks due to her excellent stability characteristics. The ship is designed to work in the shallow coastal waters of Florida, the Bahamas, the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean Sea. Besides general oceanographic work, the ship is well suited to support scientific diving operations, ROV/AUV operations, and ocean bottom mapping.  Over the course of the duration of this grant, the ship was dispached to sea some 125 times logging 901 days at sea.  The scince party was transported to the destination of their reseach for disciplines ranging from marine geology, marine physical oceanography, chemistry and to marine biology.  Researchers and charterers were also from U.S. marine institutions, private reseach organizations, the U.S. government and military such as ONR, Navy, and EPA, as well as foreign marine institutions.  One of the more intesting uses of the vessel was during summer 2012.  Quoting the GIMRI website, 'the Grand Lagrangian Deployment (GLAD) at-sea experiment in the northern Gulf of Mexico released more than 300 near-surface drifters in the vicinity of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill using deployment patterns selected to understand the unique oceanic motion in the region. Conductivity, temperature and depth (CTD) data during this experiment has become one of the most downloaded on the GRIIDC website.  A science team from the Consortium for Advanced Research on Transport of Hydrocarbon in the Environment (CARTHE) successfully mounted the GLAD experiment, which was funded by the Gulf of Mexico Research Initiative (GoMRI) in the aftermath of the Deepwater Horizon incident. To conduct the GLAD experiment, CARTHE manned a modeling support group on shore and deployed a crew aboard the University of Miami?s R/V Walton Smith. Dr. Brian Haus, Director of the SUrge-STructure-Atmosphere INteraction (SUSTAIN) facility at the University of Miami?s Rosenstiel School, is GLAD?s Chief Scientist.'  Use of the vessel based on its capabilites and handling is characterized as good.  Due to its outfitting and customer service many specifically request the vessel for repeat operations notably NOAA where for the entire duration of this grant they have used the ship over fifty (50) time for over two hundred (200) days combined.
