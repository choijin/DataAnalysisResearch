<AbstractNarration>Collaborative Research Digitization TCN: Southwest Collections of Arthropods Network (SCAN): A Model for Collections Digitization to Promote Taxonomic and Ecological Research&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Southwest Collections of Arthropods Network (SCAN) brings together 10 diverse arthropod collections at universities and museums throughout the Southwest to create a virtual network of ground dwelling arthropods which are notably responsive to temporal and spatial environmental changes. These 10 collections document much of the Southwest's biodiversity, but currently the data associated with millions of arthropod specimens are not easily accessible. To overcome this, SCAN will develop methods for integrating existing databases, catalogue-image specimens, develop new electronic identification techniques, and produce a virtual library of ground-dwelling arthropods (beetles, grasshoppers, spiders, ants). In addition the project will work with the existing project Filtered Push to increase the capacity of experts to provide remote identifications and annotations of data that can be sent throughout the network.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The comprehensive SCAN online library and expert information will be available to the public as well as professionals in taxonomy, ecology, and climate change science. Smaller institutions will be provided increased access to large data sets for promoting research. The SCAN datasets will support a number of ongoing projects examining the effects of environmental and land-use change on individual arthropod species. By increasing access to this information, SCAN will stimulate new research and increased awareness in biodiversity conservation throughout the region. Over 50 undergraduates also will be trained in cyberinfrastructure, systematics, and ecology. This award is made as part of the National Resource for Digitization of Biological Collections through the Advancing Digitization of Biological Collections program and all data resulting from this award will be available through the national resource, iDigBio.org.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;This project was funded for three years, with a no-cost, one year extension (1 July 2012 to 30 June 2016) by the NSF. Further support for salaries came from the Federal Work-Study Program and the Museum of Texas Tech University. During this grant period, 50 part-time, generally temporary, staff (including P.I.) and students of the Museum of Texas Tech University completed all of our proposed goals for the grant. The goals were to (1) collaborate on the construction and use of an online database portal named &ldquo;Symbiota Collections of Arthropods Network (SCAN) [originally entitled: Southwest Collections of Arthropods Network]&rdquo;, (2) catalog 95,000 arthropod specimens, and (3) create and present high-resolution images of 5,000 specimens from the southwestern USA and adjoining states of Mexico.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our goals were reached in collaboration with more than 10 additional small to large sized arthropod collections/museums. All of the information and photographs (from TTU) on the SCAN collaborative portal are presented live and up-to-date under our license terms: the public can share and adapt as long as it is not for commercial purposes and they give credit to the source.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Catalog entries on the SCAN portal include: data regarding how and where the specimens were collected, prepared, and stored; scientific names; georeference (locality) data; and additional information.&nbsp; Each of the topics can be searched.&nbsp; The georeferencing information can be used on the SCAN website to create distribution maps for a species.&nbsp; The data on SCAN also can be used to generate a listing of all cataloged species from any point selected on a map, and the size of the area selected can be scaled as needed.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Each image suite consists of 1&ndash;3 images representing different aspects of a single specimen and its collection labels/barcode. This results in approximately 15,000 images for the 5,000 specimens. However, we currently are presenting over 24,500 photographs on the SCAN portal. This larger number is due in part to the inclusion of numerous low resolution images that show the specimen and labels in the same view. Each high resolution image was generated by taking many (often up to 100) individual macrophotographs at slightly different levels of focus (by using a motor-driven, computer controlled, high resolution camera) and then montaging (with computer software) the images to show only the in-focus parts. The exact number of original photographs that were generated is unknown, but the total certainly consists of many hundreds of thousands.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Additionally, beyond the goals of this grant, we cataloged many thousands of specimens (from non-targeted regions of the world). Many of these records were imported to SCAN from existing Excel files and data files from other projects. Also, cataloging typically was conducted by the insect drawer; that is, because specimens are sorted in the drawers by taxonomic groups rather than by locality, all specimens were cataloged for each drawer regardless of the collection locality of each specimen.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A supplemental benefit of the project was that the methods developed for databasing, macrophotography, and presentation of the data online became part of the procedural document for the Museum of Texas Tech University. As such, it will be easier to continue to grow the information and value of the database/images.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All original individual photographs generated by this project were saved as highest-resolution CR2 (Canon) format image files.
