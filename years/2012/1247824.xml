<AbstractNarration>This study will examine how animals have been depicted in the popular science magazine, National Geographic between 1888-2008.  The evolving visual depiction of animals will be interpreted, taking into account scientific changes, natural history, environmental history, and the new aesthetic sensibilities provided by the history of landscape and environmental photography and by situating the magazine and its photographers, editors and photographic conventions in their broader historical, cultural and political contexts. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will result in two end products: 1) a digital archive and discussion forum on animal meaning and conservation using a sample of National Geographic images and the Personal Meaning Map methodology which will be made available on the web with teaching and learning exercises through Michigan State University?s MATRIX/KORA Digital Repository and Publishing Platform (to establish a pedagogical tool in animal conservation for a broad audience, including students and scholars) and 2) an illustrated monograph on animal imagery in National Geographic (to advance interdisciplinary scholarship by connecting National Geographic representations of animals to broad historical shifts in science, culture, politics and media conventions).</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Our research documented the visual depiction of animals over the 20th century in the popular science magazine, National Geographic.  The findings are important for scholars and students interested in how popular science contributes to the shaping of public attitudes about animals and nature and to ongoing policy debates about conservation and environmental sustainability.    Our work has established that popular science contributes to public discourse through the translation of scientific knowledge for a wide audience. In our qualitative analyses, we found that National Geographic uses a variety of animal representations to make salient the problem of environmental degradation from the vulnerability of wild megafauna to the overconsumption of animals raised in industrial agricultural systems.  We also established that National Geographic's visual images of certain species are linked to specific social and political discourses over the century, thus the social discourses on animals can be traced as cultural shifts documented in popular science periodicals. We also documented that the National Geographic representations of human-liminal animal interactions depict a multi-species community centered around anthropogenic food sources.  We concluded that as a print media representative of the popular science community, National Geographic contributes to what Dunn and colleagues label the emergence of an "ecological sensibility" with the future of environmental sustainability dependent on regular interactions between humans and liminal animals.  To establish the visual representation of animals using a systematic quantitative analysis of photographic content and changes over time, we collected and analyzed 2,236 photographs of animals (from one randomly selected National Geographic issue per year, 1900 to 2011).  The most interesting statistical findings were the overwhelming presence of mammals in the visual content and the connection between animal activity and time period with working animals (primarily in Asia and Europe) dominating the early 20th century and wildlife prevailing in the latter half. These patterns coincide with the passage of key conservation measures to protect endangered wildlife and the environment, such as the Wilderness Act, the Endangered Species Act, and the National Environmental Quality Act. While most images were from North America, there was an increase in the depiction of African animals in the last quarter of the century, indicative of the increasing concern for African wildlife and the establishment of foundations and projects to protect animals in Africa.  Both what is portrayed and how a subject is framed in a photograph depends in part on characteristics of the photographer and contemporary photographic conventions.  We addressed these characteristics as possible factors in the visual representation of animals.  Our analysis of photographic conventions was based on interview data from 98 photographers affiliated with National Geographic.  A network analysis of the photographer interviews demonstrate that 1) there is an influential photographer network, 2) the network is cohesive with various sub-networks, and 3) there are gender distinctions in the network with few women in the influential photographer network.  Further, women tend to network among each other. To assess the implications of these findings we will examine the demographics, characteristics, and photographic styles of the influential photographers.   With a subsample of the full archive, we developed a Teaching/Learning website to help teachers and students understand the historical and contemporary attitudes toward animals and the interrelationships between attitudes and visual representations.  The website reproduces approximately one photograph (owned by National Geographic) per year over the 20th century with characteristics of the photograph (such as geographic location, type of animal, activity of animal, whether in a natural o...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
