<AbstractNarration>Geological carbon dioxide storage can be used to reduce carbon dioxide emissions only if the carbon dioxide remains in deep geological formations for thousands of years. Unfortunately free-phase carbon dioxide in sedimentary basins is less dense than the formation water and therefore leakage of carbon dioxide from these storage reservoirs back to the surface is a major concern. Over time, however, carbon dioxide dissolves into formation waters and increases the water density. Dissolved carbon dioxide will then sink to deeper parts of the sedimentary basins and it is very unlikely to surface again. The faster carbon dioxide dissolves the sooner it is stored safely. This project will evaluate the dissolution of CO2 on two scales:  (1) The geological and geochemical record of a large natural carbon dioxide reservoir called Bravo Dome in New Mexico will be used estimate how fast carbon dioxide has dissolved on the geologic timescale and how tight the natural CO2 trap has been; (2) This study will also build scaled laboratory models for the transport of the dissolved carbon dioxide that determine the overall rate of carbon dioxide dissolution. The spatial structure of the dissolved carbon dioxide currents will be imaged with x-ray tomography. The experiments will be used to calibrate a dynamic model that can then be used to model laboratory observations and to interpret the observed field data to constrain the dissolution and sequestration rates for CO2 over long time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project brings together fluid mechanics, geology, and geochemistry and will provide a first estimate of carbon dioxide dissolution rates in the field, to inform the debate about the long-term safety of geological carbon dioxide storage. The experimental study will address several fundamental questions about the migration of solutes due to density differences that have implications for a broad set of questions for salt-water intrusion to geothermal energy.  The models that will be developed will capture the essential physics of these processes. The development of such models is key to enable uncertainty quantification in geological CO2 storage.</AbstractNarration>

The convective currents set up by the density increase of CO<sub>2</sub>-saturated water can also accelerate the rate of CO<sub>2</sub> dissolution.

First, the CO<sub>2</sub> at Bravo Dome is at low pressure and therefore gaseous, while engineered storage projects aim to inject CO<sub>2</sub> under supercritical conditions. Second, Bravo Dome is compartmentalized and does not communicate with the larger aquifer (Figure 2).

Because dispersion increases linearly with both bead size and convective velocity the pattern in a permeable&nbsp; bead pack with large beads is coarser than in a fine grained one (Figure 3). This is the opposite of the predictions from previous work, which used a Rayleigh number based on molecular diffusion (Figure 4). A major fundamental result of this project is that we have identified a new dispersive Rayleigh number that does predict the convective pattern.&nbsp;</p> <p>Our experiments also show that mechanical dispersion reduces the convective flux and hence the rate of CO<sub>2</sub> dissolution. We have used direct numerical simulations to show that it is the inherent anisotropy of mechanical dispersion, i.e., its dependence on the direction of flow, that reduces the convective flux.

The fan flow geometry is less effective because it forces the plumes further apart and hence reduces the number of downwelings per unit area.&nbsp;</p> <p>While it has long been suspected that mechanical dispersion influences convection in porous media. This project is the first to quantify the effect of dispersion and to explain how it affects both flux and pattern. Our results are important because they show that numerical simulations that ignore dispersion will overestimate CO<sub>2</sub> dissolution and make predictions for storage security that are too optimistic.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 08/04/2018<br>      Modified by: Marc&nbsp;A&nbsp;Hesse</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1215853/1215853_10199566_1533233416327_Figure4--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1215853/1215853_10199566_1533233416327_Figure4--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Convective pattern formation"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1215853/1215853_10199566_1533233416327_Figure4--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Convective pattern formation"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Figure 4: Image on the left shows the spacing of the convective fingers as function of the molecular Rayleigh number.

Natural CO2 reservoirs  provide the only analogue for the long-term evolution of geological CO2 storage.  It is important to understand to what extent these natural CO2 fields can serve as analogues for engineered geological CO2 storage.  Therefore, the first aim of this project was to understand the evolution of Bravo Dome, the largest natural CO2 field in the U.S. and answer two basic questions:  Is Bravo Dome a good analogue for engineered geological CO2 storage? Why has the CO2 at Bravo Dome not dissolved into the aquifer entirely?   The short answer to question 1 is that the Bravo Dome CO2 reservoir is not a good analogue to understand the dissolution of CO2 into the aquifer.  This is due to two important differences between Bravo Dome and engineered storage sites.

In contrast, in an open system the inflow of water maintains the pressure and convective dissolution can proceed at approximately constant rate.  This means that CO2 dissolution at Bravo Dome is slower than would be expected in an engineered storage site and may have ceased altogether. Our conclusion may also be applicable to other natural CO2 reservoirs in the continental U.S., because many are at relatively low pressure.
