<AbstractNarration>ID: MPS/DMR/BMAT(7623) 1206045              PI:  Dorfman, Kevin               ORG: University of Minnesota&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title:  Diffusion of Confined DNA&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;INTELLECTUAL  MERIT:  Nanochannel confined DNA is an emerging technology for obtaining sequence specific information directly from genomic DNA.  The development of this new technology has been accompanied by a renewed interest in the physics of confined, semi-flexible chains.  While the classical theories developed more than 30 years ago by de Gennes and Odijk provide a complete description for the extension and diffusivity of a flexible chain, experimental data indicate that these theories do not describe semi-flexible chains such as DNA over most of the range of confinement.  Simulations have provided concrete evidence for the existence of two regimes between the limits described by Odijk and de Gennes: an "extended de Gennes" regime and a "transition regime," but these state-of-the-art theories remain untested.  The specific aims of this experimental proposal are: (1) test the predictions for the extension of DNA in the transition and extended de Gennes regime, (2) develop a proper definition for the effective width of confined DNA that accounts for surface properties, and (3) test the predictions for the diffusion coefficients of DNA in the transition and extended de Gennes regimes.  The proposed experiments take advantage of a new approach to fabricate relatively inexpensive prototype nanochannels with the precision required for physical studies.  This project should lead to a comprehensive, quantitative understanding of the extension and diffusion of DNA in confinement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BROADER IMPACTS:  Nanochannel confinement is an emerging method for DNA barcoding, where the DNA is stretched and fluorescent genomic information is optically "read" from the linearized DNA.  DNA barcoding rapidly provides genome-scale information with kilobase pair resolution, serving as an important complement to second-generation genome sequencing and hybridization microarrays.  The nanochannel sizes used for DNA barcoding normally lie in the transition regime or the extended de Gennes regime.  The fundamental results gained from this project will provide the foundation for the further engineering of these devices.  The research in this project will train graduate and undergraduate students in nanofabrication, polymer physics, and transport phenomena.  The participation of underrepresented minorities will be increased further through a summer research program with the Chemistry Department at Grambling State University, an HBCU.  Participation in the "Energy and U" program will promote interest in science and engineering in students in grades 3-12.  "Energy and U" is an interactive program that teaches the first law of thermodynamics in an age-appropriate manner through dramatic demonstrations of energy conversion.  Thousands of students attend the program each year, including many students from inner city and underprivileged schools.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goal of this project was to investigate, via experiments, the stretching and movement of long molecules of DNA when they are confined in a nanochannel. Understanding these phenomena has a broader impact on the continued development of genomic mapping technologies. In this method, genomic DNA molecules are fluorescently labeled using a sequence-specific enzyme and then stretched by confinement inside a nanochannel. The locations of the fluorescent spots are "read" using an optical microscope to create a "barcode" for that DNA molecule, which can then be compared to a reference barcode for the genome of that organism to see if any large-scale rearrangements have occurred. The stretching of the DNA is important for genome mapping to ensure accuracy; the labels need to be in the correct order and uniformly stretched. The diffusion of DNA is important for the imaging, as fluctuations in the DNA position would lead to blurring of the images.  The theory of DNA confinement in a nanochannel was believed to be a solved problem based on the seminal work by de Gennes in the 1970?s and Odijk in the 1980?s. However, experiments by Austin and co-workers in 2005 cast serious doubts on the validity of these theories. Subsequent theoretical work, a substantial amount of it by Dorfman?s group, established that the de Gennes and Odijk theories were limiting cases for polymer confinement in weak and strong confinement, respectively, that have little relevance to confined DNA.  The intellectual merit of this project was to reconcile the emerging theoretical framework with precise experimental measurements. In this context, this project led to three important outcomes:  The first important outcome was the discovery of the phenomenon of regime mixing. In many experimental systems, the DNA is confined in a rectangular channel where the channel depth is different than the width. This geometry may result from fabrication limitations, but more often is adopted for experimental convenience &ndash; it is relatively easy to vary the channel width, so working with a nanochannel of fixed depth and variable with allows for a wide range of different confinement within the same device. The experiments in this project showed a remarkable behavior when the depth H of the channel is close to the bending length scale for the DNA and the width W of the channel is much larger than the bending length scale.  While theory would predict that the DNA stretching in this rectangular channel would be the same as a square channel with size (DW)1/2, this is not the case. Rather, since the length scale H lies in one type of confinement (Odijk) and the length scale W lies in a different regime of confinement (de Gennes), they cannot be "mixed" into a single type of confinement.  The second important outcome was the first experimental validation of the so-called "extended de Gennes regime" of confinement that was predicted to lie between the classical Odijk and de Gennes regimes.  The extended de Gennes regime is characterized by very weak excluded volume between distant parts of the chain, where the channel walls lead to little interaction between them. The weakness of the excluded volume leads to the variance in the chain stretching to be independent of the channel size. The experiments performed in this project demonstrated that this is indeed the case for the channel sizes predicted to lie within the extended de Gennes regime. Moreover, the magnitude of the fluctuations is, to within experimental certainty, in quantitative agreement with an exact theory for the extended de Gennes regime.
