<AbstractNarration>The IceCube Neutrino Observatory, embedded in the ice cap at the South Pole, is the world's largest and most sensitive high energy neutrino telescope. The recent addition of the DeepCore low energy extension allows IceCube to address fundamental questions in particle physics through the observation of atmospheric neutrinos at energies from 10 to 100 GeV.  With this award the Penn State group will continue to use DeepCore data to address fundamental questions of neutrino physics, including testing whether the observed muon neutrino oscillations lead to tau neutrino appearance, or whether extra, sterile neutrino flavors are involved in neutrino oscillations. The Penn State group will also use IceCube and DeepCore to facilitate searches for astrophysical neutrinos from accelerators of cosmic rays.  DeepCore will enhance IceCube's ability to identify tau neutrino events at energies of around 1 PeV.  Real-time searches for such events can be used to identify astrophysical transient events associated with cosmic ray acceleration.  In addition, the group is studying the feasibility of implementing an even more powerful atmospheric neutrino detector in the Antarctic ice cap, known as PINGU, which might have the ability to probe the neutrino mass hierarchy. This could provide extremely valuable input to fundamental theories of particle physics beyond the Standard Model.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: &lt;br/&gt;The Penn State group offers a summer professional development workshop for secondary school teachers, which exposes them to forefront research in particle astrophysics.  They have developed a version of the workshop focused on giving the educators a hands-on experience in operating state-of-the-art particle detectors, as well as on simpler activities and materials which can be easily used in the high school classroom.  In addition, the group provides opportunities for young physicists at all levels to become involved in particle astrophysics, with a particular emphasis on encouraging participation among women and underrepresented groups.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The IceCube Collaboration has made tremendous strides towards fulfilling its goal of creating a world-class neutrino detector at the South Pole.  During the period covered by this grant, IceCube discovered high energy astrophysical neutrinos and, with its low energy sub-array called "DeepCore," made measurements of fundamental neutrino properties that were competitive with the world?s best measurements.  Ranging over about seven orders of magnitude in neutrino energy, and using neutrinos from the farthest reaches of space to the nearer confines of the Earth?s atmosphere, the impressive breadth of these results spotlights the great versatility of the IceCube detector.   These and other recent successes strongly suggest that IceCube is just beginning to tap its potential to make fundamental contributions to neutrino physics and astrophysics.  At Penn State we have primarily focused on the measurement of fundamental neutrino properties, although we are also heavily involved in the important next steps following IceCube?s discovery of high-energy astrophysical neutrinos.  IceCube/DeepCore has published two analyses demonstrating our detector?s sensitivity to atmospheric neutrino "oscillations," whereby neutrinos of one type (or "flavor") transform into another flavor as they travel from their creation point to their detection point in the chunk of South Pole ice monitored by IceCube.  The neutrinos in these analyses are typically created in cosmic-ray air showers on the other side of the planet and then, in a compelling demonstration of neutrinos? very weak interaction with matter, traverse the entire Earth before their detection in IceCube.  (Most of these neutrinos will continue unscathed through IceCube, but a tiny fraction will interact there and be detected.)  Penn State?s contribution to this effort has been to devise and implement new techniques to reconstruct the data acquired by IceCube/DeepCore, making much more effective use of the data and dramatically increasing our sensitivity to the size and nature of the oscillations.  The Collaboration has approved the analysis and after some final checks, we expect to publish the results by early 2017.  These results will clearly show that IceCube is competitive with the world?s best accelerator-based measurements of these neutrino oscillation parameters.  Using the same reconstruction techniques, Penn State has also pioneered the study of the appearance of "tau" neutrinos, the least well understood and least well studied of the three known neutrino flavors.  This analysis is following right on the heels of the previous analysis, and with only four years of data will also be competitive with the world?s best measurements, including those using about 15 years of data, demonstrating again the power and reach of IceCube/DeepCore for neutrino oscillation physics.  At the higher end of the energy scale, IceCube members at Penn State have been instrumental in implementing real-time follow-up of IceCube?s high energy astrophysical neutrino candidates.  Although IceCube has discovered these neutrinos, thus far we have been unable to pinpoint an astrophysical source (or sources) that could have been responsible for accelerating these neutrinos to such prodigious energies.  One possible way to unravel this mystery is to try to find optical or other electromagnetic counterparts that arrive in other (optical) telescopes at the same time and from the same direction as the detected neutrino. Since many of these sources are expected to be transient in nature, a quick follow-up is key, i.e., we need to look in the sky for an optical counterpart as soon after the neutrino arrives as possible.  To this end, we have created the Astrophysical Multimessenger Observatory Network, or "AMON" (under a different NSF grant at Penn State, PI: Prof. Miguel Mostafa), that enables seamless realtime follow-up of IceCube neutrinos.  Members of the Penn State IceCube group have assisted in the establishment of the realtime connection between IceCube and AMON.  With colleagues working on related experiments in particle astrophysics, we ran week-long summer for-credit workshops for high school teachers.  Over multiple years, our "Hands-on Extreme Particle Astrophysics" course gave upwards of 100 teachers from the U.S. and Puerto Rico an overview of our field, and direct experience manipulating basic particle detection hardware based on the QuarkNet setup for measuring basic properties of cosmic ray muons (charged particles created in the atmosphere).  For instance, they measured the flux of these muons as a function of angle, and showed that their speed was roughly equal to the speed of light.  The post-course reviews from the teachers were glowing.  One of us (Cowen) founded and continues to run the Physics and Astronomy for Women (PAW) group at Penn State.  This group is dedicated to helping improve the climate for women in these fields, where they are currently underrepresented.  The group does organized mentoring of younger female undergraduates, meets privately with prominent female seminar and colloquium speakers, holds social events, does outreach in the community, and helped to organize a very successful Conference for Undergraduate Women in Physics (CUWiP) event at Penn State with nearly 200 attendees.
