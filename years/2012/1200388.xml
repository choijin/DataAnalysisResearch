<AbstractNarration>The problems to be investigated are in the area of dynamical systems on homogeneous spaces which are obtained as a quotient of a Lie group by a discrete subgroup. Such spaces arise naturally from problems in number theory. The main objective is to continue the path of establishing dynamics on homogeneous spaces as a powerful tool to approach certain problems in number theory. The following problems will be main objects of the study: (i) "effectivization" of orbit closure and equdistribution results for orbits of certain subgroups (ii) establishing "rigidity" results for invariant measures and orbits of ''certain subgroups" on homogeneous spaces; special attention will be given to the case of Radon measures on geometrically finite manifolds and Raghunathan's conjecture in positive characteristic setting. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lie groups and their discrete subgroups are one of the central objects of study in mathematics. During the past 40 years, techniques and ideas from dynamics on homogeneous spaces have been fruitful in answering certain long standing questions in number theory, in particular in Diophantine approximation. The relevant results are mostly in the rigidity theory of the kind that a rather weak initial information about an object almost fully classifies the object. This proposal seeks continuation of this path.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Dynamical systems study the long term behavior of a point in a space     and are central objects in modern mathematics.       Billiards provide a real life example; in order to study this from a mathematical point of view one considers an     ideal billiard table,     i.e. a table with no friction and where the angle of incidence     equals the angle of reflection.       It has been a long standing interest in mathematics to study     dynamics of billiard trajectories     on polygonal, not necessarily rectangular, billiard tables.       Indeed different trajectories can have different behaviors, e.g.     some trajectories are periodic and some trajectories are dense.       This very concrete problem has proven to be nutritiously difficult.       Part of the difficulty arises from the fact that, as a mathematical     object, one billiard table alone happens to be lacking enough     structure       to answer certain questions regarding its own trajectories.       Therefore, one is lead to the study of families of billiard tables     which       have same combinatorics, e.g. same number of edges for the table.       These families, as new spaces, turn out to have a much richer     structure and define dynamical systems with several     fruitful properties to study.  This proposal studied questions with similar philosophical point of     view, seeking for strong rigidity results.  The outcomes have deepened our knowledge on the subject of "homogeneous dynamics" and "dynamics on moduli space" by providing quantitative accounts of certain rigidity type results and by generalizing the existing (qualitative) results to new settings.  The results have applications in different areas of pure mathematics such as number theory and geometry.  The following is a more detailed description of what was studies.  (1) Employing dynamical approach to study problems in number theory     and geometry has proven rather fruitful.     However, this approach often does not provide an algorithm for finding solutions, say of a diophantine equations or inequality.     We studied effectivization of certain rigidity phenomena for the      action of groups generated by unipotent subgroups on homogeneous      spaces;       these rigidity results serve as a corner stone to aforementioned applications in number theory.  (2) There is an action of the group of nonsingular, two by     two matrices with real entries on the moduli space of     a compact Riemann surface. This is closely related to the asymptotic      of the number of periodic billiard trajectories in      polygonal billiards whose angles are rational multiples of pi.       While supported by this grant, certain rigidity results  for this action emerged, in colaborations with others, these results had been long sought after and have opened several new directions for further research.  (3) In a different direction, dynamics on homogeneous spaces with     infinite volume, and on homogeneous spaces     arising from local fields of positive characteristic were studied with several new results. There are      various geometric and number theoretical applications which motivate      the     study of these spaces.
