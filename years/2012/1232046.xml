<AbstractNarration>The research goal of this proposal is to build a comprehensive model of mechano-lipidomics and mechanocytosis by designing careful experiments and constructing solid-mechanics based models that are consistent with the classical understanding of membrane fusion mechanics.  Nano-/micro-scale liposomes and freestanding membranes will be fabricated using common drug delivery lipids and lipid extracts from cell membrane of ovarian cancer cells. Empirical investigations will include: (i) membrane-elasticity characterization, where a nano-indenter or AFM tip indents and taps the sample vesicles and freestanding membranes, and an optical microscope monitors and records the deformed profiles in-situ; and (ii) mechano-cytosis test, where a mechanical probe forces endocytosis of a liposome into a freestanding membrane or to another liposome. A comprehensive model of deformation-adhesion-endocytosis mechanics will be constructed based on (i) linear elastic approximation, (ii) visco-hyperelastic behavior of lipid membranes, (iii) nonspecific intersurface forces at liposome-membrane and liposome-liposome interfaces, (iv) thermodynamic energy balance for adhesion-fusion. Analytical solutions will first be derived by assuming axisymmetric geometries, linear elastic material responses, and square-well adhesion potential (i.e. cohesive zone approximation), in order to identify the system parameters. The more realistic but sophisticated materials laws and surface potential will then be implemented using numerical routines. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Despite progress in empirical design of drug delivery liposomes, mechanical deformation is missing from the fundamental understanding of lipid membrane fusion and endocytotic energetics.  This research will address this shortcoming by designing feasible experiments to investigate the mechanical aspects of lipid membranes and liposomes with a focus in mechano-cytosis and constructing biomechanics models, aiming to build mechano-lipidomics. The research will addres a small but critical part of mechano-lipidomics, rather than building a comprehensive model for lipidomics and drug delivery.  Outcomes from these measurements, models and analysis will be used by pharmacist to design and fabricate the next generation of drug delivery liposomes to be tested in-vivo in the future.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  Cells communicate to make our body work.  However, cells do not talk verbally, but send signaling chemicals encapsulated in small capsules called "liposomes" to one another.  Nature has a smart way to transport liposomes in and out of a cell via the cell membrane with a process known as "endocytosis".  One common example is our nerve system.  A neuron produces and stores neuro-transmitters in liposomes at the synaptic cleft. Once an electric pulse is sensed, a cascade of liposomes will be released taking the chemicals to the other side of the cleft.  The liposomes then fuse with the target cells and deliver the chemicals to trigger an action.  A better understanding of the process will lead to better drug delivery as the liposome can carry cyto-toxin and the counterpart is a cancer cell.   Liposomes are pseudo cells with walls made up of lipid bilayers, i.e. two layers of lipid molecules loosely bounded together, which is virtually identical to cell membrane (Fig.1).  When a liposome comes into close proximity of the target cell, natural intersurface forces pull them into adhesion contact.  If the chemistry matches, the two outer lipid layers fuse (or hemi-fusion in the literature), leaving a new bilayer to separate the contents of the two cells.  The partition made up of the two inner layers might fuse to provide a channel for the contents to mix.  Endocytosis action has been proposed in theory, yet experimental verification is limited. Fusion is driven by either chemical compatibility of the lipids or changing environment such as pH and ionic concentration.  The step-by-step adhesion-hemifusion-fusion is technically difficult to observe.    This project investigated the consecutive endocytotic process using mechanical methods (Fig. 2). Liposomes of desirable chemistry and dimension are fabricated by a specialized microfluidic device.  One sample liposome is left on an atomically smooth mica surface, while another is attached to the free end of an AFM (atomic force microscope) cantilever prior to apex alignment.  External load is applied to deform the two liposomes to raise the contact area and to introduce a membrane stress to facilitate fusion.  The minute applied load in nano-Newton range is measured as a function of the cantilever actuation distance in nano-scale, and the mechanical response is repeatable and consistent.  When the two liposomes are far from each other, their interaction is minimal and no force is observed. As the separation narrows, they adhere and the increasing external load continues to induce deformation in the liposome walls.  At a critical load, the force suddenly drops to a minimum due to hemifusion which is energetically favorable.  Further compression leads to even larger deformation.  A second minimum in force is then observed denoting the complete fusion of the liposomes.  Endocytosis driven by applied mechanical load is coined "mechano-cytosis" and the chemical compatibility of chosen liposomes is known as "mechano-lipodomics" in this project.  The energetic quantification of mechano-cytosis allows one to determine and predict the mechanical and adhesion properties of liposomes, the behavior of dissimilar liposomes with chemically different inner and outer lipid layers, the most efficacious lipid chemistry and size for drug delivery liposomes etc.       Last Modified: 04/01/2017       Submitted by: Kai-Tak Wan]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
