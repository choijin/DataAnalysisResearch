<AbstractNarration>Many animals must balance the need to find food against the risks of being eaten themselves, by predators, when feeding. As a result, the best food source, or host plant, for an herbivore may fluctuate, because both plant nutritional quality and the intensity of predation change in time and space. The goal of this project is to assess the preference and performance of a common butterfly, the Silver-spotted Skipper, on an array of plant species that are currently used by its caterpillars as food plants.  The researchers will construct an experimental garden of these common plants and measure differences in survival, growth, and reproduction of juvenile and adult skippers among plants over time.  These data will be used to construct an ecological model predicting food plant effects on local populations of skippers.  In addition, behavioral observations of predation on caterpillars in the field will be made to compare the activity and composition of the natural enemy communities found on different food plants. In combination, these approaches will provide a uniquely comprehensive investigation of temporal variation in plant-based and enemy-based measures of success in a common herbivore. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A better understanding of the factors determining the diets of plant-feeding insects will contribute significantly to the design of effective biological control strategies to minimize economic damage caused by insect pests.  Because the herbivore under study feeds on several invasive plants, the results of this research will be useful to land managers charged with protecting the integrity of natural communities.  Extensive educational outreach to K-5 schools in the Washington, DC, area will provide both students and teachers access to hands-on projects exposing them to ecological principles, the practice of careful observation, and the scientific method. Teachers will learn to use local insects in classroom exercises that support science curricula.</AbstractNarration>

Playing a dual role as primary consumers of vegetation and a source of prey and hosts for predators and parasites, respectively, these insects play a critical role in terrestrial ecosystems.&nbsp; While most insect herbivores have very specific diets, feeding on just one or a few closely related plant species, others are more catholic in their feeding relationships, including many important agricultural pests.&nbsp; Understanding the ecological factors that drive insect herbivores to include new plants in their diets (known as 'host shifts') has been an important goal of insect ecologists for decades. While the chemical and nutritional composition of plant foliage has been found to be an important force dictating patterns of insect-plant association, insects often experience differentilal mortality from natural enemies on alternative host plants, which can also influence their feeding choices. Because humans have been introuducing plants to new locations around the globe, there have been many instances of native insect herbivores 'adopting' new host plants into their diets. The goal of this project was to examine the ecological factors promoting these diet expansions in a native insect herbivore, the silver-spotted skipper, a widespread common butterfly that feeds on a variety of legumes in North America, and that has recently expanded its diet to include two highly invasive plants (kudzu and wisteria) and a widespread agricultural crop (soybean). Silver-spotted skipper caterpillars build characteristic leaf shelters on their host plant, facilitating tracking of the insects over time to determine their fates.</p> <p>As part of this project, we established a common garden that included three native legumes commonly fed upon by skipper caterpillars (black locust, tick-trefoil, and American hogpeanut) and the three non-native plants described above.&nbsp; Over three years (encompassing 8 full generations of the skippers), we placed more than 3000 newly hatched caterpillars on this set of 6 host plants and recorded their performance (establishment, surrvival, and growth) under natural field conditions over the entire course of development.&nbsp; We found that nutritional quality varied markedly among the plants and that female butterflies had preferences that closely matched the performance of their offspring in the absence of natural enemies. The ability of newly hatched caterpillars to construct their first shelter (i.e., establish themselves on the plant) varied among hosts and was predicted by the density and pattern of leaf hairs (physical defenses) on each plant. Once established, however, caterpillar growth was strongly related to plant nutrition (leaf nitrogen content and water), which was also fairly consistent in time. For caterpillars exposed to natural enemies (mainly arthropod predators and parasitoids), however, there was great variation among plant species and through time in the likelihood of surviving through the caterpillar stage.&nbsp; Such unpredictability in natural enemy attack rates means that some plants that are suboptimal in terms of nutrition, intermittently act as 'safe havens' from predators. This was most evident for wisteria, which was a poor quality food for the skipper caterpillars but routinely had the lowest densities of arthropod predatos and a corresponding low level of documented predation events in most generations. In the face of such unpredictability, adult butterflies thus may be expected to 'hedge their bets' by distributing their offspring among multiple host plants. These findings also add to a growing number of studies that fail to support the 'slow-growth-high-mortality' hypothesis, which was proposed to explain the functioning of sublethal plant defenses.&nbsp;</p> <p>Throughout this collaborative project, we collectively trained apporoximately two dozen student (high school and undergraduate) researchers in the basics of experimental demography, insect husbandry, data collection and management.
