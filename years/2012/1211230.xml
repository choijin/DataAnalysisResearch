<AbstractNarration>This award will support a theoretical program that will create complex general relativistic radiation-magnetohydrodynamic simulations to study black hole accretion flows.  These flows will be modeled over a wide spatial scale from the immediate vicinity of the black hole to many hundred times the radius of the black hole.  The project has several goals: (1) studying instabilities in the accretion disk, (2) exploring how strong radiation pressure alters the power and orientation of jets associated with black hole accretion, and (3) establishing the impact of radiation pressure in driving strong outflows.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The contribute to the training of undergraduate students and to ongoing efforts to incorporate research results into the curriculum at the College of Charleston.  The work is expected to have an impact on the study of black holes of a variety of masses, including those that drive active galactic nuclei.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    As part of this 3-year project funded by the NSF, we developed a state-of-the-art computational astrophysics code, with applicability to a broad range of problems and used by dozens of researchers worldwide. The specific application of the code in this project was the study of accretion onto black holes under extreme conditions. There are a number of reasons to study black hole accretion, from the central role black holes play in galaxy formation, to the violent conditions matter is subjected to as it falls in. These conditions can not be replicated in a laboratory environment; hence the need for computer-based (virtual) studies.    In our simulations, we found new evidence for various instabilities that can disrupt black hole accretion disks.  Understanding these instabilities is critical to properly interpreting the intense radiation coming from accreting black holes. Some of these instabilities had never before been seen in numerical simulations, even though they were predicted more than 40 years ago.  We also made significant progress in understanding strongly magnetized accretion flows. Strong magnetic field provide the most promising avenue for stabilizing accretion disks against the very disruptions we mentioned in the preceeding paragraph.    Finally, we made a significant advance in modeling quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs), rhythmic pulses observed in the X-ray light curves of many accreting black holes (and neutron stars). According to our model, the QPOs are attributed to natural oscillation modes of a hot, inner ring of gas near the black hole. The highest frequency QPO is attributed to the "breathing" motion of this ring. The ring expands and contracts in much the same way that human lungs do whenever a person inhales and exhales. The next highest frequency is associated with "vertical" oscillations of the ring, like a cork bobbing up and down in waves. The lowest frequency comes from the precession of the ring, as its own rotation axis traces out a conical shape in space around the rotation axis of the black hole.
