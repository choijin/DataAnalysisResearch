<AbstractNarration>This award provides renewed funding for a Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) program at the Georgia Institute of Technology (GIT).  The focus of the REU program will be chemically-mediated aquatic processes. The proposed 10-week summer internship program will provide laboratory and field-based research expertise to ten undergraduate students from across the nation each summer for three years. GIT faculty in Civil &amp; Environmental Engineering, Chemical &amp; Biomolecular Engineering, Earth &amp; Atmospheric Sciences, Chemistry &amp; Biochemistry, and Biology will form a core group of mentors and will guide undergraduates in basic and applied research on multiple phases of chemically-mediated processes, stressing interdisciplinary research as a tool to solve complex problems. Each student will complete an independent research project and will give written and oral presentations on their research. They will be encouraged to attend a professional conference after the summer program. Funding supports student stipends, travel to the site, housing and some research expenses.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual merit:  Twenty nine undergraduates engaged in summer research projects under the direction of faculty advisors and mentors at the Georgia Institute of Technology. Many were students from institutions with minimal opportunities for undergraduate engagement in authentic research experiences. The intellectual activities of the program fostered faculty-mentee relationships, research training, and educational training in scientific skills.  The central focus was a research project that each participant defined, designed, implemented, and presented in written and oral form to their colleagues. All students conducted research addressing aspects of aquatic chemical ecology and related disciplines while interacting with a large number of peers, graduate students, and faculty investigating common problems. Research questions comprised either field or laboratory studies or both. In numerous instances, students earned authorship on a published research paper or presented their research results at scientific conferences.  Broader Impacts:   This program was designed to build a community of scholars. In addition to the intellectual activities, the program include substantial career advising and also social events, including a field experience at a biological station on Sapelo Island off the Georgia Coast. These complementary activities were crafted to build a cohort of students equipped with a board set of skills for a successful career in the life sciences and also prepared to be informed and engaged participants of their local communities outside of academic settings.
