<AbstractNarration>A Pan American Advanced Studies Institute (PASI) entitled "Toward a Sustained Operational River-to-Shelf Observation &amp; Prediction System for the Amazon" will be held in Niteroi, Brazil, in 2013.  The Principal Investigator, Michael Bruno (Stevens Institute of Technology), will be joined on the organizing committee by Alberto Figueiredo (Universidade Federal Flumenense, Brazil), Belmiro Castro (Universidade de Sao Paulo, Brazil), Pedro Walfir (Universidade Federal do Para, Brazil), Christophe Proisy (Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement, French Guiana), and Charles Nittrouer (University of Washington, Seattle).  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop is intended to inform U.S. participants of the unique physical oceanographic, hydrodynamic, sediment transport, and coastal sedimentation that affect the ecosystems characteristics of the Amazon fluvial-coast-shelf region, and to build working relationships between the region?s scientists and engineers and their U.S. counterparts, as well as among scientists working in various disciplines.  The PASI will lay the groundwork for sustained scientific exchange among the faculty and students of the participating U.S. and Latin American universities and organizations.  The Amazon River system (river-to-shelf) represents an extraordinary opportunity for the scientific community to gain insights and understanding of the complex interactions among freshwater outflows, significant sediment loading, a complex coastline, and an energetic coastal ocean out to the shelf break.  The Amazon River fluvial-coast-shelf system produces unique sediment transport processes (e.g., fluid muds in the river delta) and physical oceanographic dynamics (e.g., estuary-like phenomena that extend onto the continental shelf break and produce complex open-ocean dynamics).  Lessons learned in the Amazon River system can be extrapolated to fluvial-coast-shelf systems elsewhere in the world, including those occurring in human-altered environments and those that have remained like the Amazon largely pristine.  Enhanced understanding of the Amazon system will also support local efforts to manage and preserve this vital natural resource for future generations.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  A Pan American Advanced Studies Institute (PASI) has been successfully conducted entitled "Toward a Sustained Operational River-to-Shelf Observation &amp; Prediction System for the Amazon". The workshop had several key goals, including:  inform U.S. participants of the unique processes that affect the ecosystems characteristics of the Amazon fluvial-coast-shelf region, build working relationships between the regionÆs scientists and engineers and their U.S.counterparts, as well as among scientists working in various disciplines.  lay the groundwork for sustained scientific exchange among the faculty and students of the participating U.S. and Latin American universities and organizations.    A 5-day workshop was held on the campus of the Universidade Federal Fluminense, Brazil, from 29 July to 2 August, 2013.  The workshop was attended by a total of 65 advanced graduate students and post-docs from the U.S. and from six different Latin American nations, including Brazil, French Guiana, Chile, Uruguay, Venezuela, and Argentina.  The PASI award covered the travel for 18 U.S. students and 7 non-Brazil South American students.  The rest of the students were locally funded.  The students had been selected via a competitive process that required them to submit transcripts, an essay detailing why they were interested in the PASI, and at least one letter of recommendation.  The workshop was composed of a series of lectures and working sessions. The lectures were designed to provide the students with a detailed understanding of the Amazon river to shelf system, and to provide background on ocean observing and forecasting technologies, along with examples of applications in the U.S., Europe, and elsewhere.  During the second week of the PASI, and through the generosity of our hosts at Universidade Federal Fluminense, and the Oceanographic Institute of the University of S&atilde;o Paulo (IOUSP), Brazil, we were able to provide the students with a 6-day field program from 3 August to 10 August in which they learned - some for the very first time - how to conduct field observations from an ocean research vessel and a coastal research vessel, and in which they observed the coastal ocean environment of the region guided by Brazilian and U.S. experts.  The success of the PASI - as measured by post-program web-based surveys - was very high.  Several students mentioned that they have modified their career plans as a result of the program.   In follow-up meetings to the 28 July &ndash; 10 August, 2013 PASI, the Brazilian and U.S. faculty agreed that ongoing and continuous collaboration among the faculty and students was essential to preserve and extend the significant enthusiasm and team building that had occurred at the 2013 PASI. With a focus on the original vision of the PASI &ndash; to assist in the development of a real-time measurement and prediction system for the tidal Amazon and inner shelf &ndash; the participants decided that it was essential to conduct a field trip to the area to see the region in person; to better understand the local and regional Brazilian scientific resources (people and infrastructure); and to discuss the technology challenges, including power and communications. With the great assistance of the Universidade Federal do Par&aacute;, the PASI team conducted a concentrated field program from 13 March, 2014 to 19 March, 2014 that consisted of campus visits and lectures at the main campus of the Universidade Federal do Par&aacute;, the Universidade de S&atilde;o Paulo, the Braganca campus of the Universidade Federal do Par&aacute;, and a small field facility in Macapa, as well as several land-based and boat-based field trips to the River, from Belem to the delta.   The PASI and subsequent field and university visits has resulted in a very strong, highly collaborative team of U.S. and Brazilian scientists committed to working together.  Four joint U.S.-Brazil proposals were developed and submitted to the Office of naval...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
