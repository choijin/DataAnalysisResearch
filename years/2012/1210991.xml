<AbstractNarration>This project examines various aspects of the topology of manifolds: their classification, their bundles, and their symmetries.  The project will focus on six areas.  The first is to give a systematic approach to topological equivariant rigidity, using tools from surgery theory, algebraic K-and L-theory, and the Farrell-Jones Conjecture.  The second is to study characteristics classes of matroid bundles (defined by Anderson and Davis) and to apply them to combinatorial incidence geometry.  The third area is to investigate a rigidity conjecture involving self-homotopy equivalences of 3-manifolds and its connections with high-dimensional topology.  The fourth area is to give the the classification, up to homeomorphism, of manifolds having the homotopy type of the total space of certain torus bundles over lens spaces. This is an application of the Farrell-Jones Conjecture.  The fifth area is to compute the L-groups of a free product of groups, and thereby solve the connected sum problem - when is a manifold which is homotopy equivalent to a connected sum itself a connected sum.  The last area is to study the algebraic and point-set topology of actions of p-groups on the torus from the point of view of homotopical group actions and Smith theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Geometric topology is the study of manifolds.  An n-dimensional manifold is a set of points locally modeled on n-dimensional Euclidean space.   For instance, a 2-manifold is a surface and looks like a plane near each point. Many physical phenomenon are represented by manifolds, and as such, understanding the global structure of a manifold, and what possible manifolds exist, is fundamental to the sciences, as well as to mathematics. Manifold theory connects with most areas of mathematics, as well as with physical phenomena such as cosmology, string theory, and classical and quantum mechanics.  To understand and classify manifold one uses a variety of tools including algebraic topology, bundle theory, and differential geometry.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The research supported by the grant "Geometric and Algebraic Topology" informs our knowledge of the topology and geometry of high-dimensional manifolds.  For example,  the PI settled the conjecture stating that any finite group acts freely and homologically trivially on a product of spheres, This leaves open the famous rank conjecture characterizing which groups act freely on a product of spheres.   Fuquan Fang and the PI showed that an almost flat manifold with a cyclic holonomy group bounds, exploiting interactions between topology and geometry.  Wolfgang Lueck and the PI computed the K-theory of certain crystallographic groups using a mix of algebraic topology and inputs from analysis.   This, in turn, applied to a question from differential geometry, which asks which manifolds admit a metric of positive scalar curvature.  Manifolds with positive scalar curvature resemble the surface of a ball as opposed to a flat plane, since the neighborhoods of a point have smaller area than those in Euclidean space.     The major focus of the grant-supported research, was, however, the question of which groups satisfy equivariant rigidity.   This is ongoing joint work with Frank Connolly and Qayum Khan.   For any group, one can ask whether two cocompact manifold models for the classifying space for group actions with finite isotopy are topologically the same, in which case one says the group satisfies equivariant rigidity.   The grant-supported research studied families of groups where, somewhat surprisingly, equivariant rigidity held for a subfamily, but failed for another subfamily.   This applied to give a complete analysis of involutions on tori which induce multiplication by minus one on first homology.      The grant facilitated the mentorship of several graduate students on various research topics.   It supported the writing of an expository article, and helped with the PI with organization of two summer school on Surgery and the Classification of Manfolds, one in Shilong, India in 2013 and one in Calgary, Canada in 2016.
