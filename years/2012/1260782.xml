<AbstractNarration>An observational study is an empiric investigation of the effects of a treatment, policy, intervention, or exposure that was not randomly assigned to subjects as it would be in a randomized experiment.  Observational studies are common in most fields that study people because harmful or unwanted treatments cannot be imposed on human subjects for experimental purposes.  The central difficulty in an observational study is that, because treatments were not randomly assigned, the subjects receiving different treatments may not be comparable, so differing outcomes after treatment may not be effects caused by the treatment.  If the treatment groups differ before treatment in ways that have been measured, there is an overt bias that often can be removed by adjustments, such as matching.  There often is concern that treatment groups differed before treatment in ways that were not measured, that is, concern about hidden biases.  This research project will focus on hidden biases that generally cannot be removed by adjustments and must be addressed by other means.  Prior work has shown that the design of an observational study strongly affects its sensitivity to hidden biases.  This project is comprised of four components.  The first concerns the possibility that effect modification (a treatment by covariate interaction) may under suitable circumstances be exploited to reduce sensitivity to unmeasured biases.  The second component concerns the relationship between case definition in case-control studies and sensitivity to unmeasured biases.  The third concerns clustered treatment assignment and sensitivity to unmeasured biases.  The final component concerns use of risk set matching to provide finer control of time dependent instrumental variables.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Observational studies are common in economics, education, epidemiology, medicine, public policy, and sociology.  Improved methodology for observational studies has the potential to lead to improved policies and practices of both public and private institutions.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Observational studies are common in most fields that study people, because harmful or  unwanted treatments cannot be imposed on human subjects for experimental purposes.  Methodology for observational studies has an important impact on how reliable the conclusions from observational studies are.  In our project, we have developed improved methodology for observational studies in four areas.  First, we developed a novel approach for assessing for  which groups of people is there more or less evidence for a treatment effect.  Discovering a group for which there is more evidence for a treatment effect than for the population as a whole provides evidence for a treatment effect that is less sensitive to bias from unmeasured confounding; (2) understanding which groups benefit most from a treatment helps to personalize treatments.   A problem with many methods that use the data to explore which groups are most affected by a treatment is that because they use the data to both find the groups and test for treatment effects in the groups, they suffer from a high rate of false positives.  In contrast, our approach combines exploratory analysis with a rigorous confirmatory analysis that controls the false positive rate, despite exploration and multiple testing.  The second area in observational studies that we have developed improved methodology for is case-control studies.   In a case-control study, cases of a rare outcome are compared to non-cases (called controls in the context of a case-control study) with respect to their antecedent exposure to a treatment in an effort to determine whether exposure causes some cases of the outcome.  Case-control studies sample the population in an unusual way oversampling cases, undersampling non-cases but if treatment is not randomly assigned in the population, then case-control studies may be affected by all of the biases that affect any observational study such as unmeasured confounding.  A key issue in designing a case-control study is how to define a case.  There is often a choice between a broad vs. narrow case definition.  We have developed guidelines for making this choice, showing that a narrow case definition often, but not always, reduces sensitivity to bias from unmeasured confounding.  For settings in which the best case definition is not clear a priori, we have developed an adaptive approach that uses the data at hand to choose the best case definition while properly controlling for having considered both case definitions.  The third area of our work in this project has been to develop methods that make use of clustered treatment assignments to make observational studies less sensitive to bias.  Clustered treatment assignment occurs when individuals are grouped into clusters prior to treatment and whole clusters, not individuals, are assigned to treatment or control. Clustered assignments are sometimes required because the treatment must be applied to say all children in a classroom or all radio listeners in the same media market.  In randomized trials, clustered assignments increase variance and are thought to be detrimental, although sometimes unavoidable.  This has been thought to hold for observational studies as well, but our work provides a new perspective.  Although clustered assignment increases sampling variability in observational studies, as it does in randomized experiments, it also tends to decrease sensitivity to unmeasured biases, and as the number of cluster pairs increases, the latter effect overtakes the former, dominating it when allowance is made for nontrivial biases in treatment assignment.  Our work suggests that it would be beneficial to give greater consideration to designing observational studies in which there are clustered treatment assignments.  The fourth area of our work in the project develops new methods for constructing natural experiments.  A natural experiment is a particularly compelling type of observational study in which treatment assignment, tho...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
