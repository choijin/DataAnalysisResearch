<AbstractNarration>How do politicians in Latin America achieve successful policy outcomes with oftentimes bloated and inefficient bureaucracies?  Why do some policies, like Brazil's conditional cash-transfer program Bolsa Familia, achieve success while similar programs in the same places falter?  Political Science has rigorously studied the ways in which laws are made, but has focused far less on how they are carried out, especially in the developing world.  This is a salient topic inside and outside of academia.  As recently democratized countries overcome political and economic instability, policymakers and citizens alike are increasingly concerned with the quality of public policy.  Constructing effective policy is impossible, however, without first understanding the gap between how policy is supposedly implemented, and how it is actually implemented.  This project seeks to address this lacuna through use of a novel theory, original data on presidential delegation and administrative capacity, and an in-depth examination of policy success in various Latin American countries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specifically, the project examines policy delegation decisions and policy success across 18 Latin American democracies to understand how governments increase the odds of success for their favored policies.  It argues that politicians in low capacity environments often employ "bureaucratic circumvention" for politically important legislation, bypassing existing government agencies in favor of creating new agencies, delegating policies to the military, or outsourcing.  These circumventing agents possess higher capacity or can be more easily managed, and thus increase the chances of successful policy implementation.  The project can be divided into three parts: 1) development of a formal model of bureaucratic circumvention applicable to a wide range of countries; 2) empirical tests of the determinants of circumvention with an original database of over 50,000 executive decrees from Latin America; and 3) controlled comparisons of twelve policies in Brazil, Venezuela, and Ecuador to test the effect of delegation strategy on policy success.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results should offer evidence as to how politicians can improve the provision of public services across political systems, even when faced with poorly performing bureaucracies.  Beyond the theoretical and analytical contributions of this research, two practical elements stand out: 1) the size and detail of the decree database, and 2) the valuable research experience gained by four undergraduate assistants.  The database--which will include over 50,000 Latin American executive decrees, including myriad characteristics of each policy--will be an instrumental resource for other scholars of comparative politics, public administration, and public policy.  These data will be publicly available upon completion of the project via the Dataverse Network Project.  Additionally, the project offers four undergraduate research assistants the opportunity to gain experience in collecting data, reading a codebook and coding those data, and then systematizing and interpreting the aggregated data.  In sum, this project seeks to make theoretical and empirical contributions to the understanding of comparative executive and bureaucratic politics, while offering learning opportunities for undergraduate students and providing valuable data for other scholars.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Unlike in the U.S. and much of Western Europe, politicians in the developing world are often faced with the challenge of delegating policy implementation to non-professional bureaucracies who cannot guarantee outcomes consistent with lawmakersÆ expectations.  This would seem to preclude successful public policy outcomes.  At the same time, there are many examples of well-publicized policy successes in the developing world, such as highly influential microcredit and poverty alleviation programs, and oft-duplicated conditional-cash transfer programs from Mexico.  How can this be? How do governments with weak bureaucracies achieve their policy goals if they are really as corrupt and inefficient as portrayed anecdotally?  This project argues that politicians in low-quality bureaucracies often bypass jurisdictionally appropriate agencies in favor of new agencies, out-of-jurisdiction agents such as the armed forces, or third parties via outsourcing.  It contends that in addition to gains in agency capacity, politicians are also motivated by ideological proximity to an agent as well as relative costs, all conditional upon the degree of importance of the policy.  Further, it shows that these motivations to circumvent and the agent choice itself have real consequences for policy outcomes.  Both phases of the investigation benefitted greatly from funding through the National Science FoundationÆs Dissertation Improvement Grant (NSF DIG), which allowed the construction of a database and extensive fieldwork.  The first half of the project analyzes the causes of bureaucratic circumvention.  It develops a theoretical model based on canonical delegation games, and tests the modelÆs propositions with data from Latin America.  The model holds that a decrease in a government agencyÆs capacity, an increase in ideological distance between that agency and the political principal, an increase in circumvention costs, and an increase in policy importance all increase the likelihood of politicians bypassing bureaucratic red tape.  The next part tests the theoretical propositions using the Latin American Executive Decree Database (LAEDD), a comprehensive, original dataset of delegation decisions from over 45,000 executive decrees from eleven Latin American countries, and made possible in part by the NSF.  Using nested logit modeling, the results show that policy importance has the strongest substantive effect on circumvention, while agency capacity and ideology also behave as expected.  It also finds that while agency creation and military delegation increase as existing agency capacity decreases, outsourcing is more often used in countries with high-performing bureaucracies.  The second half of the project then examines policy consequences of bypassing the bureaucracy.  It develops a simple theory of implementation success based on agency choice, and tests the consequences of agent choice on implementation success using a series of controlled comparisons.  The theory links politiciansÆ motivations for agency choice to policy outcomes, arguing that politicians favoring efficient agents over ideologically proximate ones will enjoy higher implementation quality (an expectation that does not hold in high capacity environments, since efficiency loss for privileging ideology is attenuated by better performing agencies). The next section tests the theory through six sets of controlled comparisons from Brazil, Ecuador, and Venezuela, where the control for each case is the bureaucracy and the treatment is the circumvention strategy. NSF monies permitted fieldwork in these three countries, directly covering costs in both Ecuador and Venezuela.  The controlled comparisons first show that while some politicians are motivated by gains in capacity, ideology, and cost, others confront tradeoffs, enduring losses along one dimension for gains along another.  The comparisons also show how incentives to delegate in a certain way can set the interests of the president an...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
