<AbstractNarration>A new center is to be planned named the Industry/University Cooperative Research Center (I/UCRC) for Social Technologies and Analytics. The planned I/UCRC intends to conducts research of high-end applications for accessing the Social Media data ecosystem, where Social Media refers to how users generate content, exchange information and share ideas in public and private platforms over the Internet.  Research foci of the planned center include Big Data analysis, cyberinfrastructure, mobile applications, technology and people, business intelligence and society and computing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The social media ecosystem represents a significant and growing global resource that offers a wide and varied set of new applications with potential impact spanning the private and public sector.  The planned center has the potential to build a corporate, government and university cooperative to address research challenges in this area and accelerate its growth. The planned center would engage students at all levels and train them in through its research. The effort will draw on existing university programs to engage a diverse set of participants.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The project was for a planning workshop that would result in the establishment of the Consortium for Social Technologies and Analytics (COSTA); an NSF Industry/University Cooperative Research Center consisting of 4 universities &ndash; Clemson University, University of Minnesota, New York University and University of California Irvine.  COSTA would focus on research for accessing and using social media in businesses.  Discussion with business executives indicated that they perceived positive benefits from using new modes of communication and analysis that would draw them closer to their customers.  Yet, they also revealed that they currently lacked the footing to profit from this new technologies.   The investigators attended the I/UCRC bootcamp and planning meetings.  Investigators from the four universities held bi-monthly conference calls in which plans for a workshop consisting of interested organizations and researchers was discussed as well as the design of a website and logo for COSTA.   A number of potential partners were approached with regard to participating in the multi-university consortium.  In discussion with the organizations it was found that companies were more interested in establishing a close research/collaborative relationship with a single group rather than pooling resources and belonging to a multi-university group.  Through discussion with the university partners it became evident that the proposed consortium was not a good fit for the study of social technologies given the multiplicity of interests and differences among companies and industries.  The decision was made to end the planning of a workshop and the formation of the Consortium for Social Technologies and Analytics.
