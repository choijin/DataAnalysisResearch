<AbstractNarration>In this project funded by the Chemical Synthesis Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Jin K. Cha of the Department of Chemistry at Wayne State University will explore synthetic applications of the low valent titanium-mediated cyclopropanation of esters and related cross-coupling reactions.  By building on the original discovery by Kulinkovich, Professor Cha's group developed the olefin exchange-mediated variant to broaden the scope of the Kulinkovich cyclopropanation and pave the way for mechanistically related cross-coupling reactions.  The specific goals include mechanistic studies of the key cyclopropananation reaction; low-valent titanium-mediated alkylation and cross-coupling reactions of allylic and homoallylic alcohols; and ring opening of cyclopropanols with a range of electrophiles in C-C bond forming reactions.  Included are transition metal-catalyzed ring opening reactions.  These reactions represent new uses of the Kulinkovich reagent with a broad scope and the well-defined stereochemical outcome.  Particular emphasis will be placed at high efficiency and convergence, which is made possible by segment coupling.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Professor Cha's approach lends itself to environmentally benign syntheses, which offer enabling technology to the pharmaceutical, chemical, agricultural industry, and materials science.  Additionally, this project will provide training of coworkers, from undergraduate research participants to post-doctoral, including those from groups historically underrepresented in the physical sciences.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ NSF CHE-1265843  "New Synthetic Methods Based on Titanacyclopropanes"  Cha, Jin K.  End Date: August 31, 2017     In this project which was funded by the Chemical Synthesis Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Cha and his coworkers of the Department of Chemistry at Wayne State University focused on the development of an efficient preparation of several building blocks or compounds that are frequently utilized in organic or medicinal chemistry.  The research plan made use of readily available cyclopropanols and leveraged the release in ring strain present in these starting materials for the preparation of common, useful structural motifs.     Toward environmentally benign syntheses of important building blocks or natural products, high efficiency and convergence was achieved by means of segment coupling (union of two large fragments).  One highlight was a concise total synthesis of alkaloid (&ndash;)-205B, which demonstrated the preparative power of the key synthetic methods.  Because this alkaloid and related natural products are scarce from natural sources, chemical synthesis is necessary for testing of their biological activity.     This project has provided excellent training of the coworkers, from undergraduate research participants to post-doctoral fellows, including those from groups historically underrepresented in physical science.  Organic synthesis offers enabling tools in pharmaceutical, chemical, agricultural industry, and materials science.   For example, our long-standing work in the cyclopropanation reaction paved the way for the discovery by a former Ph.D. coworker of Besifovir, a potent acyclic nucleotide phosphonate, for treatment of heptatitis B virus.  Besifovir is expected to be available on market.           Last Modified: 12/29/2017       Submitted by: Jin K Cha]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
