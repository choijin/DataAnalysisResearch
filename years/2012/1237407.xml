<AbstractNarration>Intellectual merit:  An eight-day survey of waters at the mouth of the Gulf of California will be conducted during the return transit of R/V Point Sur from Palmer Station, Antarctica, to Moss Landing, California, in April 2013.  Flow rates and transports between the Pacific Ocean and Gulf of California will be measured using closely spaced CTD observations which extend from the ocean surface to the bottom as well as from observations of currents using vessel mounted acoustic Doppler current profilers.  Similar observations will be carried out along the southern coast of Baja California in order to determine the fate of waters formed in the Gulf of California when they reach the Pacific Ocean.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These observations will complement a 20-year program of observations carried out jointly by the Universidad Autonoma de Baja California (UABC) in Ensenada, Mexico, and the Naval Postgraduate School (NPS) in Monterey, CA.  Surface waters at the mouth of the Gulf are highly productive, in part due to mixing of Gulf and Pacific waters, while subsurface waters contain very little dissolved oxygen, about 2-4 micro mole per kg.  The latter is of concern as subsurface waters which flow out of the Gulf along Baja California join the California Undercurrent and flow poleward along the West Coast of the United States, perhaps contributing to declining oxygen values in the Southern California bight.  2013 observations of water properties at the mouth of the Gulf will be compared to those obtained in 1991 to see if systematic changes of water properties are occurring with time. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts:  This collaborative research will contribute to graduate and undergraduate teaching programs at UABC and graduate programs at NPS.   Students will be involved with collection, processing, and interpretation of shipboard data.  The project will also foster continued cooperative ocean studies with Mexican oceanographers which are necessary to understand joint management of common ocean resources.  Examples  include  "dead  zones"  which  occur  when  low  oxygen  waters  flow  onto  the continental shelf and the ecological perturbations which occur when Humboldt squid move northward into California waters.   All the collected data will be submitted to the National Oceanographic Data Center (NODC) for archiving and distribution.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[        Waters within the Gulf of California are warmer in summer and colder in winter than those in the adjacent Pacific Ocean.  These temperature differences cannot be explained by air-sea fluxes alone and require an exchange of water with the Pacific Ocean.  This means that in spring the Pacific warms the Gulf and in fall the Pacific cools the Gulf.  Within the Gulf, Pacific waters are transformed by evaporation, summer heating and winter cooling, and intense tidal mixing in a narrow channel which links the Northern and Southern Gulf.  The resulting waters and flows are important, not only for understanding the productive fisheries in the Gulf, but also because the subsurface waters along the West Coast of the United States are poleward flowing equatorial waters which have been modified within or at the entrance to the Gulf.    To understand these exchanges, a 12 day research cruise aboard R/V Point Sur from Mazatlan, Mexico, to San Diego, California, was conducted in April 2013.  Shipboard observations were focused on measuring the exchange between the Gulf and Pacific Ocean as well as a survey along the coast of southern Baja California to trace the path of the flow.  Observations included vertical profiles of water properties as well as continuous shipboard measurements of upper ocean currents and surface water properties.  Participants included seven Mexican and four U.S. oceanographers.    The measured pattern of surface circulation is shown in the attached figure which shows shipboard measurements of currents in the upper 50 m superimposed on a chart of satellite measured sea surface height.  Observations indicated that a pair of counter rotating mesoscale eddies located along 22N (adjacent to the southern tip of Baja California) blocked the usual path of outflow of Gulf waters.  Instead of occurring along Baja California, outflow was observed adjacent to Sinaloa.  The outflow was about 40 km wide, had speed greater than 0.5 m/s in the upper 100 m which decreased to 0.1 m/s at a depth of 400 m.  The resulting transport was about 3 Sv (a Sv is a million cubic meters per second).  Although strong inflows were observed over the continental shelves of Sinaloa and Baja California, these were not enough to balance the outflow and the net outflow above 400 m was 1.8 Sv.  This was the first time that this pattern was observed.  It is unlikely it existed for long as mass balance requires weak inflow to the Gulf.  Also note that the observed flow pattern resulted in a loss of heat in the Gulf when a seasonal inflow of heat is needed.  Finally, the pattern of flow would make it difficult for the subsurface poleward flow along the outer coast to enter the Gulf and mixing of Gulf and Pacific waters would take place in the Pacific Ocean.
