<AbstractNarration>In this project, the Principal Investigator will employ methods from &lt;br/&gt;stable homotopy theory to provide insight into the surprising relationship &lt;br/&gt;between p-local group theory, modular representation theory and stable &lt;br/&gt;homotopy theory.  Specifically, the PI will first give a much simplified &lt;br/&gt;description of the p-local finite group model for the homotopy theory of &lt;br/&gt;fusion systems.  This shows that a p-local finite group on a finite &lt;br/&gt;p-group is equivalent to map from the classifying space into a p-complete, &lt;br/&gt;nilpotent space with a stable retract satisfying Frobenius reciprocity up &lt;br/&gt;to homotopy.  In recent work, joint with Radu Stancu, the PI has shown &lt;br/&gt;that saturated fusion systems on a finite p-group are in bijective &lt;br/&gt;correspondence with stable idempotents of the classifying space that &lt;br/&gt;satisfy Frobenius reciprocity.  The PI will extend this result to a &lt;br/&gt;bijection between p-local finite groups and idempotents that satisfy &lt;br/&gt;Frobenius reciprocity up to structured homotopies.  The crucial question &lt;br/&gt;in the field is on the existence and uniqueness of classifying spaces for &lt;br/&gt;saturated fusion systems (in the form of p-local finite groups).  Using &lt;br/&gt;results from this project, the question can be approached by refining the &lt;br/&gt;current construction of classifying spectra from being a construction up &lt;br/&gt;to homotopy to producing structured classifying spectra, and steps will be &lt;br/&gt;taken in this direction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Groups are fundamental objects in mathematics used to keep track of the &lt;br/&gt;symmetries of an object (e.g. a set or a space).  A group is said to act &lt;br/&gt;on an object if that object exhibits the symmetries encoded by the group. &lt;br/&gt;Among such objects the classifying space of a group is of special &lt;br/&gt;importance, as its homotopical properties contain information about all &lt;br/&gt;possible actions of the group on topological spaces.  A finite group can &lt;br/&gt;be characterized as the fundamental group of its classifying space --the &lt;br/&gt;set of paths in the space beginning and ending in a fixed point where two &lt;br/&gt;paths are identified if one can be continuously deformed into the other. &lt;br/&gt;For a given prime p, the p-local structure of a group can be thought of as &lt;br/&gt;the system of symmetries of the group that can be detected by actions on &lt;br/&gt;sets whose cardinality is a power of p.  This notion is made precise by &lt;br/&gt;fusion systems as introduced by Puig and developed by Broto-Levi-Oliver. &lt;br/&gt;As conjectured by Martino-Priddy, and proved by Oliver, p-localizing the &lt;br/&gt;classifying space mirrors this construction in topology.  More generally &lt;br/&gt;one can consider abstract fusion systems that do not necessarily come from &lt;br/&gt;groups and p-local finite groups are a model for the corresponding &lt;br/&gt;classifying space suggested by Broto-Levi-Oliver.  In this project the PI &lt;br/&gt;will elucidate this correspondence by providing a simpler model for &lt;br/&gt;classifying spaces of abstract fusion systems and take important steps &lt;br/&gt;toward proving the existence of classifying spaces for arbitrary fusion &lt;br/&gt;systems which is a fundamental question in the field.</AbstractNarration>
