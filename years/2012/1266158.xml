<AbstractNarration>This award provides funding to help defray the expenses of U.S. participants in the conference "Focus Program on Noncommutative Geometry and Quantum Groups" that will take place from June 3-28, 2013, at the Fields Institute in Toronto, Canada.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The subject matter of this wide-ranging conference is noncommutative geometry and related topics. One of the deepest principles in mathematics, dating back to Descartes's "La Geometrie" in 1637, is the equivalence between geometry and algebra. Geometric objects can be studied by algebraic tools, and algebra can be studied by thinking about it geometrically. Noncommutative geometry is the study of geometry when the associated algebra is noncommutative. Far from being just a generalization of conventional geometry for its own sake, noncommutative geometry is in fact forced on us by the basic principles of quantum mechanics, which require physically observable quantities to correspond to noncommuting operators on a Hilbert space. This event will explore the ramifications of such noncommutativity in a number of different contexts. The conference program provides ample opportunity for graduate students, postdocs, and other young scientists to present their work.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The award 1266158 supported a major Focus Program on Noncommutative Geometry and Quantum Groups at the Fields Institute for Mathematical Sciences in Toronto, lasting almost the whole month of June, 2013, with well over 100 participants, as well as two shorter and smaller follow-up conferences in January 2014 and March 2015, plus publication of a special issue of the scientific journal SIGMA: Symmetry, Integrability and Geometry: Methods and Applications.  The special journal issue included 20 original research papers on noncommutative geometry, many of which grew out of scientific interactions during the focus program.  The program was dedicated to Marc Rieffel, who has been one of the leading researchers in this area over the last 40 years.  Intellectual Merit:  In traditional geometry, observable quantities are represented by ordinary functions and symmetries of a system are represented by a symmetry group.  However, the principles of quantum mechanics dictate that in quantum mechanics, observable quantities do not necessarily commute and symmetries may be encoded in a "quantum group".  Thus the subject of noncommtuative geometry and quantum groups was born.  This subject has become an important focus of research over the last several years and the purpose of this Focus Program was to get together experts in all aspects of the subject.  Through intensive interactions, seminars, and short courses, new research was generated.  Some of this was published in a special journal issue.  The follow-up workshops in 2014 and 2015 concentrated on two aspects of the field: noncommutative bundles and noncommutative manifolds, in which there has been substantial progress in the last two years.   Broader Impacts:  A key element of the Focus Program and the follow-up workshops consisted of short courses intended for graduate students and postdocs.  NSF assistance was crucial in helping many students attend, and several graduate students who attended found the program to be a big help in their dissertation research.  NSF assistance also helped several early-career mathematicians to publicize their work to an international audience.
