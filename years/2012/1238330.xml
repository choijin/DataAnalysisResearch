<AbstractNarration>The proposed planning activity seeks to undertake planning of the establishment of a new Industry/University Cooperative Research Center (I/UCRC) site at the University of Chicago of the existing Center for Cloud and Autonomic Computing. The center currently involves Arizona, Florida, Mississippi State and Rutgers, and industry and government partners in the field. The University of Chicago site intends to provide additional capabilities for the center. The site intends to explore joint efforts to accelerate the understanding of infrastructure cloud computing (also known as Infrastructure-as-a-Service or IaaS cloud computing), its potential for scientific community and to transfer this understanding into industry solutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The planned site, in combination with the existing center plans to help build innovation capacity in cloud computing.   The outcomes from the center have the potential to broadly impact the public and private sectors through impact on distributed computing systems which today are critical to a range of applications crucial to science, engineering, healthcare, financial services, transportation, and command and control systems. The site plans to have a significant impact on students via mechanisms including the Google-sponsored Summer of Code Program,  the PIs involvement in Women in the Computing, Environment and Life Science organization at Argonne and development of tools for education.   &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
