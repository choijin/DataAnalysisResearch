<AbstractNarration>The Impact of Early Algebra on Students' Algebra-Readiness is a collaborative project at the University of Wisconsin and TERC, Inc. They are implementing and studying a research-based curriculum that was designed to help children in grades 3-5 prepare for learning algebra at the middle school level.  Researchers are investigating the impact of a long-term, comprehensive early algebra experience on students as they proceed from third grade to sixth grade.  Researchers are working to build a learning progression that describes how algebraic concepts develop and mature from early grades through high school.  This study helps to build our knowledge about the piece of the progression that is just prior to entering middle school where many students begin formal instruction in algebra.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Building on previous research about early algebra learning, researchers will teach a curriculum that was carefully designed to reflect what we know about learning algebraic concepts. Previous research has shown that young children from very diverse backgrounds have the ability to construct algebraic ideas such as equality, representation, generalization, and functions. Researchers are collecting data about students' algebraic knowledge as well as arithmetical knowledge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We know that the majority of students in the United States struggle with learning formal algebra.  By studying the implementation of the research-based curriculum for an extended period of time, researcher's are learning about how algebraic  ideas are connected and whether or not early  instruction on algebraic ideas will help students learn more formal ideas in middle school.</AbstractNarration>
