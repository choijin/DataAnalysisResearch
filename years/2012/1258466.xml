<AbstractNarration>The research objective of this project is to measure the long-term seismic responses of the base-isolated Christchurch Women's Hospital, located in Christchurch, New Zealand, and to use these measurements, along with computational models, to assess the relative effects of soil-foundation-structure interactions with liquefying soil, for interactions between adjacent buildings, and for interactions across the isolation interface.  Nine networked triaxial accelerometers and three displacement sensors, installed at three levels within the structure, will allow for remote monitoring of aftershock responses and rapid data processing.  The database of high fidelity measurements from this building will be combined with detailed computer simulations of the structure, isolation system, foundation, and supporting soft soil.  The project team, including researchers in structural and geotechnical engineering at the University of Canterbury, Christchurch, New Zealand, engineers from firms in New Zealand conducting geotechnical field investigations at the building site, and hospital staff, will collaborate on the deployment and remote monitoring of the instrumentation, the development and application of modern system identification techniques to the data, and the development of nonlinear numerical models to examine the processes governing the response of this structure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Vibration measurements obtained in situ from buildings during actual earthquakes are invaluable in assessing and improving the performance of earthquake protection systems.  Following the large earthquakes of 2010 and 2011, Christchurch has experienced, and continues to withstand, hundreds of earthquake aftershocks per year. This project seizes the unique opportunity to capture perishable data from the seismically-isolated Christchurch Women's Hospital, a building designed to be particularly earthquake-resistant.  While this facility is providing uninterrupted service throughout this sequence of earthquakes, some aspects of the dynamic response of this structure are unanticipated. By combining measurement and analysis, researchers will identify the aspects of this structure leading to the measured and observed motions.  These results will bear on the design of new base-isolated structures on soft soils in Christchurch, New Zealand and in other seismic regions worldwide. Knowledge gained from this project will contribute to best practices for the implementation of seismic isolation systems. Data obtained from this project will be archived and made publicly available in the NEEShub Project Warehouse (http://nees.org/warehouse).</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The major goals of this project was to determine a mechanistic explanation for the observed and measured dynamic responses of the base-isolated Christchurch Women's Hospital (NZ) to a swarm of earthquakes from 2010 to 2012.<br /><br />This projected had three primary components.<br /><br />First, under a previous NSF award, instrumentation installed in 2011-2012 resulted in a high quality data set of over two hundred aftershocks response measurements.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This data in combination with measurements from New Zealand's national seismic recording network is proving very useful in understanding how the characteristics of the behavior of this structure depends on the severity of shaking.&nbsp; Acceleration response measurements can not only tell researchers the intensity of shaking within the structure.&nbsp; These measurements, combined&nbsp; with advances in data processing methods made under this project, can be used to detect any anomalous behavior within the isolation system itself.&nbsp; The anomaly-detection method assumes almost nothing regarding the structural characteristics of the building.&nbsp; The method, called Base Shear Reconstruction (BSR) uses only Newton's second law, an estimate of the weight of each floor of the structure, and a combination of data processing methods known as Singular Spectrum Analysis and Principle Component Analysis, our method the dynamic forces transmitted through the seismic isolation system, from only two acceleration sensors.<br /><br />Second, the combination of very soft soils and seismic isolation on a concrete raft foundation (without deep piles) is a unique aspect of this structure.&nbsp; In collaboration with researchers and professionals in New Zealand we obtained detailed geotechnical information about the soil strata beneath this hospital building and incorporated that information into detailed computer models of the geotechnical setting.<br /><br />Third, a significant portion of the project involved the permanent instrumentation of this structure with many more accelerometers.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This new instrumentation system is generating data that is accessible to researchers around the world via the partners in New Zealand.&nbsp;&nbsp; This new system worked perfectly in a swarm of earthquake activity in the Cook Straight area in November and December of 2016.&nbsp; Importantly, this project has provided opportunities to develop new methods for analyzing the response of instrumented structures in order to assess the behavior and performance of seismic hazard mitigation technologies.<br /><br />In the culminating task of this project the research team combined a model for the nonlinear behavior of the isolation system, as informed from the Base Shear Recovery algorithm, with detailed computer models of the soil and the superstructure.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The model responses were simulated using input motions from recorded earthquakes from 2011-2012.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The modeled results matched the observations, validating the model and showed that the full scale behavior of the isolators was very close to the design goal, and did not display anomolous behavior.&nbsp;&nbsp; This model can be used in ongoing studies to investigate how changes in soil conditions, isolation system behavior, and structural behavior could potentially improve the performance of this structure.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 10/09/2017<br>      Modified by: Henri&nbsp;P&nbsp;Gavin</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1258466/1258466_10204623_1507570040933_ChristchurchWomensHospital1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1258466/1258466_10204623_1507570040933_ChristchurchWomensHospital1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Sensor Locations in the original instrumentation period"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1258466/1258466_10204623_1507570040933_ChristchurchWomensHospital1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Sensor Locations in the original instrumentation period"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">In 2011-2012, 18 accelerometers and 3 displacement sensors collected responses from a swarm of earthquake activity.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Duke</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Public Domain</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Henri&nbsp;P&nbsp;Gavin</div> <div class="imageTitle">Sensor Locations in the original instrumentation period</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1258466/1258466_10204623_1507569546077_CHCH-quakemapO--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1258466/1258466_10204623_1507569546077_CHCH-quakemapO--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Epicenters of the Christchurch NZ Earthquake Sequence"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1258466/1258466_10204623_1507569546077_CHCH-quakemapO--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Epicenters of the Christchurch NZ Earthquake Sequence"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">A sequence of strong earthquakes affected Christchurch NZ from 2010 to 2012.</div> <div class="imageCredit">http://www.christchurchquakemap.co.nz/</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Public Domain</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Henri&nbsp;P&nbsp;Gavin</div> <div class="imageTitle">Epicenters of the Christchurch NZ Earthquake Sequence</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1258466/1258466_10204623_1507570268485_GM_pkpk_CDF--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1258466/1258466_10204623_1507570268485_GM_pkpk_CDF--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Distribution of peak responses from the earthquake swarm."><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1258466/1258466_10204623_1507570268485_GM_pkpk_CDF--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Distribution of peak responses from the earthquake swarm."></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Cumulative distribution functions of the peaks of key response quantities: isolator displacement, structural displacement, accelerations within the isolator system, and roof accelerations.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Duke</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Public Domain</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Henri&nbsp;P&nbsp;Gavin</div> <div class="imageTitle">Distribution of peak responses from the earthquake swarm.</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1258466/1258466_10204623_1507571211906_CWH_ssid_fig57-n16--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1258466/1258466_10204623_1507571211906_CWH_ssid_fig57-n16--rgov-800width.jpg" title="The natural period of the CWH system lengthens with the peak velocity of the foundation motion"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1258466/1258466_10204623_1507571211906_CWH_ssid_fig57-n16--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="The natural period of the CWH system lengthens with the peak velocity of the foundation motion"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Processing hundreds of data records from the swarm of aftershocks on this structure enables a visualization of how the natural periods of the system lengthen with the intensity of motion.
