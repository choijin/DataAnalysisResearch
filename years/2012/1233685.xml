<AbstractNarration>The principal investigators will explore terrestrial-to-marine sediment transport using a framework in which rivers and river plumes act as a dynamically coupled system.  Laboratory experiments will separately target the hydro- and morphodynamics of the coupled system. Numerical modeling will be used to investigate sediment transport as well as topographic and stratigraphic evolution at the river mouth. Finally, model results will be scaled to the field level to explore implications for the Mississippi and Elwha river and plume systems.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Sediment transfer from rivers to the ocean is the fundamental driver of continental sedimentation with implications for carbon burial, land use management, reservoir exploration, and unraveling global climate change and Earth history from sedimentary strata.    Despite the important role that coastal rivers play globally, substantial uncertainty exists about the behavior of rivers near their mouths.  To address this knowledge gap, we proposed a suite of studies to better understand the behavior of coastal rivers and their offshore river plumes by explicitly considering their shared boundary condition at the river mouth.  We developed a numerical model to route freshwater, saltwater and sediment in coastal rivers, and tested the model against flume experiments and against analyses of data from the Mississippi and Huanghe deltas.    Intellectual Merit.  We found that coastal rivers behave differently than their upstream counter parts because they are affected by backwater from the ocean, which forces the river water to slow and deepen as it approaches the coast under typical conditions.  Within the backwater zone, which can extend hundreds of kilometers inland, rivers tend to scour into their channel beds during large floods and deposit sediment on their beds during low flows.  The location and degree of channel bed change is modified by the intrusion of saltwater into the lower river.  The alternation in erosional and depositional events during floods filters sediment export to the ocean, and may control where rivers are most likely to breach their levees and flood neighboring land.  Our models also help to explain how rivers build land through the development of delta lobes.   Overall these results are reported in ten peer-reviewed journal publications.  Broader Impacts.  Over half a billion people near river mouths and deltas, areas vulnerable to catastrophic inundation from river floods, tsunamis, hurricanes, subsidence, and global sea-level rise, all of which are extremely sensitive to small changes in land-surface elevations produced by imbalances in sediment flux.  Our results have consequences for evaluating land-building strategies, for example, on the Mississippi Delta in the wake of the Hurricane Katrina disaster and the great flood of 2011. Sediment transport in the lower reaches of rivers can also have very significant societal implications. For example, bottom sediments in the lower Duwamish estuary are highly contaminated with PCBs and other industrial contaminants. We are using our analytical and numerical models to understand how the estuary dynamics are modified by river discharge and contribute to suspension and export of contaminated sediment. This work will specifically address the question of whether or not planned remediation activities, which will cost several hundred thousand dollars, will provide solutions that are robust to expected climatic shifts in river discharge. Beyond the application of this new knowledge, this grant allowed for undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral students from diverse backgrounds to be trained in a highly interdisciplinary STEM area with both regional and global relevance.
