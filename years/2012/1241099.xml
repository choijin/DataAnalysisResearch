<AbstractNarration>The cooperative relations between animals and their symbiotic bacteria make a crucial contribution to global diversity, but there remains a major gap in our understanding of how the taxonomic diversity (number of species etc.) relates to its functional diversity (what organisms do). In this project, genetic measures of diversity will be applied to quantify the taxonomic and functional diversity of bacterial communities in fruit flies and their relatives.  A century's worth of genetic research on fruit flies makes these species a particularly amenable study system. This project will use several fly species, including an emerging agricultural pest that feeds on fruit and mushrooms, to investigate how taxonomy and function of the bacteria are coupled both to each other and to the functional diversity of the flies. The impact of these interactions on the capacity of the flies to utilize and damage fruits, their competitive interactions, and their resistance to parasites, will also be investigated.  The research will also use genomic methods to obtain an integrated understanding of how animal-bacterial interactions shape the taxonomic and functional diversity of both the animal and its microbiota.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will provide research education in biodiversity science for two postdoctoral associates and graduate and undergraduate students, and will be communicated to the general public by Science Saturday meetings, including talks and hands-on demonstrations, at the Rochester Museum and Science Center.  A photographic exhibition communicating the beauty, complexity and diversity of animal-microbial associations will be organized at Cornell University for the general public. Both these complementary initiatives have plans for traveling exhibitions, for wider dissemination of the importance of biodiversity.   The insects studied in this project include an invasive pest, the spotted-wing drosophila.  The researchers will enhance ongoing extension activity via meetings, newsletter articles, and interviews with local media to describe how the findings of this research may help to mitigate the damage of this insect to crop production and food quality.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The gut of most animals, including humans, harbors a wide diversity of microorganisms, collectively known as the microbiome.  Very little is known about whether the presence and composition of the microbiome influences the health and fitness of most animals, especially under natural conditions.  Our project investigated the composition of the gut microbiome in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster and related species of drosophilid flies, and how this influences traits of the flies.  We studied both natural populations and laboratory cultures of the Drosophila species.   The microbiome of drosophilid flies in the wild is very variable, and most of this variation cannot be explained by species or sex for both fruit-feeding and fungus-feeding species.  The abundance of most microorganisms in individual flies can be explained by the rates at which they are acquired as flies feed, and lost by passage through the gut.  These processes are described as neutral processes because the abundance of the microorganisms is not influenced by their traits (e.g. how fast they grow, whether they produce nutrients beneficial to the flies or toxins that kill other microorganisms).  The importance of neutral processes in shaping the microbiome composition probably explains why we found no simple one-to-one relationships between the presence of particular microbial species and host traits.  Nevertheless, microbiomes dominated by Bacteroidetes in fungus-feeding species were associated with heightened expression of host genes predicted to protect against "leaky gut"; and flies of fruit-feeding species with high abundance of certain Acetobacter strains had a very low lipid content, making them very susceptible to food shortages.  In summary, our studies on the microbiomes of wild flies suggest that individual flies have little control over the composition of their gut microbiome, even though some species can have important effects on the health and fitness of the fly.   In complementary laboratory studies, we found that the composition of the gut microbiome differs among different drosophilid species maintained under strictly uniform conditions.  When we transferred the microbiome of one Drosophila species into a different species, we found that the flies of the second species died prematurely.  This suggests that some microorganisms in the gut microbiome may be co-adapted with particular Drosophila species.  In the "wrong" species, beneficial microorganisms can become deleterious.  These studies reinforce our conclusions from research on wild drosophilid flies that the microbiome can strongly influence fly fitness.  This research has supported 6 postdoctoral staff, 4 technicians, 1 graduate student and 3 undergraduate research students.  In addition, it has supported two major initiatives: visual communication of the diversity of animal-microbial symbioses; and dissemination of reliable methods to identify drosophilid flies.  We designed a public exhibition "Shifting the Paradigm: Microbes as Animal Helpmates" at Cornell University to display micrographs of 12 associations, together with explanatory posters of the physics underlying the advanced microscopical methods, time-lapse video movies, and poems of Dr Tiffany Taylor created for this exhibition.  The opening event on 4th November 2014 included a public lecture by the Cornell President's Council for Cornell Women A.D. White Professor at Large, Professor Margaret McFall Ngai, followed by a reception.  The exhibition has contributed to the Cornell Sesquicentenial celebrations, was displayed at the Gordon Research Conference on Animal-Microbial Symbioses (2017), and is on permanent display both at Cornell University and the Collaborative Research Center on MetaOrganisms at the University of Kiel.  Dr Taylor's poems are now published in a poetry book for children Great Adaptations (Lake Publishing).  This exhibition has also led directly to a new undergraduate course spanning the humanities and life sciences, Topics in Media Arts, co-organized with colleagues in the Department of History of Art, Cornell University.  We have provided regular hands-on workshops on drosophilid taxonomy through the course of this project, attracting academic researchers and practitioners in insect pest management.   In parallel, co-PI Jaenike has developed and published a Guide to the Drosophilids of the Midwest and Northeast USA, in collaboration with Thomas Werner (Michigan Tech University).  The Guide was launched with an event at the University of Rochester on 12th June 2017, including a lecture by John Jaenike on Drosophila taxonomy, and is available for free online, attracting nearly 4,000 downloads from its launch in late 2017 through early 2019.
