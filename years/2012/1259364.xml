<AbstractNarration>This collaborative research project will examine the degree to which local governments improve socioeconomic well-being across the nation and whether they contribute to recovery following the recession of 2008 to 2011.  The impacts of local governments on employment growth, income growth, poverty alleviation, and other socioeconomic indicators will be investigated.  The researchers will focus their efforts on tests of three broad-ranging hypotheses:  (1) Capacity (size, administrative/fiscal resources, and policy interventions) of local governments is positively related to the well-being of the populations they serve.  (2) Capacity is related to countercyclical (proactive) local government responses to the Great Recession.   (3) Where local governments took countercyclical responses, future socioeconomic well-being improved.  Each of these hypotheses will be addressed for all local governments within county-area units across 50 states and for the county governments. Although county governments exceed federal civilian government in employment size, social scientists have all but ignored them.  A local government database constructed by the investigators will be extended for the post-recession period through the use of the Census of Governments and other secondary data.  For county governments, unique primary longitudinal data spanning 2001-2008 will be used.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will have theoretical significance across the social sciences and broad utility for communities and families across the U.S. as they face potential cuts to their local governments in the aftermath of the Great Recession.  The project will create a new bridge between political sociology and the longstanding poverty-and-place literature, a tradition addressing subnational disparities that spans sociology, geography, economics, and regional science.  The project will address fundamental social science questions about the role of government in promoting public well-being across the nation.  It will inform policies aimed at post-recession recovery.  Captured in the data are local public employment changes during the Obama stimulus-package period that will enable the researchers to measure their impact on poverty and to also assess whether place-based (locally centered) policies helped in poverty alleviation.  The project will provide education and training opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students, and it will enhance the data infrastructure for detailed studies of local governments and well-being for future research.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project was innovative for compiling information -- at the county level -- for federal, state and local government employees.  Using this information, we examined the impact of public employment on inequality and well-being before (2008) and after (2010) the Great Recession.  We show that the impact of government employment varies.  We provide no evidence that state government employment reduces inequality or enhances local well-being.  We surmise this may be the result of state governments shifting towards corrections and away from social welfare functions in recent decades.  Federal employment contributed to lower level of inequality and reduced poverty in rural counties.  Federal employment was less impactful in urban counties.  By contrast, local government employment is most influential in urban counties.  Local govenment employment (many employed in primary and secondary education) contributed to lower levels of inequality, reduced poverty ad higher median family income.  To a lesser extent, local government employment has similar impacts in rural counties.  These findings challenge the academic literature on welfare states to fully consider the decentralized and varied roles played across the federal system in the United States.  In the realm of policy debates -- and in a context in which growing inequality is fraying social cohesion -- this research offers a reminder that government programs and employment can impede and ameliorate the damage caused by inequality.
