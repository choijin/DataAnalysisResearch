<AbstractNarration>This ArcSEES proposal for the North Slope Arctic Scenarios Project (NASP) involves multiple organizations and stakeholders across the North Slope and Northwest Arctic Boroughs in partnership with UAF, NSSI, ION, and ANTHC. Faculty members, students, and a broad range of experts drawn from stakeholder communities will collaborate to explore options for sustainable development in the North. NASP employs proven and advanced approaches to engage North Slope communities in developing and analyzing scenarios visions for the future and plausible pathways - for effective strategic planning and implementation of policy. NASP develops products and applies new tools at the intersection of climate model output, information products from observing networks, and different knowledge systems to facilitate sustainable healthy communities. NASP will identify key uncertainties and indicator variables for specific scenarios (i) translating them into guidance for optimization of Arctic observing systems, and (ii) synthesizing scenarios-derived findings, variables and spatially explicit scenarios and climate model projections using the NSSI geospatial data framework for stakeholder planning. The project explicitly fosters the emergence of communities of practice (CoPs), engages teachers and students at the secondary and tertiary level, and generates scientific deliverables that contribute to improved understanding and observations of Arctic change.</AbstractNarration>

In times of rapid change scenarios have been shown to help with strategic planning, adaptation, and problem-solving at the community level. Figure 1 details the process &ndash; from beginning with identification and deliberation over the factors essential to community resilience through to the development of indictors to track a community&rsquo;s path into the future. Working with the ideas and deliberations of over fifty participants in three workshops during 2015 - 2016, the research team developed a series of scenarios for community health and sustainability by 2040. Figures 2 and 3 demonstrate participant affiliations and expertise. In particular, three scenario outcomes were produced that are plausible and internally consistent. Figure 4 is the most robust scenario and shows the Key Factors and their Future Projections produced and groundtruthed by participants. Only one particular future will come to be and it may be different from those produced. However, as shown in past studies, scenarios analysis can aid people and organizations in better preparing for any one future by asking &ldquo;what if&rdquo; and considering what in a community matters most to carry into the future. This is a proactive approach to adaptation where local-scale actors can strategize how to best meet possible challenges rather than passively adapt to whatever happens.</p> <p>The results of the Northern Alaska Scenarios Project demonstrate the core values and key characteristics Arctic Alaska residents find significant to determine community resilience. The key factors, future projections, and scenarios of the project can help guide community action and policy. Potential social and environmental hazards can be identified via indicator tracking over time, based on the knowledge and data collected from the workshops. &nbsp;A few next steps would be to expand the indicators being identified and collected, in particular filling gaps where community members recognize an important trend but there is not yet a monitoring process in place; to create a holistic community resilience dashboard specific to Arctic Alaska needs; and to engage other locations in Alaska in similar scenarios workshops to look for shared concerns and strategies across regions.</p> <p>The project&rsquo;s<em><span style="font-family: Times;"> intellectual merit </span></em>in advancing understanding within its own field and across other fields is significant. There was no principal discipline for this project, it was truly multi-disciplinary. For example, four successful PhD degrees resulted, in part, from this project. They were in Cross-Cultural Studies, Communication, Geography, and Natural Resources Management. By participating in this project these students will carry the value of futures thinking, Indigenous and local knowledge, and interdisciplinarity into their own teaching and research. In addition, studies of Indigenous well-being don't generally include politics in terms of holistic health evaluations but our findings indicate this needs to be accounted for &ndash; fate control matters to well-being. Our project contributed directly to Arctic Studies, as a field, in several ways (1) except for the scenarios framework itself, the project was a co-production of knowledge with North Slope and Northwest Arctic Borough residents where the researchers worked at the direction of our participants on the key drivers of community health and sustainability, the projected futures of these drivers, and what a future might look like in their region; (2) it tested the use of scenarios as a way to enhance social learning in rural, primarily Indigenous locations experiencing uncertain futures and found the process significant for participants and for research outcomes; (3) it generally confirmed, but also nuanced and added to the small number of evidence-based findings about community resilience in the Arctic.</p> <p>The <em><span style="font-family: Times;">broader impacts</span></em> of this work that benefit society are tied to the method that is discussed above. The two boroughs in Arctic Alaska must make decisions about an uncertain future with incomplete information. In a relatively short time, they need to think ahead in rapidly changing complex environments and make crucial decisions to ensure the success of their communities in the absence of complete information about what will happen in the coming decades. The survey data collected demonstrate critical elements to producing civic communication (a foundation of policy action) were present in our workshops: the production new knowledge, shared deliberation of and understanding about this knowledge, enhanced trust, and ultimately, a shift in perspective on community resilience. Such a process is vital in regions of the Arctic where decisions must be made often among groups who may not fully trust one another or the knowledges presented. Ad hoc or spotty adaptation has often been the case in rural arctic communities. Such planning infrequently captures the full spectrum of factors regional residents consider vital, and holistically interlinked, to healthy sustainable places to live. The main resilience concepts of adaptation and transformation are key in envisioning future states as well as integral in the strategic planning that is to occur after the scenarios development process is over.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 11/29/2017<br>      Modified by: Amy&nbsp;L&nbsp;Lovecraft</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1263850/1263850_10280291_1511998610868_NASP_ExecSummary_Figure1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1263850/1263850_10280291_1511998610868_NASP_ExecSummary_Figure1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 1: Summary of NASP project activities, with schematic representation of examples of some of the main products generated by the project."><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1263850/1263850_10280291_1511998610868_NASP_ExecSummary_Figure1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 1: Summary of NASP project activities, with schematic representation of examples of some of the main products generated by the project."></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Figure 1: Summary of NASP project activities, with schematic representation of examples of some of the main products generated by the project.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Dr. Hajo Eicken</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Creative Commons</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Amy&nbsp;L&nbsp;Lovecraft</div> <div class="imageTitle">Figure 1: Summary of NASP project activities, with schematic representation of examples of some of the main products generated by the project.</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1263850/1263850_10280291_1512003432544_NASP_Figure2--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1263850/1263850_10280291_1512003432544_NASP_Figure2--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 2: NASP participants reported affiliations"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1263850/1263850_10280291_1512003432544_NASP_Figure2--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 2: NASP participants reported affiliations"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Figure 2: NASP participants reported affiliations</div> <div class="imageCredit">Dr. Berill Blair</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Amy&nbsp;L&nbsp;Lovecraft</div> <div class="imageTitle">Figure 2: NASP participants reported affiliations</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1263850/1263850_10280291_1512003577060_NASP_Fig3Expertise--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1263850/1263850_10280291_1512003577060_NASP_Fig3Expertise--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 3: NASP participants reported expertise across arctic community sectors"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1263850/1263850_10280291_1512003577060_NASP_Fig3Expertise--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 3: NASP participants reported expertise across arctic community sectors"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Figure 3: NASP participants reported expertise across arctic community sectors</div> <div class="imageCredit">Dr. Berill Blair</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Creative Commons</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Amy&nbsp;L&nbsp;Lovecraft</div> <div class="imageTitle">Figure 3: NASP participants reported expertise across arctic community sectors</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1263850/1263850_10280291_1512004966556_NASP_Figure4--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1263850/1263850_10280291_1512004966556_NASP_Figure4--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 4: Most Robust Future of Key Factors and their Future Projections"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1263850/1263850_10280291_1512004966556_NASP_Figure4--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 4: Most Robust Future of Key Factors and their Future Projections"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Figure 4: Most Robust Future of Key Factors and their Future Projections</div> <div class="imageCredit">Dr. Marc Mueller-Stoffels</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Amy&nbsp;L&nbsp;Lovecraft</div> <div class="imageTitle">Figure 4: Most Robust Future of Key Factors and their Future Projections</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>

The results of the Northern Alaska Scenarios Project demonstrate the core values and key characteristics Arctic Alaska residents find significant to determine community resilience. The key factors, future projections, and scenarios of the project can help guide community action and policy. Potential social and environmental hazards can be identified via indicator tracking over time, based on the knowledge and data collected from the workshops.  A few next steps would be to expand the indicators being identified and collected, in particular filling gaps where community members recognize an important trend but there is not yet a monitoring process in place; to create a holistic community resilience dashboard specific to Arctic Alaska needs; and to engage other locations in Alaska in similar scenarios workshops to look for shared concerns and strategies across regions.  The project?s intellectual merit in advancing understanding within its own field and across other fields is significant. There was no principal discipline for this project, it was truly multi-disciplinary. For example, four successful PhD degrees resulted, in part, from this project. They were in Cross-Cultural Studies, Communication, Geography, and Natural Resources Management. By participating in this project these students will carry the value of futures thinking, Indigenous and local knowledge, and interdisciplinarity into their own teaching and research. In addition, studies of Indigenous well-being don't generally include politics in terms of holistic health evaluations but our findings indicate this needs to be accounted for &ndash; fate control matters to well-being. Our project contributed directly to Arctic Studies, as a field, in several ways (1) except for the scenarios framework itself, the project was a co-production of knowledge with North Slope and Northwest Arctic Borough residents where the researchers worked at the direction of our participants on the key drivers of community health and sustainability, the projected futures of these drivers, and what a future might look like in their region; (2) it tested the use of scenarios as a way to enhance social learning in rural, primarily Indigenous locations experiencing uncertain futures and found the process significant for participants and for research outcomes; (3) it generally confirmed, but also nuanced and added to the small number of evidence-based findings about community resilience in the Arctic.  The broader impacts of this work that benefit society are tied to the method that is discussed above. The two boroughs in Arctic Alaska must make decisions about an uncertain future with incomplete information. In a relatively short time, they need to think ahead in rapidly changing complex environments and make crucial decisions to ensure the success of their communities in the absence of complete information about what will happen in the coming decades. The survey data collected demonstrate critical elements to producing civic communication (a foundation of policy action) were present in our workshops: the production new knowledge, shared deliberation of and understanding about this knowledge, enhanced trust, and ultimately, a shift in perspective on community resilience. Such a process is vital in regions of the Arctic where decisions must be made often among groups who may not fully trust one another or the knowledges presented. Ad hoc or spotty adaptation has often been the case in rural arctic communities. Such planning infrequently captures the full spectrum of factors regional residents consider vital, and holistically interlinked, to healthy sustainable places to live. The main resilience concepts of adaptation and transformation are key in envisioning future states as well as integral in the strategic planning that is to occur after the scenarios development process is over.
