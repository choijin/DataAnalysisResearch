<AbstractNarration>For the past three years, students involved in the Molecular Genetics course have collaborated with students from either the Developmental Biology or Diseases of the Nervous System courses to conduct a research-based, multi-week project using microarrays to measure changes in gene expression in chicken embryos or neurons following chemical exposure. Chicken microarrays were obtained from and scanned by the Genome Consortium for Active Teaching (GCAT), a project geared towards motivating undergraduate research, formerly sponsored by the Howard Hughes Medical Institute. To continue the cross-course collaboration and give students access to newer techniques, the current project switches to an alternative, more current technology, PCR-based arrays, and adds electrophysiology and qPCR to enable follow-up confirmatory studies and extend student learning. This effort has three foci: 1) redesign of lab activities to incorporate the use of PCR arrays, electrophysiology, and other molecular techniques to study altered gene expression levels, 2) inclusion of faculty at neighboring institutions to reach additional first generation and minority students, and 3) dissemination of lab protocols to other institutions as a viable methodology for teaching development, neuroscience, and molecular biology in college lab courses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The initial project increased the learning gains of students across the biology sub-disciplines by engaging them in the process of discovery. Participating students in the current courses are gaining skills in experimental design, collaborative research, use of multiple technology platforms, and data presentation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: At the national level a large number of institutions that relied on the GCAT program are now seeking to fill the gap left by the termination of that resource. The new approaches being developed by this project offer important alternative strategies to the GCAT-user community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is being jointly funded by the Directorate for Biological Sciences and the Directorate for Education and Human Resources, Division of Undergraduate Education as part of their efforts toward support of Vision and Change in Undergraduate Biology Education</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Modern biology requires the use of a wide variety of experimental approaches to work toward answers to complex scientific questions.&nbsp; The BioLEAD project was developed to address the question of how best to prepare undergraduate students to enter the biological sciences workforce.&nbsp; At the liberal arts college where we teach, students can choose from several majors that allow them to study subfields of biology more deeply than they might in a general &ldquo;biology&rdquo; major, including our own specialties of Genetic Engineering (Molecular Biology) and Neuroscience.&nbsp; We have observed that while students are successful in mastering the factual content and research approaches that they view as central to these subfields, they frequently fail to make connections among them or to recognize the need to collaborate with other scientists to utilize the full range of available experimental approaches.&nbsp; We began a cross-course collaboration with our junior and senior level undergraduates enrolled in a Molecular Genetics course (taught by KJ Karnas) and either an upper level Neuroscience or Developmental Biology course (taught by AJ Etttinger) by participating in an existing grant-funded program based at Davidson College to bring a particular research method, microarrays, into undergraduate teaching labs.&nbsp; We then applied for the NSF INCLUDES grant program to expand this collaboration to include new technologies (PCR arrays and automated electrophysiology) with more students at our institution (independent research students during the academic years and summers as well as students enrolled in courses) and at neighboring institutions (via shared access to our equipment and experimental protocols).&nbsp;</p> <p>Cedar Crest College is a women&rsquo;s college and enrolls a substantial percentage of first generation college students and students from socioeconomically disadvantaged populations.&nbsp; Therefore, our project had the potential to encourage members of these underrepresented groups to persist and succeed in science, a goal which previous work has demonstrated to be supported via meaningful research experiences during undergraduate training.&nbsp; The research focus of our project is investigating herbal remedies, primarily <em>Ginkgo biloba, </em>and how they could prevent damage from stroke.&nbsp; Stroke is a major human health concern as a leading cause of death and disability.&nbsp; Current treatment is limited to a single medication, TPA, that must be given within 3 hours of the stroke to have an effect; healthcare providers also focus on stroke prevention via controlling cardiovascular health.&nbsp; A stroke can also be called a &ldquo;brain attack,&rdquo; as damage occurs in the brain immediately after a stroke from the loss of oxygen, and can expand over a period of days or weeks via cell death mechanisms that can spread from one dying cell to its neighbors.&nbsp; Herbal remedies used before a stroke occurs or immediately after a stroke may be able to prevent some of that damage.&nbsp; In our labs, students work with chicken cells, a model system that allows us to cause cell death using the same molecular pathways as strokes and try to interfere in that death with a herbal remedy.&nbsp; Our students have confirmed that <em>Ginkgo biloba</em> can enhance cell survival after a stroke-inducing treatment, and have used our PCR array instrumentation to study the molecular pathways that allow it to do so.&nbsp; Experiments using our automated electrophysiology instrument have allowed our students to learn this important research technique and begin to test whether herbal remedies can affect the electrical properties of cells.&nbsp;</p> <p>Over the funding period, students participated in grant-related activities by enrolling in the upper level courses that had initially inspired our grant proposal, by participating in our summer internship program, and by conducting independent research on the related questions during the academic year.&nbsp; Students from one neighboring institution (Moravian College) traveled to Cedar Crest to use both the automated electrophysiology and PCR array instrumentation, and a workshop was held for students and faculty attending a regional Neuroscience conference hosted by Cedar Crest that allowed them to try automated electrophysiology.&nbsp; Our students have presented their research results at on-campus (6), regional (10), state-wide (5), and national (4) scientific conferences, enhancing their public speaking abilities and improving their confidence in their scientific skills, both of which should increase the likelihood that they will continue to further scientific training or join the scientific workforce.</p> <p><em>&nbsp;</em></p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 08/30/2017<br>      Modified by: Kimberly&nbsp;J&nbsp;Karnas</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1245526/1245526_10251936_1504121945526_Studentswithrotorgene--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1245526/1245526_10251936_1504121945526_Studentswithrotorgene--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Students Using the Rotor Gene Instrument"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1245526/1245526_10251936_1504121945526_Studentswithrotorgene--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Students Using the Rotor Gene Instrument"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Two students, one enrolled in Molecular Genetics II and one enrolled in Diseases of the Nervous System, use the Rotor Gene instrument (Qiagen) to perform PCR Array analysis during a cross-course research collaboration.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Cedar Crest College</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Audrey&nbsp;J&nbsp;Ettinger</div> <div class="imageTitle">Students Using the Rotor Gene Instrument</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1245526/1245526_10251936_1504122191426_Studentswithprizeposter--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1245526/1245526_10251936_1504122191426_Studentswithprizeposter--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Award-Winning Health and Wellness Presentation"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1245526/1245526_10251936_1504122191426_Studentswithprizeposter--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Award-Winning Health and Wellness Presentation"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Students enrolled in Molecular Genetics II or Developmental Biology prepared a poster describing their cross-course research collaboration.
