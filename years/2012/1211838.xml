<AbstractNarration>This collaborative program will develop and implement a new technique for measuring the growth of dark matter structure from galaxy clustering. While most techniques that use galaxy clustering to constrain cosmological parameters focus on measurements at the largest scales, the investigators aim to use clustering at the smallest scales, making full use of the information available in the data with the goal of developing a new cosmological probe based on the relationship between galaxies and dark matter halos that can be applied to existing data and future surveys.  This approach could develop into a leading probe of dark energy and other cosmological parameters with the next generation of photometric surveys.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of the work include training of graduate students, release of computer code to the community, and outreach via public lectures.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   Intellectual Merit: This project demonstrated that robust cosmological constraints can be obtained using the spatial distribution of galaxies on small scales. Our approach uses non-linear galaxy clustering and the number of galaxies within massive clusters. At small scales, the complicated physics of galaxy formation can influence the galaxy distribution, even if the underlying dark matter distribution is the same. We tested our model with simulations of galaxy formation that used extreme physics, well beyond that expected in the real universe, to produce mock universes that are well outside of observations. Regardless of the physics used, our approach was able to isolate the connection between galaxies and the underlying dark matter, and recover the correct cosmology.   Our project additionally performed a wide range of large cosmological simulations, to measure and characterize the sensitivity of cosmological observables to the underlying physical parameters. Raw and processed data from these simulations was provided to the broader community. Our work further developed a cutting edge technique for finding and characterizing galaxy clusters, using the distribution galaxies on a well-defined color sequence.  Catalogs of galaxy clusters based on data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey were presented and made publically avialable.  These can be used for a range of studies in cosmology and galaxy formation.  This methodology was developed further to establish a new technique for identifying a clean catalog of red galaxies with well-developed photometric redshifts, that can be determined from imaging data alone.  Catalogs constructed with this method are now being used for core cosmology analyses of the Dark Energy Survey. Broader Impacts: This project was the primary dissertation project of a female graduate student, who was trained in cutting edge computational and statistical techniques as well as in modern galaxy formation and cosmology research.  The project provided additional training for postdoctoral fellows, graduate students, and undergraduates.  We also publicly released cosmological simulation data that has broad use for other scientific studies.  The PI's work in this field was featured on the Science Channel and the BBC, thus bringing new results about our understanding of the universe to broad audiences.
