<AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit &lt;br/&gt;American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology's outreach initiative named Hands-on Outreach to Promote Engagement in Science (HOPES) will promote and facilitate the establishment of partnerships between biochemistry and molecular biology faculty and science teachers from K-12 schools. The HOPES project will provide support for the creation and implementation of hands-on science learning activities. The workshop participants will be provided with the opportunity to meet potential collaborators and apply for funding that will support the purchase of materials for use in the K-12 classrooms.  The workshop will be summarized into three parts, with each one having a specific goal.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;HOPES initiative began in 2011 and resulted in 44 proposals of new or developing partnerships between college/university faculty and K-12 teachers.  In addition, the workshops have the potential to impact science learning for many students who may not have the opportunity to experience quality instruction and experiences in STEM fields.  The workshop's target audience is K-12 science classrooms with a high percentage of underrepresented minority students.  The activities that develop from these workshops and seed grants will have a significant impact on science interest of students from underrepresented groups.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In 2011 the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology (ASBMB) piloted a project geared at bringing K-12 and post-secondary educators together in conversation about science education.  The initial program was a workshop conducted during the Experimental Biology (EB) annual meeting in Washington, DC.  During the three hours workshop, descriptions of science outreach projects available in the community were presented, and educators were given opportunities to network and to bounce ideas off of each other.  Following the workshop, the participants were invited to submit proposals for up to $2000 of funding to support classroom science activities developed through new partnerships; the idea was to develop projects that engage K-12 students in inquiry-based classroom projects, that fostered learning through discovery.  Ten proposals were funded in the first year.  In 2012, the workshop was conducted at the EB meeting in San Diego, CA, and six proposals were funded; In 2013, the workshop was conducted at the EB meeting in Boston, MA, and eleven proposals were funded; in 2014, the workshop was conducted at the EB meeting in San Diego, CA, and five proposals were funded (the outcomes of the first 4 years of this project can be viewed at the ASBMB-HOPES website - [http://www.asbmb.org/HOPES_Recipients/].  The first four years of this program has resulted in 27 partnerships in 22 cities across the USA, with over 5,000 K-12 students having been impacted.  Many of the K-12 schools were public, with many students from groups historically underrepresented in STEM or from homes with lower socio-ecomonic backgrounds.  And many were students who represent the first in their families to aspire to attend college.  Because of the success of the HOPES program, the ASBMB Council committed to make this Society a leader in outreach programs.  The Society now has a permanent Public Outreach Committee that oversees several outreach programs [http://www.asbmb.org/Outreach/].  In addition, funds have been committed to continue the support of newly developed educational partnerships via the HOPES seed grant program [in 2015, the workshop was conducted at the EB meeting in Boston, MA, with seed grant awards to be made during summer].  The long-term goals for this project are: (1) to have the HOPES workshop conducted in many cities throughout the USA, (2) to secure funding to continue this program in perpetuity, and (3) to have an impact on the diversification of STEM fields.
