<AbstractNarration>This grant is providing logistical support for the 2012 Tri-Agency Climate Change Education Principal Investigators Meeting, held April 17-20,2012 at the Sheraton National Hotel. The meeting is attended by representatives of more than 120 separate projects funded by NSF, NASA, and NOAA climate education-related programs. Grant funds are being used to develop the meeting registration web site and rent audio-visual equipment and other materials as required by the meeting agenda. The conference has a strong focus on integration of research in the climate sciences and the learning sciences, in order to strengthen educational practices in formal and informal learning environments, as well as improve the acquisition of knowledge about the complex, interdisciplinary topic of climate by learners of all ages. A major goal of this jointly sponsored conference is to improve coordination, cohesion, and synergy among the grantees, in order to foster greater efficiency and impact. Development of a common framework for program evaluation related to climate change education, which directly addresses priorities articulated in the 2012 NSTC Co-STEM report "Coordinating Federal Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) Education Investments: Progress Report", is another goal of the conference.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Climate Change Education (CCE) is a Presidential priority initiative within the current administration.  Over the past few years, NSF, NASA, and NOAA have dramatically increased their investments in projects that focus on increasing public understanding of climate science and improving the quality and effectiveness of climate change education in formal and informal learning environments.  The Institute for Global Environmental Strategies (IGES) supported a Tri-Agency Climate Change Education Conference that was held April 17-20, 2012, at the Sheraton National Hotel, 900 S. Orme Street, Arlington, VA.  The conference was attended by over 200 participants representing projects supported by NSF's Climate Change Education (CCE) and Climate Change Education Partnership (CCEP) programs, NASA's Global Climate Change Education (GCCE) and Innovations in Climate Education (NICE) programs, and NOAA's Environmental Literacy Grants (ELG) program, as well as other relevant projects funded through core programs at these agencies.  The conference brought together representatives of these projects in order to minimize duplication of effort, foster synergy among the different projects, leverage existing resources, develop common approaches to program evaluation, and facilitate communication between the growing community of scientists and educators engaged in climate change education. As a result of the conference, sessions on climate change education were identified and proposed for the 2012 American Geophysical Union (AGU) conference.  The intellectual merit of this project related to its focus on integrating research in the climate sciences and the learning sciences, in order to strengthen educational practices in formal and informal learning environments, as well as improve the acquisition of knowledge about the complex, interdisciplinary topic of climate by learners of all ages.    The broader impacts of this project were improved coordination, cohesion, and synergy among three different agencies and their grantees, in order to yield greater efficiency and impact. The conference also provided a venue for a Tri-Agency Common Evaluation Framework Working Group to work together on a common framework for program evaluation related to climate change education.  This directly addressed priorities identified in the "Coordinating Federal Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) Education Investments: Progress Report" produced by the National Science and Technology Council Committee on STEM Education (2012).  The meeting was organized by a planning committee comprised of representatives from the three sponsoring agencies. The meeting focused on three main themes: using data and technology to educate about climate change and its impacts, leveraging insights from the learning sciences to improve educational strategies, and updates on the current science of climate change.  The program included presentations by invited keynote speakers, hands-on training focused on specific issues and strategies to improve the utility and impact of resources being developed by the projects, and sharing of the approaches, insights, and resources being investigated and developed by individual projects, through poster sessions and share-a-thons.  The conference agenda and other information is available at:  https://nice.larc.nasa.gov/tri_pi/  IGES provided support to NSF for the conference and also participated in the conference and represented the results of NSF, NASA, and NOAA funded efforts to develop a variety of climate change education resources for the Earth System Science Education Alliance (ESSEA) program.  IGES developed and presented a workshop for conference participants on "Looking for Liftoff: Strategies for Widespread Dissemination and Scale-up of Effective Practices in Climate Change Education" (T. Schwerin, IGES; N. Brickhouse, University of Delaware; and H. Davis, Technology for Learning).       Last Modified: 06/18/2013       Submitted ...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
