<AbstractNarration>In this project funded by the Chemistry Division and the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities of the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences, Professors Lisa McElwee-White and Tim Anderson of the University of Florida will work with Dr. Gary S. Silverman of Arkema Inc. on a vertically integrated approach to developing chemistries for cost-effective and scalable chemical vapor deposition of tungsten oxide injection layers for organic optoelectronic devices.  The researchers use mechanism-based precursor design accompanied by computational chemistry tools to evaluate potential precursors before synthesis.  Synthesis of the precursors is followed by a rapid screening process that sends only the most promising precursors to the film demonstration step. Aalternative precursor delivery systems designed for all molecules independent of volatility are also considered, thus including the full range of possible precursors.  Close collaboration with industry will facilitate process development and optimization including reactor modeling, thus increasing the likelihood of successful technology transfer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project brings together collaborators with complementary chemistry, chemical engineering, materials and industrial process development expertise to address a critical problem in the manufacture of organic optoelectronic devices.  The target application is OLED devices for general illumination, which have the potential for significant energy savings.  Through working on an interdisciplinary project involving academic-industrial collaboration, students will gain exposure to team-based training and problem solving skills that reach outside their own disciplines of graduate study.  Six-month internships at the Arkema site will give students exposure to industrial practice that will broaden their perspectives beyond academic research.  In addition, participating faculty will have the opportunity to integrate their added insight from industrial collaboration into their courses.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The performance of organic electronic devices such as the organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs) used in lighting and television displays relies in part on the extremely small thicknesses of the active layers.  As these layers become thinner and thinner, new materials and manufacturing techniques become necessary.  Several interesting methods such as chemical vapor deposition (CVD), involve synthesizing materials in place by running chemical reactions on the device during manufacturing.  In this NSF-funded GOALI project in collaboration with Arkema, Inc., we developed new reactions for depositing hole injection layers for OLED devices.  Hole injection layers are necessary for efficient migration of the electrons and holes (negative and positive charges) during operation of the OLED.     Tungsten oxide (WOx) is a candidate hole injection layer material.  Previously reported co-reactant systems for deposition of WOx employed volatile tungsten compounds such as WF6 or W(CO)6 with water or alcohols as the oxygen source.  While cost-effective, these systems generally require high deposition temperatures (&gt; 400 &deg;C), result in the production of corrosive byproducts, and lead to the incorporation of undesirable impurities in the films that affect their color.  We have been developing chemical vapor deposition methods to deposit WOx films from tungsten oxo alkoxide complexes at low temperatures as an alternative.     Tungsten oxo alkoxide complexes bearing partially fluorinated ligands proved to be the best precursor compounds.  As an example, we reported CVD growth of WOx materials from WO(OC(CH3)2CF3)3(tbac) at temperatures as low as 150 &deg;C.  The films grown at low temperatures had a smooth surface, which makes them suitable for incorporation into the layered OLED materials.  Materials grown from the tungsten oxo alkoxide complexes had suitable color and work function for the OLED application.  Films grown at high temperatures (&gt; 400 &deg;C) consisted of nanorod or nanowire structures with possible applications in sensor devices.
