<AbstractNarration>Since the 1980s, all states have passed "drug-free zone" laws providing added penalties for offenders charged with distributing, or possessing with the intent to distribute, any controlled substance in public locations surrounding schools, parks, and public housing.  These laws are intended to keep illicit substances out of areas where children congregate, protect children from exposure to drug use, and foster safe public environments.  Yet little is known about whether these laws have accomplished their intended objectives, under what conditions legal decision-makers patrol these zones and apply these charges, how the criminalization of public spaces may disparately affect minorities and the urban poor, and whether offenders consider the prohibitive "costs" of offending in drug-free zones.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Employing a sample of 19,063 felony drug cases closed between 2001 and 2009 in Fulton County (Atlanta), Georgia, this research evaluates the conditions under which drug-free zone charges are included in felony drug case processing.  Quantitative spatial analyses (using mapping software) will determine whether the proportion of hyper-criminalized space is greater in inner-city communities than in more suburban locales, and will explore sentencing outcomes by defendant race and racial composition of the offense neighborhoods. Additionally, interviews with police officers and prosecutors will examine whether drug-free zone charges are used conscientiously to incapacitate the most dangerous dealers, provide leverage in plea negotiations, and/or make communities and schools safer.  Finally, interviews with active dealers will probe the extent to which the perceived costs of selling in a drug-free zone may be offset by apparent benefits, such as improved foot traffic or access to prospective customers.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This interdisciplinary, mixed methods study will extend our understanding of the collateral consequences of potentially discriminatory drug enforcement policy, thereby providing policymakers with insights regarding the efficacy of drug-free zone penalties and related place-based crime prevention policies.</AbstractNarration>

Nearly one-third of all physical space in the county under study constitutes a DFZ, but it is not evenly distributed; a considerably larger proportion of public space is constituted by a DFZ in both high poverty (51.5%) and extreme poverty (63.6%) neighborhoods when compared to low poverty regions (24.8%). While we find no statistically significant differences in the distribution of DFZs across tracts of varied racial composition, distinguishing by Rural-Urban Commuting Area codes shows that DFZs are predominantly located in the most densely populated urban neighborhoods. In particular, more than half (56.4%) of all urban census tracts and 46.4% of the land in inner suburban tracts is characterized as a DFZ, whereas only 15.1% of outer suburban tracts are demarcated by DFZs.

Even so, significant differences in the application of DFZ charges are apparent by race and neighborhood socioeconomic conditions, especially at the time of arrest. Moreover, there is considerable slippage in the application of these charges based on the location of drug arrests; only 83.7% of offenders arrested on any DFZ charge are physically present in a DFZ at the time, suggesting that nearly one-fifth are erroneously subject to the charge. Proportionately more offenders are incorrectly charged with type-specific DFZ offenses wherein three quarters (76.3%) of those charged with a residential zone offense are actually in a residential zone at the time and less than half of those charged with a commercial DFZ offense (45.8%) or a school DFZ offense (49.4%) are physically present in the specific associated zone at the time of arrest. </span></p> <p><span>&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Prosecutors and police officers are aware of the existence of DFZs, but their experience with these charges is limited and they largely believe the laws are ineffective.

It is not surprising that police largely ignore DFZs, as the current state of drug markets exist virtually, through meetings set through internet or cell phones, rather than large open-air markets.
