<AbstractNarration>The goal of the proposed research is to better understand how changes in global emissions and climate are affecting the distribution, lifetime, and bioavailability of selected persistent organic pollutants (POPs) in the Arctic Ocean. POPs travel globally in air and water, are often highly bioaccumulative, and have the ability to cycle among environmental media enabling long-range transport to remote regions such as the Arctic. The investigators will use a modeling approach to provide insight into the relative importance of changing primary anthropogenic emissions and oceanic biogeochemical processes in controlling the fate and lifetime of POPs in the Arctic Ocean. The research will focus on two classes of compounds (polyfluorinated compounds - PFCs - and polychlorinated biphenyls - PCBs) with contrasting physical and chemical properties affecting behavior and reactivity in the atmosphere and ocean. The investigators will also collect new data on depth profiles of PCBs and two PFCs - perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanate (PFOA) - in the Arctic Ocean. Three main objectives will be addressed in the proposed research:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1) Quantify the global and regional atmospheric budget of PCBs and PFCs, including relevant spatially-varying uncertainties &lt;br/&gt;2) Quantify the budget of PCBs and PFCs in the Arctic Ocean, including inputs from atmospheric deposition, riverine inflows, and ocean cycling &lt;br/&gt;3) Quantify the relative importance of atmospheric, oceanic, and riverine inputs of PFOA, PFOS and PCBs to the Arctic, including the influence of climate and emissions. &amp;#8232;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ultimately this project will improve knowledge of how these compounds reach the Arctic and inform environmental management. The broader impacts component of the project will have three main goals: (1) Provide policy-relevant information to the Stockholm Convention and other international agreements on POPs to support monitoring and evaluation efforts for its controls on PCBs and PFOS and related compounds; (2) Inform sustainability education, by developing a case study on emerging POPs in the Arctic for courses relevant to environmental sustainability; and (3) train the next generation of interdisciplinary scientists (one graduate student will be trained at each of the three collaborating institutions).</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project contributed to the development of a 3-D modeling framework for addressing the impacts of changing human pollution sources and climate change on the Arctic Ocean.  Work was focused on a well-known legacy pollutant with peak emissions in the 1970s (polychlorinated biphenyls: PCBs) and one important compound in an emerging class of chemicals, poly- and perfluoroalkyl compounds (PFAS).  We focused our work on a compound that is found at high concentrations in humans and wildlife, perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS).   We found that climate driven changes in ocean cirulation are likely to increase the inputs of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) to the Arctic.  Specifically, weakened Atlantic Meridional Overtunring Circulation (AMOC) is likely to increase inputs of PFOS in future years.  We also find that secondary emissions of PCBs from the ocean are now important global sources and are sustaining inputs to regions of the environment where exposures can occur.  This work provides insights into the timescales of cycling of different chemicals in the global and Arctic environments and helps to inform global policy actions such as effectiveness evaluations associated with the Stockholm Convention.  This project has supporting the training of four highly qualified personnel in interdiciplinary environmental modeling and environmental chemistry.  The modeling framework developed as part of this project is being made to a global community of modelers who use the GEOS-Chem atmospheric model, and the MITgcm ocean circulation model.
