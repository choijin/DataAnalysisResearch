<AbstractNarration>This project is developing online (video) learning materials for engineering design to enable an instructor to "flip" the traditional classroom processes and practices.  Engineering design is critically important for all engineering programs.  The process of classroom flipping requires finding, or creating, sufficiently rich online learning materials that students access outside the classroom.  After studying the online materials, students enter an active classroom where the information is discussed and activities occur.  Because there are inadequate design materials available online, this project holds promise of advancing engineering education through the creation of quality materials for this purpose.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The online video materials under development can be adopted by virtually any university that is teaching engineering design principles.  A further outcome is a set of online quizzes to help monitor student understanding of the online materials.  Finally there are thirty in-class exercises to support active learning in the classroom.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project also includes an assessment and evaluation plan that can inform the education community about the efficacy of these online modules for engineering design.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Building on best practices in engineering education, we created instructional resources for faculty and students to implement a "flipped classroom" model for first-year, multidisciplinary engineering design classes.  The flipped classroom or inverted instruction model shifts course content with low cognitive load to videos, screencasts, or other forms of rich media that students watch outside of the classroom, thus freeing class time for students to focus on high cognitive load tasks with support of their peers and the instructor.  To support the flipped classroom, the team created 72 web-based videos, 17 quizzes and 67 in-class exercises covering steps in the engineering design process.  Another thrust of this work was to answer the engineering education research question:  Are there differences in student performance in executing the engineering design process when engineering design process knowledge is delivered using a lecture format versus a flipped classroom model?  Our results demonstrated that the performance of student teams was statistically significantly improved in several aspects when comparing the flipped classroom model relative to the lecture model.  Based on these results, we hypothesize that using a flipped model of instruction in engineering design has a more significant impact on complex material rather than on straightforward concepts.  In addition, we note that a flipped classroom model of instruction impacts students' early attempts to apply the engineering design process to a greater extent than students' performance on tasks requiring accumulated knowledge such as end-of-semester exams.  The materials have been disseminated through publications and are being used at several universities in the United States and abroad.  All materials are available online; the videos are being hosted on the YouTube channel "Learn Engineering Design" at https://goo.gl/dPMdaO, and the quizzes and in-class exercises are being hosted on https://goo.gl/VVpjmJ.
