<AbstractNarration>This project aims at developing efficient methods for protecting the privacy of computations on outsourced data in distributed settings. The project addresses the design of an outsourced storage framework where the access pattern observed by the storage server gives no information about the actual data accessed by the client and cannot be correlated with external events. For example, the server cannot determine whether a certain item was previously accessed by the client or whether a certain algorithm is being executed.  This property provides a high level of privacy protection that goes far beyond standard data encryption. The project also deals with advanced methods for verifying the correctness of outsourced computations, focusing on keyword searches and graph algorithms. The educational component of the project includes a curricular development effort for introductory computer security courses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project has applications to a broad range of web services widely used by business and consumers. Privacy-preserving access for outsourced data is relevant to web-based email and office applications. Also, it is especially important for the management of proprietary business data, medical data, and other sensitive personal data.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project studied privacy-preserving distributed storage and computation, which addressed the question of how to store data and perform computations on outsourced storage and compuation servers, such as Amazon S3 and Microsoft Azure, in ways that preserve the privacy of the data and computations performed.  Intellectual Merit. The methods and technologies developed in this project provide ways for a client computer to outsource data and computations to an honest-but-curious server computer so that the client has all of its tasks performed correctly but the server computer does not learn anything useful about the client's data.  Identifying the server as "honest-but-curious" implies that the server is trusted to keep client's data safe, available, and to perform all the specified protocols, but at the same time the server wants to learn as much as possible about the client's data.  The methods developed in this project included several algorithms for oblivious random access machine (ORAM) simulation, in cloud computing environments where a client outsources her data to a server using small messages and the algorithm provides a way for the client to access the data remotely so that its privacy is preserved even in terms of any patterns as to how the data is accessed.  These methods were further parameterized by how much private storage is available to the client and the size of the messages exchanged between the client and the server. The developed algorithms combined various techniques to achieve improved input-output overheads over previous methods. The project outcomes were disseminated in a significant number of peer-reviewed publications. Broader Impacts. The problem of privacy preservation is important both for providing information confidentiality for sensitive data, but also for giving users confidence that they may safely outsource their data to external servers, thereby increasing the availability and confidentiality of their data while also improving the economic returns for cloud computing companies. This project therefore provided methods that can lead to improved economic and social outcomes for the outsourced data and computation markets.  In addition, this project involved the development of human resources in computing, by integrating undergraduate and graduate students in a computer science research project. This involvement led to these students learning research skills, communication skills, and teamwork skills, which they carried with them after they graduated. Futher, this project also incorporated collaborators from under-represented groups in computer science.          Last Modified: 02/24/2019       Submitted by: Michael T Goodrich]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
