<AbstractNarration>This award provides funding to help defray the expenses of participants, especially women, graduate students, postdocs, and junior faculty, in the "Ninth AIMS International Conference on Dynamical Systems, Differential Equations, and Applications" conference that will be held from July 1--5, 2012, at the conference center Hyatt Grand Cypress in Orlando, Florida.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This conference will cover a variety of topics in analysis (e.g., dynamical systems, partial differential equations, bifurcation theory, etc), with the interplay of dynamical systems and differential equations in both pure and applied settings as a unifying theme. All of the conference topics are central to analysis and are active subjects of current research. The format of the meeting is such that young people will have ample opportunities to speak and be otherwise engaged in the various conference activities.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The American Institute of Mathematical Sciences (AIMS) founded and organizes the biennial Conference on "Dynamical Systems, Differential Equations and Applications" since 1996.  This Conference provides a vital international forum for mathematicians and scientists working in the ever growing field of analysis and applied analysis, including dynamical systems, differential equations, and real-world applications.  Each conference takes place in a different region of the world to benefit most people.  The following five features make the Conference unique and outstanding.     (1) Its high quality and broad coverage so that each participant can find numerous stimulating talks to match his/her interest; (2) its well-organized symposia that are participated by most of the leading experts of the world in the chosen areas; (3) its capacity of arranging each conference to take place in a different region to benefit most people; (4) its organizer, AIMS, which is backed by thousands of supporters, with its proceedings published by AIMS; and (5) its financial support for a broad participation by young researchers and graduate students.    The 9th AIMS International Conference on Dynamical Systems, Differential Equations and Applications took place at the Hyatt Grand Cypress Resort in Orlando, Florida, July 1-5, 2012.   It was participated by 1200 mathematicians and scientists from all the continents. The five-day Conference featured 9 plenary speakers, 75 special sessions and 7 contributed sessions.  More than 1200 talks were presented. The Conference was benefited by all participants, especially the participating graduate students and young Ph.Ds..  The NSF grant supported partial travel expenses for 51 graduate students and female Ph.Ds., 32 post-doc trainees and young faculties, and 9 session organizers and other participants from US to attend the Conference.  The 9th AIMS Conference at Orlando was saluted by an article at Dynamical Systems Magazine, http://www.dynamicalsystems.org/ma/ma/display?item=438.  The peer-reviewed proceedings of the Conference, edited by David Costa, Wei Feng, Zhaosheng Feng, Xin Lu, Xingping Sun, Masaharu Taniguchi, Antonio Vitolo and Abudul-Aziz Yakubu, will be published in summer 2013.     The first AIMS Conference took place at Southwest Missouri State University, Springfield, MO, USA, in May 1996. Since then, the Conference has been hosted by Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai, China; Kennesaw State University, Kennesaw, GA, USA; University of North Carolina at Wilmington, Wilmington, NC, USA; California State Polytechnic University, Pomona, USA; University of Poitiers, Poitiers, France; and University of Texas at Arlington, Texas, USA; the Dresden University of Technology, Dresden, German. The number of participants has grown from 250 in 1996 to a record of 1400 in 2010. Consequently, the AIMS Conference has become a prime event for this international community.  The AIMS Conference has been financially supported by the United States National Science Foundation.             Last Modified: 04/18/2013       Submitted by: Yaw Chang]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
