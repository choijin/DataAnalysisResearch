<AbstractNarration>The innovation of this SBIR Phase II project is the development and commercialization of a low-cost through-building surveillance product for police and SWAT teams that locates and tracks people across an entire building using a network of wireless sensors deployed around the outside of the building. Unlike other through-single-wall imaging technologies, a device does not need to be held against a wall. This project will develop new technologies that make the system useful for police team end-users to quickly deploy and use without extensive training. Specifically, the produce should investigate methods to achieve robust connectivity across larger buildings; develop capabilities for 2.5-dimensional (x,y + floor) imaging and tracking; develop adaptive estimation algorithms that automatically adjust to the environment; develop devices suited for rapid deployment, and develop a real-time commercial prototype including user interface. At the end of the project, the combination of these developments should allow delivery of a prototype to a SWAT team for them to deploy and use on their own in a training exercise.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader/commercial impact is the commercialization of a technology for police and SWAT (special weapons and tactics) teams to quickly obtain situational intelligence that will save lives.  Lives are lost every year because law enforcement officers do not know what is happening inside a building prior to entering. In addition, other life-saving applications will benefit from technologies developed, for example: military urban operations; building security and homeland security systems; finding people alive in collapsed buildings or during fire rescue; and worker safety systems. The firms technology is also useful in systems that allow elderly to live longer in their own home by monitoring their activities to ensure their safety and health. The proposed solution to these challenges is uniquely useful because it does not require a person to wear or carry any device, and cannot image a person's face or features, thus preserving privacy. The technology is capable of "seeing" through walls, even in the dark or through smoke. These features make it compelling for indoor and outdoor security systems, in-home monitoring systems, "smart building" energy-conservation systems, and other context-aware computing systems. This project develops technologies for a new sensing modality with many compelling applications.</AbstractNarration>
