<AbstractNarration>Populations of organisms have a remarkable capacity to adapt to environmental change. Adaptive evolution increases the relative abundance of individuals with genes for particular traits (genotype) that allow them to survive and reproduce better than those with different traits.  An organism?s genotype determines how it interacts with its environment, including with other species. The variety of genotypes present in a population, and how much the environment changes, dictate not only how fast evolution will occur, but also how that population increases or decreases in abundance as the environment changes.  Mathematical theory and simple laboratory predator-prey experiments demonstrate that the ability of a population to evolve markedly affects whether, and how quickly, it changes in abundance.  The cycles of predator and prey abundance look very different with and without evolution. This project tests whether these evolutionary predator-prey cycles are important in understanding changes in species abundance in more natural conditions where weather varies daily, seasons come and go, and they are imbedded in a community of many species. The research will use replicate experimental ponds to document changes over time of freshwater phytoplankton abundances driven by the increases and decreases in the abundance of Daphnia, an animal that feeds on phytoplankton.  The experiment will manipulate the amount of genetic variation in the Daphnia populations in order to change their capacity to evolve, and to determine how that affects seasonal changes in phytoplankton abundance and water clarity.   Genomic methods will be developed to track evolutionary changes in the Daphnia populations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project has practical value in the management of freshwater lakes since the capacity for Daphnia to evolve may determine when and how Daphnia regulates water clarity, a major feature of environmental quality in lakes.  This project will provide research training and career mentoring for a postdoctoral scholar, and for graduate and undergraduate students.  In addition, high school students will participate in conducting the field experiments through summer research experiences.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In recent years, overwhelming evidence has accumulated demonstrating that adaptive evolution often takes place on the same time scale as ecological processes. Population, community, and even ecosystem processes can be a product of evolution in the characteristics of species that influence the strength and direction of ecological interactions: interactions which are, in turn,  a primary cause of natural selection. The strength of ecological interactions can change while those interactions are taking place. Is rapid evolution actually important for the dynamics of populations, communities and ecosystems? The answer is critical for understanding how the natural world functions and responds to environmental change. Even within this context, most studies of these eco-evolutionary processes in the field have explored the relative magnitudes of ecological (e.g., temperature, population density) and evolutionary (genetically based characters of key organisms) effects on system properties at a fixed point in time, rather than their impacts on how population, community, or ecosystem functioning change through time. Studies of eco-evolutionary temporal dynamics, in which evolutionary and ecological changes are followed through time in concert with their effects on the system, have been largely confined to tightly controlled laboratory microcosms where interactions may be unnaturally simple and artificially strong. These studies leave unanswered the questions of whether, and when, rapid evolution plays an important role in the dynamics of populations and communities under natural conditions where the external environment varies and there are many interspecific interactions.  To explore this question, we studied the role of evolution in an important group of crustacean consumers of suspended algae and cyanobacteria (phytoplankton) in lakes, and how that evolution (if present) could affect seasonal changes in the abundance of phytoplankton and hence water clarity.  The important grazing crustaceans are members of the genus Daphnia ("water fleas"), which can reach enormous numbers in lakes and in aggregate can impose impressive grazing pressure sufficient to cause a lake to go from being turbid with phytoplankton to being crystal clear. But grazing efficiency of Daphnia depends upon the quality of the phytoplankton present and, we hypothesized, the ability of particular Daphnia genotypes to consume it.  Thus our study system is both of fundamental interest to field eco-evolutionary dynamics and of significance for understanding an important environmental concern &ndash; lake water-quality management.   Our initial approach was to set up replicate experimental ponds with the intention of exposing Daphnia populations to different regimes of natural selection: phytoplankton rich in phosphorus (P) content in some ponds and poor in P in other ponds.  Like other investigators, we found that the Daphnia genotypes we sampled from a variety of local lake varied in their ability to grow on P-rich and P-poor phytoplankton (see accompanying photo of students setting up a lab experiment to measure this variation).  We expected that selection on these Daphnia genotypes would result in different genotypes dominating in different pond P-treatments.  And from this end result of selection we could set up new ponds with different starting amounts of genetic variation to test the effects of eco-evolutionary dynamics on Daphnia-phytoplankton dynamics over the course of a season (May to October) (see attached photos of a pond with sunlight shades installed to assure P-effect on phytoplankton, and an unshaded pond being fertilized with P by one of the PIs).  Unfortunately, two consecutive years of setting up our pond experiments resulted in no usable data because predatory fly larvae (genus Chaoborus) invaded the ponds and consumed nearly all Daphnia.  In our third year of support, we decided to invert our approach.  We studied a lake with known seasonal Daphnia-...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
