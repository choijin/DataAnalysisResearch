<AbstractNarration>Molecular spin devices (MSDs) are promising candidates for revolutionizing computer logic and memory. MSDs aim to harness the controllable transport and magnetic properties of molecular device elements which can be synthetically mass produced. However, there have been insignificant efforts to predict or measure the effect of molecular coupling on the performance of a MSD. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In order to produce insights about the role of molecular device elements on the magnetic properties of the MSDs, the Research Initiation Award project entitled - A Monte Carlo and SQUID Magnetometer Study of Molecular Spintronics Devices - has two goals: a) To perform Monte Carlo Simulations (MCS) to theoretically investigate the interplay between the magnetic molecules and ferromagnetic electrodes responsible for bringing about the desired characteristics within MSDs. The project will study the effects of Heisenberg exchange coupling between magnetic molecules and ferromagnetic electrodes of a MSD; study the effect of dimensionality, geometry on the molecule induced magnetic coupling, and improvise algorithms for Monte Carlo Simulations near phase change points in a MSD. b) To experimentally study the effect of molecular device elements on the magnetic properties of the MSDs. The research will focus on magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) based MSDs, by conducting a SQUID magnetometer based magnetization study before and after transforming a variety of MTJ test beds into MSDs by utilizing molecular device elements.</AbstractNarration>
