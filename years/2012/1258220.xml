<AbstractNarration>Many species on Earth are unknown to scientists, and in some groups, such as beetles, many known species are poorly documented. This project will build tools and methods to increase the rate of species discovery and documentation, and it will apply these tools to a group of ground beetles (Bembidiina) having over 300 species in the United States. The researchers will discover and delimit species by analyzing DNA sequences using new methods they will develop based on population genetic theory. Photographs of the beetles and their defining physical characteristics will be captured and presented with the DNA results live as they are gathered in an open, online database to which other biologists can freely contribute. The researchers will develop tools to create tablet-apps and print-on-demand, custom-build field guides and scientific monographs. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to increasing knowledge about these common beetles, this project will produce many tools that will broadly benefit biodiversity scientists, regardless of their organisms of study. The new DNA analysis methods will allow experts to increase their rate of species discovery, and the improved integration of data collection with dissemination will ensure that effective documentation keeps pace with the rate of discovery.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In this course of this project, we discovered 41 new species of ground beetles of the subtribe Bembidiina in the United States and Canada.  We did this through weeks of field work, museum-based research, sequencing the DNA of over 2500 specimens, and morphological preparations.  These data also lead to a much greater understanding of the nature and distribution of the previously described species.  During the course of this work we discovered unexpected patterns of variation in one component of the genome, the ribosomal DNA cistron, which could prove to be a useful general tool in species discovery and documentation. We developed protocols for sequencing small, dried insects that have been housed in museums for between 10 and 159 years.  We also developed new components of the software package Mesquite, and helped develop TaxonWorks (with the lead developers of that platform), which itself will aid in biodiversity discovery.  Undergraduate students participated in a Discovering Insect Species class that we taught, and in this experiential-learning class, the students discovered two new species.  During the project, one postdoctoral fellow and one graduate student received extensive training, and are now in jobs at other universities; eighteen undergraduate students had direct research experience as a result of this project.
