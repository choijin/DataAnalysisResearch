<AbstractNarration>The tree of life links all biodiversity through a shared evolutionary history. This project will produce the first online, comprehensive first-draft tree of all 1.8 million named species, accessible to both the public and scientific communities. Assembly of the tree will incorporate previously published results, with strong collaborations between computational and empirical biologists to develop, test and improve methods of data synthesis. This initial tree of life will not be static; instead, we will develop tools for scientists to update and revise the tree as new data come in. Early release of the tree and tools will motivate data sharing and facilitate ongoing synthesis of knowledge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Biological research of all kinds, including studies of ecological health, environmental change, and human disease, increasingly depends on knowing how species are related to each other. Yet there is no single resource that unites knowledge of the tree of life.  Instead, only small parts of the tree are individually available, generally as printed figures in journal articles. This project will provide the global community of scientists who study the tree of life with a means to share and combine their results, and will enable large-scale studies of Earth's biodiversity. It will also create a resource where students, educators and citizens can go to explore and learn about life's evolutionary history.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Katz laboratory at Smith College was one of eleven groups collaborating on the Open Tree of Life Project. The support of this proposal allowed PI Katz to make substantial progress on: developing resources for scientists that allows them to explore the tree of life; enabling the public to learn about the tree of life through a dynamic website; and support training of numerous postdoctoral fellows, graduate students, undergraduates, and a high school student.  Details of achievements on various tasks are described below.     1) Representing microbes in the synthetic tree produced by our collaboration:  Including microbes (e.g. bacteria, archaea, protists) into a synthetic tree is challenging for several reasons.  First, the bulk of microbial diversity remains unknown or poorly documented, as evidenced by the vast numbers of lineage emerging from microbiome studies.  This is particularly challenging given the ~3.4 billion year origin of life and the ~1.8 billion year origin of eukaryotes.  Given the greater patchiness of available data for these lineages, phylogenetic reconstruction tends to be problematic for microbes as orphan/lonely species can vary in placement on trees depending on data and analysis type.  Further, microbes tend to be more impacted by non-vertical processes such as lateral gene transfer (e.g. gene transfer from environment, food) and endosymbiotic gene transfers (i.e. gene transfer from chloroplasts and mitochondria to the nucleus of eukaryotes). With knowledge of these challenges, we worked to capture as many published phylogenies as possible, and to push tool development to be able to handle the diversity and challenges in dealing with names of microbes (i.e. many names are more complex than the traditional binomial for genus and species, creating challenges for bioinformatics).  The current version of this tree, which is meant to be used by specialists and advanced students, can be found here: https://tree.opentreeoflife.org/.     2) Capturing microbes in taxonomy:  The katz lab led on the initial efforts to create the taxonomic backbone (the ?open tree taxonomy of life?) that is required for synthesis of existing and future data.  Given the challenges described above, we sought out databases that pushed beyond traditional focus on plant and animal diversity.  By identifying databases like IRMNG (international registry of marine and non-marine genera), and both Silva and Greengenes (databases originally designed for bacteria/archaea), our group provide awareness of and possible solutions to some of the many of the challenges required to synthesize taxonomies from diverse lineages.  We also conducted preliminary synthesis across databases and proposed solutions for some of the problems that plague taxonomic databases.  Ultimately, our collaboration support the inclusion of ~2 million named species in our Open Tree of Life resources.     3) Outreach to broader community:  Again given the importance of microbial lineages to our understanding of the tree of life, our group played a major role in the development of resources aimed at educating non-scientists.  Working largely with PIs Gude and Soltis, we sought to translate insights on the origin and diversification of life on Earth into an accessible format.  The results of this effort include an overview of the history of life on Earth (i.e. origins, major domains, and influential processes that shape divergences), a dynamic version of the branching tree of life, and an exploration of a subset of species: https://etreeoflife.com/.     4) Development of methods for future studies  The katz lab has also used the Open Tree framework to substantially improve a pipeline that enables automatic generation of trees from multiple data sources.  Method improvements include: efficient handling of high throughput sequencing data, including dealing with errors; control of names to aid in interpretation of results; refinements to use of third party tools to produce multisequence alignments and phylogenetic trees.  This phylogenomic pipeline has been used widely by lab members, including to estimate the eukaryotic tree of life, study the diversification of amoebae in the Amoebozoa, assess lateral gene transfers and endosymbiotic gene transfers.     5) Disseminating data and results  Beyond the components listed above, we are mindful of the need to ensure data are widely available.  This has included contributions to over a dozen manuscripts (with more to come in future years from use of the phylogenomic pipeline and open tree taxonomy) plus images of diverse microbes on the Encyclopedia of Life Website. Results have also been disseminated through numerous public talks at both national and international meetings.  Computer programs written for this grant have been made available on a website (Katzlab github).     6) Education and professional development:  Considerable effort has also gone into education and professional development of participants.  This has included the training of four postdoctoral fellows, three PhD students, over 15 undergraduates, and one high school student.  Given PI Katz?s commitment to enhancing access, roughly half of the undergraduates are students of color and/or first generation college students.
