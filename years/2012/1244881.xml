<AbstractNarration>This project is creating and evaluating an introductory physical-geology textbook, to be distributed by a commercial publisher, that is informed by research in the learning sciences and pedagogy. The reformed textbook includes stronger integration of figures and text, directly addresses common misconceptions, and provides a leaner approach that emphasizes conceptual understanding and minimizes nonessential terms. The assessment plan, which is integral to the project, includes independent evaluation of the alignment of the materials with cognitive research, student affective and cognitive response, and faculty feedback, providing a basis for testing and revision during development. The potential impact of the reformed textbook is high, given the opportunity to improve student learning in the most-commonly taught geoscience course in the undergraduate curriculum.</AbstractNarration>
