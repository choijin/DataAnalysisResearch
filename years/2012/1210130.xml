<AbstractNarration>This action funds Brian Seok of University of Colorado Boulder to conduct a research project, entitled "Measuring ozone forming gases over the Pacific and Arctic oceans from a South Korean icebreaker," during the summer of 2012 at Korea Polar Research Institute in Incheon, Korea.  The host scientist is Tae Siek Rhee.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Intellectual Merit of the research project lies in the answer to the questions: Does the ocean act as a source or a sink for ozone and its precursor, e.g., biogenic volatile organic compounds? Is this a universal phenomenon? What factors may influence the ocean to act as a source or as a sink for ozone and its precursors?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.  These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.</AbstractNarration>

The NSF-EAPSI program to South Korea provided an opportunity for the graduate student to work with South Korean scientists and conduct research aboard one of the latest research vessels with ice breaking capability in the Pacific Ocean built by the South Korean government. Working with South Korean scientists and living in South Korea enhanced the graduate student's awareness in this region of the world, broaden the student's social and scientific network, and helped strengthened the networking between South Korea and US science fund agencies. Given the limited number of research vessels, especially with ice breaking capability, the project funded through this program was a stepping-stone for developing a long-term collaboration between South Korean and US scientists in atmospheric and oceanic research in the Pacific Ocean and will provide US scientists further access to the South Korean research vessel in the future.
