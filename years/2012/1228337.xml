<AbstractNarration>The project will develop a real-time processing system for geospatial survey data acquired by light detection and ranging (LiDAR) technology. Surface reconstruction and attribute detection for LiDAR point cloud data are challenging due to natural surface roughness, diverse noises, and huge data sizes. In the existing literature and commercial software, surface reconstruction has been carried out by various methods such as the inverse-distance weighting, kriging, splines, and wavelets. However, the problem is ill-posed and the conventional reconstruction methods either introduce observable interpolation artifacts or become too computationally expensive when the number of data points increases. The investigator will develop and analyze an effective partial differential equation (PDE)-based surface reconstruction algorithm, called the recursive curvature interpolation method (R-CIM), which produces a smooth image surface of a minimum oscillation, and of which the computational cost is in the order of the image size.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will develop an optimal image reconstruction algorithm for LiDAR point cloud data via collaboration between the Department of Mathematics and Statistics, Mississippi State University, and Agriculture Research Service, United States Department of Agriculture. The proposed algorithm (R-CIM) is optimal in the sense that it possesses a minimum oscillatory behavior and its computational cost is in the order of the image size, independent of the data size. It will contribute to research on image reconstruction and advance various real-time applications towards the real world which involve nonuniformly sampled data. At the same time, the proposed researh includes the development and implementation of the state-of-the-art algorithms for various LiDAR data processing tasks. The project nurtures collaborations between an agricultural engineer and mathematicians having backgrounds on PDEs, numerical analysis, and image processing; it would support a graduate student and an undergraduate student for three years. All the newly-developed software will be freely shared with the community.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The major goals of the project are to develop (a) a curvature-based surface reconstruction method, which is more efficient than conventional interpolation methods, satisfies a minimum oscillatory behavior, and results in smooth surfaces, (b) fast algorithms for real-time applications, and (c) other processing algorithms for various tasks such as the elimination of Moire patterns, denoising, and the detection of attributes (contours, gradients, curvatures, etc.).  The PI could finish the proposed research successfully, by developing effective surface reconstruction algorithms and applying them for various areas including agricultural surface reconstruction, denoising, mesh optimization, cosmology, and computational fluid dynamics. The support has thankfully resulted in seven journal papers, five conference proceedings articles, two submitted articles, two preprints, and a Ph.D. thesis.  The newly-developed surface reconstruction method is optimal in the sense that it is an interpolator, rather than an approximator, and its computational cost is in the order of the image size, independently of the sample size. Furthermore, it shows a minimum oscillatory behavior. None of previous surface reconstruction algorithms have proved such desirable properties simultaneously. The new algorithm has been applied for LiDAR point cloud data, for real-time processing. It will deliver a big impact to societies of geospatial survey research, remote sensing, and image processing.  The convex mesh optimization method overcomes the local extrema problem and guarantees a global convergence for simultaneous untangling and smoothing for moving meshes. The new algorithm will put a great impact to research areas such as medical imaging, fluid dynamics, and computer graphics.  As an application to cosmology, the PI introduced recursive Heaviside step functions, as a potential of the known universe, for the first time in the history of mathematics, science, and engineering. The generalized functions are analyzed as a possible model for the immeasurable energy appeared for the Big Bang. The research will bring out an aesthetic (but, somewhat rigorous) branch of applied mathematics for mathematicians, physicists, and cosmologists.
