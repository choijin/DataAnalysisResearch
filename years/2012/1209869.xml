<AbstractNarration>This action funds Anastasiya N. Protasov (Romanovskaya) of Texas A&amp;M University to conduct a research project, entitled "Reducing computational costs of a model in porous media using a hierarchical approach," during the summer of 2012 at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore.  The host scientist is Dr. Viet Ha Hoang, assistant professor in the Division of Mathematical Sciences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Intellectual Merits of the research project lies in its special approach to solve only particular problems instead of solving the entire high-dimensional system.  The research includes the development of robust and inexpensive hierarchical local-global reduced-order models and application of these techniques to single-phase compressible flows that arise in real world problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.   These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Problems involving heterogeneous porous media applications entail prohibitively expensive computations due to the large scale fields and extremely complex geometry. An input-output formulation for parabolic problem is considered, where input is a defined, controllable quantity and output is a measurable quantity (usually the later has much smaller dimension compare to a solution of the system). Proposed approach reduces computational cost of obtaining a solution for suggested problems in heterogeneous porous media. As a first step, in order to descretize the problem two types of Finite Element Method (FEM) were considered &ndash; standard (full tensor product) and sparse tensor product FEM. The main advantage of a sparse tensor product approach over standard is the fact of getting a system of much smaller size, while convergence rates are comparable to full tensor product FEM. As a second step, a combination of both global and local model reduction techniques was applied in order to carry out expensive computations on a descretized system. The following approach was developed for both sparse and full tensor product FEM. First, two-scale homogenization was applied to the system. Hierarchical approach allows solving local problems with different resolution and then combines these multi-resolution solutions to achieve an accurate approximation. Secondly, the system was transformed in order to apply a global model reduction technique &ndash; Balanced Truncation Method. The later enables to get a good approximation of a solution by solving a system of much smaller size than the original one. Two main objectives of the project were achieved:   A  robust and inexpensive hierarchical local-global reduced-order  modeling technique to solve problems involving heterogeneous porous  media applications was developed,   Modeling  technique was further applied to obtain a solution for a  single-phase compressible flow.   Proposed research has broader impact on many areas where one is interested in constructing reduced-order models  for solving forward problems, inverse problems and optimization problems. As a future work suggested approach may be applied to develop solutions for multiphase flow in a frame of two- and three-scale homogenization.
