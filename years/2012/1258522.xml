<AbstractNarration>Observations of ionospheric convection from SuperDARN and DMSP along with ACE solar wind observations will be used to develop a new high-latitude convection model. The approach will be to use Data Interpolating Orthogonal Functions (DINEOFs). DINEOFs are a data-based technique that determines a limited set of basis functions and their evolution that best describes a data set. The basis functions will be used to study the interaction between polar cap convection and the solar wind.  The technique allows the two ionospheric data sets to be combined and will fill gaps in the data record without using bin-averaging as is presently done. The approach is rigorous and provides error estimates. The resulting model will provide spatial and temporal characteristics of the convection for both hemispheres.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This model will be valuable to other magnetospheric and ionospheric researchers. It is from a young researcher just starting his career and will support a post-doctoral researcher at the University of Texas at Dallas. A graduate student will be supported at Virginia Tech.</AbstractNarration>

Furthermore, the IMF y-component influence acted on a lag time which was 10 minutes faster than that of the z-component. This difference in lag time was found to be consistent with the propagation delay expected for magnetic merging taking place simultaneously at two distinct sites on the "magnetopause" which is the boundary between the solar wind and the magnetosphere -- antiparallel merging with the IMF z-component on the top/bottom of the magnetosphere but component merging with the IMF y-component at the sunward "nose" of the magnetopause.  The second study used 2 years of data obtained from SuperDARN radars in the North American sector to derive a new statistical model of quiet time nightside midlatitude plasma convection between 52&deg; and 58&deg; magnetic latitude (MLAT).
