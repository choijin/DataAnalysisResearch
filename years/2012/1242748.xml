<AbstractNarration>This  project is providing  support for graduate students to attend a workshop organized in conjunction with the fall 2012 annual symposium of the Association for Advancement in Artificial Intelligence. The workshop entitled Artificial Intelligence for Gerontechnology was held November 2nd to November 4th, 2012, in Arlington, Virginia.  Gerontechnology  is an interdisciplinary academic and professional field combining the study of aspects of aging and technology to address the challenges arising from the demographic changes due to aging society.   Artificial intelligence techniques are considered to be among the key components of the solutions within the gerontechnology domain supporting care for elders. Intellectual Merit: The symposium advances the state of the art in artificial intelligence by considering problems and solutions that are inspired by the challenges in developing gerontechnology. Specifically, the topics addressed include the following: 1) novel approaches for dealing with sparsely annotated data, 2) innovative machine learning techniques that can improve the generalization of technological solutions across a wide range of real-world settings and 3) design of modeling algorithms that take advantage of domain knowledge. Broader Impacts: While the goal of the symposium was to advance the field of AI with the focus on elder care applications, the solutions resulting from the symposium can also be applied to other health care areas such as assisting chronic patients in hospitals and homes. In addition, the educational aspect of this workshop provides the opportunity to educate future workforce with expertise at the intersection of computer science, artificial intelligence and care for the elders.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The artificial intelligence for gerontechnology was held at Arlington Virginia form November 2-4, 2012. The goal of this symposium was to investigate the role of AI in design and development of current and future technologies for older adults that promote safety and independent living.  The development of user-centric technologies that assist older adults to live independently and also reduce the burden on caregivers, is gaining more attention due to the increasing health care costs and aging population.  AI is central to these technologies as it deals with the process of transforming raw sensor data into human interpretable abstractions, innovating new human computer interfaces, as well as planning and reasoning. The symposium provided an intimate setting for researchers from the disciplines of computer science, engineering, nursing, psychology, cognitive science and health informatics to take stock of state of the art, highlighting successes and failures, while discussing new problems and opportunities. Incidentally, the symposium happened to be the 4th one in a series of symposiums related to the topic held over the past decade and thus presented updated perspectives on the topic.  A common theme reflected in all the discussions at the symposium was the confluence of AI and "Information and Communication technologies" (ICT) in the smart home environment. The smart home environment can provide safety, can facilitate the assessment of functional and cognitive skills, and can provide just in time interventions to promote independent living. It can also enable deriving non-pharmacological behavioral parameters to identify changes in health that may indicate early sign of illness.
