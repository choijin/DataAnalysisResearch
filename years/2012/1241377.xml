<AbstractNarration>The Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms Program supports the 2012 Electron Donor-Acceptor Interactions Gordon Research Conference and Gordon Research Seminar, being held at Salve Regina University in Newport, Rhode Island, from August 4 ? 10, 2012. This conference is a leading venue for dissemination of research spanning chemistry, biology, physics, and materials science for which electron and energy transfer processes comprise the conceptual underpinning for molecular and materials design. This year, the inaugural session of a Gordon Research Seminar for graduate students and post-doctoral associates, subtitles "The Role of Fundamental Science in Our Energy Future", will be held immediately preceding the main GRC meeting. This grant is used for registration and/or travel fees for U.S. students accepted to attend the GRS, as well as those attendees who wish to also participate in the GRC.</AbstractNarration>
