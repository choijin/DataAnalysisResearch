<AbstractNarration>This proposal requests travel funds from NSF to assist 20 US students to participate in PerMIS 2012, which will be held at the University of Maryland University College in Hyattsville, Maryland. The purpose of this Group Travel Grant Proposal is to make it possible for US students and postdocs to attend the conference, present their work, and forge connections with colleagues from around the world. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Performance Metrics for Intelligent Systems workshop is the only one of its kind dedicated to defining measures and methodologies of evaluating performance of intelligent systems. This years theme revolves around Cyber Physical Systems, an important area of research highlighted in the recent PCAST report. As part of this award, students will also have the opportunity to participate in special events and learn more about the field of performance metrics and cyber physical systems. Travel funding will be in the form of partial airfare reimbursement and full reimbursement for student registration to approximately 20 U.S. students who plan to present at least one paper at the Conference.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The importance of performance metrics for engineered systems cannot be overstated. The benefit to student learning and mentorship by encouraging attendance of students by direct monetary means brings large dividends in student confidence, knowledge and expertise.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The objective of this grant is to provide travel funds to assist 20 US students to participate in the 2012 Performance Metrics for Intelligent Systems (PerMIS'12) Workshop held in Baltimore, MD on the campus of the University of Maryland.  The goal of the travel funds is to enable students to attend the conference, present their research, and forge career connections with other students and researchers from around the world.   In total 18 US students were awarded travel funds.  Of the 18 students awarded, 9 US students attended PerMIS'2012 and presented their research in a Student Poster Session at the Workshop.   The remaining funds provided were awarded to 9 additional students to travel to the 2012 International Symposium on Distributed Autonomous Robotic Systems (DARS 2012) also held in Baltimore, MD.   The funds supported student authors of accepted papers and enabled them to present their work at the conference.  These funds gave undergraduate and graduate students the opportunity to learn about state of the art research in the areas of intelligent systems, distributed robotic systems, and the evaluation of such systems.  Each student participated in a poster or oral presentation of their work.  As a result, students had to think critically about their research presentations and write up their thoughts with guidance from senior researchers.  Student awardees also had the opportunity to discuss their work with other presenters and receive additional guidance from senior researchers not at their institutions. The workshop and conference enabled students to network with other students and senior researchers to further their research and their careers.       Last Modified: 06/13/2013       Submitted by: M.
