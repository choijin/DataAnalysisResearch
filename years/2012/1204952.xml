<AbstractNarration>This project is developing unique and comprehensive career pathways that provide students with the academic and technical skills needed to work in the mining industry by blending credit and non-credit resources, improving the education of science and engineering technicians, and providing students with a career context for both STEM and mining-specific courses. It is bringing together the public school system (K-12), post-secondary community colleges and universities, workforce development, and industry to create comprehensive academic programs with clear articulated career pathways and enhanced instruction. Four academic programs, Electrical Engineering Technology, Mining Engineering, Mine Management, and Mine Technology, are undergoing development, redefinition, and implementation to become web- and media-enriched programs that include new technologies and meet industry needs. Courses in the programs have specific course articulations including both secondary education and post-secondary education and enhanced instruction. Faculty are receiving professional development training in instructional design and technology-mediated delivery of courses to facilitate the implementation of the career pathways and strengthen STEM education within the programs. The curriculum, lessons learned, and other material developed by the project, have the potential to impact technical education at K-12 and other postsecondary institutions in states across the nation in which coal mining occurs.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Developing Comprehensive Career Pathways and Programs in Coal Mining was a National Science Foundation - Advanced Technology Education grant awarded to Southern West Virginia Community and Technical College.  The project's initial framework was to create comprehensive pathways for careers in coal mining. With the downturn of coal, the pathways were expanded and included more general manufacturing. To accomplish the project goals Southern brought together partners from the regional K-12 schools, industry, state officials, and other 2-4-year partner colleges and universities.  Southern created four new technical programs - Associate of Applied Science in Welding Technology, Certificate in Welding Technology, Associate in Applied Science in Mechatronics, and Certificate in Industrial Technology.  Career pathways mapping were developed for each of these programs along with the existing Electrical Engineering Technology, Mining Engineering Transfer 2+2, and Technical Studies (Management focus to applied technical skills).  The career maps allow for multiple entry-and exit points to allow students straight from high school to enter, those who are simply changing careers to enter, and those with background seeking to earn additional credentials.  The involvement of all the parties created a dynamic relationship for the Southern Mountains District Consortium, a partnership between Southern and the K-12 system in the counties it serves.  Faculty from all sides worked together to setup curriculum, align standards, and create documents to help guide students through the programs.   A secondary objective of the project was to revise/develop courses in an online format and provide greater access to the area. To accomplish the objective, a full professional development training program was established that encompassed pedagogy, technical skills and Quality Matters standards for online course design (WV adopted QM statewide as the standards for quality online course development). A total of 34 faculty were chosen to participate in the project to develop one of the program courses. The faculty were provided yearlong training and support to develop the courses.  Courses that were considered fully online were submitted to Quality Matters for a formal external review and certification. Quality Matters is a national program that sets standards to measure quality of course design and has been adopted by West Virginia as a state initiative. As a result, Southern had the first faculty in WV to receive formal QM approval of a course and had 17 courses complete formal review with only 2 courses needing modification to meet requirements.  The process developed for participants in the grant has resulted in systematic change for Southern for the training and development of all faculty teaching online. Partnerships were developed with other schools to share the training and provide a Peer-Reviewing sharing process to help other each school further the work on quality online course development.   The success of the welding and mechatronics programs sparked new interest for students who started a leadership program and the college participated in its first ever Skills USA competition.  The first welding team took silver at the state competition.  The following year the Mechatronic students took gold and participated in the National competition. The program continues to grow each year and added students from 5 programs throughout the college. The interest in leadership programs exploded resulting in the development of the National Technical Honor Society, Southern Ambassadors, and the National Society for Student Leadership.  Without the National Science Foundation grant, these programs and the opportunities for students would not be where they are today.
