<AbstractNarration>The process by which a sheet of undifferentiated cells within a developing embryo gives rise to a fully operational brain remains a pressing scientific problem with significant implications for understanding how brains function. Each neuron in the developing brain must adopt an appropriate cellular identity through a precise genetic program of spatial and temporal gene expression. Although these genetic programs do not always play out in an accurate manner, embryonic tissues have an enhanced ability to recover from perturbations as compared to adult tissues. The overall goal of this research is to identify the molecular mechanisms by which the embryonic nervous system responds to and recovers from these deviations from normal development. The experiments will employ a well-suited animal model system, namely the amphibian Xenopus laevis, that displays not only remarkable ability to compensate following genetic perturbation of the developmentally important Notch signaling pathway, but also employs a similar suite of genes to those regulating early human neural development. Using molecular, cellular and genetic tools, this research will uncover the specific genes and pathways that allow tissues to recover from genetic perturbation of Notch signaling. This will broaden our understanding of the ways in which the highly conserved Notch signaling pathway function to promote proper development of the nervous system in animals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: This knowledge will contribute to understanding how and why processes go awry in human brain development and how these genetic pathways can potentially be manipulated in the emerging field of regenerative medicine.  Equally importantly, the research will entail extensive undergraduate involvement in a manner that blends teaching and research; a cadre of undergraduate students, working with the principal investigator, will conduct the research as part of their science education and the experiments will also be incorporated into a new research-based genomics course. In order to engage the broader community, local teachers will have the opportunity to participate in the research through summer workshops.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[             While all cells and tissues possess some ability to respond to changing genetic and environmental conditions, embryos are characterized by a remarkable degree of plasticity, that is, an ability to respond to adverse conditions and continue normal development. Despite some differences among organisms, embryonic development is an exceptionally robust process that allows embryos to respond to and recover from the wide range of perturbations they continually face. This pronounced regenerative and compensatory ability is distinctly different from most adult cells, so it is important to understand the basis of this embryonic plasticity.  Despite its importance, the mechanisms underlying developmental plasticity and compensatory processes remain poorly understood, particularly on the molecular level.                The overarching goal of this project was to address this longstanding and important question in developmental biology. We sought to investigate the broader issue of developmental plasticity by focusing on one specific and profound case of compensatory regulation in the amphibian Xenopus laevis, namely the restoration of cellular patterning and phenotype in the nervous system following perturbation of the Notch signaling pathway during early embryogenesis in this classic and widely studied model system for neural development.              Our data show that after the Notch pathway was either inhibited or hyperactivated, the embryos initially showed developmental defects, but then gradually recovered. This was due to both differential programmed cell death and cell proliferation as a means of regenerating proper neuronal cell number. Following analysis of the key genes known to be involved with neural determination and differentiation, we identified a number of them that may be involved in the compensatory response.  These include the following:  Delta1, Geminin 1, HES1, Irx1, Irx2, Jagged2, Sox1, Sox2, Sox15, Zic1, Zic2, Zic3, and Tyh1.  All of these genes show an expression pattern that suggests they may be involved in a regulatory response to the perturbations.    Our analysis of global gene expression experiment suggests that, not surprisingly, rather than a few key genes, an entire network of genes may be mediating this compensatory response.  Our work also identified a novel player in the Notch signaling pathway, Tweety1, a calcium responsive chloride channel, that involved in Notch signaling and potentially the compensatory response. Consistent with the key role of Tweety1, preliminary findings suggest that there is a difference in calcium activity in embryos with perturbed Notch signaling compared to control embryos.  We hypothesize this may be an early step in the regulation and compensatory response. Finally, an important aspect of the project was the engagement and mentoring of an eager cadre of undergraduate research students who performed the work both in the research lab and in laboratory courses that blended teaching and research.
