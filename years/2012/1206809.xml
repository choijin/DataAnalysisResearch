<AbstractNarration>TECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports theoretical research aimed at understanding and controlling quantum correlations in solids. In the long term, the two goals of this research program are:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(1)  Design and development of new materials and structures with useful functionalities that are not currently available, and &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(2) Extending the basic scientific framework to understand matter in novel regimes and phases.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The three main topics to be studied to achieve these goals are: (1) highly quantum magnetism, (2) materials derived from topological insulators, and (3) correlated oxide interfaces.   It is envisioned that there will be synergy between these areas. The research will be carried out using a diverse set of theoretical techniques including phenomenological modeling, statistical mechanics, field theory, ab initio simulations, density matrix renormalization group, and symmetry analysis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The general style of this research program is to develop and bring deep theoretical ideas in the theory of solids into fruition in real materials. Quantum magnetism, the first topic, is the most ideal arena to test theories of exotic, non-locally entangled quantum states. Research on quantum spin liquids and magnetization processes is very timely, coinciding with a burst of experimental discoveries and questions raised by them. The second topic defines new directions for the active area of topological insulators, focusing on problems where fundamental theoretical issues still reside, and where opportunities are present for materials synthesis. In the third topic on correlated interfaces, essential issues in this field, such as the driving forces behind the metal-insulator transition and the nature of carriers induced by polarization discontinuities, will be addressed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award also supports the education of a graduate student and a postdoctoral research associate at the frontiers of condensed matter theory.  The PI will incorporate the methods and results from the research into teaching materials, and involve undergraduate students in research providing motivation for them to pursue higher education in physics.  The PI will also be involved in disseminating the research results to specialist as well as non-specialist audiences via the group's extensive web site and review articles.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports theoretical research aimed at understanding and controlling quantum mechanical correlations in solids.  Focusing on novel phenomena which have been observed or can be engineered in modern materials, the goal of the research is to devise new types of functionalities for these materials, and to expand the theoretical framework which describes quantum phenomena.   At the most fundamental level, the work will describe new phases of matter with remarkable properties, and determine how to study and harness those properties in the laboratory.&lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;This award also supports the education of a graduate student and a postdoctoral research associate at the frontiers of condensed matter theory.  The PI will incorporate the methods and results from the research into teaching materials, and involve undergraduate students in research providing motivation for them to pursue higher education in physics.  The PI will also be involved in disseminating the research results to specialist as well as non-specialist audiences via the group's extensive web site and review articles.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project bridged fundamental and experimental  of natural materials and artificial structures, addressing the question: "Where and how can we find new phases in the laboratory?"   In answer, we predicted several new magnetic states in a the class of known as "double perovskite" compounds, providing an organizing framework for dozens of materials.  We showed how to combine two electronically different system to imprint the properties of one on another:  a new type of "proximity effect".    Groundbreaking computational methods were developed and applied to determine the quantum state of electron spins in diverse geometries, discovering many different states: magnetic analogs of liquid crystals; "chiral" magnets with intrinsic left- or right-handedness; intricate "skyrmion" textures; and highly quantum "spin liquids" which display macroscopic quantum behavior.  We uncovered a set of materials intermediate between metals and semiconductors, and showed that by exerting small controllable forces on them, they can be made to switch states extremely sensitively.     Beyond identifying these materials and phases, we designed new measurements to characterize and utilize their unique properties.  Among the more striking results, we found, surprisingly, that in some cases even a purely local measurement near a single atom of a solid can determine the global state of the electrons in it.  In a class of magnetic materials, we showed that  a "quantum phase transition" -- an abrupt change of state of the material as a function of applied field  -- provides an efficient reservoir of entropy that can be utilized for thermoelectric cooling.   The research provided on-the-job training of next generation scientists who learned the skills to carry out independent and collaborative research in STEM disciplines.  Five postdoctoral  scientists and three PhD students were involved in the research and published peer-reviewed journal papers, attended conferences and delivered lectures, and in the latter case completed portions of their PhD theses as part of the project.
