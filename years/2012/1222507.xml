<AbstractNarration>Spectroscopic sensing techniques are powerful analytical tools for detecting and identifying chemical and biological substances, and so are widely used in determining molecular structures, stand-off detection of explosives, imaging of air composition to name a few. However, the objects being imaged in the real-world are more often mixtures than pure substances, making difficult direct identification and quantification of chemical constituents from existing lookup tables or templates. A fundamental scientific problem is to unmix or decompose the measured spectral data into a non-redundant and compact combination of basic components (pure or source spectra) facilitating subsequent verification and quantification based on look-up tables. The principal investigator (PI) and his team study three classes of unmixing problems depending on the available knowledge of the source signals (minimal, partial or full knowledge of a template of source signals). The research problems are blind, partially blind and template assisted source separation and identification. The intellectual merit of the proposed project is a combined geometrical and statistical approach with associated computational algorithms incorporating sparsity regularized optimization techniques. The geometric approach is based on the sparseness of the spectra of the source signals while the statistical approach is on decomposing the errors of template based data fitting when partial and statistical knowledge of the source spectra is available. The proposed methods are shown to be applicable to laboratory data from nuclear magnetic rensonance, Raman spectroscopy and differential optical absorption spectroscopy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The data analysis and computational algorithms on unmixing spectroscopic mixtures by the PI and his team can greatly improve the capability of threat reduction and decision making for public health and security. Their proposed line of work is well-positioned to generate broad impact on information technology, biotechnology, safety of civil infrastruture and environment; in particular the structural understanding and threat assessment of mixtures of chemical compounds originating in battle fields, homeland security, air quality monitoring, metabolic fingerprinting and disease diagnosis. The mathematical tools and numerical data produced in their project also benefit researchers and graduate students in data sharing and management, curriculum development and course offerings. The PI actively engages in mentoring postdoctoal fellows in terms of research and career advancement.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The project developed new information retrieval computational techniques to extract low dimensional structures from high dimensional data, detect and quantify hidden chemical and biological threats, as well as analyze images beyond hardware resolution limits.   The intellectual merit is in the theoretical and algorithmic advancements of non-convex sparse optimization methods which robustly improve on the classical convex methods ( L1 norm minimization and non-negative least squares methods) in imaging sciences. A prime example is the discovery of  the difference of two convex norms (L1 minus L2) for sparse vectors and the analogue for low rank matrices.  The improvement in sensing is accomplished for a whole range of sensing conditions from the well-conditioned to the extremely ill-conditioned scenarios so that one can see better without modifying an existing hardware.  The project has led to better understanding of the mathematical properties of the limit points of the iterative algorithms in non-convex sparse optimization. The project also discovered a class of geometric, analytical and statistical methods to extract hidden source signals and concentrations from their mixture measurements by solving non-convex optimization problems with limited or imperfect information on the source signals. The variants of the methods based on weighted convex methods and adaptive weight estimation from data also apply to low cost portfolio management in economics and finance.   The broader impacts of the project are on enhancing spectroscopic sensing capability of chemicals and bacteria when measurements contain redundancies, distortions and uncertainties arising in areas of threat detection, remote sensing and air pollutant imaging. The studied sensing modalities include Raman spectroscopy for stand-off explosive detection, nuclear magnetic resonance in structural chemistry, and differential optical absorption spectroscopy in atmospheric science.  The project also makes an impact on the general public awareness and the need to invest in STEM areas, such as educating future generations to pursue STEM careers, which is a critical step to maintain the nation's technological and scientific lead in the world for the long run.The project results show how mathematics and computation can help us see better with spectroscopic imaging technology, recover hidden information in measurements with sparse non-convex optimization, geometric and statistical methods; thereby improving decision-making and public safety. The project successfully trained three Ph.D students in computational mathematics.              Last Modified: 11/29/2016       Submitted by: Jack Xin]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
