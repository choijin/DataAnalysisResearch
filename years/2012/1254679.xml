<AbstractNarration>The goal of this Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) Program award is to understand, predict, and analyze the impact of civil engineering decisions on the environmental, social, and economic value of civil infrastructure systems for its stakeholders (residents, firms, etc.). This aims at advancing our knowledge of how to plan, design, construct, and operate our civil infrastructure systems in a way that maximizes its collective life cycle value. In order to achieve this goal, the research objective of this CAREER award is to account for stakeholder values (safety, economic growth, etc.) in infrastructure project planning and design decision-making through the discovery and formalization of "axiology (a theory of value) of civil infrastructure systems", its application in value modeling and simulation, and its validation in the context of value-sensitive decision-making. The research methodology involves empirical investigations, mathematical modeling, semantic (computer-understandable and meaning-rich) modeling, and semantic simulation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, this research will provide models for assessing the value of infrastructure projects in a stakeholder-conscious way. These models will offer the structure for soliciting and aligning public values and expectations about infrastructure systems and can guide the planning and design of solutions that are socially-equitable, economically-effective, and environmentally-viable. This research will advance the "science of value" (the science that attempts to formalize value theory using mathematical and logic formalisms). It will also advance the fundamental research in decision theory by offering a value theory that may guide infrastructure system decision-making. This project will involve educational and outreach activities to integrate research findings into coursework and outreach material, engage undergraduate and graduate students, and reach out to K-3 children and female high-school students. These efforts will help foster the "engineer of the future" who has a blend of knowledge, skill, and humanistic understanding of the role and impact of civil engineering in society.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Project Outcomes and its Intellectual Merit  It is important that we know the value (worth) that an infrastructure adds to its stakeholders (residents, businesses, etc.), because this affects the way we make infrastructure investment decisions and the way we plan and design our infrastructure. Existing infrastructure decision making approaches have failed to conceptualize, model, and reason about value, in its complex and holistic sense and considering different stakeholder perspectives. To address this challenge, this project proposed a new approach to account for stakeholder (human) values (safety, comfort, economic growth, etc.) in infrastructure project planning and design decision-making through the discovery and formalization of the axiology (a theory of value) of civil infrastructure systems and its application in value modeling, value quantification and analysis, and value-sensitive decision making. The project team developed a set of mathematical and computational models for assessing the value of our infrastructure projects in a stakeholder-conscious way.  The following is a brief description of the main outcomes of the project, along with a summary of their intellectual merit:  (1) Identification of stakeholder values in the context of infrastructure planning and design: This offers important empirical and theoretical knowledge on stakeholder values (what stakeholders value in infrastructure projects and to what extent), as well as their variability across different types of projects and stakeholder groups.  (2) Novel mathematical value quantification and value aggregation models: These models offer a new approach for predicting the value (worth) of an infrastructure to its different stakeholders. The models also advance the science of value by adapting formal axiology concepts from the domain of mathematical philosophy to the domain of infrastructure and translating these adapted concepts into mathematical terms. The models also advance decision theory by incorporating the human element in engineering decision making in a systematic and mathematical way.  (3) Building information modeling (BIM)-integrated value assessment models and visualization framework (and its implementation in a proof-of-concept prototype software system): These BIM-integrated models and software advance our ability to conduct value analysis and study tradeoffs in a quantitative and efficient manner, which in turn advances our knowledge of how to plan and design our civil infrastructure systems in a way that maximizes its collective life cycle environmental, social, and economic value.  (4) Important findings and insights derived from value analysis studies: A number of important findings and insights were derived. For example, we advanced our knowledge of how to create high levels of synergy between the design of the infrastructure and the personal (human) value systems of the stakeholders.  Broader Impacts of the Project  The project outcomes had three main types of broader impacts:   (1) Promoting teaching, training, and learning: Graduate and undergraduate students were provided with state-of-the-art research training opportunities, including participation in the research and educational activities, advancing their professional skills, presenting at conferences, collaborating/interacting with industry practitioners and project stakeholders, etc. In addition, a proof-of-concept prototype software for infrastructure value analysis was developed. Undergraduate and graduate students would be able use the prototype on actual and hypothetical cases.  (2) Broadening the participation of underrepresented groups: The project provided an opportunity to improve the performance and skills of members from underrepresented groups with an aim at improving their access to research. Two women (one undergraduate and one graduate student) were given the opportunity to actively participate in the research and educational activities of this project.  (3) Disseminating the research results: Ten peer-reviewed journal papers (published or submitted), six peer-reviewed conference papers (published), and two PhD dissertations (one published and one under preparation) were produced as a result of this project. In addition, a number of posters were presented to disseminate the research results at events that target broader communities.   In addition, the results from this project are likely to make a future impact on society in two main ways:  (1) Promoting transparency and consistency in civil infrastructure decision making: Value-based decision making would promote greater transparency in decision making, improved information for making decisions, and a better understanding about the links between infrastructure planning and design decisions and the value that an infrastructure adds to the stakeholders.  (2) Supporting value-enhancing and sustainable civil infrastructure development: Sustainable development requires an integrated approach towards achieving social, economic, and environmental objectives. This research resulted in models for assessing the environmental, social, and economic values of our infrastructure projects taking into consideration stakeholder input.
