<AbstractNarration>Karst aquifers are sources of groundwater for human use, are an integral component of the water cycle, and may contain diverse microbial, invertebrate, and vertebrate communities. Many karst aquifers are threatened by groundwater extraction and contamination, but relatively little is known about their community structure, ecosystem function, or biogeochemical cycling. This research, on the Edwards Aquifer of south-central Texas, will address links between hydrogeology and geochemistry, the distribution of organic matter, and the trophic structure of groundwater communities. Specific issues that will be addressed will include the ways that hydrology and geochemistry affect the spatial and temporal distribution of chemolithoautotrophic and photosynthetic organic matter and utilization by groundwater species, whether biodiversity in groundwater habitats is supported by resource partitioning, and whether the prevailing paradigm of truncated trophic structure in subsurface habitats is supported by isotopic data. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These issues will be addressed by sampling across geochemical gradients in the freshwater and saline portions of the aquifer. Methods will include inorganic and organic geochemical characterization of groundwater, geospatial analysis of geochemical data, stable isotope analyses, and morphometric analyses of invertebrates. Preliminary results show that organic matter produced both by plants, using sunlight, and by microbes that derive energy from redox reactions involving inorganic substrates (chemolithoautotrophs) is utilized by invertebrates, and both types of organic matter are distributed unevenly within the aquifer, being controlled by the movement of water (photosynthetic matter being prevalent near recharge features) and geochemistry (chemolithoautotrophic production occurring where fresh and saline groundwaters mix). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will have substantial societal importance because it directly relates to water quality and the maintenance of biodiversity in ecosystems that are intensively managed for human use. The project also will provide field and laboratory opportunities for students, including Hispanics and women employed or enrolled as graduate students in the PIs laboratory.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goals of this project were to 1) provide insight into the origin of food resources utilized by animals inhabiting deep groundwater ecosystems and 2) to understand how these animals interact with one another trophically (i.e. to answer questions such as "Who eats who? Are they eating the same thing? Are they feeding in the same pace?").  Not only are these questions academically interesting, but they have afforded training opportunities for laboratory employees, educational opportunities for middle-school students and community members outside of academia, and the research indirectly provides information about water quality and water storage in an economically important aquifer: the Edwards Aquifer of Central Texas.  The Edwards Aquifer is one of the most biodiverse groundwater systems in the world, harboring unusual and endangered species such as blind catfish, blind salamanders, freshwater shrimp, subterranean diving beetles and subterranean leeches.  Organic matter and body tissue from many of these species were analyzed to quantify their stable isotope composition: an inexpensive and widely used technique for identifying animalsÆ food sources (carbon analysis) and food web position (nitrogen analysis).  Among different sites in the aquifer, animals have significantly different carbon compositions, suggesting the presence of two distinct food sources in the aquifer: plant material washed in from the surface, and microbial biomass produced within the aquifer without energy from the sun.  The latter source (called chemolithoautotrophy) is especially significant because it is relatively uncommon, occurring, among other places, at deep-sea hydrothermal vents and a handful of caves scattered around the world.   The Edwards Aquifer probably represents the largest chemolithoautotrophic groundwater system yet identified. Both input of organic matter from the surface and production of organic matter within the aquifer vary in response to environmental change.  Specifically, during drought, organic matter entering the aquifer from the surface is dominated by algae produced in surface streams.  During wet periods, terrestrial plant material (such as tree leaves and grasses) becomes more important.  Microbial generation of organic matter varies as well. Although the mechanism is unclear, changes in the composition of microbial organic matter are probably a response to changing groundwater flowpaths within the aquifer that result from changing water levels.  These findings have been accepted for publication in the journal Acta Carsologica. Additionally, at a given site, animals show a wide range of both carbon and nitrogen values.  This is significant for several reasons.  First, significantly different carbon values among species illustrate that different species are feeding on distinct food resources: a process known as niche partitioning.  Niche partitioning reduces competition between species, allows more species to coexist, and allowing more energy to be transferred to higher trophic levels.  This suggests that the presence of multiple food resources partially explains the high biodiversity observed in the Edwards Aquifer.  Microscopical analysis of animal mouthparts is ongoing to better understand specific adaptations that allow these coexisting species to feed on different resources.   The wide range of nitrogen values among species indicates the presence of primary consumers, primary predators and higher level, apex predators.  This finding is unusual in groundwater systems which are typically energy limited and consequently possess few obligate predators.  The Edwards Aquifer represents the longest food chain yet observed in a groundwater ecosystem.  These findings have been published in the Proceedings of the International Congress of Speleology and were shared with the scientific community at a meeting held in Brno, Czech Republic in late July, 2013.
