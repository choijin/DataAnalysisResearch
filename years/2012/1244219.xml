<AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;Most inherited traits are quantitative and determined by variation in multiple genes dispersed throughout the genome.  Genetic variation in these different genes can interact in ways that are difficult to predict.  The project aims to identify principles governing relationships between genes that underlie quantitative trait variation. This project will study genetic interactions in a model experimental system for naturally occurring quantitative trait variation and identify general principles regarding the functional relationships between interacting genes.  The research entails selecting yeast mutants that have increased cell growth rates by performing evolution experiments in carefully defined environments.  Experiments will be designed so that mutants accumulate a small number of mutations relative to the founding strain.  This project will identify all the acquired genetic variation using whole genome resequencing and construct a panel of strains carrying individual mutations and all possible combinations of mutations.  It will quantify growth rates for each genotype combination and determine the nature of the interactions between the gene variants.  It will then study the functional relationships between genes that interact in different ways using the extensive functional annotation available for the yeast genome.  Just as genes and their products are conserved across the kingdoms of life, interactions between genes, and the principles that govern the outcome of those interactions, are likely to be conserved.  Thus, findings from the study will inform our understanding of the genetic architecture of quantitative traits in model and non-model organisms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;The project will contribute to an understanding of how genes interact with potential applications to improving agricultural breeding practices. This work will have a number of broader impacts in undergraduate and science education, inclusion of underrepresented groups, and enhancement of scientific understanding. The project will include undergraduates, underrepresented minorities and students from primarily undergraduate institutions. It will involve training scientists in genetics, computational biology and microbiology at the graduate and undergraduate level. In addition, the project will include an outreach program that provides high school students with the opportunity to work in a laboratory environment. High school students from diverse backgrounds will be provided with training in experimental and computational biology and undertake an independent research project in the laboratory. The project will provide mentorship so that high school students can submit their research to national science competitions. Concomitant with the proposed project, a new integrative course for undergraduate students will be developed that combines instruction in statistics, genetics and computing.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Adaptive evolution is the process by which beneficial inherited changes in DNA sequences become more prevalent in a population.  To study how repeatable adaptive evolution is we performed evolution experiments in the laboratory.  We used the single-celled microbe, baker?s yeast, and grew them in selective environments in which the cells experienced a continuous nutrient stress.  We focused our studies on environments that had low amounts of nitrogen to ask how the cells evolve when nitrogen is the scarce resource.  Many natural environments contain very low amounts of nitrogen, so these conditions mimic some natural conditions.  We allowed the cells to evolve for hundreds of generations and then used DNA sequencing to identify the mutations that had occurred in their genomes that enabled them to grow better in environments containing low amounts of nitrogen.  Our study revealed that many of the mutations conferred improved abilities to acquire the nitrogen in the environment.  One class of mutations that we frequently identified are known as copy number variants.  These mutations result in increased copies of the DNA that contain genes required for transporting nitrogen.  Having more of the DNA results in more of the encoded protein being produced and thus these cells can acquire more of the nitrogen that is available in the environment and proliferate faster than other cells.  By testing different types of nitrogen, we found that the sections of DNA that are increased in copy number are very specific depending on the type of nitrogen.  In similar experiments, we also identified an interesting example in which a protein known as a transcription factor, that turns on genes required for using nitrogen, repeatedly acquired mutations that enabled it to turn on those genes with greater efficiency.  Interestingly, we found that in some cases specific mutations were only useful if they occurred in the context of other specific mutations.   Many of these studies were performed by graduate students in our laboratory.  However, the work also involved several undergraduate and high school students who had some of their first exposure to experimental evolutionary biology by participating in these studies.  Ultimately, understanding how single cells evolve to improve their ability to live in nutrient poor environments may contribute to industrial applications such as the production of biofuels and to our understanding of the process of evolution at the molecular level.
