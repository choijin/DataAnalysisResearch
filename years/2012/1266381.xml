<AbstractNarration>Agriculture drives environmental change. Landowners who do not manage their land effectively may experience large losses in production, especially in the face of environmental change.  Drought over time decreases agricultural production even more, making farmers increasingly vulnerable to change.  Such is the case in Oklahoma's Cimarron County and New Mexico's Union County.  Both locations are nationally important cattle and agricultural producers. Yet, drought, changing cattle and agricultural markets, governmental policies, and invasive plants that compete with native grasses threaten cattle and agricultural production and other land use. Since 2000, the region has been experiencing an "extreme" (D3) to "exceptional" (D4) drought. These are the most severe categories of droughts possible. Land managers have to make increasingly difficult land use decisions in order to sustain production, and to feed their families, as well as the rest of the country. This study explores how land users' respond and rebound under such extreme environmental conditions. The study will use a mixed methods approach including surveys, observations, focus groups and oral histories to understand what is currently happening to farmers and ranchers in Cimarron County and Union County.  Researchers will also develop a Geographic Information Systems (GIS) database with historical and census data to map out how land uses change over time, and how these changes impact farm families. The research team will include graduate students to help with the study. In addition, forty undergraduate students will also get the opportunity to experience fieldwork in the region and to study land use changes too. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Land users must become more resilient when facing increasingly harsh environmental conditions.  The study will look at which land users become vulnerable, as well as why and when they are subject to a loss of or decrease in the quality of their livelihoods. Likewise, the study will also look at how land users adapt to extreme drought conditions and what factors make some land users less vulnerable than others. Results will reveal the ways in which land users become more resilient or able to bounce back.  Given that such drought conditions are expected to continue, the project will create usable and timely findings. The study results will be given out to local land users, policymakers, and researchers. User-friendly results will be disseminated to local communities and policy makers in Oklahoma and New Mexico. Copies of the land maps created by the team will be shared with the local County Assessors Offices.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Agriculture is essential for life. Family farms remain an important part of the fabric of American society and history. Agriculture can also contribute to local, regional, and, global environmental changes, such as aquifer drawdown, soil erosion, biodiversity loss, invasive species introduction, and watershed capacity loss. These environmental changes may be further compounded during periods of weather extremes, such as prolonged, cyclical drought. Prolonged drought may decrease agriculture production, making farmers and ranchers increasingly vulnerable to environmental change. Local, regional, and national land and water policy may serve to mitigate or exacerbate such vulnerability. Such is the scenario that recently played out in the Southern Great Plains. From ~2000 to 2015, the region experienced &ldquo;extreme&rdquo; (D3) to &ldquo;exceptional&rdquo; (D4) drought. As land managers struggled to sustain production, they made land use decisions based not only on complex economic factors and land and water policy, but also past experiences (e.g. the 1930s Dust Bowl).</p> <p>This human-environment study explored how land users' responded under extreme environmental conditions, economic hardships, and varying governmental policy. Specifically, this study used a mixed-methods approach, including household surveys, landscape analysis, focus groups, oral histories, and community meetings to understand the vulnerability and resilience of farmers and ranchers in two counties in the Southern Great Plains, Cimarron County, OK and Union County, NM. Despite similar frontier histories and demographics, they are governed by different public land policy and regional and state water rights. The study looked at how drought and land use changes impact the local and regional environment. Likewise, the study analyzed how and which land users better adapt to extreme drought conditions, and what factors make some land users more vulnerable than others. At the regional scale, this involved the production of times-series land cover datasets and historical land ownership datasets; at the community scale, the recording of oral histories and key informant interviews and hosting of focus groups and community meetings; and at the household scale, 120 household surveys.</p> <p>Results indicate that agriculturalists respond differently to pressures wrought by persistent and severe drought. These responses are influenced, in part, by federal, state, regional, and local land and water policies (Fig1). In particular, results show that access to public lands during times of drought help land managers better cope with changes in stocking capacity. At the same time, differing public land policy makes some users potentially more vulnerable during extreme drought, as some ranchers find they are required to vacate pubic lands or dramatically reduce their herds. Overall, public land and ground water policies impact socio-ecological resilience in complex ways, offering both opportunities and constraints for land managers. A regional land change analysis from 1992-2011 found an increase in grassland degradation and loss through woody plant encroachment across both counties (Fig2). The largest gains in woody vegetation occurred on the highly contested state lands of Cimarron, suggesting that state land governance impacts land management decisions, household adaptation, and overall grassland health (Fig3).</p> <p>Access to groundwater and groundwater policy impacts socio-ecological resilience. Using repeat aerial photography (1950s-present) to quantify Center Pivot Irrigation (CPI) growth illustrated how CPI dramatically increased in both counties from 1950-1980 (Fig4). However, as prolonged drought continued, CPI continued to increase in Cimarron, while decreasing in Union through the 2010s (Fig5). Utilizing key informant interviews to supplement remote sensing analyses, these differences were attributed to drought-related agricultural changes, aquifer depletion, and, most importantly, water governance policies. Results illustrate that while households initially adopted CPI to lower household vulnerability to drought, the depleting aquifer and rising associated costs and increasing perceived competition between family farms and corporate farms have resulted in many households feeling increasingly more vulnerable. Overall, this research illustrates how public land and water policy impacts socio-ecological resilience in the Southern Great Plains.</p> <p>This project resulted in the following tangible deliverables: sixty oral histories were conducted with residents and publically archived exploring frontier, agricultural, and Dust Bowl histories. Additional deliverables include two separate land-use/land-cover change map series showing land change over time, in particular woody plant encroachment; four adaptive co-management workshops with local residents; multiple maps, research posters, presentations, and factsheets presented at local, regional, and national conferences and community engagement events; two master&rsquo;s thesis projects; student-produced tourism documents; multiple peer-reviewed articles in international journals; an edited special issue; an edited book volume; and a project website for dissemination of results and other information. Broader impacts include the direct mentoring of one post-doctoral fellow, four PhD students, five master&rsquo;s students, and ten undergraduate students (~40% of which were minority or female). Additionally, 60+ undergraduate and graduate students were introduced to mixed-method socio-ecological field research. Lastly, this project had outreach, collaboration, and/or data sharing arrangements with approximately a dozen museums, heritage centers, libraries, and other entities and organizations. Lastly, two of the project PIs continue to work in the study area addressing these issues.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 07/29/2018<br>      Modified by: Peter&nbsp;Kedron</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1266381/1266381_10243567_1532868315479_Fig1_conceptualframework--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1266381/1266381_10243567_1532868315479_Fig1_conceptualframework--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Proposed framework for coupled human and natural systems (CHANS) studies."><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1266381/1266381_10243567_1532868315479_Fig1_conceptualframework--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Proposed framework for coupled human and natural systems (CHANS) studies."></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Linkages between human actions, landscape patterns, and social and ecological processes occur at and across scale(s).</div> <div class="imageCredit">Source: The authors, Vadjunec et al.
