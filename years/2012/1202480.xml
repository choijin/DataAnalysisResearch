<AbstractNarration>The proposed Mid-Level Upstate Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (ULSAMP)- Clarkson University, Cornell University, Monroe Community College (MCC), Onondaga Community College (OCC), Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI), Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT), and Syracuse University (Lead Institution) - will build on, refine, and further institutionalize recruitment and retention interventions implemented in the first award cycle. The Alliance will also pilot new programming to boost the recruitment and retention of freshman and sophomore students, and employ research-proven, early-intervention strategies to enhance retention of upper level students for increased baccalaureate degree attainment and foster graduate matriculation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recruitment efforts will use a two-pronged approach: a) expanding the network of articulation agreements between two- and four-year colleges within and beyond the Alliance; and b) targeting nationwide "geographies of opportunity" by extending such 2+2 arrangements to cities such as New York, Washington DC, Atlanta, Los Angeles, and Miami. The retention of first- and second-year students will be supported by improving both the academic preparation of students and the instructional performance of the STEM faculty who teach them. Pre-freshman summer bridge programs and academic "boot camps" will emphasize both college orientation and university-level skills in math and/or biology and chemistry. Syracuse University will also pilot a pre-sophomore Summer Scholars Program combining coursework in mathematics and science fundamentals with hands-on, faculty-mentored research as well as leadership training. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Beyond directly increasing the representation of African American, Latino American, and Native American students in STEM industries, research labs, and the professoriate, ULSAMP will: 1) contribute to the nation's knowledge base and best practices in recruitment, retention, and effective STEM education by developing, piloting, assessing, disseminating, replicating and institutionalizing successful interventions and collaborative approaches in these areas; and 2) further institutional transformation at seven key institutions of higher education in New York State, leaving them better prepared to engage with an increasingly diverse student body and to meet regional and national demands for a high-tech workforce and research community.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The goal of the Upstate Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (ULSAMP) is to recruit, retain, and graduate an increasing number of underrepresented minority (African-Americans, Alaskan Natives, American Indians, Hispanic Americans, Native Hawaiians, and Native Pacific Islanders) students in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) fields and to provide early student research experiences to foster graduate school enrollment. During Phase I (2007-2012), ULSAMP achieved significant results in increasing the entry, retention, and graduation of URM students, focusing its efforts on assisting students with bridging key transitions: from high school to college; from college into graduate school; and ultimately into a rewarding career in STEM. Phase I of ULSAMP provided financial support, career building opportunities and academic support for students. ULSAMP is a partnership between seven institutions in Upstate New York: Clarkson University, Cornell University, Monroe Community College (MCC), Onondaga Community College (OCC), Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI), Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT), and Syracuse University (SU).

Major emphases of Phase II include increasing partnerships with the ULSAMP two-year institutions, OCC and MCC, and increasing communication and collaborative planning throughout ULSAMP. As in past years, partners were able to leverage resources to establish additional research opportunities for ULSAMP students.

This increased institutionalization took the form of new hires to support diversity programs, dedicated admissions staff or resources to support the recruitment of URM students in STEM disciplines, and institutional support for LSAMP research opportunities. ULSAMP recognizes the importance of providing outreach to K-12 students in upstate New York. Consequently, the ULSAMP team has identified opportunities to leverage university and corporate funding to support pre-college initiatives without using the LSAMP funding for K-12 activities. As a result of the work of ULSAMP, there has been an increase in the number of URM students entering the STEM pipeline, receiving STEM degrees, and enrolling in graduate programs.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 11/29/2017<br>      Modified by: Tamara&nbsp;N&nbsp;Hamilton</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>

Interacting with K-12 students and alumni continued to be a focus of the project. ULSAMP activities were promoted through the website, social media, research presentations by scholars, and "best practices" sessions facilitated by project directors.     Below are the objectives of the Mid-Level ULSAMP project:     Objective 1:  Increase the freshman enrollment of URM students in the STEM disciplines at four-year ULSAMP institutions by 15% above the 2012 baseline.     Objective 2:  Increase the number of students transferring from Alliance and non-Alliance member community colleges to four-year STEM studies at Alliance universities by 20% above the 2012-2013 baseline.     Objective 3:  Increase the total enrollment of URM students in the STEM disciplines by 50% above the three-year average for the 2010-2012 periods.     Objective 4:  Increase the baccalaureate degree attainment of URM students in STEM disciplines by 75% above the three-year average for the 2010-2012 periods.     Objective 5:  Increase the number of URM graduates of the four-year ULSAMP institutions pursuing graduate studies in STEM disciplines by 15% above the 2012-2013 baseline.     Below are ULSAMP outcomes over time:     The total fall enrollment for undergraduate URM students at ULSAMP institutions increased from 1,943 STEM students in 2007 to 3,594 students in 2016.      The total number of URM STEM      bachelor degrees awarded by ULSAMP institutions increased from 249 in      2007-2008 to 611 in 2016-2017.      Since 2007, ULSAMP institutions      have awarded 4,186 STEM degrees to URM students.       Each year ULSAMP activities      support over 200 URM STEM students.
