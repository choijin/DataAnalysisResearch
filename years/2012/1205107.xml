<AbstractNarration>This collaborative project is developing a regional and comprehensive education program by expanding on a previously funded "urban" sustainable agriculture program at Seattle Central Community College (SCCC).  Together with Skagit Valley College, SCCC, and Washington State University, Edmonds Community College is developing educational initiatives to increase the number and quality of sustainable urban and small farm agriculture technician professionals.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit:  The program is preparing and training students as technicians in sustainable agriculture, an emerging and ecologically important agricultural sector in the region's economy.  Moreover, the program is helping the region develop expertise in securing the basic food needs of our growing and urbanizing populations.  By providing research, service-learning, and internship opportunities for students, the program is serving as the cornerstone of contemporary curricula at various institutions to develop needed and advanced training to the regions students that includes hands-on experience, private sector partnerships, and the use of spatially-appropriate innovative technologies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts:  This proposal is providing educational and training opportunities for students to be more competitive for green-collar jobs in agricultural production, processing, distribution, and retail, a growing and ecologically sustainable sector of our agricultural economy.  Particular to urban and suburban environments, opportunities exist for merging the education and career fields of horticulture and landscaping with sustainable agriculture as entrepreneurial businesses in edible landscape design, installation, and maintenance in response to residential and commercial demand.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The Sustainable Agriculture Education (SAgE) Collaborative 2012-16 NSF ATE Project grant was led by Edmonds Community College (ECC) in partnership with Skagit Valley College (SVC), Seattle Central College (SCC), and Washington State University (WSU). The genesis of the SAgE Collaborative stems from an understanding of the imperative action that we as a global society must take to steward our local ecosystems and natural resources in concert with securing the basic food needs of our growing and urbanizing populations, and the recognition that community colleges, and education institutions in general, play a pivotal role in the advancement of such action. The mission of the SAgE Collaborative is to <em>use innovative education, cooperative research, and community partnerships to address the coupled environmental and ecological processes and socioeconomic, political, and cultural complexities related to sustainable urban and small farm agriculture and food system enterprises within and beyond the Puget Sound bioregion and Washington State</em>. As an NSF ATE Project grant awardee, the SAgE Collaborative strived toward the goal of increasing the number of specialists who have the education and training to meet current and projected workforce demand in these sustainable agriculture sectors.</p> <p>Building upon its 2009-11 NSF ATE Project grant led by SCC, SAgE expanded its disciplinary and geographical reach by collaborating with two additional community colleges in the North Puget Sound bioregion. In so doing, SAgE became a &lsquo;Collaborative&rsquo; that now offers three programs of study comprised of both common theoretical and applied courses and distinct specialty courses which reflect program emphases&ndash;<em>ECC SAgE Urban Agriculture Program</em>, <em>SVC SAgE Small Farm Agriculture Program</em>, and <em>SCC SAgE Food Systems Program</em>. As a precursor to the establishment of these programs, SAgE facilitated two Developing-A-CurriculUM (DACUM) workshops and one Systematic Curriculum &amp; Instructional Development (SCID) workshop with industry sector stakeholders that, respectively, identified competencies required to perform sustainable agriculture work profiles and pedagogical approaches to competency instruction. As a result, SAgE newly designed or redesigned 36 courses, nine of which are distance education courses, and two internship courses. A combination of these and existing courses provided the foundation with which to construct 14 stackable certificates within the ECC SAgE and SVC SAgE professional-technical programs and enhance the associates degree emphasis within the SCC SAgE academic-transfer program. Furthermore, SAgE courses and program transfer degrees were designed to articulate with the WSU Agricultural &amp; Food Systems Bachelor of Science majors in <em>Organic Agriculture Systems</em> and <em>Agriculture &amp; Food Security</em>.</p> <p>While creating an education and training pipeline from two-year to four-year higher education institutions is critical to workforce development, SAgE also partnered with four secondary schools through the establishment of articulation agreements that qualify students who enroll in a high school SAgE <em>Agroecology</em> course to achieve five credits toward a SAgE college credential. These partnerships, in addition to others in-progress, were initiated during two annual SAgE Institutes where participant secondary school educators and administrators learned about SAgE programming, agroecological curriculum, and opportunities for course adoption and transferability. In support of this three tiered academic development strategy, and as a resource for high school and college advisors, SAgE produced an <em>Education to Career Pathways Guide in Sustainable Agriculture</em> for both traditional and emergent employment opportunities that aligns job categories, titles, and wages with graduated levels of education typically required to successfully perform these jobs.</p> <p>SAgE programs provide a theoretical foundation in agriculture through the study of environmental sustainability principles, ecology in agricultural systems, and plant and soil sciences; but there is also a combined practical focus on agriculture production and enterprises. The production emphasis trains students to cultivate organic food crops for year-round production and harvest in the maritime climate of the Puget Sound bioregion. And the enterprises emphasis trains students to design, plan, and operate agriculture systems relevant to urban environments&ndash;including backyard, vertical, rooftop, and community gardens, micro-farms, and food hubs and markets, and small farm environments&ndash;including the development of farm management and business plans and associated best agricultural practices tailored to wholesale and direct market enterprises. Applied training experience is acquired in greenhouses and learning gardens on each SAgE college campus, in cooperation with three SAgE college service area community partners demonstrating agricultural innovations, and on two student experimental and working farms&ndash;the <em>SAgE Sammamish Valley Student Farm</em> and <em>SAgE Skagit Valley Student Farm</em>&ndash;where students take on-farm courses, fulfill service-learning objectives, and engage in &lsquo;seed-to-sales&rsquo; real-world agricultural operations associated with the <em>SAgE Student Farms-to-Campus Program</em>.</p> <p>The two SAgE NSF ATE Project grants collectively supported the advancement of sustainable agriculture education and workforce development and training in the North Puget Sound bioregional of western Washington and contributed to the agriculture and food system knowledge and skills that hundreds of diverse SAgE students are employing in both their daily lives and in pursuit of jobs and entrepreneurial endeavors in a greening economy.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 10/15/2016<br>      Modified by: Jason&nbsp;Niebler</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div
