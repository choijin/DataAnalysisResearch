<AbstractNarration>The tree of life links all biodiversity through a shared evolutionary history. This project will produce the first online, comprehensive first-draft tree of all 1.8 million named species, accessible to both the public and scientific communities. Assembly of the tree will incorporate previously published results, with strong collaborations between computational and empirical biologists to develop, test and improve methods of data synthesis. This initial tree of life will not be static; instead, we will develop tools for scientists to update and revise the tree as new data come in. Early release of the tree and tools will motivate data sharing and facilitate ongoing synthesis of knowledge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Biological research of all kinds, including studies of ecological health, environmental change, and human disease, increasingly depends on knowing how species are related to each other. Yet there is no single resource that unites knowledge of the tree of life.  Instead, only small parts of the tree are individually available, generally as printed figures in journal articles. This project will provide the global community of scientists who study the tree of life with a means to share and combine their results, and will enable large-scale studies of Earth's biodiversity. It will also create a resource where students, educators and citizens can go to explore and learn about life's evolutionary history.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Gude lab at Michigan State University is one of ten collaborating university labs in the Open Tree of Life Project. The goal of the Gude lab was to build a web-based interactive tool that would engage and teach the public about evolutionary biology and all of its moving parts.  We also created a social media campaign to raise awareness for the project, so you'll find us on Twitter and Facebook.  Our website presents three distinct, interactive diagrams of the phylogenetic [evolutionary] tree. These diagrams have "branches" that infer evolutionary relationships between various species on the panet. You can scroll, spin, zoom, watch, listen and generally explore the content to discover new things along the way.   The three graphic trees are:   1) "Big Picture" Tree: A pulled back tree, a graphic representation that showcases six key elements surrounding evolutionary biology. This version of the tree is packed with interactive content including videos that explain each of the six elements in greater detail, pop-up, descriptive text blocks and audio options versions of this text. The six elements are:   There is a single origin of life. Species get some of their traits through lateral gene transfer, traits of species moving across the three domains of life. There are three domains of life. Species have shared ancestors. Species disappear from the planet through extinction. There are many diverse species on the planet.     2) "Categorizing Life On Earth" Tree: A middle tree that is a more traditional display of a branching phylogenetic tree offering a selection of clades. The home screen of this tree displays a node representing single origin of life which then splits into the three domains.  The user is enticed by pulsating nodes to explore this tree. When a node is clicked on, the tree flows deeper into the tree.    3) "Explore Species" Tree: A drilled down spinning wheel that allows the user to explore roughly 200 species from across the tree by linking to the Encyclopedia of Life database. Each species is represented by a wedge (think pie chart) on the wheel and as a user mouses over a each wedge a pop-up box appears that displays an image of the species (if available) and its name. When clicked on, a wedge spins around to the right side of the wheel where an information box displays detailed information about that particular species.
