<AbstractNarration>This award to New Mexico State University (NMSU) is for the acquisition of a state-of-the-art high resolution atomic force microscope (AFM) system.  The instrument will be installed in a readily-accessible centralized core facility that supports the NMSU main campus and five satellite community colleges. AFM is an indispensable tool in characterizing surface topography on the nanoscale via phase or force imaging.  It will enhance process development and analysis of nanostructured materials as well as provide a new resource to probe specific and dynamic interactions of complex physic-chemical, biological, and agricultural systems.  A multidisciplinary group of junior and senior faculty from  the Colleges of Engineering; Arts and Sciences; and Agricultural, Consumer and Environmental Sciences with active research programs will expand their investigations and teaching into nanoscience and nanotechnology by employing the unique capabilities of the AFM. Specific research projects that will directly benefit from the instrument include thin film morphology of nonmetals (such as graphene), metals, metal-oxides, nitrides, carbides, and their nanocomposites; surface functionalization of nanomaterials and microstructural changes in material surfaces; imaging in soft biological and agricultural materials; electrochemical investigation on addressable array platforms; and, optical, magnetic, and electrical properties of materials, etc.    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The new AFM will impact not only the specific research programs, but also help to catalyze and promote a broader, college-wide initiative in materials research and education at NMSU. The centrally-located instrument will significantly enhance the research and breadth of capabilities of more than one-hundred faculty, staff, and students. In addition, this modern AFM includes design features for ease-of-use and versatility for multi-disciplinary applications that facilitate high quality educational training and will be used for student training, classroom demonstrations, and sponsored workshops.  This project bridges the gap between the classroom and the research lab. The combination of a modern AFM in a managed core facility with established informal and formal training for a multi-disciplinary user base will have a positive impact on nanoscience and microscopic imaging research and education in southern New Mexico, the borderland region, and beyond.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The coordinated purpose for obtaining a modern scanning probe microscope for use by the science and engineering faculty and student body at New Mexico State University was to make this important new type of research tool readily available for sponsored research and educational training.  The new microscope was installed in a dedicated workspace adjacent to other types of high performance microscopes, and the facility has been operating through a managed schedule that includes professional supervision, data management and instrument maintenance.  Approximately 50 student users have been trained to obtain scientific results with the microscope independently for over 30 faculty researchers, and almost one-half of the students were female and/or under-represented minorities.  In addition to the diverse research applications, the new microscope was featured in classroom-related training sessions in university courses for biology, chemical engineering, nanoscience and nanotechnology and agricultural extension education in addition to facility tours for the engineering college and annually, middle school students in the Las Cruces Public School System.  Through these classroom and outreach activities, the working microscope has been demonstrated to several hundred students and members of the public over the course of the term of the grant.  Through scientific collaborative arrangements of NMSU faculty with other scientists in the borderland and other locations in the USA, the microscope has been instrumental in a broad range of research programs and contributed imaging results to many research presentations and scientific publications. Since the microscope represents a cutting edge technology, the continuing use of this instrument in training and research at NMSU for new and different applications is expected to contribute further over the coming decade to the attainment of important scientific and engineering skills and knowledge for students and faculty and thereby the Nation through the population of New Mexico.
