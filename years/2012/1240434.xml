<AbstractNarration>This award supports the continued representation of the United States in the Scientific Committee on Solar-Terrestrial Physics (SCOSTEP) of the International Council for Science (ICSU). SCOSTEP organizes and conducts international solar-terrestrial physics programs of finite duration in cooperation with other ICSU bodies, including the Committee of Space Research (COSPAR), International Association of Geomagnetism and Aeronomy (IAGA), International Association of Meteorology and Atmospheric Sciences (IAMAS), International Astronomical Union (IAU), International Union of Pure and Applied Physics (IUPAP), International Union of Geodesy and Geophysics (IUGG), Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research (SCAR), and the International Union of Radio Science (URSI). SCOSTEP's principal tasks are to promote, organize, and coordinate international interdisciplinary programs and symposia in solar-terrestrial physics (STP), and to define the data relating to these programs that should be exchanged through data centers. Through its programs, SCOSTEP advances scientific knowledge of solar terrestrial physics, supports a globally-aware and engaged STP community, and promotes the development of early-career STP scientists. SCOSTEP provides a forum where scientists from different disciplines can interact, generate ideas, and implement activities along and across disciplinary lines. SCOSTEP's current scientific program is the Climate and Weather of the Sun-Earth System (CAWSES), which is designed to significantly enhance the understanding of the space environment and its impacts on life and society. The U.S. continues to have a substantial scientific and leadership role in SCOSTEP, and the U.S. dues support these activities.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The National Academy of Sciences (NAS) serves the U.S. national member of the International Council for Science (ICSU) and many of its scientific unions, programs, and committees.  Eight of the ICSU-related unions are actively engaged in the Scientific Committee for Solar Terrestrial Physics (SCOSTEP).  SCOSTEP works in cooperation with these other ICSU unions to organize and conduct international solar-terrestrial physics research programs of finite duration.  SCOSTEP also organizes cross-disciplinary meetings, workshops, and conferences, and facilitates cross-project cooperation and multi-national research collaboration.    Funding for SCOSTEP comes primarily from the annual national member dues.  This grant provided the U.S. dues to SCOSTEP from 2013 through 2016, and funded coordination efforts among the U.S. national committees that correspond to the scientific unions participating in SCOSTEP.   The SCOSTEP Coordinating Group at the NAS includes representatives from the U.S. National Committees for:  Committee of Space Research (COSPAR) International Association of Geomagnetism and Aeronomy (IAGA) [1] International Association of Meteorology and Atmospheric Sciences (IAMAS) [2] International Astronomical Union (IAU) International Union of Pure and Applied Physics (IUPAP) International Union of Geodesy and Geophysics (IUGG) Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research (SCAR) International Union of Radio Science (URSI)    SCENTIFIC MERIT  Until December 2013, SCOSTEPÆs primary scientific program was Climate and Weather of the Sun-Earth System (CAWSES).  CAWSES was one of the longest running and most successful of SCOSTEPÆs programs.   Its goal was to enhance understanding of the space environment and its impacts on life and society. It fulfilled this goal by coordinating international activities in observations, modeling, and applications; involving scientists in both developed and developing countries; and providing educational opportunities for students of all levels.  CAWSES increased STP funding in several countries, and this enabled new joint research opportunities for U.S. scientists.   CAWSES addressed four overarching questions: What are the solar influences on Earth's climate?  How will geospace respond to an altered climate?  How does short-term solar variability affect the geospace environment?  What is the geospace response to variable waves from the lower atmosphere?   U.S. scientists participated in Task Groups on each of these topics, and results were shared broadly.  Beginning in 2014, CAWSES was replaced by a new scientific program:  Variability of the Sun and Its Terrestial Impact (VarSITI).  VarSITI will run through 2018.  It is studying the causes and consequences of weak solar activity during cycle 24.  The program has four themes:  Solar evolution, Solar-stellar connection to understand dynamo and extreme events; Origin, propagation, and Earth impact of transient events (flares, CEs, CIRs, SEPs); Inner magnetosphere and its connection to geospace and the Sun; and EarthÆs atmosphere with energy input from above and below.   Three of these have project co-leaders from the United States:  Petrus Martens, Montana State University (SEE); Jie Zhang, George Mason University (ISEST); and Jacob Bortnik, University of California, Los Angeles (SPeCIMEN).   The SCOSTEP Coordinating Group at the National Academy of Sciences has three purposes:  To pass information about SCOSTEP to all the relevant      U.S. national committees; To bring to SCOSTEPÆs attention any concerns or issues      that the USNCs have; and To provide a forum where representatives from each of      the interested USNCs share thoughts and ideas about SCOSTEP programs.   The Coordinating Group held regular conference calls during the grant period.  Nat Gopalswamy, the U.S.-based president of SCOSTEP, participated in all calls.  The information provided during these calls was subsequently shared with the related U.S. national committees.  No in-per...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
