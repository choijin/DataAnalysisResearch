<AbstractNarration>This research project will examine the timing and causes of ice ages in the Southern Hemisphere and how these observed climate changes compare with those found in the Northern Hemisphere.  A major question in the earth-system sciences has been ascertaining what drives different sections of Earth to switch in and out of ice age climates.  This is an outstanding question that remains unresolved. The traditional Milankovitch or orbital "ice-age theory" proposes that the intensity of summer insolation received in the Northern Hemisphere paces ice ages across Earth.  Measurements of the intensity of summer insolation in the Northern and Southern hemispheres have been found to be out of phase, however.  If glaciers expand and retreat in similar ways around Earth at the same time, other driving mechanisms therefore must be involved, such as greenhouse gasses or a global impact of the largest ice sheets that covered the land in the Northern Hemisphere.  A problem is that in the Southern Hemisphere, there is insufficient information regarding when the last cold glacial period started, how long it lasted, and when it ended.  Without this information, scientists are ill-equipped to assess how well Southern Hemisphere glacial climates correspond to possible driving forces, such as changes in (orbital) solar insolation intensity, Northern Hemisphere ice sheets, and atmospheric carbon dioxide.  They also are unable to assess the underlying causes of ice-age climates and to refine the Milankovitch theory.  This project will focus on the collection and analyses of materials that help document how glaciers in southern South America have changed over time.  The investigators will employ state-of-the-art techniques in dating glacier landforms and glacial-climate modeling. The dated paleogeography of glaciers will provide boundary conditions for experiments using models developed by the researchers and others to assess the roles and responses associated with possible climate parameters, such as temperature and precipitation ranges that are needed for an ice sheet to grow and retreat over the southern Andes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will provide deeper understanding of the nature and causes of ice age climates and related natural environmental processes as well as their spatial and temporal differences around the globe.  The project also will provide enhanced information about natural climate states, such as the climate during the last ice age that can be used as test beds for general circulation models that simulate future change.  The project will provide opportunities to enhance international research collaborations between scientists in the U.S. and Chile.  Education and training opportunities will be provided for undergraduate students, and educational outreach will be pursued through collaborative relationships with the American Museum of Natural History and New York City schools.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This research utilizes a numerical ice sheet model to reconstruct the former Patagonian Ice Sheet, and then test the sensitivity of the simulated ice sheet and selected outlet glaciers to changes in temperature and precipitation climate.  Targeted sites include the regions Ba&ntilde;o Nuevo (~45&deg;S) and Strait of Magellan (~53&deg;S), which are mapped for glacier deposits by project collaborators at the Lamont-Doerty Earth Observatory at the University of Columbia.  The overarching aim of this research is to gain a greater understanding of the climate characteristics of southern South America at the height of the last ice age about 20,000 years ago, an interval known as the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM).  Knowledge of past climate variability provides baseline information that can improve future climate projections.  Glacier simulations in this work are made using the University of Maine Ice Sheet Model (UMISM).  UMISM requires input bed topography (Figure 1) and monthly mean temperature and precipitation climatology, both supplied to the model on grids representing modern conditions.  The climate variables are input from reanalysis, a type of weather model derived from recent historical data.  Past climate is then defined by prescribed changes in temperature and precipitation (for example, temperature for all months cooled by 5&deg;C and precipitation reduced by 20% in comparison to modern conditions).  Glaciers form in the model at gridcells where the climate settings afford a surplus of frozen precipitation at the end of each years; glaciers melt where the temperature is sufficiently high to melt all snow with a net excess of degree days.  A suite of UMISM experiments is conducted at high resolution for Ba&ntilde;o Nuevo and Strait of Magellan, and coarse resolution for the whole Patagonian Ice Sheet.  Key temperature-precipitation departures (&Delta;T and &Delta;P) afford simulated ice extents in good accord with LGM glacier features mapped by project collaborators.  These combinations are &Delta;T -5&deg;C and &Delta;P -20%, &Delta;T -4.5&deg;C and &Delta;P 100%, and &Delta;T -4.25&deg;C and &Delta;P +120% for Ba&ntilde;o Nuevo (northernmost site), and &Delta;T -5&deg;C and &Delta;P -50%, &Delta;T -4.5&deg;C and &Delta;P -70% for Strait of Magellan (southernmost site) (Figures 2-4).  These results suggest comparable cooling (4.25 to 5&deg;C) between both Ba&ntilde;o Nuevo and Strait of Magellan tied to a steep precipitation gradient from south (near the Antarctic) to north (middle latitudes).  LGM Strait of Magellan was likely much drier (50% precipitation reduction) than Ba&ntilde;o Nuevo (precipitation +/- 20% that of modern).  These results in general support a hypothesis based on previous proxy evidence collected from field researchers that moisture-bearing middle latitude westerly winds were shifted equatorward during the LGM.  Current generation climate models do not capture this dynamic, and thus fleshing out the mismatch remains an objective for future work.
