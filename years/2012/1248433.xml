<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research Program (SBIR) Phase I project is to demonstrate the feasibility of the environment resistant resonant sensor (ERRS) process which will enable a next generation of high performance and high reliability sensors. In the last 5 years, microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) inertial (motion) sensors have exploded into a wide range of consumer applications because they can be manufactured for &lt;$1 and are small enough to be integrated into mobile devices. In contrast, MEMS and other inertial sensors used in industrial, aerospace and military applications are significantly larger, more power hungry and extremely costly. This is because these devices require 50 to 100,000× better resolution/measurement stability (bias stability) and high reliability. MEMS gyroscopes (which measure angle change) have extreme difficulty achieving these performance levels because of their need for low vacuum pressure and their high temperature and vibration sensitivity. The ERRS process will address these challenges, with low vacuum pressures and a built in low-power oven and vibration isolation platform. Gyroscopes fabricated in the ERRS process are targeting state of the art performance (bias stabilities of 10 down to 0.01º/hour) at 1/100th the size (0.1 cubic centimeters (cc)) and 1/10th the price of currently available gyroscopes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will be to enable a next generation of cost efficient, high performance and high reliability applications enabled by inertial (motion) sensors. Inertial sensors have already had a huge impact in the cell phone and gaming industries because of their small size and cost efficiency. The work conducted here will enable extremely high performance gyroscopes (which measure angle change) for a host of commercial, military, aerospace and scientific endeavors. These include: handheld navigation systems for firefighters and troops; navigation of unmanned air vehicles for police, military and commercial applications such as real estate; motion control for industrial robots; precise satellite pointing for broadband internet; and targeting and navigation systems for every troop in the field. These sensors can also be used for surgical robots and wheel chair control. Scientific applications would include precise telescope pointing for terrestrial and space telescopes which look into space and to the earth (for studying the climate). This will also enable researchers to purchase state of the art motion control sensors for developing other new applications.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>IMUs consist of 3 accelerometers (which measure motion in a straight line in all 3 axes) and 3 gyroscopes (which measure angle changes in all 3-axes). Working together with the correct software, they can be used for navigation and orientation measurements in a wide range of applications. Microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) inertial (motion) sensors are now used for a wide range of consumer applications, but can&rsquo;t be used for higher performance applications because of their extreme environmental sensitivity&mdash;especially to temperature. In particular, the measurement (bias) stability of consumer grade gyroscopes is more than 100 degrees per hour per degree Celsius. This means that even with small outside temperature changes, these sensors cannot maintain bias stabilities of under 10 degrees per hour required for many industrial navigation applications. The proposed eIMU will address this by applying a micromachined physics package around a MEMS IMU in order to: 1) maintain a constant temperature during operation and 2) isolate it from humidity and outside stresses in the environment. The technical challenges include: i) developing an assembly process for reliably assembling the IMU dies in to the physics package; ii) optimizing the physics package for temperature stability and in order to prevent it from introducing any noise to the IMU and; iii) optimizing software algorithms for reducing the power required for temperature controlling the IMU. In this work, a new process was developed for manufacturing packages which stabilize the performance for gyroscopes and accelerometers by heating them to a constant temperature and isolating them from outside stresses. Testing of these packaged sensors demonstrated the feasibility for producing very small, low power and low cost inertial measurement units for near tactical grade inertial sensor performance.
