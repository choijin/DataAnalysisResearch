<AbstractNarration>We propose to hold a workshop among experts in Ross Sea, Antarctica, ecology in order to identify&lt;br/&gt;important factors that are likely to be affecting the Ross Sea in the near future, including&lt;br/&gt;both climate and more direct factors such as industrial fishing. On the basis of this information,&lt;br/&gt;a report will be generated concerning how uncertainties in this knowledge can best be addressed,&lt;br/&gt;including the use of technological advances in marine ecology. This information, in turn,&lt;br/&gt;will be used, in part, to adivse the US Department of State on a management plan required&lt;br/&gt;in the designation of the Ross Sea as a marine protected area under the jurisdiction of the&lt;br/&gt;Commission for the Conservation of Antartic Marine Living Resources.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

It was entitled, "Workshop to Identify Significant Uncertainties Concerning the Effects of Climate Change and the Antarctic Toothfish Fishery on the Ross Sea Marine Ecosystem," and was attended by 23 experts in Ross Sea marine ecology.  Most attendees presented a discussion pertinent to their respective expertise and in regard to Ross Sea food web structure and  function.
