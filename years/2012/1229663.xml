<AbstractNarration>The objective of this project is to acquire a scanning electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis (ESCA) microprobe to fill a critical gap in surface analysis capabilities and greatly expand research possibilities in surface science, biosensor, nanodevices etc. at Portland State University (PSU) and beyond. The approach is to install such a state-of-the-art surface characterization instrument at the Center for Electron Microscopy and Nanofabrication, a multi-user core research facility at PSU, subsequently offer professional training and research support to internal and external researchers and students as well as technical personnel from high-tech industry, expand existing and develop new courses.&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this project is the unique integration of the scanning ESCA microprobe with a low-surface-damage C60 sputtering source to provide high-resolution surface analysis capabilities, not currently available at the greater Portland Area. It will allow academic researchers and industrial technical personnel to accurately identify the chemical state and composition, band structures and further understand the surface nature of inorganic and organic nanomaterials.&lt;br/&gt;The broad impact of this project is that it will significantly 1) Enable research activities in over 18 NSF, DOD, DOE etc. projects totaling over $10M; 2) Expand the scientific impact of planned research proposals; 3) Provide unique opportunities for the interdisciplinary research training and education via existing and newly developed courses and training programs; 4) Facilitate new faculty recruitment and advance junior faculty career development; 5) Increase inter /intra university and industry collaborations with current partners, while stimulating new collaborations with potential partners.</AbstractNarration>
