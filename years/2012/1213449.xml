<AbstractNarration>Edwin L. Sibert of the University of Wisconsin is supported by an award from the Chemical Theory, Models and Computational Methods program in the Chemistry division to develop theoretical models of the CH stretch spectral region in order to enhance the power of this functional group as a probe of molecular structure.  The PI and his research group are systematically investigating a series of molecules in order to elucidate how local environment affects the couplings between the CH stretches and remaining degrees of freedom.   The models combine electronic structure theory with quantum treatments of molecular vibrations. They collaborate with the Zwier group at Purdue who provide the experimental spectra that enable them to calibrate and improve their models.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A theoretical understanding of the CH vibrations and their interactions with the local environment will greatly enhance the utility of this moiety as a probe of molecular structure, with the result that CH spectra can be used to enable experimentalist to gain new insights into processes ranging from protein-membrane interactions to hydrocarbon adsorption at solid surfaces. The PI is involved in organizing a Gordon conference workshop to bring together scientists working in this research area; he is also organizing the next Telluride School of Theoretical Chemistry.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In collaborative research with the Zwier group at Purdue as well as with experimentalists at other universities, we have worked to develop a model that has enhanced the scientific community?s ability to use the vibrations of molecules to probe local environment.  More specifically, the vibrations of CH and OH stretches were investigated for a variety of molecules and clusters.  The experimental results were obtained in the gas phase under ultra-cold conditions using a technique that allows one to obtain spectra associated with specific individual conformers.  This specificity enabled us to develop a theoretical model for predicting and interpreting the vibrational spectra for many conformers.  The model highlights the role of ring strain and nearest neighbor interactions.  The application of the local mode model has also provided important benchmarks for emerging methods for force field determination.   The intellectual merit of this work was the inventive melding of electronic structure theory, approximate solutions of the nuclear quantum mechanics, and the analysis of molecular spectroscopy in order to be able to predict spectra in what had previously been considered a spectral region that was too complex for obtaining useful insights of structural determination. This work has resulted in 13 publications in peer reviewed research journals, and the results have been presented at numerous scientific meetings.  The sound training in fundamentals received by the two funded graduate students allowed them go onto postdoctoral positions in highly selective research groups. Both a Gordon conference and a Telluride Summer School were organized by the Principle Investigator in order to facilitate the training and dissemination of ideas by a community of scientists working in this research area.
