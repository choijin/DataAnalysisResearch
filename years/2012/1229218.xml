<AbstractNarration>This project, acquiring a data center instrument, aims to conduct research on security and resilience. The goal is to design and verify a security architecture that features high scalability, good flexibility, and low complexity, and to develop and verify a systematic resilience scheme to provide differentiated resilience to various applications and optimize the failure recovery. The project also focuses on the deployment of the novel, hybrid security architecture (HSA), which decouples security from routing and enables the full distribution of the security devices in the DCN regardless of network topologies and routing schemes. This feature is expected to enable the perimeter defense model to become one in which the security checking and enforcement is much more integrated into the data center fabric.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The instrument will be used to study the modeling of the interactions between the application and lower networking layers. In addition, it will be used to design the protocols and interfaces between them, to develop QoS-aware fast failure recovery algorithms, as well as improve the application layer failure reactions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed instrument can greatly impact the evolution of secure data centers (in particular, multi-tenant data centers) toward higher capacity and better service provisioning. The results of the project will be disseminated via publications. The proposed software and hardware modules are expected to encourage research and commercialization. The proposed instrument should greatly impact education and student training, and is expected to also be shared with the research community also outside the institution.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In this project, we built a data center testbed with which we have successfully designed, prototyped and tested several security defense systems and resilience enhancement schemes. These systems and schemes are summarized below:  (1) An automated network appliance deployment system;  (2) A data center anomaly detection framework along with a set of algorithms that detects anomalies in data centers based on statistical data analysis;  (3) A distributed and coordinated defense system (SDNShield) to prevent Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks on Software Defined Networking (SDN) control plane.  (4) A wildcard rule caching scheme that resolves the dependency issue with minimal cache space usage.  (5) A flow table management scheme that better preserves the scarce flow table resource in SDN switches to prevent table from overflowing.  The built data center testbed has demonstrated its ability to perform run-time test with various applications running on the platform. Research performed on the data center testbed has led to 11 papers, 5 issued patents, and two pending patent applications.  The testbed consists of tens of servers, more than ten switches, and other equipment. These resources have become valuable asset in NYU for both research and education. After the completion of this project, these resources will continue to generate outcome for our future research in the data center area. The testbed has also been used in two graduate-level courses: "Data Center and Cloud Computing" and "High Speed Networks", which gave students hand-on opportunities on configure and operation of data center equipment. We have obtained a large volume of traffic traces from a production data center. The data becomes valuable asset for us to conduct research in the data center, including but not limited to anomaly detection, intrusion defense, traffic engineering, congestion control, etc.  The students that participated in the project had gained hand-on experiences on the data center design, setup, and operations, which gave them great advantages when they go to job interviews. Two PhD students that completed their PhD research under the support of this grant have joined Fortinet and Pala Alto Networks, two major network security companies in US.  Most of MS students participated in the project joined major networking companies after thwir graduation, including Cisco, Google, Facebook, Yahoo, Fortinet, Pala Alto Networks, etc.          Last Modified: 12/18/2017       Submitted by: H.
