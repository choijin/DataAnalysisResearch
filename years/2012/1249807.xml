<AbstractNarration>This award provides funding for the 8th annual Conferences for Undergraduate Women in Physics and for a formative assessment of the effectiveness of the conferences in meeting their goals. The next conferences will take place on January 18-20, 2013, simultaneously at Caltech, Colorado School of Mines, Cornell University, the University of Central Florida, University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign and the University of Texas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conferences have two overarching goals: 1) To give undergraduate women the resources, motivation, and confidence to apply to graduate school and to successfully complete a Ph.D. in physics or a related discipline; and 2) To increase awareness by undergraduate women in physics of the wide range of career opportunities available to them. Regional conferences are held simultaneously to maximize student attendance by minimizing travel, to increase the excitement of the participants in a joint national venture, and to allow the interactive simulcast of a keynote address. The conference goals are achieved by providing a series of inspiring talks by female physicists, panel discussions on graduate school and physics careers, student presentation sessions, and ample opportunity for networking and informal mentoring. The success of these goals will be measured by surveys given to students before and after the conferences, as well as by longitudinal studies following the students' post-graduation paths and comparing them with female student cohorts who did not attend the conferences.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Conference for Undergraduate Women in Physics is aimed at retaining female physics students.  At the conference, participants have the opportunity to build the skills and knowledge for success, see the wealth of career opportunities, and meet and network with both senior women physicists and other students.  We hope that they will return to their home institution with increased enthusiasm, and serve as ambassadors for physics to their families, friends and fellow students.   The conference hosted at Cornell was in very high demand, with 135 attendees selected from ~220 applicants. The conference featured a number of elements:  Workshops on tips for international students, creating a physics community at your school, fellowship opportunities and studying abroad, Networking 101, and applying to graduate school.   Panels on career options and graduate school  A skit about being a woman in physics Grad School and Career Fair with representation from a number of programs Refereed Poster and Talk Sessions by the undergraduate participants.   Tours of six campus laboratories Presentations on a broad range of topics in science and      technology, including particle physics, nuclear physics, laser physics and      biophysics.    Each speaker integrated into her talk a brief description of her personal career path. The keynote talk by Margaret Murnane described her research and explored the need for diversity in meeting the scientific and engineering challenges of the future.  A subaward at Indiana University supported an assessment of the impact of the conferences, including pre- and post-conference questionnaires.  Among participants in the Cornell conference who completed both questionnaires, 97% were satisfied with their experience.  In addition, 92% felt that the conference had improved their understanding of career opportunities in physics, 91% reported that it had influenced their confidence in succeeding at graduate school, and 97% reported that it had influenced their confidence in succeeding in a physics related career.  The websites for all six conferences are linked to this APS-hosted site: http://www.aps.org/programs/women/workshops/cuwip.cfm  The materials generated by the conferences, including the results of the assessment supported by this award, are archived on an APS-hosted wiki, and are being used to identify and promote best practices and facilitate efficient organization of future conferences.
