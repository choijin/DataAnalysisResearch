<AbstractNarration>Collaborative Research: Genomics &amp; Society - Exploring ethics, impacts and consequences of technological advances.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scientists and engineers who develop genomics technology must address key ethical questions about the process of genomics research, the role of society in genomics research, and carefully reflect about the intended and unintended implications of new technology for different social groups, economic sectors, communities, animals and the environment. This project develops a graduate ethics education program that uses advances in genomics and genomics technology as a central theme in a team-taught, case-based, modular course to facilitate students' ability to understand and think carefully and critically about social and ethical questions raised by these advances. This course considers more than the downstream consequences of accepted technologies by placing importance on discussion of the formation of technologies, as well as on the in-principle decisions about whether to use them at all.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This approach is innovative in considering a broad spectrum of ethical and societal issues related to genomics and genomics technologies that goes far beyond health or specific disciplinary topics to bring interdisciplinarity, critical thinking and values awareness together with genomics science to explore a range of interconnected social and ethical issues spanning human health and privacy, justice, agriculture, animals, and the environment. In particular the course raises critical questions at the human/animal/environment boundary, concerning the relationships between human, animal and environmental health, and the permissibility of various practices on different kinds of living beings including, but not restricted to humans. These questions inevitably expose students to diverse perspectives and competing ideas; and the discussions and assessment tasks are geared to help them make balanced, thoughtful, and informed judgments about these questions. The course is being developed at Texas A&amp;M University (TAMU), and presented on campus in College Station for students from a variety of disciplines. During year 2, the course is also being presented via e-learning and textual resources at Texas A&amp;M University Corpus Christi (TAMUCC) and Boise State University.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project was a collaboration between instructional designers at Texas A&amp;M University-Corpus Christi and instructors in the fields of philosophy and genetics at Texas A&amp;M University-College Station. Working together over a distance, the team developed an online, open Genomics Ethics course for broad dissemination. To facilitate formative design, we delivered three different versions of the course, and following each delivery revised the course according to student and instructor input. The goal of the course was to encourage student discussion and consideration of ethical and societal issues in the field of genomics.  Intellectual merit:  Intellectual products of the course design process include  presentations and  a publication detailing the efficacy of collaboration between content experts and instructional designers over a  distance. The team learned that the use of a project manager, a project tracking website, and holding weekly webconferences allowed for more efficient collaboration at a distance. Additionally, a research publication  detailing the design and  development of the course will be submitted  December, 2016. The team learned that online course content should be structured in ways that allow ease of navigation for students. Additionally, students benefit from the following implemented features: rubrics that clearly define student expectations for completing discussions and case analyses; sample discussions; case analyses; writings which demonstrate 'A' quality coursework; video clips of expert speakers; and scaffolded assignments which measure students abilities to discuss course topics.   Finally, the intellectual impact of the  course on society is that  the course itself fosters critical thinking about  ethical dilemmas specific to  genomics. The ability to think critically,  provide valid discussion, and  construct well thought out ethical arguments  is applicable to fields  outside of science and technology.  Broader impact:  Following the Spring 2015 online course, the team redesigned parts of the genomics ethics course based on student input, and then distributed the course as a MOOC on two different sites, Academia.edu and BlackBoard Coursesites (see image of course homepage).  The Academia.edu Genomics Ethics MOOC can be access via the following  link: https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Genomics_Ethics  The Black Board Course Sites MOOC can be accessed via the following link: http://www.coursesites.com/s/_GenomicsEthicsandSociety                Last Modified: 10/05/2016       Submitted by: Lauren Cifuentes]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
