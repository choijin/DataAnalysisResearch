<AbstractNarration>Proposal #: 12-29185&lt;br/&gt;PI(s):  Silva, Claudio; Freire, Juliana; Iacono, John; Suel, Torsten; Vo, Huy&lt;br/&gt;Institution: Polytechnic University of New York&lt;br/&gt;Title:   MRI/Acq.: Prototyping Next-Generation Algorithms for Large-scale Visualization, Data Processing and Analysis&lt;br/&gt;Project Proposed:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project, acquiring an instrument for prototyping the next-generation algorithms for large-scale visualization, data processing and analysis, facilitates the development and evaluation of next-generation algorithms and systems that leverage different hardware configurations. It consists of computational resources in the form of an SGI UV 1000 machine with 384 cores and four Tesla M2070 GPUs, and a small cluster composed of 32 nodes (384 cores total), each with two Tesla M2070 GPUs; and disk resources in the form of solid-state storage cards and an Isilon Storage Cluster. The instrumentation supports projects in various domains. The computer science projects include &lt;br/&gt;- Dataflow architectures, &lt;br/&gt;- Theoretical models of computation, &lt;br/&gt;- Web search, &lt;br/&gt;- Visualization, and &lt;br/&gt;- Data mining; &lt;br/&gt;While the application area research projects (undertaken with external collaborators) relate to&lt;br/&gt;- Wildfire simulation, &lt;br/&gt;- Bird migration simulation, and &lt;br/&gt;- Climate science. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: &lt;br/&gt;The team plans to release the software developed as part of this project as open source, which carries potential for significant broader impact. The involvement of graduate and undergraduate students in the project provides mentoring opportunities.</AbstractNarration>
