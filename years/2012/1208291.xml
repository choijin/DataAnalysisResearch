<AbstractNarration>This project will support NSF funded research programs by providing a safe, efficient and economical platform for studies conducted aboard R/V Blue Heron within the Great Lakes. This is a five-year cooperative agreement, and in CY2012, 38 days out of 70 will be used to support NSF sponsored research. For each year of the cooperative agreement, funding is dependent upon the number of days deployed on NSF research, and budgets are re-negotiated accordingly. The intellectual merit of the research programs being supported on R/V Blue Heron has been determined through review of those proposals. Although the Great Lakes dominate the northern boundary of the United States and constitute 20% of the world's freshwater, our understanding of these water bodies is limited.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The project ?Ship Operations, R/V Blue Heron 2012-2016? (OCE 1208291) provided support for 16 NSF funded research projects to use the University of Minnesota?s research vessel, the R/V Blue Heron, for their projects on the North American Great Lakes.  These projects ranged in subject from studying decreasing ice on Lake Superior, the fate of nitrate in the Great Lake system, and the impact of currents on Lakes Michigan and Superior to testing experimental equipment and training the next generation of scientists.     The R/V Blue Heron is an 85? former fishing trawler that is outfitted with state-of-the-art research equipment.  She is a member of the U.S academic research fleet?s umbrella organization - UNOLS (University National Oceanographic Laboratory System) - and is the only member of UNOLS on the Great Lakes.  The vessel not only supports NSF funded projects but also projects funded by NOAA, the state of Minnesota and the University of Minnesota.  The vessel primarily works with researchers in biology, chemistry, geology and physics but also works with educators to ensure that undergraduate and graduate students get a first-hand appreciation of field work on large bodies of water.     As a result of the work undertaken on the R/V Blue Heron, researchers have published their findings in at least 40 peer-reviewed articles.  Their work has been presented in talks and on posters in numerous professional meetings.  Funds from this award have ensured that the crew of the vessel is well trained and that the ship is maintained at the high level that is expected for ships in the academic research fleet.     Over 5,000 post secondary, secondary and elementary students, and members of the community have toured the vessel as part of our Science on Deck events or other dock-side tours during the period of this award.  These events ensure that members of the public have a better understanding of the R/V Blue Heron and the work that researchers funded by NSF do onboard the vessel.  Additionally, numerous T.V. and radio segments as well as print articles have been published during the last six years about work done on the R/V Blue Heron.  We feel that this outreach is important part of our mission.          Last Modified: 04/13/2018       Submitted by: Richard D Ricketts]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
