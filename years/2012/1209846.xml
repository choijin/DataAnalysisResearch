<AbstractNarration>This action funds Karan Jessica Odom of University of Maryland, Baltimore County to conduct a research project, entitled "Reconstructing the evolutionary history of female song in birds: did the ancestral female songbird sing?" during the summer of 2012 at the Australian National University in Canberra, Australia.  The host scientist is Dr. Naomi E. Langmore.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Intellectual Merit of the research project is to determine the evolutionary history of female song in songbirds.  Songbirds are heavily studied for their complex, learned songs; however, the majority of research focuses mostly on males from temperate regions.  Yet, in the tropics where the majority of bird species are found, females of many species sing.  The approach is to use ancestral state reconstruction to reconstruct the history of female song in songbirds to determine whether female song evolved along with male song.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.  These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Songbirds are well known for their elaborate, beautiful  songs, which, like human speech, require learning.  However, unlike human speech, birdsong is thought to belong mainly to males, while females are thought to be relatively silent or to not have song at all. Researchers interested in how complex song has evolved in birds therefore typically study song in the framework of sexual selection.  This theory, first proposed by Darwin, suggests that songs become elaborate in males through the choices of silent females.  However, most research on birdsong is conducted in North America and Europe, where male song is known to be less common. In the Southern Hemisphere, however, where songbirds are thought to have originated, both males and females of many bird species sing.  Therefore, we investigated how common female song is across all songbirds. We found that song is indeed much more common than previously recognized in female songbirds.  We then used this information and known relationships among songbird species to reconstruct the history of birdsong.  Our analysis revealed that the female ancestor of the songbirds likely sang.  This suggests that song probably evolved in both males and females and that female song has since been lost in some species, leading to the many different styles of singing behavior we see among male and female songbirds today.  Our work will contribute to establishing a new framework for studying the evolution of birdsong and will hopefully allow us to develop a more accurate picture of how this complex trait evolved.      Our work was an international collaboration involving researchers at the Australian National University and University of Melbourne, Australia, Leiden University in The Netherlands, and University of Maryland Baltimore County, USA. Our research involved educational research opportunities on all levels, including experiences for undergraduate and graduate researchers.  Lastly, we hope that our work will provide future research opportunities in a diversity of fields related to the brain and behavioral mechanisms of learned communication, as well as provide opportunities for citizen scientists interested to document new instances of female song in birds.
