<AbstractNarration>This research project  focuses on  the modeling and mathematical analysis of  nonlinear systems arising in physical and biological science as well as engineering applications. The models under investigation include  hyperbolic balance laws for the investigation of nonlinear systems arising in continuum physics, mixtures of fluids for the study of fluid-particle and fluid-solid interaction as well as  kinetic models for the investigation of the collective self-organization of agents.  Specific themes include: (a) Structure and stability of  solutions to hyperbolic balance laws and models of fluid mixtures. (b) Diffusion and hydrodynamic  limits for collisional kinetic equations. (c) Large-data existence theory for polymeric  fluids. (d) Self-organized dynamics: long-time behavior and stability of models capturing flocking behavior.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Mathematical models that directly address fluid-particle interaction and collective self-organization of agents  are very relevant to a variety of problems: biological, and non-biological (social networks). Progress in this investigation will enhance our understanding of complex systems. Furthermore,  a successful completion of the proposed activities will contribute  to the development of new analytical and numerical techniques and to the design of high performance computational  algorithms. The project includes a substantial educational component that reflects an ongoing commitment to education on all levels (undergraduate, graduate, and post-graduate education). Special attention is given to outreach activities, minorities, and to developing programs that foster and encourage training in the field of applied  mathematics.</AbstractNarration>

On kinetic models for the collective self-organization of agents  Models describing collective self-organization ?of biological agents are currently receiving considerable attention. ?In this line of research the PI investigates a class of such models. ?More precisely, the focus is on kinetic type models for the flocking behavior exhibited by certain species of birds, fish, and insects. Below I present three distinct but interconnected parts of this investigation.  Modeling.   In this research direction Trivisa (in collaboration with T. Karper and A. Mellet) proposes a new model which exhibits flocking behavior. The newly proposed model corrects some of the limitations which appeared in earlier models in the literature.  Analysis.  Existence of solutions to Kinetic flocking models.  This research  establishes the global existence of weak solutions  to a class of kinetic flocking equations.  The models under consideration  include the kinetic Cucker-Smale equation (2007) with possibly non-symmetric flocking potential, the Cucker-Smale equation with additional strong local alignment,  and related models. This investigation provides the first rigorous existence result for kinetic flocking models. This article appeared in the SIAM Journal on Mathematical Analysis.    Hydrodynamic limit of the kinetic Cucker-Smale flocking model     Results on The hydrodynamic limit of the kinetic Cucker-Smale flocking model are obtained and appeared in Math. Meth. Models Appl. Sci. (2015).  On strong local alignment in the kinetic Cucker-Smale model  In this research direction the PI et al justify rigorously a class of flocking models and construct a new one that captures a variety of phenomena previously ignored in the earlier litarature.  Multiphase flow models  Fluid-particle interaction models  A new direction of research on fluid-particle interaction was initiated by Carrillo, Karper and Trivisa in (Nonlinear Analysis (2010))  and is continued by Ballew and Trivisa (Quarterly 2012, Nonlinear Analysis 2013).  Modeling  The system under investigation describes the evolution of particles dispersed in a viscous compressible fluid and is?expressed through the conservation of fluid mass, the balance of momentum and the balance of particle density often referred as the Smoluchowski equation. The coupling between the dispersed and dense phases is obtained through the drag forces that the fluid and the particles exer...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
