<AbstractNarration>The PI is developing curricular materials based on educational robotics, gaming, and computer vision for the first-year calculus course. An example project is based on a throwing robot. By spinning an arm at a controlled speed and releasing a ball bearing at a precise angle, the robot can accurately toss the bearing several feet into a coffee cup. Students are using calculus to compute rotation speed and release angle. The intellectual merit of the project comes from 1) providing new technology for calculus education, 2) motivating students with robotics activities which give them a better understanding of the uses of calculus, and 3) contributing to the emerging body of scholarship on educational robotics in the university mathematics classroom. The broader impacts of the project include 1) providing instruction to several hundred students with the new materials, 2) training future teachers from the UGA College of Education in technology-based mathematics education, and 3) training faculty from seven campuses with the new materials. The project is providing a new robot platform for students to use in investigating the problem of throwing a ball onto a target, software to track thrown objects for teaching projectile motion, and an interface to a Bluetooth-controlled toy car with accelerometer to learn about acceleration, to calculus classes on seven campuses. The new materials are being evaluated by an external team, using the Student Mathematics Motivation assessment, to see if they increase student engagement with mathematics.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The project was designed to test an experimental curriculm for the first-year calculus class. Instead of working on standard example problems and calculations, the students completed three ambitious real-world projects, producing technical reports aimed at an imaginary 'client corporation'.   The three projects focused on  finding a trajectory to intercept a thrown tennis ball with another tennis ball launched at a fixed angle and speed, finding out where a ball thrown by a robot with a rotating arm lands as a function of the rotation speed of the arm, the angle at which the ball is released, the length of the arm, and the height of the arm's center, and analyzing the effect of error in the rotation speed and release angle on the final landing position of the ball.   After the three reports were complete, the students worked with an actual robot throwing machine, selecting rotation speeds and release angles to throw the ball about a meter into a coffee cup.   The project funded the development of a robot for the students to use and the running of a number of test sections of the curriculum.  Anecdotally, the students enjoyed and valued the experience, and reported learning a number of useful professional skills from the experience. Many of them very much enjoyed the practical robot experience, and the course was rated more highly in student evaluations than the average calculus course at the study institution.   However, this pilot study of the curriculum failed to find large, statistically significant effects on any of a variety of measures of student outcomes in calculus or student attitudes regarding calculus and mathematics. While students in the class generally did well and had very positive beliefs and attitudes regarding mathematics, this was also true of the students in other sections.
