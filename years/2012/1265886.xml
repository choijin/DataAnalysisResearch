<AbstractNarration>The proposed center seeks to establish a new Industry/University Cooperative Research Center (I/UCRC) addressing broadband wireless access and applications. The center will focus on four areas: 1) enabling sharing up to many GHz of spectrum using technological advances and enabling platforms such as spectrum trading and auctions, and millimeter wave communications; 2) co-existence of heterogeneous devices (e.g. radar and communication systems); 3) providing connectivity for new applications such as wireless devices in the hospitals of the future, bringing wireless into the hospital in novel ways; and (d) improving electronic warfare technologies that address national-security issues.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The new center addresses an area of critical economic and has the potential to support development of broadband wireless as a platform for innovation as addressed in the White House PCAST Report.  The proposed center has the potential to link a diverse set of member companies across the broadband industry sector with university discovery in this area.  Moreover, the center participants have a history of start-up initiation, and the opportunity from new starts to leverage the ecosystem created by the center is significant.   The center plans to impact students via their conduct of center research, curriculum development and REU site development.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The field of wireless communications has evolved from Third Generation (3G) systems that brought about the smartphone revolution and the wireless Internet to the emerging 5G systems with its massive capacity and rich applications.  For the past five years, the Broadband Wireless Access &amp; Applications Center (BWAC) has been operating as an NSF I/UCRC.  Its researchers have been carrying out cutting-edge research in several focus areas, including dynamic spectrum access and spectrum sharing, heterogeneous coexistence of wireless networks, wireless security and privacy, mmWave antennas and networks, massive cellular MIMO, wireless edge computing, etc.  At present, BWAC's participating universities include the University of Arizona (lead), Virginia Tech, University of Mississippi, and the Catholic University of America. Each university brings leading academics and industry partners. Over 15 companies serve on the Center's Industrial Advisory Board (IAB), which is currently led by Keysight Technologies.  For the past five years, the BWAC's universities, with support from their industry affiliates, have carried out research projects and outreach activities to address the various challenges in the rapidly evolving landscape of wireless technologies and applications.  During the five years, BWAC has funded the research of tens of faculty members. Several postdoctoral researchers, and more than 80 Ph.D. and 30 M.S. students have been supported by BWAC, along with tens of undergraduate students. Hundreds of research papers have been published and tens of patents have been filed based on BWAC's research findings.    The Virginia Tech Site, which is one of the founding university members of BWAC, has been very active in research as well as industry and government outreach activities.  Through these activities, the Virginia Tech Site played a key role in raising the profile of BWAC and promoting its research activities.  In terms of research, the researchers of the Virginia Tech Site produced significant results in a number of key areas, including coexistence of heterogeneous wireless technologies, dynamic spectrum sharing, next-generation Wi-Fi technologies, operational security in database-driven spectrum sharing, PHY-layer security in wireless systems, security protocols for Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices, security and enforcement in spectrum sharing, security analysis of LTE, and vehicle-to-everything (V2X) technologies and applications.         Through BWAC's academia-industry collaboration, technologies and tools required for broadband access and applications have been developed.  The results of this collaboration have contributed to the development of technologies and techniques that enable applications such as remote health, smart transportation, V2X safety and infotainment applications, and high-speed rural broadband access in new spectrum bands.  The partner universities of BWAC have strived to encourage and broaden the participation of students and faculty in BWAC's activities.  This has been achieved through REU site programs, participation of under-represented minority students and faculty in research projects, and execution of inter-disciplinary projects.  With its strong research track record, established partnerships, and a long history of collaboration between its members, BWAC will likely continue to be successful in carrying out impactful research and creating industry-relevant intellectual property.
