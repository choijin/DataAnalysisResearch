<AbstractNarration>This project will develop geospatial data analysis building blocks as core part of the HUBzero Scientific Collaboration platform to enable researchers and educators to create and share geospatial data sets and modeling tools.  The project will build upon geospatial capabilities that have been developed by IT experts and validated by the science community and bring such capabilities to the masses, hence any domain scientist can develop and deploy geospatial applications with graphical user interfaces on the web.  The deliverables include (1) tools and web service interfaces of "data space" for managing and sharing data, including geospatial data, and (2) Extended RAPPTURE Toolkit APIs to support geospatial mapping, image processing, visualization, and access to shared data in the data space. The building blocks software developed in this project will be open source as part of the HUBzero open source releases.</AbstractNarration>

HUBzero powers more than 60 research community websites that makes computational tools, scientific data sets, research results and training materials available to the broader community and public. These sites, also known as science gateways, support research and education in a wide range of domains including nanotechnology, materials research, cancer care engineering, extreme weather, hydrology, and agricultural and food sustainability. As geographically referenced data are widely collected and available, its usage in research and education is increasing rapidly. Traditionally, one needs to have in-depth knowledge and computer programming expertise of Geographical Information System (GIS), as well as computing resources to process, analyze and view geospatial data. The GABBs software produced from this project helps lower the barriers in dealing with such data.&nbsp; Integrated with the HUBzero platform, GABBs is helping make scientific datasets such as satellite imagery of land use, earth features, water quality data, and crop health information, and simulation outputs more accessible and usable by anyone with a web browser and an Internet connection. Tools of general usage and domain specific applications have been created and are being used by users from multiple disciplines and sectors.&nbsp;</span></p> <p style="line-height: 1.3800000104037198; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;" dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-position: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The software developed in this project is available in multiple manners and is deployed on a geospatial data science gateway MyGeoHub.org, a web portal for research data, applications, learning and collaboration. This site is currently supporting more than 10 federally funded research projects and more than 10,000 users annually. The software tools from the project have been widely used to support education and workforce development. Researchers use these interactive tools to access scientific and social science datasets around the nation; run computational workloads on the NSF supported powerful supercomputers; and train the next generation workforce in computational and data competency in classrooms and workshops.&nbsp;</span></p> <p style="line-height: 1.3800000104037198; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;" dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-position: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earth scientists in an NSF Cyber Training project are using the GABBs-enabled tools and MyGeoHub to teach graduate students how to make their research more reproducible and accessible.

It has been used by 400+ users to publish more than 500 SWAT models, and run more than 700 simulations and calibrations on the NSF supported supercomputing ecosystem XSEDE through a web browser interface. SWATShare has been used by several graduate courses at Purdue University and Texas A&amp;M University Kingsville. It is interoperable with HydroShare, a data/model sharing collaborative platform for the hydrology community. Also freely available, HydroGlobe can extract remotely sensed data related to soil moisture, potential evapotranspiration, precipitation and other hydrologic variables in a user friendly format for a specified spatial and temporal domain, reducing the &ldquo;data wrangling&rdquo; time significantly in the research pipeline. The AgMIP tool makes it easier for social scientists to access and aggregate output data from the Global Gridded Crop Model Intercomparison data archive.&nbsp;</span></p> <p style="line-height: 1.3800000104037198; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;" dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-position: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More than 12 graduate students and more than 9 undergraduate students were trained and contributed to the project.

It is interoperable with HydroShare, a data/model sharing collaborative platform for the hydrology community. Also freely available, HydroGlobe can extract remotely sensed data related to soil moisture, potential evapotranspiration, precipitation and other hydrologic variables in a user friendly format for a specified spatial and temporal domain, reducing the "data wrangling" time significantly in the research pipeline. The AgMIP tool makes it easier for social scientists to access and aggregate output data from the Global Gridded Crop Model Intercomparison data archive.       More than 12 graduate students and more than 9 undergraduate students were trained and contributed to the project. The team published 35+ peer-reviewed conference papers and abstracts, and approximately 20 peer-reviewed journal papers, and one book chapter; conducted 100+ training events and presentations (including conferences, workshops, tutorials, webinars and posters). 20+ scientific tools were created using GABBs, attracting approximately 2200 users.       By making it easier and faster to share computational tools and data, this project helps the research community make progress toward compliance of FAIR science, that is, making research software and data Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable.
