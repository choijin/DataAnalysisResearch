<AbstractNarration>This project aims to study endpoint maximal inequalities for families of convolution operators with smooth measures on manifolds under anisotropic dilation structures, making use of local smoothing estimates in the context of an advanced Calderon-Zygmund argument. The (properly scaled) convolution in three dimensions with the arc-length measure on the twisted cubic is the ultimate model case. In addition, LaVictoire and his collaborators hope to apply these methods to obtain new estimates for singular averaging operators with canonical folding relations in nilpotent groups, and also to complete a related project on nonstandard ergodic averages derived from sparse sets in discrete virtually nilpotent groups. Finally, LaVictoire plans to develop and test an innovative approach to supplementary mathematics instruction inspired by the website Project Euler.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Methods and techniques from the mathematics field of harmonic analysis have often led to important  applications to the natural sciences and engineering. Harmonic analysis, in its broadest sense, concerns the study of functions by means of calculus-type integrals that lead to the discovery or recovery of important information which can be very hard to detect from the function's technical definition. This project looks at various processes that distort a given function (the data) in a geometrically patterned way similar e.g., to a photograph taken with a shaking camera, or to a deep-space image warped by a massive gravitational field. LaVictoire will investigate the important problem of when can the original data be satisfactorily reconstructed from the distorted data; such problems can be studied using recent advances in several areas of harmonic analysis.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The grant provided partial research support to two postdoctoral researchers, several graduate students, and two undergraduate students working in analysis.   Several interesting results were obtained. We  mention some highlights:    (i)  Patrick LaVictoire and his collaborators worked on multivariable averages in ergodic theory and obtained various pointwise convergence results assuming suitable sparseness conditions.   (ii) Kyudong Choi and his collaborators considered a one-dimensional model of the two-dimensional Boussinesq system and established that in this model the solutions may blow up in finite time.   (iii) Sriram Alladi proved a converse of a transplantation result for multipliers of ultraspherical expansions by characterizing multipliers with a dilation invariance property.  (iv) Xianghong Chen obtained a number of surprising results about the restriction of the Fourier transform to fractal sets, and the behavior of self-convolutions of measures supported on such sets.   (v) Evangelos Dimou proved new results on pointwise convergence questions for solutions of higher order dispersive equations.   (vi) Jongchon Kim obtained various results on discrete fractional operators, and on the  characterization of radial multipliers and associated maximal operators.  (vii) Christopher Breeden worked on generalizations of an example due to Kohn of a sum of squares of complex vector fields which is hypoelliptic, but not subelliptic.     In the summer of 2014 the grant was used to support the work of the following undergraduate students:  (i) Zijian Tao, along with two other undergraduate students, made progress toward proving the nonexistence of extermizers for certain restriction inequalities.  (ii) Enkhzaya Enkhtaivan, along with two other undergraduate students made progress on a conjecture of the PI concerning uniqueness of certain differential equations which arise in medical imaging.
