<AbstractNarration>Quality Education for Minorities (QEM) Network, a non-profit organization, has been instrumental in serving as a catalyst to improve the education of under-represented groups, particularly in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM). As an agent for change, QEM continues to develop effective strategies for broadening STEM participation, and focuses on issues and barriers that impede underrepresented groups from receiving a high quality education. This project supports internship placements for students at the National Science Foundation as a mechanism to: increase students understanding of science policy; develop the potential of future STEM leaders; promote STEM participation, including students from low-income communities; and encourage advanced studies in STEM disciplines.  This human capacity building endeavor will help train a diverse, engaged, and globally competitive STEM workforce prepared to meet future challenges through discovery and innovation.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>With support from the National Science Foundation (NSF), the Quality Education for Minorities (QEM) Network conducted the Science Student Internship Program (SSIP) to provide internship placements for students at NSF as a mechanism to: increase students understanding of science policy; develop the potential of future STEM leaders; broaden STEM participation of underrepresented minority (URM) students; and encourage advanced studies/careers in STEM disciplines. This human capacity-building endeavor helps the Nation train a diverse, engaged, and globally competitive STEM workforce prepared to meet future challenges through discovery and innovation. This SSIP award enabled the placement of 23 undergraduate and 11 graduate students in summer internships at NSF during FY 2013-2016. The interns lived with and participated in professional development and enrichment activities with interns from another QEM program supported by NSF&rsquo;s Tribal Colleges and Universities Program (TCUP).</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>During the ten-week internship, students were placed with various NSF directorates/divisions and engaged in research activities under the guidance and supervision of NSF program officers who served as their mentors. SSIP interns focused on enhancing their skills through the conduct of science policy-related research projects and participation in a variety of activities to support their STEM career pursuits and leadership development. Interns learned about the Foundation&rsquo;s programs and gained a better understanding of how science policy is formulated and implemented. NSF mentors provided access to resources, oversight of activities, and periodic feedback/assessments as interns completed their assignments.</p> <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> <p>This award enabled QEM to address the national need to increase the participation/persistence of URM students in STEM advanced degree programs, careers, research, and teaching. The 34 SSIP interns, plus two QEM NSF TCUP interns who were placed at NSF in 2016, represented 31 colleges and universities nation-wide (10 HBCUs, 3 HSIs, 1 NHSI, 2 TCUs, and 15 PWIs). As a result of the internship program, the students were encouraged to persist in their STEM educational and career plans. They became more informed about the many career and graduate school opportunities available to them, including funding options, which further refined their educational and career paths. Many realized the importance of obtaining a Ph.D. degree. Interns also honed their research and communications skills; and developed professionally, expanding their networking and mentoring circles. Interns contributed to the work of NSF through gathering and analyzing information on the results of various Foundation programs/policies.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>QEM recently tracked the 2013-2016 interns&rsquo; progress via social media and follow-up surveys. Information received on 16 (45%) of the 36 intern alumni describe other research experiences as well as matriculation from undergraduate to graduate study or to a range of STEM-focused positions in academe, industry, non-profit, and government (e.g., American Express, Google, Northrup Grumman, Raytheon, University of Michigan-Ann Arbor, East Baton Rouge Parish Schools, and U.S. Dept. of Homeland Security). Others were continuing their academic programs towards STEM degrees.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The project advanced knowledge about career development and support strategies for URM students in STEM, incorporating a community service focus to address societal needs. The interns learned about various minority-focused programs at QEM as well as at NSF and other federal agencies designed to address barriers to a quality education. This project has helped to develop a diverse, engaged, and globally competitive STEM workforce to meet future challenges. QEM&rsquo;s SSIP increased students&rsquo; understanding of STEM educational needs of minorities as well as educational equity issues that disproportionately affect minorities.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The interns represented 31 institutions across the country with significant URM populations.

QEM has compiled informational materials on a series of topics to address the academic and professional preparation of 21<sup>st</sup> Century students for STEM advanced degrees and careers, including on effective mentoring.

As an agent for change, QEM develops and disseminates effective strategies for broadening STEM participation, and focuses on issues that impede underrepresented groups from receiving a high quality education. From 1990-2016, QEM provided over 400 undergraduate and graduate students, primarily from groups underrepresented in STEM, the opportunity to work on STEM and science education policy-related research projects under the guidance and mentorship of STEM policymakers and educators, with funding from various federal agencies. QEM&rsquo;s technical assistance projects support efforts to ensure that students who graduate with degrees in STEM disciplines are well-prepared to successfully pursue graduate study or transition into the STEM workforce.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 02/28/2017<br>      Modified by: Ivory&nbsp;A&nbsp;Toldson</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Image         </div> <div class="galControls onePhoto" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation onePhoto" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1261569/1261569_10246425_1488293393039_Unknown--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1261569/1261569_10246425_1488293393039_Unknown--rgov-800width.jpg" title="2016 QEM NSF SSIP and TCUP Interns"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1261569/1261569_10246425_1488293393039_Unknown--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="2016 QEM NSF SSIP and TCUP Interns"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">2016 QEM Network/NSF SSIP and TCUP Summer Interns</div> <div class="imageCredit">QEM Network</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Ivory&nbsp;A&nbsp;Toldson</div> <div class="imageTitle">2016 QEM NSF SSIP and TCUP Interns</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
