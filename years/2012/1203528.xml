<AbstractNarration>Abstract - Geomyces destructans, a newly discovered cold-loving fungus ("psychrophile"), has devastated bat populations in North America. We know very little about this fungus as there are huge gaps in our knowledge of how fungi thrive in cold conditions and what unique traits make them pathogenic. Specifically, the forms and functions of fungi at low temperature have not yet been subjected to genetic analyses. Therefore, the unique enzymes and proteins that make psychrophilic life possible at such extreme low temperature remain unknown and their biotechnology potential remains unrealized. The investigators in this project propose to remove major barriers to experimental investigations of psychrophilic fungi by providing a molecular toolkit for the experimental manipulation of G. destructans and its psychrophilic sibling species G. pannorum. The experimental focus will be on the development of reliable systems for the manipulation, deletion or over-expression of target genes in G. destructans and G. pannorum.  These approaches would allow assignment of specific roles for various genes of interest. Additional objectives will focus on labeling two fungal species with stable fluorescent proteins so that details of fungal development can be studied by high resolution microscopy. This project will lay down the foundation for the study of cellular processes in the psychrophilic fungi. This is an important pursuit to discover if there is a unity or diversity of gene functions in different groups of fungi. It is expected that investigators in mycology, genetics, polar biology, environmental sciences, infection biology and industrial biotechnology would benefit from the reagents and findings generated in this study. This project will also involve mentoring of a post-doctoral fellow who might pursue study of psychrophilic fungi subsequently as an independent investigator. Additionally, undergraduate students will be trained under summer research experience for underrepresented minorities in an ongoing NSF Program at the host institution.</AbstractNarration>

Most commonly, the researchers focus on the manipulation of fungal genes of interest to understand their functions. However, the necessary experimental tools for such manipulations were not available for psychrophilic fungi until recently. Therefore, the current research project was designed with a goal to develop a molecular toolkit to enable in-depth genetic studies of psychrophilic fungi. The target fungi were&nbsp;<em>Pseudsogymnoascus destructans</em>, the causal agent of bat white-nose syndrome, and&nbsp;<em>P. pannorum</em>, which causes human and canine disease rarely. The genomes of both&nbsp;<em>Pseudogymnoascus&nbsp;</em>species were mapped to get an estimate of total numbers of genes and putative proteins, and hundreds of substrates were tested to make a detailed metabolic map. The primary goal of the project was achieved by the development of a bacterial vector system for the introduction of foreign DNA into&nbsp;<em>Pseudogymnoascus</em>species. The same tool also allowed the replacement of functional copies of individual fungal genes with defective copies to study their functions. Furthermore, live cell imaging of fungal proteins was developed for&nbsp;<em>Pseudogymnoascus</em>species by stable expression of fluorescent protein from jellyfish. An invertebrate animal model was established in the Greater wax moth (<em>Galleria mellonella</em>) to study pathogenic properties of&nbsp;<em>Pseudogymnoascus</em>species. Additionally, a novel fungus&nbsp;<em>Trichoderma polysporum</em>was discovered for the biological control of&nbsp;<em>P. destructans</em>in bat hibernacula; a comprehensive approach was standardized to study the fate of native microbial community following the application of biocontrol agents&nbsp;<em>T. polysporum</em>in affected sites. Two post-doctoral research scientists received advanced training in the biology and pathogenesis of psychrophilic fungi. The project findings were shared with the scientific community by presentations at local, regional and national meetings. Seven peer-reviewed articles were published in open-access scientific journals. The tools and novel strains created in the project were distributed to other scientists for further investigations. Overall, the availability of a molecular toolkit and an invertebrate animal model will jumpstart experimental investigations of psychrophilic fungi. The investigational framework developed in the current project will also have a positive impact on other scientific disciplines such as ecology, environmental remediation, agriculture, and wildlife conservation.&nbsp;</span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 02/25/2019<br>      Modified by: Vishnu&nbsp;Chaturvedi</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1203528/1203528_10170340_1551119357085_Fig1-NSFpublicawareness--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1203528/1203528_10170340_1551119357085_Fig1-NSFpublicawareness--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Characterization of urease gene deletion in P. destructans"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1203528/1203528_10170340_1551119357085_Fig1-NSFpublicawareness--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Characterization of urease gene deletion in P. destructans"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">URE1 gene is important for fungal utilization of nitrogen.
