<AbstractNarration>This project provides scholarships to support academically talented students with demonstrated financial need in attaining baccalaureate degrees in the College of Engineering, Forestry and Natural Sciences at Northern Arizona University after transfer from community and tribal colleges. In addition to scholarship aid, students are being supported though a residential learning community specifically for STEM transfer students, as well as a seminar class promoting academic and career success in STEM.  Scholars also have access to an extensive suite of student-support services, including supplemental instruction, mentoring and undergraduate research opportunities. Financial aid and other project activities are providing support toward increasing graduation rates for transfer students, as well as shortening time to graduation. The intellectual merit of this project lies in its comprehensive, research-based approach which merges financial, academic and social support to retain and graduate STEM transfer students. The broader impacts include strengthening relationships and transfer advisement between the university and surrounding community and tribal colleges, as well as providing a useful comparison of the impacts of residential learning communities on transfer students versus freshmen. The project taps a diverse and talented pool of students to enhance STEM workforce needs in Arizona and beyond.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p><span>The Transfers to Graduates in Engineering, Math and Science (Transfer-GEMS) program was designed as a two-year sequence of support for STEM transfer students at Northern Arizona University. Students were recruited to apply to the program primarily through emails sent to newly-accepted transfer students into the college and through visits to community college campuses around the state. Overall, 44 students in three cohorts participated in the program (48% female, 32% underrepresented minority in STEM). These students received a two-year scholarship (up to $10,000 per year, average $6,000) based on financial need and funds for conference travel and professional organization fees. Participants were strongly encouraged to participate in an eight-week seminar course during the first semester of transfer. The seminar content was specifically designed to provide STEM transfer students with the skills, knowledge, and habits of practice necessary to earn a Bachelor of Science degree. Students were required to participate in mentoring with a near-peer mentor, a science graduate who had previously transferred into the university, and also received mentoring and advising from the program coordinator.<span>&nbsp;</span></span></p> <p><span>After completion of two years in the program, 33 of 35 invited students participated in exit interviews.&nbsp;As program completers, these students were selected because they had the best knowledge of what supported successful transfer and continued academic accomplishment. These students described the importance of the program coordinator and peer mentor, for making them feel valued, helping them integrate into campus life, and resolving challenges, such as transferring credits. Students agreed about the importance of scholarship support to reduce financial need to work and to reduce worry. Many students in this program became involved in "high impact" educational experiences such as undergraduate research and identified these experiences as important. A number of students have presented their research at conferences, were publishing their research, and were pursuing new opportunities. Some have gone on to graduate school. Students felt that participation in career activities through the seminar course pushed them to "visualize the next steps" early in their career trajectory. Developing professionalism through learning to create resumes and elevator speeches was also identified as important from the seminar course.&nbsp;</span>Based on evidence of effectiveness, the transfer seminar course has been institutionalized after the grant ended and was offered on a sustained basis starting in fall 2017. Tutoring, study tips, and other academic strategies, were identified as important for some, but not all, students. Social activities and residential opportunities were also identified as important by fewer students.

Overall, the Transfer-GEMS scholars had an 18% higher graduation rate among STEM majors, which is also practically significant and allowed eight students to graduate that otherwise might not have. However, participation did not affect performance (GPA) or time to graduation.</span></p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 09/29/2019<br>      Modified by: Jennifer&nbsp;M&nbsp;Duis</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Image         </div> <div class="galControls onePhoto" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation onePhoto" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1260138/1260138_10256555_1569443202576_JustLogox4-page-0--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1260138/1260138_10256555_1569443202576_JustLogox4-page-0--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Transfer-GEMS logo"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1260138/1260138_10256555_1569443202576_JustLogox4-page-0--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Transfer-GEMS logo"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Transfer-GEMS logo with outline of a gem</div> <div class="imageCredit">Jennifer Johnson</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Creative Commons</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Jennifer&nbsp;M&nbsp;Duis</div> <div class="imageTitle">Transfer-GEMS logo</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
