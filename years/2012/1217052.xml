<AbstractNarration>The project builds on an existing citizen journalism activity to investigate how to use collaborative critique and construction of infographics to foster high school students? science literacy and engagement. Foundations are in sociocultural approaches to human action and learning, using the notions of mediated action and identification over time to explain development and preparation for future learning of individuals. Foundations are also in cognitive science work on spatial and visual thinking that has found that spatial metaphors provide a foundation for more abstract thinking, on notions of meta-representational competence development of understanding of the process of representation itself, and on collaborative idea development. Infographic design and idea development around it are distributed across people and tools in the environment, and learners better their own conceptual understandings through collaboratively bettering the representations they are using to communicate. The technological innovation is the socio-technical system that is being created around design of infographics as a way of promoting science learning and literacy and includes (i) the integration of infographics tools into learning activities to promote science learning and literacy, (ii) a case library of annotated infographics that can be used to promote idea development, ability to read and understand infographics, and critique and construction of infographics, and (iii) a case authoring tool that promotes reflection on one's infographic designs as learners write up their designs and are guided to annotate them with justifications for their designs. Research focuses on design of the socio-technical system that allows infographic design to promote learning and foster scientific literacy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Drawing in more high schoolers to science, promoting scientific literacy, and promoting deeper science learning among high schoolers are huge challenges to the educational system. This project focuses on addressing those challenges through design of citizen journalism activities that can be integrated with other science curriculum activities. The activities themselves revolve around collaborative critique and construction of infographics. Infographics are visual representations of data and/or information, used to express and communicate science, mathematical, technological, and sociological information and used extensively in journalism today. The project seeks both to help high schoolers learn to make sense of such graphics to use design of such graphics as a way to promote learning. The activities themselves require students to engage in data analysis and synthesis and to use science they are learning to develop visual representations that others can make sense of and learn from. The technology is authentic to what journalists use, and its use and the philosophy around its use could be powerful in drawing high schoolers to the wonders of science and helping them appreciate what scientists do, thus broadly promoting scientific literacy. Activities using the technology for infographic design have potential to engage and draw in not only those who already enjoy manipulating and analyzing data, but in addition, and more importantly, those who consider themselves writers and those who enjoy helping others learn. It also has potential to draw into science and advance science literacy in those who simply want to be recognized as making a contribution to their peer community. This work goes beyond current philosophies of schooling in suggesting that we may help people better their understanding by allowing them active roles in helping others learn and in communicating to the populous.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ People living in the 21st century have opportunities that would have previously been considered wondrous. We have access to countless scientific and technological advances, in part through widespread dissemination of science news, information, and data on the web, often in the form of visually rich "infographics." We can use what we glean from such sources to make better personal decisions related to health and safety, and to inform civil debates on policies related to topics such as vaccination and the environment.  But the opportunity to access the rapidly expanding abundance of information and data?what the authors of the 2008 National Science Foundation report on Fostering Learning in a Networked World called a "deluge of scientific data"?brings challenges. The "Collaborative Infographics for Science Literacy" (CISL) project (NSF IIS-1217052) filled gaps in what was known about how people make sense of the visually dense and multifaceted information and data displays in infographics, and how educational interventions can assist learners to find meaning and assess information embedded in infographics.  The CISL project team conducted an expert study of the graphic and information design in news infographics, which was published (in 2015) in the peer-reviewed Journal of Research in Science Teaching. Based on the expert study, previous research on involving youth in science journalism conducted by the principal investigators and collaborators, and other learning sciences research on how people learn with representations and through processes of idea refinement, the project developed, studied, and refined a model of involving high school aged youth in critiquing and creating science news infographics. In this design-based research project, participating secondary school students produced authentic news reporting on science topics of their choice.

Students revised their representations through an iterative process in which they used collaborative tools to exchange feedback and share resources with peers, and received feedback from an external science news editor.
