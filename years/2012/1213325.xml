<AbstractNarration>In this project funded by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program of the Chemistry Division, Ned B. Bowden of the University of Iowa will explore the synthesis of polymers containing the sulfenamide and the diaminodisulfide repeat unit, congeners of polythiazyl.  The approach is to prepare cyclic sulfonamides and then investigate the fundamental chemistry of their ring-opening polymerization; to develop methods for the step-growth polymerization of secondary amines and disulfur transfer reagents into polydiaminodisulfides; and finally to synthesize and characterize semiconducting polymers based on polysulfenamides and polydiaminodisulfides.  The broader impacts involve visiting local schools to present chemistry demonstrations, hosting a booth at the Iowa State Fair to present chemical research innovations to the general public, a monthly newspaper column to communicate science to the general public, training graduate and undergraduate students, and broadly disseminating research results in a variety of formats.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Plastics are long chain organic molecules and are found in many facets of everyday life, including food packaging, structural materials for automotive and aerospace transportation, and lightweight electronic devices.  This research will explore new approaches to include sulfur and nitrogen atoms within the polymer chain, which can impact properties ranging from electrical conductivity to susceptibility to water hydrolysis.  The results of the studies could facilitate access to high performing organic electronic or light-emitting devices as well as environmentally responsive materials.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project resulted in the development of new polymers &ndash; or plastics &ndash; that have exciting potential as electrically conducting wires and as materials for medicine.  We developed the synthesis of new classes of polymers based on bonds between atoms that were not found in polymer chemistry prior to our work.  These polymers are unique because they combine atoms in new ways that have never been used in polymers.  New opportunities often arise when unique polymers are introduced into science, and our polymers offer many new opportunities.  Some of these polymers are good at conducting electricity which means they have potential applications for the next generation of soft materials that combine flexible materials with electricity. These applications are important because most materials used in the electronic industry are hard and brittle.  An advance in this field is the development of new polymers that offer the flexibility of, for instance, clothing with the ability to integrate with electronics.  Our polymers are unique additions to this field.  Our new polymers are also potentially very important for medicine. In the treatment of many cancers nanoparticles composed of a polymer called PLGA are used to deliver drugs to tumors. Our initial work indicates that our new polymers may be better than PLGA for these applications. Furthermore, these polymers degrade to release a molecule, hydrogen sulfide, which was has been implicated in diseases ranging from AlzheimerÃ†s disease, glaucoma, cancers, and cardiovascular disease.  It is critically important for medical applications to control the release of hydrogen sulfide in the body and our polymers offer a new method to do that.  We also synthesized new polymeric membranes that can separate fatty acids from each other. Polymeric membranes are inexpensive and common (an example of a polymeric membrane is a coffee filter that retains the coffee grinds but allows coffee to pass), but no membrane was able to separate fatty acids until our membranes succeeded. Fatty acids are the principle components of vegetable oils and they are highly desired as new green and biorenewable starting materials for many applications in industry.  Our membranes can uniquely separate these fatty acids which can increase their commercial applications and replace the use of chemicals that originate in the petroleum industry.
