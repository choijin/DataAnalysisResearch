<AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT &lt;br/&gt;#1239265&lt;br/&gt;Vlachos, Pavlos P.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cardiovascular flows are subject to high shear rates that result in large velocity dynamic range for particle image velocimetry measurements. Such measurements are subject to high errors that ultimately contaminate subsequent shear stress estimation. In order to overcome such limitations they propose to develop and demonstrate a PIV processing methodology that is robust to shear rate and offers an extended measurement dynamic range. Furthermore in contrast to the traditional paradigm that relies on velocity field derivative estimation for calculating the wall shear stress they will develop a novel approach that directly calculates the complete deformation of a flow particle pattern. As a result trhey will be able to directly estimate vorticity and shear stress without relying on any post processing of the velocity field. Finally, they will explore the effect of the wall position and wall interaction with the flow on the velocity and shear stress estimation. These developments correspond to state of the art innovative advancements that promise to dramatically improve the accuracy with which wall shear stresses are estimated in cardiovascular devices.</AbstractNarration>

Parameters relevant to device safety, including shear stress at the wall and in bulk flow, were computed using radial basis functions (RBF) to improve accuracy.  In-field spatially resolved pressure distributions, Reynolds stresses and energy dissipation rates were computed from PIV measurements.  Velocity measurement uncertainty was estimated directly from the PIV correlation plane, and uncertainty analysis for wall shear stress at each measurement location was performed using a Monte Carlo model.  Local velocity uncertainty varied greatly and depended largely on local conditions such as particle seeding, velocity gradients, and particle displacements.
