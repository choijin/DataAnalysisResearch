<AbstractNarration>Proteins are a major contributor to organic carbon and nitrogen in the ocean and their amino acid building blocks comprise a major fraction of the total nitrogen identified in coastal and oceanic waters and sediments. Over the last decade, tandem mass spectrometry methods developed for the analysis of peptides and protein reconstruction together with informatics developments have re-assembled the amino acid signatures and unlocked the information inherent in the proteins they represent. This interdisciplinary research team has the combined expertise in marine organic biogeochemistry, proteomics, and bioinformatics to help determine the fate of individual proteins during degradation and likely mechanisms for their preservation. This research aims to identify and quantify the proteins responsible for chemical transformations of organic matter in the ocean, thereby exposing how microbial communities control and contribute to the carbon and nitrogen cycle and to organic matter preservation. This project has the potential to trigger a fundamental change in how we view, analyze, and model microbial degradation processes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recent findings from microbial ecologists show that bacteria with broad responses to various nutrients (i.e. the generalists) can fine-tune the gene expression of various proteins as a reflection of substrate availability; the proponents of this project have observed a suite of bacterial proteins present during organic matter recycling and that this protein expression changes as degradation proceeds. These observations hint that bacterial proteins have potential as organic biomarkers to reflect the taxonomic distribution of the functioning catalysts in degradation processes. The investigators propose to build on these results to investigate the potential for organic matter preservation to be linked to proteomic expression of the microbial community that drive carbon and nitrogen cycling. The project objectives are: 1) to address the relationship between marine organic matter composition and protein expression by the bacterial community (metaproteome) which act as catalysts for degradation; 2) to detail protein expression in the context of detailed organic matter characterization and 3) to distinguish how proteins present in oceanic sediments derived from different kingdoms of life (e.g. eukaryotic or bacterial) reflect the complex process of organic matter preservation. The overall goal is to capture proteins as critical markers of both presence and process in marine systems. The investigators will link the rapid advances in protein identification to track bacterial proteins to act as "functional biomarkers" and indicators of carbon and nitrogen utilization. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project would provide multiple opportunities for interdisciplinary student training in marine geochemistry and proteomics, and address the goal of disseminating results and tools to a broad audience. In the more traditional role, the project will expand the career for a female research faculty member in marine proteomics and support both graduate and undergraduate student research at each participating institution. On the broader community level, both Harvey and Nunn are also heavily involved in high school outreach programs.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ As the primary drivers of organic carbon turnover in the ocean, natural microbial communities are essential catalysts.  The ability to measure cellular function of natural and largely uncultured marine microbial communities in situ and link these functions to carbon cycling has been a research goal for decades.  Since proteins carry out the majority of molecular functions and are tightly regulated within the cell, their characterization, quantification, and the timing of expression can reflect their activity and metabolic goals and were the central theme of this project.   Although there have been studies that have successfully linked bacterial metaproteomic (i.e. community proteomic) responses to important biogeochemical cycles in situ, most metaproteomic analysis pipelines are adaptations of traditional single-species proteomic methods used in simple environments or for disease investigation.  This leaves the complications of having  multiple bacterial species analyzed in a single sample, especially the difficult assignment of an identified peptide to what may be multiple protein sequences from the community.  As described in publications from this award, we have detailed the importance of  capturing all the protein information to follow the role of bacteria communities as the principal catalyst of  organic matter recycling despite their small mass contribution.   Experiments and publications have also detailed lab and field experiments to track protein expression of natural communities together with important software tools for informatic improvements  which allowed us to quantify important bacterial peptides despite the presence of large amounts of eukaryotic (algal)  peptides  typical of oceanic materials.   This work also allowed the impact of identical peptide sequences and taxonomically indistinct peptides sequences to be evaluated to improve the detection of small amounts of proteins.  Gains from this effort allowed shipboard experiments to compare natural Arctic microbial communities at different sites and their response to organic matter.  The simultaneous measurement of taxonomic and functional shifts followed the comprehensive metabolic response of the native Arctic microbial community over time in the context of shifts in organic matter.   At least 24 functional protein terms were shared between experimental treatments, showing that changes in organic matter  directs community functionality prior to changes in taxonomy at the microbiome class level.  These results need to be repeated in other systems but have important implications for how community-level functions of microbes may forecast biogeochemical gradients in oceans.  Despite significant difference in community taxonomy, the process of organic degradation showed a high degree of functional consistency.  At least for the Arctic Ocean, this observation argues that bacterioplankton collected from different water masses and having differing taxonomy may nevertheless have a predictable order and high degree of functional consistency in the cycling of materials.  This project and the long term collaboration on which it was built acted as a conduit for interdisciplinary training of both graduate students and postdocs with research and minority serving institutions.  This award supported two Ph.D.?s who received highly interdisciplinary training and several undergraduate?s students at ODU who assisted in laboratory activities.  All these students received extensive experience in research and were mentored during their graduate experience.  All information generated through this project and proteomic profiles generated have been submitted to publicly available databases for use by multiple communities.  Software tools developed are available for full public use to encourage its dissemination and utilization.  The cycling of organic material in the ocean is dependent  on complex microbial communities that collectively metabolize, degrade and recycle organic material. The insights from this peptide-centric  approach suggests that functional responses of microbial communities are shared across diverse taxonomic groups.  It should encourage researchers to consider a broader view of protein synthesis rather than rely on select enzymes or element specific pathways.    The conclusions are clear that many functional responses can cross major bacterial class levels and suggests that at least for Arctic microbial communities, bacterioplankton from different water masses and having differing taxonomy may nevertheless have a predictable order and high degree of functional consistency driving biogeochemical profiles.   The sum of the information gained allow important insights into biogeochemical cycles and the functional differences of  microbial communities responsible for material cycling in ocean systems.
