<AbstractNarration>Many viruses encode their genome in RNA and exhibit high genomic diversity within their hosts. Advances in sequencing technologies have made it feasible to track viral transmissions and timely detect outbreaks on a global scale.  The goal of this project is to develop a comprehensive set of predictive mathematical models and accurate computational methods for integrated analysis of the massive epidemiological and sequencing datasets generated by emerging molecular surveillance programs.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Research results will be broadly disseminated via journal publications and presentations at international conferences, including the Workshop on Computational Advances in Molecular Epidemiology organized by the PIs. Prototype implementations of developed algorithms will be distributed as open-source packages and incorporated in the cloud-based Global Hepatitis Outbreak and Surveillance Toolkit (GHOST) developed at CDC.  The project will provide ample opportunities for promoting participation of women and underrepresented groups in bioinformatics and molecular epidemiology research at GSU, UCONN, Georgia Tech and Tel Aviv University.  An important aspect of the project is to disseminate core concepts and ideas from Computer Science and Computational Biology to wide target audiences including: (1) teaching Computer Science, in an informal setting, to  middle and high school students, and (2) incorporating computational thinking into Life Science curriculum at the undergraduate university level.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The proposed research and education activities will leverage the extensive expertise of an interdisciplinary team comprised of computer scientists, mathematicians, and molecular epidemiologists to develop accurate mathematical models and computational methods for key problems in molecular epidemiology including deconvolution and inference of viral variants from error-prone pooled sequencing data, inference of relatedness between viral samples and transmission networks, inference of transmission event times and network parameters, as well as predictive modeling  of transmission network dynamics. The team will carry out extensive algorithm validation on massive molecular surveillance datasets generated at CDC and develop robust prototype software implementations.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ At the broadest level, this project focused on developing of a comprehensive set of transformative computational methods for analyzing massive molecular surveillance datasets with the emphasis on sequencing data from viral outbreaks. The computational methods were developed for - deconvolution and inference of viral variants from error-prone pooled sequencing data, - inference of sample relatedness and transmission networks, - inference of transmission event times and network parameters. The developed algorithms and respective software tools were applied to HIV, HCV, Zika, COVID-19 sequencing data. Additionally, the developed algorithms have been applied to explore evolution of cancer cells based on analysis of single cell sequencing data.  The Zelikovsky’s lab at Georgia State was responsible primarily for designing and implementing sequencing data analysis. In collaboration with Mandoiu’s lab from the University of Connecticut and Bunimovich’s lab from Georgia Tech several algorithms were designed and implemented for analysis of HCV molecular surveillance data.  In the process of designing, implementing and applying these algorithms Zelikovsky’s lab has developed several popular software tools (CliqueSNV, QUASIM, Pooling, k-EMD,SCIFIL, and MULAN)  and generated a total of 21 journal or juried conference papers, 4 book chapters, 5 conference abstracts and two edited books.  All papers acknowledge NSF support.  A second major goal of this project was to provide training and leadership opportunities to graduate and undergraduate students.  As a result of this project 4 graduate students (including two female) successfully defended their PhD dissertations, 1 more graduate student has defended his Ph.D. proposal, 3 MS students have defended their theses and projects, and 2 undergraduate students received summer research training. Description of designed algorithms were incorporated in two graduate courses.   The tools resulting from this work will be of interest to anyone investigating viral outbreaks and pandemics, analyzing high-throughput viral sequencing data, and exploring intra- and inter-host viral evolution. This includes scientists in the fields of epidemiology, virology, oncology, and forensics.              Last Modified: 05/01/2021       Submitted by: Aleksandr Z Zelikovskiy]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
