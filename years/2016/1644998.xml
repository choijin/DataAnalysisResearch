<AbstractNarration>Extreme urban haze is common in China and this pollution is transported over long range to the Pacific and the United States where it can damage human health and ecosystems. Therefore understanding the chemistry that produces this Chinese haze is important to us. Preliminary data and analysis show that current models grossly under-predict the fine particle pollution in this haze in China. This demonstrates that the chemistry in current models is incorrect and that we do not have confidence in their predictions that are used for assessments worldwide. The proposed work will measure the chemical and isotopic composition of the extreme haze in Beijing and analyze it with models to rectify this problem. The results should improve the forecasting of extreme air-pollution in China and also the exposure to the American population since this is transported over the Pacific to the United States.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The researchers will collect samples of fine particle pollution in the urban haze in Beijing. The samples will be brought to US where their mass, chemical composition (sulfate and nitrogen),  and the oxygen isotopic composition of the fine particle pollution will be measured.  The oxygen isotope data will then be used to fingerprint the chemical mechanisms that are amplifying the particle pollution in the haze.  A US developed high-resolution chemistry, transport and isotope enable model centered over Beijing that will be adjusted to match the isotope observation.  This revised model should be better constrained and more realistically capture the large particle-production measured in the Chinese haze and also its long-range transport to the United States.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ INTELLECTUAL MERIT  Outdoor air pollution represents a major health threat to well over half of the ~1.5 billion people living in China.  Particulate matter (PM) represents the main constituent of air pollution in China, and explains the reduced visibility conditions known as "haze events".  Air pollution models have been unable to reproduce the high concentrations observed during the severe haze episodes, exposing an incomplete understanding of the underlying processes involved in their formation.  This project studied the formation of sulfate and nitrate aerosol, which represent two of the main constituents of Chinese haze. We found that sulfate forms through chemical reactions on existing particulate matter, a process that is not typically included in air quality models. Usually sulfate formation on existing particulate matter is thought to be negligible compared to other processes; however, the high particulate matter concentrations in intense haze can make this sulfate formation mechanism important. We found that the main oxidant for sulfate formation on particulate matter is likely molecular oxygen, a chemical reaction catalyzed by metals in the haze.  Sulfate concentrations have been decreasing in recent years in China due to air pollution regulation policies. However, nitrate concentrations have increased despite reduction in emissions of its main precursor, nitrogen oxides. We found that nitrate formation is limited not by nitrogen oxides, but by ozone. Ozone, another air pollutant, has increased as particulate matter concentrations have decreased. More ozone leads to faster production of nitrate, even with decreasing emissions of nitrogen oxides. In order to reduce nitrate concentrations in Chinese haze, ozone must decrease. We found that reductions in ozone are most likely to be occur with decreased emissions of volatile organic compounds.     BROADER IMPACTS  This research has improved our understanding of how sulfate and nitrate aerosols form in highly polluted environments. This information is useful to policy makers aiming to reduce air pollution, and may be applicable to other highly polluted environments outside of China. This project contributed to the training of five Ph.D. students in laboratory methods and air pollution modeling.
