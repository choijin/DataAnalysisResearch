<AbstractNarration>Postdoctoral Fellow: Mar√≠a Rosa&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: 1611997&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology for FY 2016, Broadening Participation of Groups Under-represented in Biology. The fellowship supports a research and training plan that will increase the participation of groups underrepresented in biology.  The title of the research plan for this fellowship to Maria Rosa is 'Flexibility in modes of gaining nutrition in early life stages of suspension-feeding molluscs.' The host institution for this fellowship is Stony Brook University, and the sponsoring scientist is Dr. Dianna K. Padilla. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this study is to determine the flexibility and relative importance of different feeding modes used by early life stages of suspension-feeding molluscs. Suspension-feeding molluscs collect particles from the water column, and include bivalves such as mussels, clams and oysters. Many species are economically important as food sources for humans, and play important roles in ecosystems by stabilizing shorelines and clearing particles from water columns. Although we know a great deal about suspension feeding in adult bivalves, we know very little about young life stages. Most bivalves have a microscopic larval stage that swims in the water column and has specialized structures for capturing algal food. These structures are shed once the larvae transition to juvenile stages and live on the bottom. Juveniles can take up to a year to develop adult structures for feeding. The Fellow's research focuses on early life stages, and life stage transitions, and examines links between juvenile performance and adult morphology. Understanding the feeding mechanisms of young suspension-feeders is critical, because for most species, survival of these early life stages is the greatest bottleneck determining survival to the adult stage.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project provides a rich training opportunity to a Hispanic female, including expanded training in functional morphology, advanced statistical methodology, and microscopy.  It is also allowing the Fellow to expand her knowledge and research capabilities in evolutionary biology, functional morphology, and the ecology of early life stages. The Fellow is also developing skills in formal and informal education, assisting with classes for both graduate and undergraduate students, and receiving mentoring by a specialist in education research.  To broaden participation of underrepresented groups, the Fellow is mentoring and serving as a role model for undergraduate and high school students in research, particularly those from groups underrepresented in STEM fields.  The Fellow is implementing a range of outreach opportunities, including presentations to local groups interested in marine conservation and protection, and to managers and legislators. This links the outreach to the research because many of the species included in this research are commercially and/or ecologically important.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Suspension-feeding bivalve molluscs (such as oysters, mussels, and clams) are an important group of animals in coastal ecosystems.  They can provide essential habitat for other species, and modify the environment in ways that provide important services to humans, including improving water clarity.  In addition, they are an important food source for humans, and are readily grown in aquaculture. Most bivalves have a small (0.1-0.2mm) free-swimming larval stage, with specialized structures for capturing algal food. These larvae (veligers) undergo a radical metamorphosis that produces juveniles with structures similar to adults, but at a much smaller scale.  Adult form may not be attained until animals are more than a year old.  Understanding the feeding mechanisms of early life stages is important as these early life stages have been demonstrated to drive patterns of abundance and distribution of many species.  This research focused on feeding and food choice in the larval stages of a variety of marine bivalves.  Experiments with larvae of two species of mussels (Mytilus trossulus and M. edulis), and the invasive oyster Crassostrea gigas were used to test for food preferences of developing veligers at 1 week and at 4 weeks of age. Different species of food (microalgae, of different sizes and nutritional value) were fed to larvae individually and in combinations. The rates at which these food particles were captured and consumed was measured. Contrary to predictions, size did not determine which algae the larvae preferred.  There were differences among bivalve species in which algae they preferred, and these preferences sometimes changed with larval age.  In addition, the rate that a given food was selected depended on which other foods were given at the same time.  Some species of algae were always captured at low rates, regardless of veliger age. When given more than one food at the same time (food choice experiments) larval age affected which species were generally rejected or ingested.  Results indicate that across development, properties other than size of the algae or its nutritional value affect which species are ultimately ingested, and food choice differs depending on larval age and which combination of foods are available at the same time.  These findings are intriguing and open a new line of research into which factors, may be responsible for the observed patterns of particle capture.  The results of this work have implications for our understanding of the importance of algal communities for bivalve larval success and performance in different environments, which can then translate to population level effects, as well as for aquaculture and the farming of different species of bivalves.  Funding for this project provided research opportunities and training for an early career scientist from an underrepresented group in STEM fields.
