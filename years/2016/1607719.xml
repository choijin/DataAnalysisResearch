<AbstractNarration>Ultra-high-energy neutrinos are unique astrophysical messengers as they interact only weakly with intervening matter and can therefore be used to probe the distant universe.  A small but observable flux of these ultra-high-energy neutrinos are expected to be produced in interactions between high-energy "cosmic ray" charged particles traveling through the Universe and Cosmic Microwave Background photons.  Observations of these cosmogenic neutrinos probe the structure and evolution of the Universe and test physics at energies beyond the standard models.  Utilizing the large volume of radio transparent ice, several pioneering efforts to detect these high energy neutrinos have been implemented in Antarctica.  Ultra-high-energy neutrinos traveling through the dense Antarctic ice generate cascades of particles that emit observable radio waves.  This award will support operations and continued development of the Hexagonal Radio Array (HRA), located on the surface of the Ross Ice Shelf in Antarctica.  HRA is designed to detect short-duration radio pulses generated by neutrino interactions in the ice, which reflect from the ice-water surface at the bottom of the Ross Ice Shelf up to the stations on the surface.  This award provides funding to improve the detector characterization and continue observations.  The group will utilize a variety of outreach activities, including twitter feeds and personal blogs, to engage the public in the science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Consisting of seven autonomous stations, HRA is intended to demonstrate the technology, assess data quality, and evaluate backgrounds as the first phase of a larger project, the Antarctic Ross Ice-shelf ANtenna Neutrino Array (ARIANNA.)  With data from the HRA stations, the group will further characterize the sources and properties of non-thermal contributions, and improve the accuracy of detector simulation and event reconstruction programs.</AbstractNarration>

Neutrino astronomy began in 2013 when the IceCube neutrino detector at the South Pole announced that it had discovered 28 of neutrinos, though at energies too small to be cosmogenic neutrinos.   The broad goal of the ARIANNA project is to complement the progress made by Icecube by extending the energy window of neutrino astronomy to reach up to the energy of cosmogenic neutrinos.  We do this by constructing an array independent stations on the snow surface in Antarctica that exploits the revolutionary Askaryan radio technique.  ARIANNA will provide source identification because we have shown it can measure the direction of extreme energy neutrinos with 3 degree precision. The pointing capabilliy of ARIANNA surface stations makes this technology ideally suited to contribute to the multi-messenger thrust by the US National Science Foundation, Windows on the Universe ? Multi-Messenger Astrophysics, providing critical capabilities to observe explosive sources from unknown directions.   The ARIANNA technology is flexible and can be deployed at different geographic locations.  When it is located at Moores Bay on the Ross Ice Shelf in Antarctica, it can view nearly half the sky.  If located at the South Pole, the view is more limited, but ARIANNA can look deeper into the sky, perhaps discovering weaker sources.  The NSF-funded ARIANNA piloy array of detector stations has been operating successfully since December 2014 at sea-level on the Ross Ice Shelf, Antarctica, and more recently at the South Pole. The ARIANNA neutrino station consists of autonomous and independent detector stations deployed on the snow surface and separated by 1 kilometer in a uniform triangular mesh.  ARIANNA?s technology can be integrated into the next generation neutrino telescopes, so it is expandable, and unlike the fossil-fuel-dependent drilling and power sources of other concepts, it is a ?green? surface array powered solely by the sun and wind.    The success of the ARIANNA surface technology will inform the planning process of the next generation of high energy neutrino detectors.   Since ARIANNA stations and IceCube can view almost the same sky at extreme energies, there is even greater power when results are combined. For example, the observation of a rare, explosive source by two independent subsystems with different systematic uncertainties is almost a scientific necessity for such an important discovery.  During the past half decade, the Nobel committee cited pioneering science arising from the use of astrophysical neutrino detectors. We believe that the development of the next generation of high energy neutrino telescopes will continue to deliver Nobel-worthy results of fundamental importance.
