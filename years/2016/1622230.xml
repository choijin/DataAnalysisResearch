<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is the development of a medical device that accelerates wound healing and prevents infection.  Wound contamination and infection are notoriously challenging to treat and are a significant cause of patient morbidity and mortality. Bacterial and other microbial colonization in wounds delay healing, cause further degradation, and can lead to severe complications including deep tissue and bone infections, as well as stroke and sepsis. The wound care field is large and diverse and includes acute and chronic wounds, pre- and post-surgical care and scar prevention, burns, as well as emergency wound care in war settings and homeland security. Due to the aging population and increasing rates of diabetes and obesity, the entire global wound care products market is expanding rapidly at an estimated 7% per year and currently totals over $21B. Moreover, new financial reimbursement policies to reduce the estimated $50B US economic burden of wounds are incentivizing hospitals to improve care, reduce infection, and accelerate patient recovery. The market is ripe for a medical technology that treats wound infections.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project supports the development of a high voltage power supply capable of driving a cold plasma medical device that treats wound infections. Cold plasma is ideal for treating wound infections because it is effective against all bacteria types and is unlikely to confer bacterial resistance. It is superior in its anti-microbial effect compared to topical antibiotics and antiseptics but safe for human skin. Our research objectives include scaling the output voltage, shortening pulse width, enabling thermal, overvoltage, and overcurrent protections, and incorporating voltage control feedback. Anticipated technical results include completion of these research objectives and testing of the power supply with the cold plasma device on bacterial cultures to confirm antibacterial effects.</AbstractNarration>
