<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is that the model of a universal, user-facing commercially run "commons" results in an easier to use dynamic and creative Internet of Things, with more power for users and more sales for manufacturers. The commons allows devices of many protocols to publish, subscribe and react to updates from one other in a way that is open to manufacturers and visible/comprehensible to normal Internet Users. Most of the largest Internet companies (including in auctions, social media and ecommerce) constitute conceptually similar models in which a central entity helps support the relationships between consumers, or between consumers and manufacturers/sellers. This project aims to bring similar efficiencies, power and ease of use to the network-connected devices of the next few decades, with a view to capturing some of the value it creates for manufacturers and users in the process (as e-commerce, social media and auctions platforms have before).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is focused on creating interoperability between all devices at the level of a user interface and in such a way that a normal Internet User can understand. At present, limited sub-sets of devices may be interoperable at some levels of their protocol, and may be able to react to one or extend their networks. But this interoperability does not extend to all devices, and it does not extend to the user interface. A normal person cannot make any two devices interact with one another without resorting to computer programming. The project proposes that the creation of a centralized real-time-messaging-based "commons" in which devices (i) publish their status in both human readable language and a parallel extensible data format, and (ii) can register ways for their major functions to be triggered which creates a space in which any device can react to state changes in another. The project aims to demonstrate that (i) the core statuses of devices can be expressed and easily published in these real-time human-readable/data messages, that (ii) the data structure can comprise both core data types and a looser, name-spaced set of data types, that (iii) a real-time rules engine can trigger a device to action when a set of arbitrary criteria occur, and that (iv) these criteria and responses can be created through a comparatively simple user interface.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ As the cost and size of computing and networking hardware shrinks year-on-year, more and more everyday and civic devices are being connected to the internet, for control or monitoring purposes. These "Internet of Things" devices can be contacted over the internet from mobile phones or the web by individuals, companies or sometimes by other pieces of soft- or hardware.  They are used for a variety of purposes - to make people's environments more reactive and hospitable (lights, thermstats and entertainment systems in the home), or to track the presence of dangers in the world (radiation, fire and security sensors) or simply to report back on the status of the world around us (tide sensors, weather sensors and the like).  By default, any individual devices can only be controlled by a limited set of individuals, via proprietary services, and can be - at best - connected to a few other services and sensors. In addition, a large proportion of the time their actions are inscrutable and invisible even to the people who own them.  This project looked at the way humans have found new ways to connect with one another in the 21st century via social networks and rapid messaging frameworks and sought to see if it might be possible to apply those lessons to network-connected devices. It aimed to prototype and explore the idea of a 'conversational commons' where (a) devices could publish their statuses publicly or privately in both human-readable forms and in a parallel extensive data format, (b) a core vocabulary of data types could be developed while still allowing people and companies to create new types of objects and services, (c) a real-time rules engine could be built that could run on a commercial scale and could trigger a device to action when a set of arbitrary criteria were met and (d) these criteria and responses could be created by normal people through a comparatively simple human-focused user interface.  The team collected and analyzed the way that Internet of Things products - including lightbulbs, light switches, color-changing bulbs, IR bulbs, outlet switches, smoke alarms, web cams, weather stations, environmental sensors, car monitors, motion sensors and heaters, air conditioners and humidifiers - communicated their data and developed a way that a core vocabulary of data could be developed that was still extensible by individual manufacturers or creators.   A dictionary of these core data types was constructed, published as a public blog post, circulated to interested parties and described in public talks.  The team then built software and a user interface allowing any smart device manufacturer or public real-time data provider (weather company, or public environmental sensor) to register their devices with a central provider, create human readable scripts for them, and start publishing real-time data to a 'commons?.  The team also built a real-time rules processing engine - and a user interface to interact with it - upon which various criteria could be registered (for example, temperate, time of day, pollution level or light status). As updates then came in from other devices in real-time, the real-time engine observed them to see if they matched the criteria. If all criteria were met, the engine would then in turn send a corresponding instruction to one or more devices to change their status. For example, if one sensor read that the air pollution levels were very high, and another that the ambient temperature within an environment was also high, the real-time rules processing engine could send a command to a home to close its windows, turn on the air conditioning and turn on an air purifier.  The team demonstrated that by allowing individuals and companies to publish and take commands via a central ?conversational commons? many more opportunities for recombination could be found - with any device added to the network being able to respond to or react to (or trigger) a result or action in one or more others. These ?network effects? - wherein the value of a network is proportional to the square of the number of things on the network - has not yet been realized in connected devices, and the team believes this kind of project could point in the direction of methods and approaches to help achieve it.  Many of the materials and conclusions from this project have been opened up to a wider community - with the proposed core vocabulary for Internet of Things devices having been publicly published on the internet, and a variety of talks given to practitioners in the field.
