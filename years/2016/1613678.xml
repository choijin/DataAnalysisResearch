<AbstractNarration>Title: Functional dynamics in microRNA precursors by NMR &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ribonucleic acid (RNA) performs many essential functions in all living organisms.  MicroRNAs are an important class of RNAs that regulate the vast majority of the human genome, however the molecular mechanism by which these microRNAs are produced from precursor species is unclear. The dynamic structure of the precursor species have implications on microRNA processing.  The project investigates how intrinsic motional properties of the RNA and RNA-binding proteins regulate the biological pathways associated with RNA regulation of gene expression, as a paradigm to understanding the molecular logic of regulation. This research will be executed in a highly interdisciplinary manner, which will allow training of postdoctoral fellows and graduate students to interdisciplinary research at the interface of physics, chemistry and molecular biology. The project will involve under-represented minority students who will be included in the research activities. Material from the project will also be used in teaching at the graduate level and in specialized advanced undergraduate courses.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The overarching goal of this project is to study the relationship between RNA motion and its biological function. The specific objective of the research is to understand how microRNAs are produced in a manner that is regulated in different cellular states. This project will investigate how RNA dynamics, intrinsic to RNA, is altered upon substrate binding and its effects on the efficiency of processing of microRNA precursors.  Primarily solution and solid-state NMR will be used and advanced spectroscopic techniques will be developed. Experimental studies will be integrated into state-of-the-art computational modeling for atomistic level interpretation. Biochemical and cell-based experiments will also be performed to test the biological functional relevance of the project's discoveries. Spectroscopic tools developed within this project to study functional dynamics in RNA will be broadly applicable to other nucleic acid systems.This project is supported by Molecular and Cellular Biosciences Division in the Directorate for Biological Sciences.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The appreciation of RNA as an increasingly important player in basic biology and in the development of chronic and infectious disease is growing every year. It is now know that 80% of the human genome codes for RNA which perform a variety of essential functions; misregulation of RNA function leads to many diseases. In RNA viruses such HIV to COVID-19 and Zika, or the flu virus, the RNA genetic material of the virus also regulates replication, fitness and pathology in infected individuals. Understanding how RNA functions is therefore critical to understanding its role in the healthy and diseased state of cells, and in the transmission and virulence of RNA viruses.  Through this project, we have been able to demonstrate that dynamics is intrinsically coupled  with the ability of RNA to perform its biological function in a variety of RNA systems of significant fundamental biological and biomedical importance. These include the oncogenic microRNA miR-21, perhaps the best known oncogenic non coding RNA; an RNA that regulates expression of the tumor suppressor E-cadherin, whose expression is suppressed in most cancers of epithelial origin; the viral HIV TAR RNA, that regulates the emergence of the virus from the latent state that makes permanent eradication of the virus such a challenge.        In addition to the primary focus on fundamental new discoveries, we have also used the biophysical information generated in performing this project to learn how to assay and discover small molecules that inhibit the oncogenic and pro-fibrotic activity of pre-miR-21, a major player in many malignancies and other chronic diseases. Indirectly, in the course of developing the chemistry, we have also been able to discover drug-like molecules that inhibit replication of flaviviruses (Dengue) and Coronaviruses (MERS and SARS-CoV2) in human cells with potent activity, and that work by interfering with the RNA conformational dynamics motions studied in this project.  Therefore, in addition to their intrinsic importance to fundamental biology and biophysics, the knowledge generated in this award has been a critical component in spinning off a biotech company which is pursuing new anti-cancer and anti-viral drugs, in partnership with big pharma (under negotiation) and the support of NIH and the venture capital community (under negotiation).
