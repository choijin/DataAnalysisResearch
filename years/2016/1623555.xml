<AbstractNarration>The goal of this workshop is to increase robustness and generalizability of the experimental behavioral sciences. The meeting is dedicated to addressing potential solutions to the so-called "WEIRD people" problem: the fact that most experimental behavioral science research is conducted with members of WEIRD populations (Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich Democracies) and the discovery that much of this research fails to generalize to broader populations. There has been much attention paid in some fields to this well-documented sampling bias however calls for broader sampling by themselves have not been effective in the absence of structured guidance on how to address this problem. This workshop will bring together scholars from a range of disciplines whose research represents positive case studies of how to overcome these barriers and highlights the benefits of doing so. The goal of the workshop is to conduct a systematic analysis of disincentives undermining diversity and incentive structures supporting convenience and inertia over good science practices. An action plan will be developed for addressing and ameliorating these issues through more specific guidance for researchers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Robust and generalizable theories of human behavior are essential for improving policy in a range of areas, including education, savings, human capital investment, public health, workforce training, and decisions under uncertainty.  However, current findings in the social and behavioral sciences are based on an extremely biased set of convenience samples, largely based in U.S. colleges.   The primary goal of the funded planning workshop was to set the agenda for a larger workshop aimed at ameliorating this problem.  The planning meeting was held at the Santa Fe Institute on March 15-16, 2016, and brought together scholars from a range of disciplines whose research represents positive case studies of how to overcome key barriers and the benefits of doing so.  To identify issues arising at different levels of professional training and development for researchers of diverse backgrounds, the workshop included a mix of junior and senior scholars as well as scholars from under-represented groups. The presentations and discussions at the planning meeting produced a set of action items and an agenda for a larger workshop in D.C.  These include key areas of: (1) Teaching and training, (2) Infrastructure for faciliating collaborations and data sharing, and (3) Institutional recommendations for incentivizing more robust social and behavioral science at the level of journal and grant review and tenure and promotion.  The planning meeting led to a larger NSF-funded workshop held in Washington D.C. (March 2017) bringing in a larger group of key stakeholders (journal editors, granting agency program officers, university administrators) to identify what strategies would be most feasible and effective at improving the robustness and generalizability of findings and theories in the social and behavioral sciences.  Some of the outcomes of the workshop were draft guidelines for journals to increase sample diversity, formation of a working group to build training materials for cross-cultural research, and a Sackler colloquium on related issues held September 2017 (which will be resulting in a series of Colloquium papers in PNAS).
