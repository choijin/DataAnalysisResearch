<AbstractNarration>1605916&lt;br/&gt;Timko&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hydrothermal chars are inexpensive carbon-based materials that are synthesized by heating waste feedstock in the presence of liquid water.  Hydrothermal chars have recently attracted significant interest because they exhibit promising performance in a variety of applications ranging from soil additives to electrocatalysis.  The objective of this GOALI project is to understand and control the unusually high adsorption capacity of hydrothermal chars for inorganic and organic compounds. This adsorption capacity can be exploited to sequester compounds that pose environmental risks.  The research will be performed in collaboration with Cabot Corporation, who will provide comprehensive characterizations of complex hydrothermal char materials. Results from the project will be incorporated into Worcester Polytechnic Institute?s student projects curriculum.  The research team will partner with the Worcester-based non-profit group, The Toxic Soil Busters, for additional research and mentoring.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hydrothermal chars have remarkable adsorption capacities despite their relatively low surface areas. It has been hypothesized that surface-bound carboxylic acid groups self-associate to mediate an ultramicropore structure that is accessible only in the presence of hydrogen bond donating molecules. Traditional gas sorption measurements that use molecular nitrogen do not open the carboxylic acid gated ultramicropore structure, resulting in low apparent surface areas.  However, the carboxylic acids deprotonate in water, and the hydrothermal char structure swells, mimicking the swelling of a hydrogel under appropriate pH conditions. Therefore, the sorption capacity of hydrothermal char is a result of its actual surface area being much greater than measured. To test the hypothesis, two separate ball milling techniques will be used to independently control the surface area and surface chemistry of the hydrothermal chars: (1) a dry-milling technique that is useful for modifying hydrothermal char surface composition, and (2) a solvent-assisted wet-milling technique that increases the surface area of carbonaceous materials. Using these two related techniques, the PI will investigate systematically the adsorption capacity of hydrothermal char to determine why measured adsorption capacities of hydrothermal chars are comparable to those measured for activated carbon, despite the fact that the nitrogen-measured surface areas of hydrothermal chars are less than 1% of those measured for activated carbon.  The three aims of the project are: (1) to understand the relationship between surface area and sorption capacity using a reactive gas milling to modify surface composition; (2) to understand the relationship between measured surface area and sorption capacity, using solvent-assisted milling as a technique for increasing measured surface areas of pyrolysis biochar; and (3) to test the carboxylic acid gating of hydrothermal char ultramicropore area by measurement of sorption characteristics for a series of sorbates with varying characteristics and molecular sizes.  By disentangling the competing effects of surface area and surface composition, the results will provide a firm understanding of the remarkable sorption capacities of hydrothermal chars.</AbstractNarration>

Heavy metal contamination in particular causes long-term health and developmental problems that are difficult to recognize in their early stages and can be impossible to reverse once they have progressed. Access to clean drinking water is a multi-dimensional problem and solving it will require efforts in policy, social structures, and technology. Technologically, inexpensive heavy metal removal sorbents are needed for removing trace metals from water. In addition to the drinking water problem, the world faces a growing danger from decades of waste accumulation. Converting waste into valuable products is one way to mitigate environmental damage caused by improper waste disposal. Hydrothermal carbonization is an emerging technology for converting wastes into hydrochar, a useful material with many applications, including water purification. Hydrochars are especially effective at heavy metal removal, with capacities on the order of 10-times or even 100-times that of similar carbon-rich sorbents, such as activated carbon. Adding to the mystery, the surface areas of hydrochar are just a fraction of those of activated carbon. Since surface area is generally considered the most important property governing the ability of a material to remove contaminants from water, we sought to understand what we considered to be the anomalous capacity of hydrochar for heavy metals. The first challenge we faced was understanding the structure of hydrochar. This seems elementary, but literature models of hydrochar structure were fanciful and in conflict with one another. To solve this problem, we performed an extensive study of Raman spectropic analysis of hydrochar. Raman spectroscopy is a powerful, yet generally available tool for analyzing connections between the carbon atoms that we hypothesized were the key to the hydrochar structure. The study of Raman analysis of hydrochar took two parts. The first was relating the data obtained from Raman analysis to structural features in hydrochar. The second was refining the Raman method itself so that it would yield reliable structural data. We published both of these studies in the peer-reviewed literature in the journal Carbon. The outcome of these studies was a working model of the hydrochar structure. We applied this working model to a detailed study on the ability of hydrochar to remove copper - a model toxic heavy metal - from water. We found that the capacity of hydrochar arises not from weak interactions with its surface, which is the sorption mechanism of activated carbon, but from very strong interactions with specific groups in the hydrochar structure. Access to these groups is mediated by swelling of the hydrochar when it contacts water. This adsorption mechanism mimics the action of ion exchange resins, a very different type of sorbent than activated carbon. Armed with this knowledge, we can now tailor the properties and composition of hydrochar for maximum benefit. This work was published in the open access, peer-reviewed journal Energies. While the work that appeared in Energies showed that strong hydrochar-metal interactions were key to the ability of hydrochar to purify water, it also suggested that secondary interactions between other groups int he hydrochar structure and the metal could also play an important role. To understand secondary interactions, we partnered with a group at nearby Brandeis University. Our partners at Brandeis University specialize in solid state NMR, a very powerful technique for understanding carbon-carbon bonding in solids. With help from a lab in Germany, we synthesized a series of hydrochars, specially made to have maximum signal in the solid state NMR experiment. Brandeis then analyzed these samples and we used our newly established Raman technique as well as computational methods to propose an authorative set of hydrochar structures that depend on the synthesis conditions (synthesis temperature, time, and pH). We have not yet published this study, and aim to submit it in Spring 2021. We anticipate that this work will become the final word on hydrochar structure. Knowing the hydrochar structure will have many broader impacts, as knowing the structure is the first step in science-based design of any material. Hydrochar has found use as a water sorbent, catalyst, gas storage material, power storage material, and in many other applications. Progress in all of these areas is hampered by a lack of structural knowledge. In addition, the various techniques we have developed will be generally applicable to many other carbon-based materials. In fact, we have published a seires of papers on the application of our Raman and computational techniques to soots and chars. The project has served as a platform for 1 PhD student, 4 MS students, and 8 undergraduate students. Of these, five are females and two are from under-represented minority groups.
