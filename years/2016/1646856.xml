<AbstractNarration>Modern critical infrastructure relies on successful interdependent function among many different types of networks. For example, the Internet depends on access to the power grid, which in turn depends on the power-grid communication network and the energy production network. For this reason, network science researchers have begun examining the robustness of critical infrastructure as a network of networks, or a multilayer network. Research in network anomaly detection systems has focused on single network structures (specifically, the Internet as a single network). Among these methods, some promising detection algorithms rely on decentralized and distributed coordination among many participants, improving meaningfully over results from independent parallel and centralized algorithms. The project involves rigorous analysis of the different challenges and opportunities for anomaly detection posed by multilayer networks relative to single network structures, with a particular focus on how cross-layer information can be effectively used to improve both efficiency and detection as well as how cross-layer threats can create vulnerabilities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project develops a general framework that can be used in multiple applications to detect large-scale threats to information flow for enhanced security. This has the potential for significant benefit to society through its contribution to enhanced resiliency in the nation's cyber infrastructure and other interdependent critical infrastructure such as the power grid. The combination of concepts and ideas from the cybersecurity community with the network science community will help researchers in both fields to better understand the realistic problems and be aware of each other's problems, results, and techniques.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Modern societies are built on networks of interconnected and interdependent systems, which enable a smooth integration of services and enhance the capabilities of the isolated systems. Unfortunately, these features also amplify the vulnerabilities of each system, as seen, e.g., in the 2003 U.S. blackout. That incident exemplifies the potential for cascading failures both within a single network (the power grid) and across networks (impact on transportation and resources networks). Natural, non-malicious, but non-standard perturbations, along with intentional attacks, may spiral out of control and cause significant damage. It is therefore critically important to consider how to develop and deploy anomaly detection methods that can be efficient in the complex environment of a multilayer network.</p> <p>In this project, we explored the challenges and opportunities associated with anomaly detection in multilayer networks, and we studied how best to leverage non-parametric methods to address/exploit these issues. We generalized a recently introduced algorithm, DIAMoND (Distributed Intrusion/Anomaly Monitoring for Nonparametric Detection), for the case of multilayer networks under a DDoS attack. This bio-inspired distributed algorithm allows nodes to determine the level of threat to the network locally, based on the concern of neighboring nodes, while at the same time preserving the privacy of each node by not sharing any sensitive information. We also developed a system of trust among layers, where nodes can combine information received from nodes in their own layer in different ways with information from nodes in other layers. The algorithm was assessed for different traffic substrates, distributions of baseline (i.e. non-malicious) traffic, sizes of the attack packets, and number of nodes taking part in the attack. DIAMoND performed well under almost all metrics, independently of simulation conditions. These results were evaluated against a parallel algorithm with no information sharing among nodes. In most cases, DIAMoND outperformed the parallel algorithm by a wide margin. In the few cases where the parallel system was better, DIAMoND still offered improvement in some other aspect, e.g. providing better precision. The results also indicate that, in the case of concurrent attacks to two layers, it is possible to improve the already-high detection accuracy, while for asymmetric attacks the accuracy can only improve detection accuracy significantly in one layer.
