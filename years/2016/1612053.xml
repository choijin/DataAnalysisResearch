<AbstractNarration>Increasing the number of US university students who successfully complete degrees in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) and enter the STEM workforce is of national importance. However, this has proven to be surprisingly difficult, especially with women and underrepresented minorities. A primary reason is that the students most likely to drop out of STEM disciplines, and therefore most in need of help, benefit least from innovations that merely address teaching quality or curriculum content. Research shows that we must influence students' self-efficacy: their belief in their own ability to overcome setbacks and ultimately succeed. This project will develop, test, document, and publicize a practical, inexpensive, single-session intervention to improve students' self-efficacy. It is suitable for inclusion in any university STEM course. Our test population will be 440 STEM majors taking introductory physics at UNCG and NCA&amp;T, both universities having particularly large minority and/or female enrollments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project builds on two strong, but previously separate, lines of research into attitudinal/affect variables that influence student success. The first is "attributional retraining", in which students learn to attribute their successes and failures to internal rather than external factors. The second is "mindset" about fixed vs. growable intelligence, in which students learn that the brain remains plastic throughout life and that they can, with conscious effort and attention to thinking skills and strategies, become smarter. Interventions of demonstrated efficacy exist for each of these two, but none exist that address both concurrently, and none are suitable and practical for widespread use in university-level STEM instruction. In addition to developing a disseminable intervention and documenting its effectiveness, this project will develop procedures for efficiently and reliably gauging STEM students' self-efficacy (with extant instruments), and will advance our theoretical understanding of self-efficacy, its components, and its growth dynamics.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Developing a globally competitive STEM workforce, with the full participation of women and underrepresented minorities, is a national priority. Students' self-efficacy, their belief in their own ability to overcome setbacks and ultimately succeed, is a significant factor for student success. Since low self-efficacy can cause disinterest, disengagement, and inhibit achievement, developing strategies for increasing self-efficacy is both a promising and productive approach for addressing workforce imbalances.   The purpose of the Self-efficacy Intervention to Improve STEM Performance (SIISP) project was to develop, test, document, and disseminate a single-session intervention -- a brief, classroom-based workshop -- to improve students' STEM self-efficacy that would be suitable for inclusion in any university STEM course.    The SIISP project integrated two theoretical ideas, growth mindset and locus of control (perceived academic control).  Growth mindset says that intelligence can be cultivated through effort and deliberate practice and locus of control is based on how students attribute their successes and failures in the classroom --  to internal or external factors. Since effective interventions exist for each of these and they are both significant components of self-efficacy, we hypothesized that if an intervention targeted them in combination, student STEM self-efficacy would increase.   This study was a large-scale research project involving students enrolled in introductory Physics courses at three public universities in the University of North Carolina system across three semesters in 2017-2018.  Participants completed a 34-item questionnaire we developed for this study, the USSEMAC, to measure STEM self-efficacy, growth mindset, and perceived academic control. They were then assigned either an intervention or a control treatment by lab section (n=853).  Participants were surveyed before treatment, a few weeks after treatment, and late the following semester, and final course grades were collected.  The University STEM Self-Efficacy, Mindset, and Academic Control (USSEMAC) instrument is a survey with 34 Likert-scale items measuring a) STEM self-efficacy (20 items) with 3 sub scales identified (overcoming challenges, engaging in behaviors, and ability to succeed); b) growth mindset (7 items); and c) perceived academic control (7 items). It was validated using exploratory factor analysis, qualitative interviews with the target population, and Rasch Model analysis. While it was developed for this study, it should be useful to anyone interested in measuring self-efficacy and its components in university students.  The SIISP Intervention is a 30-minute workshop we created to increase growth mindset and student sense of control over academic success, in an effort to increase STEM self-efficacy.  This intervention was facilitated, interactive, and conducted during regular lab meetings by a member of the research team.  It is comprised of a) slides and discussion questions, b) two short, animated, narrated whiteboard videos presenting the key ideas and c) a workbook for participants to record their responses to prompts.  The control was a similarly constructed workshop with the content focus on developing an understanding of the complexities of diversity in the modern STEM workplace and presenting specific strategies to increase cultural competence.  We employed Hierarchical linear modeling (HLM) to examine the effect of intervention vs. control treatments on STEM self-efficacy, growth mindset, perceived academic control, and final course grades.  HLM allowed us to control for differences by institution, semester, course, lab section, and the race and gender of the participant. The results show that students who attended the intervention workshop showed more of an increase in growth mindset than those who attended the control workshop (statistically significant effect, &beta;=.213,  p&lt; 0.001), and the effect of the workshop on growth mindset was still significant at the 40 week follow-up (&beta;= .23, p= .01).  However, there was no effect of the intervention on STEM self-efficacy, perceived academic control, or final grade.     We hypothesized that the intervention would increase student self-efficacy, so we were not able to confirm our hypothesis. There were also no effects of race or gender, meaning that our intervention workshop was not more or less effective for participants based on gender or race.  The only interaction found was between treatment and semester such that the intervention was less successful in the first semester than in the 2 subsequent semesters (&beta;= -.14, p&lt; .04).  While the findings did not support our hypothesis that the SIISP Intervention would increase student STEM self-efficacy, it did increase growth mindset; contributed to the theoretical understanding of self-efficacy, its components, and growth dynamics; provided insight into the design, delivery, and evaluation of psychosocial interventions; and advanced a line of research that has potential for providing effective and efficient strategies for broadening participation and success in STEM.
