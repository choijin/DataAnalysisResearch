<AbstractNarration>Predicting the effects of climate change on ecological systems is complicated by the many separate and interacting ways in which climate can affect the different species and processes in the same place. This project will investigate the multiple effects of a decrease in annual precipitation in desert grassland in California where burrowing, seed-eating mammals strongly affect soil nutrients, soil moisture, and seed dispersal by plants, and where introduced plant species compete with native ones. Researchers will exclude mammals, intercept or add rainfall, and measure effects on populations of mammals, plants, and invertebrates and on nutrient levels over four years. This unusual opportunity to experimentally test multiple, complex effects of climate in a natural system will advance our basic understanding of the ecological consequences of climate change.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this project include development of the workforce for science likely including underrepresented groups, outreach to the public, and applications to the conservation of biodiversity and the management of natural areas. The project will train a postdoctoral researcher, a graduate student, and three research technicians. Work with two local organizations will promote public science education and volunteering. Findings will inform management of the Carrizo Plain, the last major remnant of a major type of grassland in California and a refuge for endangered species.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p><em>Intellectual merit</em>&mdash;This study has led to important new insights about the ways in which climate and species interactions jointly shape community dynamics. These findings have been disseminated to the scientific community through 6 peer-reviewed publications and 10 conference presentations to date, with 3 additional manuscripts in late stages of preparation for submission to peer-review journals. Our experimental manipulation of rainfall and burrowing rodent presence provided evidence that activities of animals strongly affect plant community responses to climate change. For example, kangaroo rat presence buffered the plant community against rainfall-induced reductions in species diversity. We found a strong lagged effect of precipitation on plant composition, and kangaroo rat burrowing amplified these precipitation legacy effects by promoting the dominance of grasses that were also favored by rainfall, whereas kangaroo rat foraging buffered against these effects by selective foraging on grasses. In analyses spanning taxonomic groups, we found that precipitation altered the strength and even the direction of species interactions. Thus, changes in precipitation from year to year may weaken species interactions over time, thereby increasing ecosystem stability and resilience to climate change. Likewise, our system-wide analysis documenting the responses of 423 species of plants, arthropods, birds, reptiles, and mammals to California&rsquo;s drought of 2012-15 revealed that responses of most species were surprisingly weak despite strong community-aggregated responses. Locally rare species were more likely to increase and abundant species were more likely to decline in response to drought, and this negative density-dependence was remarkably consistent across taxa. While extreme droughts can lead to substantial short-term declines in the abundance and diversity of species across taxonomic groups, our findings indicate these disturbances may play a vital role in the long-term maintenance of biodiversity by inducing periodic die-offs of dominant species and subsequent opportunities for rare yet fast-growing species. Together, these findings highlight processes that shape community structure in highly variable environments and provide insights into whole-community responses to climate volatility.</p> <p><em>Broader impacts</em>&mdash;This project provided training and professional development to 104 people: 93 student interns and volunteers (including 3 REU students), 7 technicians, 1 project manager, 2 postdoctoral researchers, and 1 contract biologist. Nearly all (96/104) trained personnel were from groups underrepresented in the sciences (women and minorities). This was the first postdoctoral position for both Deguines and Grinath, who gained experience with fieldwork, new analytical techniques, manuscript preparation, and grant writing. Both have moved on to new postdoctoral research positions. All 3 REU students presented their independent research at professional conferences, and REU student Brianna Doran obtained permanent employment as a wildlife biologist for the Carrizo Plain National Monument. All personnel obtained valuable hands-on ecological research experience, including unique opportunities such as handling of endangered mammals and exposure to a variety of survey methods for multiple taxonomic groups. Many personnel also obtained valuable experience with project management, data management, data analysis, and report writing, and several students and technicians have obtained permanent positions in the conservation field or gone on to graduate school. Findings from the study have contributed to K-12 education through a first-grade science book about Prugh&rsquo;s kangaroo rat research (&ldquo;Nighttime Investigation&rdquo;) that was distributed as part of a new science curriculum by AmplifyScience to elementary schools nationwide in fall 2017. To date, over 40,000 copies of the book have been distributed. The study has also contributed to public science education through informational pamphlets distributed to visitors of the Carrizo Plain National Monument, our project website, and presentations to diverse audiences (e.g., naturalists, interpreters, documentary filmmakers). In addition, our findings have contributed directly to endangered species conservation. We assisted in the design and implementation of emergency feeding stations for giant kangaroo rats when their populations were on the brink of extinction at the end of the drought. Our findings have also been used by the managing partners of the Carrizo Plain National Monument in their habitat management plans, and officials use our study as a reference when evaluating the effects of adjacent large-scale solar farms on giant kangaroo rat populations.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 07/11/2018<br>      Modified by: Laura&nbsp;R&nbsp;Prugh</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1628754/1628754_10294855_1531351053092_DSCN4611--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1628754/1628754_10294855_1531351053092_DSCN4611--rgov-800width.jpg" title="kangaroo rat trapping"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1628754/1628754_10294855_1531351053092_DSCN4611--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="kangaroo rat trapping"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">REU student Lorraine ?Mamo?
