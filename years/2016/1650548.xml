<AbstractNarration>Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) education and workforce development in the US are critical for global competitiveness and national security. However, the U.S. is facing a decrease in entrants to the STEM workforce which is not shared evenly across demographics. Specifically, women, underrepresented minorities, and people with disabilities obtain STEM degrees and enter the STEM workforce at levels significantly below their demographic representation in the U.S. The National Science Foundation's (NSF) Inclusion across the Nation of Communities of Learners of Underrepresented Discoverers in Engineering and Science (NSF INCLUDES) program supports models, networks, partnerships and research to ensure the broadening participation in STEM of women, members of racial and ethnic groups that have been historically underrepresented, persons of low socio-economic status, and people with disabilities. This conference focuses on collective impact as a strategy to address the broadening participation challenge.  Collective impact is distinguished from collaboration in that the alliances require a backbone organization to succeed. The goal of this project is to organize a conference to inform backbone organizations toward broadening participation in STEM education and the workforce. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference takes place at the University of California, San Diego January 20-22, 2017 and brings together Project Investigators from the Design and Development pilots, along with stakeholders in broadening participation in STEM on a local, regional, and national scale. The overarching goal of the conference is to develop the knowledge base of participants in the application of the collective impact model, and the role of backbone organizations to address specific issues and transition points of the STEM pipeline. Conference participants include K-12, community college, and university representatives; leaders in graduate education, policy makers and private sector employers.  The conference includes plenary sessions, ?flash? presentations, and interactive workgroups engaged in the development of collective impact approaches to problems in Broadening Participation in STEM.  Workgroups share their insights, and audience feedback is electronically curated via Twitter and Storify. To respond in real time to participant questions or insights this conference uses the innovative platform, IdeaWave, to solicit, sort and value ideas from the attendees before, during, and after the conference.  Conference results are integrated into a final report to inform the NSF INCLUDES Alliances backbone organizations. The intellectual merit of the project is that it advances knowledge about the barriers to broadening participation in STEM education and the workforce, the collective impact model, and the role of the backbone organization to guide the vision and strategy, and support the activities, evaluation, and communication of the NSF INCLUDES Alliances. The broader impact of this project is that it benefits society by informing backbone organizations, which leads to broadening participation of the STEM workforce and ultimately increases U.S. global competitiveness and national security.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In September 2016, UC San Diego was the recipient of National Science Foundation Inclusion across the Nation of Communities of Learners of Underrepresented Discoverers in Engineering and Science (NSF INCLUDES) Conference Grant No.1650548.  Under the leadership of Principal Investigator Dr. Kim Barrett, the conference planning committee developed and implemented the conference on January 20-22, 2017 at UC San Diego. The conference brought together 157 participants that included Project Investigators from NSF INCLUDES Design and Development pilot grants, and stakeholders in broadening participation in STEM at local, regional, and national levels. Conference participants included K-12, community college, and university representatives; leaders in graduate education, policy makers and private sector employers.  The overarching goal of the conference was to develop the knowledge base of participants in the application of the collective impact model and the role of backbone organizations in addressing specific issues and transition points of the STEM pipeline.  The planning committee created a conference program that 1) provided opportunities to learn from plenary speakers and successful NSF INCLUDES pilot grantees about their experiences with collective impact and broadening participation in STEM, and 2) engaged participants in applying the principles of collective impact to real challenges in the STEM pathway.  A primary feature of the conference was workgroup activity focused on specific themes related to broadening participation in STEM. The UC San Diego Office of Operational Strategic Initiatives? crowdsourcing program, IdeaWave, was instrumental to this aspect of the conference.  IdeaWave was utilized in pre-conference work to gauge participant knowledge of collective impact, and to identify prominent concepts of interest to participants.  The NSF INCLUDES conference themes that became the basis for the workgroups included:  Two Year Colleges - Pipeline, Success, and Opportunities for Research Industry and Private Sector Engagement High School to Undergraduate - Increasing Transfer Rates, Transition Points, and Leaks in the Pipeline K-12 Engagement - Identity, Preparation, and Early Interventions Removing Economic Barriers for Underrepresented Minority Engagement with STEM Links to Community Research Priorities and Support to Boost Engagement and Retention Network Improvement Communities as a Means to Collective Impact Women - How to Retain in STEM Post-docs/Early Career Investigators, Supporting and Retaining       Peer Mentoring, Near Peer Mentoring, and Addressing Intimidation vs. Expectations   Over three days, the workgroups were asked to apply the principles of collective impact in addressing possible outcomes or solutions for the theme/conceptand, and to document their progress within the IdeaWave tool.   Post Conference Survey and IdeaWave Campaign Analysis  A post-conference survey was conducted to understand the impact of the conference on participants? understanding of and confidence in implementing collective impact and their skills at broadening participation at various levels. Specifically, we expected that the conference would:  Increase participants? understanding of collective      impact, including common agenda, shared measurement, mutually reinforcing      activities, continuous communication, and backbone organization. Increase the ability of participants to broaden      participation at various levels, including K-12, community college,      four-year institutions, graduate studies, and in the STEM workforce.  Increase the confidence of the participants in      implementing collective impact.    Survey results revealed an increase in participant understanding of the principles of collective impact: common agenda, shared measurement, mutually reinforcing activities, and backbone organization. However, participants did not self-report an increase in skills or confidence in broadening participation through collective impact as a result of the conference.  After the conference the campaign management team evaluated the solutions and outcomes of each workgroup as documented in the IdeaWave tool and using the following criteria:  Urgency: How urgent is the need and/or solutions      proposed associated with this concept? Scale: High/Medium/Low Impact: What is the degree of impact that the solutions      proposed by the concept team will have?  Scale: High/Medium/Low Feasibility: Are the solutions proposed within this      concept feasible in terms of time and resources?  Scale: Yes/No   Seven out of ten workgroup solutions and outcomes were considered feasible based upon how well-rounded and detailed the recommendations were within the IdeaWave elaboration form. Therefore, even though participants did not self-report an increase in skills or confidence in broadening participation through collective impact, the workgroup outcomes and solutions demonstrated that they were able to identify common agendas and developed mutually reinforcing strategies for their concept areas. In addition, 71% of participants responded that the conference met their expectations. This suggests that the conference was successful at achieving its goal of increasing the knowledge base of participants of the collective impact model and its application.
