<AbstractNarration>This EArly-Concept Grant for Exploratory Research (EAGER) project will design an analytic model for assessing a community's resilience and analyzing the multi-dimensional effects of a crisis or disaster on the population.  The research will provide new insights into network theory and how network characteristics affect transmission of hazard and risk warnings within communities.  The outcomes of this effort will provide alternate approaches to planning and response, and develop the foundation for analyzing dynamic changes in social network structure that occur as crises unfold.  Project findings will provide first responders, local, and state governments with the capacity to visualize and mobilize their communities and human capital in innovative and effective ways.  The project also offers the potential to enhance public and private sector collaboration for disaster planning, build trusted communications networks, and improve coordination of resources across the private sector.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The mobilization of human capital is the most challenging facet of any response to a disaster.  This research adopts a novel approach for analyzing civil emergencies by addressing the core question of the cost - broadly defined in terms of the negative social, economic and psychological impacts - of a single civil disaster event on a community.  The research will employ a mixed-methods, multi-disciplinary approach to conduct a full spectrum of impact analyses on the economic, social, psychological, and security costs of a civil disaster.  The impact analyses will be followed by an assessment of the response, resiliency, and adaptability of the community through the integration of the human capital database.  Findings from this research could potentially transform analytical approaches in evaluating the response and economic cost analyses of disasters.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ On July 23, 2015, a lone gunman entered the Grand 16 Theater in Lafayette, Louisiana during the 7:00 p.m. showing and randomly opened fire into the theater with a semi-automatic handgun. Nine people were injured and three died, including the gunman, who killed himself to avoid arrest. The incident led to a dynamic community response: civic events in the weeks following the tragedy focused on strengthening ties across the community, and included a wide range of ceremonies, memorials, and marches to unite and strengthen the community in the aftermath of the tragedy.  In response to these events, a research team at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette conducted a multi-disciplined, broad-spectrum analysis of the economic, social, psychological, and security impact of the incident on the city and parish. While much of the media attention focused on the human dimension of the tragedy, there were major economic, social and security consequences for the community. The event thus stands as a case study of the ripple effects of a single tragedy and its consequences.  Review of the community impact was completed using several techniques. First, by an analysis of media coverage of the shooting incident within a two-year window of the event. Second, through a sampling method to collect interviews with community stakeholders and key individuals affected by the incident. Third, a community interview collection event?called a ?History Harvest??was held at the second anniversary of the incident to collect community impressions of the long-term impact of this event on the community. Finally, additional interviews were conducted with community First Responders involved in the incident response, and a survey conducted of local businesses to assess potential economic and financial impact on local businesses. Over 800 individuals were involved with the project, including community members, undergraduate and graduate student researchers, and others.  The significant contribution of this research project was the development of a set of standard questions to evaluate individual perceptions of a community to the tragedy of a mass-casualty shooting in a public theater within the city. The process and interview technique for ?History Harvests? was refined and archived for historic record, and to form the basis of the research approach for future disasters, such as floods, hurricanes, and other regional and community crises.  Interview questions measured:     1. the relational history of an individual to a single traumatic incident; 2. the short-term impact and long-term perception of incident effects within a community; 3. the specificity of memories of an event at the first or second anniversary; 4. the perception of community response and effectiveness of emergency management strategies at the first or second anniversary of an incident; 5. the impression of long-term community preparedness for similar emergencies; 6. the impression of community recovery efforts at the first or second anniversary of the incident; 7. and the memories of media influence in community response both during and after the incident.      This process was then replicated for subsequent incidents in the same community and others in the state of Louisiana following a major flood and a hurricane to test the process of community rapid-response collection following disasters.  A significant finding was that data collection for generally qualitative measures such as economic impact, community actions and communications, and operational procedures between responder agencies, are best collected immediately after an event, before memory of fades and clarity merges with other succeeding incidents, and before the press of current events displaces past ones.  Conversely, perceptions of community and individual reactions and longer-term impacts and affects often need a gestation period to occur, and often for individuals?particularly those touched at the personal level by tragedy?to have assimilated and processed the event, and to reach a point where members of the affected community are willing and able to talk about the incident.  Overall, one lesson was specifically learned from this project?that the rapid implementation of community interview collection events should be initiated within a first- or third-year window of an incident for best practice in terms of memory of the specifics of the incident's effects, and to best enact the collection method within this key timetable. For example, interviews collected as part of this project at the first anniversary provided different data than those collected at the second anniversary due to distance from the event, but were notably diminishing in quality of specifics remembered by the third anniversary of an event.

The impact, as recalled by residents of this community, is similar to other disasters experienced, such as major floods and hurricanes.
