<AbstractNarration>Archaeologists, forensic scientists, and air crash examiners often find objects of evidence broken in many pieces, and if the number is large they face the problem of how to match, edge shapes and surface markings to fit the fragments back together. In cases where individual sites often yield thousands of pieces this problem can be particularly acute. This research will develop a computer assisted program, "SnowVision" to aid in fitting fragments of objects together.  The research is of significance for its use not only at archaeological sites but also for the general applicability of the algorithms developed. The project will provide new insights into a novel line of research for computer vision scientists. The open-source nature of the project means that the products delivered by the team can be addressed to multiple challenges. In addition to the educational impacts, the project includes outreach efforts to Native-American tribes and institutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Karen Smith and her research team are addressing this issue by focusing on a specific type of prehistoric Southeastern US pottery which contains paddle-stamped designs. For the development and implementation of SnowVision, Dr. Smith and her team focus on the designs embellished on Swift Creek pottery, ca. AD 200-800, found on sites throughout the Deep South. Swift Creek's curvilinear designs, which were carved onto wooden paddles and subsequently stamped onto pottery vessels, offer insights into networks of exchange, ritual, and mobility at an unprecedented level of granularity when paddle matches are found across archaeological contexts, as they so often are. Limitations of time, design expertise, and collections access have been the primary impediments to advancement in the study of these pre-Columbian networks, for which design matches provide unequivocal evidence. SnowVision will increase the speed by which researchers are able to identify design matches from different archaeological sites. This will, in turn, incentivize the digitization of understudied collections. By making the software and related pottery sherd images available online, SnowVision also will increase the reach of collections curated in different museums. Dissemination of the designs will continue to raise awareness of the deep decorative traditions of our Nation's indigenous communities. Sherd images will be archived with Open Context, where sherd data can be leveraged with data from other research projects.</AbstractNarration>

The purpose of  Snowvision is to investigate the possibilities of using computer-vision  technologies to analyze fragmentary sherds in order to reconstruct, and  thereby study, southeastern Native North American carved wooden paddle  designs and the extent of their geographical spread. Understanding how  widespread these designs were will give unprecedented insight into the  social and economic networks among the residents of the Southeast some  2,000 years ago.</p> <p>Swift Creek research would not be possible without the paddle design  reconstruction work done by Bettye J. Broyles and Frankie Snow, our  project?s namesake. Since the wooden paddles do not survive in the  archaeological record, both artists pieced together designs from  fragments of vessels, called sherds, to reconstruct the original paddle  carving. The work of both artists show that one design can be found at  multiple sites, indicating connections between communities. The  Snowvision project, both in our algorithm and the use of the World  Engraved website as data-sharing repository for archaeologists, thus  complements existing research and provides new possibilities for  expanding research methods.</p> <p>NSF support allowed the Snowvision team to fully engage with the core  of our project, a robust matching algorithm based on computer vision  and deep neural network machine learning. Identifying the full  curvilinear paddle design from fragmentary sherds is a challenging  computer vision problem. First, each sherd only contains a small portion  of the underlying full paddle design. Second, the available sherds  rarely come from the same vessel, and it is difficult to assemble them  into large pieces for more complete curve patterns. Third, one carved  paddle will be applied multiple times on the vessel surface with spatial  overlap. As a result, curve patterns detected on sherds may be  incomplete or very noisy due to both the gap when applying a planar  carved paddle onto a curved pottery surface and the erosion of sherd  surfaces over centuries. Furthermore, a sherd may contain a composite  pattern?a small fragment of multiple, partially overlapping copies of  the same design. Such a composite pattern is not simply a portion of the  full design.</p> <p>To address the above challenges, we have used computer vision  research to develop a new framework for identifying carved paddle  designs from pottery sherds. Broadly speaking, we extract the curve  pattern from a sherd and then compare it to each known design in our  database, returning a rank order of the best to least-best match. We  extract curve patterns using a fully convolutional neural network. Our  CNN re-ranking algorithm then finds the sherd?s underlying design, or  matches it with a composite pattern, using a new Chamfer matching  algorithm.</p> <p>NSF support also enabled the team to engage with research standards  in information science. A user needs survey conducted during the project  indicates that  potential users are primarily researchers and curators  who may have  hundreds or thousands of sherds for submission. To  encourage robust and accurate collection of submission data that meets  the unique information needs of archaeological researchers, our team  developed metadata schemas for sherd, design, and site submissions,  which are available through World Engraved.</p> <p>The computer infrastructure is now place to carry Snowvision beyond known designs.
