<AbstractNarration>The Gaseous Electronics Conference (GEC) is an annual topical meeting of the American Physical Society sponsored under the auspices of the Division of Atomic, Molecular and Optical Physics.  It is the leading international conference in the science and technology of Low Temperature Plasmas (LTP) combined with collision physics (CP). The GEC combines aspects of atomic, molecular, and optical physics with low-temperature plasma physics, electric discharges, and plasma chemistry, as well as their technological applications.  The conference has been the venue of the first presentations on world leading developments in investigations of LTP and CP topics including advanced combustion systems, lighting and lasers, plasma materials processing of relevance to the semiconductor and photovoltaics industry, and plasma application in biomedicine.  The invited speakers represent the world's leading scientists in these fields. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will pay partial travel support for 10 US PhD students to attend and present the results of their work at the 69th Annual GEC meeting to be hosted on October 10-14, 2016 by Ruhr-Universitat Bochum, Germany. This meeting is expected to attract more than 600 plasma scientists, collision physicists, and engineers. This award will provide the opportunity for PhD students to establish peer to peer collaboration with researchers from around the world. The students will have the opportunity to observe first-hand the scientific and cultural diversity of the field, and establish what will hopefully be career long collaborations with their international counterparts. The GEC makes a special effort to support graduate students who are women and underrepresented minorities.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In 2016, The Gaseous Electronics Conference was held in Bochum, Germany and Hosted by Ruhr-Universit&auml;t Bochum.  Historically, when the conference is hosted by non-US based institutions, a US based institution will serve as steward for NSF backed student travel support for students attending the conference from US based institutions.  In 2016, NC State University agreed to act as the steward for the annual NSF award (NSF has generously supported student attendance at GEC since 1977).  Student travel grant requests were received and awards were made accounting for the $10,000 grant received by NSF.  All travel requests were honored, and students travelling from the U.S. were allowed $1,200 in travel reimbursement to attend.  Reimbursement for travel was carried out after the conference; receipts were required from student travel awardees so that the allocation of funds would be treated as reimbursement for costs incurred, and not as a stipend that would require students to complete a W-9 form and treat the stipend as income.     Upon completion of the conference, it was clear that the 2016 GEC was going to close the books with a substantial surplus due to increased registration above projection and the generous access to facilities for the conference through Ruhr-Universit&auml;t Bochum.  It was concluded that given the surplus, GEC would waive using the NSF funds for the 2016 Conference.       Since reimbursements were not sent out until after the conference ended and the realization of the budget surplus was made, it is important to point out that not using these funds in no way impacted the level of support provided to students who would have otherwise received funds from this grant.  Since the determination not to use the funds was made after the award announcements had been distributed, and this was done assuming addition of the NSF support, the number of students and their level of support both were not impacted by use of NSF funds.
