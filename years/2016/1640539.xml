<AbstractNarration>Developing a titanium implant surface that can be fully integrated with the surrounding bone while inhibiting the development of infections by microorganisms will improve orthopedic implant performance, improve patient outcomes, reduce patient morbidity and decrease health care costs. This team has engineered a bio-inspired interface built upon chimeric peptides that bind to titanium. Similar to facial recognition, the peptide recognizes the atomic face only of titanium. Another peptide with a desired biological function for antimicrobial, or bone formation or cell anchoring is joined with the surface-binding peptide function to make a chimeric peptide. The proposed product, a chimeric peptide both anchors and delivers biological signals to the patient that will reduce infections, reduce costs, and reduce risk while improving patient outcomes. Titanium alloys are frequently used material for joint replacement, restoration of craniofacial and axial skeletal birth defects and bone loss to combat injuries. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the I-Corps curriculum kick-off, the team will interview thought leaders at the Center for Disease Control and surgeons at Emory University who use titanium implants.  In subsequent interviews, the team will travel to sites offering a high-density of "information-rich strangers" who can help shape the commercialization interests of the proposed company, Integrated Interfaces. These plans include travelling and interviewing knowledgeable individuals at The Annual Orthopaedic Manufacturing and Technology Exposition and Conference (OMTEC), The California Dental Association (CDA) Convention, The American Dental Association (ADA) Convention, coupled by physical proximity with a visit to The Orthopedic Surgery Residency Program at the University of California Davis, School of Veterinary Medicine, Davis, CA. The team will also consult with and retain Dr. Francis Richmond of the USC Regulatory Sciences Program to help the team with the FDA regulatory compliance. Following completion of I-Corps, the team plans to research several business pathway critical issues, including the in vivo stability of the interface, the in vivo duration of Wnt signaling to stem cells, the quantity and quality of bone formed in vivo, and the immunogenicity of the chimeric peptides.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Our invention is based on our years of biomedical research and our commitment to improve the health of Americans. We are bringing to market a water based green technology that improves the performance of any titanium and titanium alloy implant surface. Implants are used in dental, hip, knee, elbow and spine applications to correct disease loss of the bone. They also have application in the treatment of our military personnel who receive traumatic bone injuries occurring from improvised explosive devices. The invention uses a discovery funded by the NSF for creation of new materials at the atomic level.

Value Propositions Discovered  Enhance professional reputation through successfully managing post-implant complications to extend the lifespan of implants Boost practice profitability with better implant-bone fixation and less infection The surface coating is easy to use and can be applied to any implant system to increase long-term success rate Higher success rate, less infection, and less pain     Customer Segments  Dentists maintaining implants Dentists placing implants Implant patients   We attended the I-Corps training sessions at Georgia Tech where Dr. Zhou was recognized as the best Entrepreneurial Lead among all of the participating teams.  We learned how to think about business opportunities and how to define our customer base and their ecosystem.

We initially thought to address all implants with our novel technology, but soon found that a pivot to providing a coating product to dental implants only made the best fit for the market.  Dental implants are considered elective and comprise a high-end therapeutic market and our coating could expand the market for high-end manufacturers.  We submitted a R43 application "In vivo Stability of Biomimetic Implant Interface" to the National Institutes of Health, National Institute for Dental and Craniofacial Research.
