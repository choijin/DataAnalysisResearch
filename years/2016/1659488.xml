<AbstractNarration>This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) program at Indiana University Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) will provide eight undergraduate students from across the United States with the opportunity to conduct research on the data science of human activity.  The students will spend ten weeks during the summer working with IUPUI faculty on projects related to predictive modeling and estimation of risk with applications to crime, conflict, political instability and daily routine activity.  The students will also attend a data science bootcamp as part of the program that will provide training in the foundations of data science (statistics, machine learning, and software development).  Data science is a rapidly growing field due to increases in the volume and variety of data being generated.  Graduates with skill sets at the intersection of mathematics, statistics, computing, data analysis, and data modeling are in high demand, both in industry and academia.  The REU site will increase undergraduate student awareness, preparation, and interest in pursuing graduate degrees in STEM fields where data science is becoming a larger focus.  Students choosing to pursue a career in industry upon graduation will also be better prepared to meet the data challenges of the increasing number of companies where data science is a high priority. &lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;The REU projects address new challenges in the data science of risk and human activity.  Students working in problem area 1 will focus on learning to rank problems for space-time crime prediction.  Machine learning models for ranking crime hotspots according to risk will be developed that will be tailored to ranking based loss functions that arise in criminology.  The second project will focus on classifying types of activity from mobile sensor time series.  The students will compare existing techniques to deep learning algorithms employing architectures developed specifically for 3d data from the accelerometer and gyroscope.  The third area of research will focus on point process models of heterogeneous grievance data.  In particular, students will develop spatio-temporal models for conflict data in Sub-Saharan Africa coupled with geolocated, relevant Tweets from the same time period.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goal of the REU Site in Data Science of Risk and Human Activity was to increase undergraduate student awareness, preparation, and interest in pursuing graduate degrees and/or industry positions in STEM fields where data science is becoming a larger focus.   A second goal was to increase data science awareness and preparation in under-represented groups (women and minority) and to provide opportunities in data science research to undergraduates at both teaching and research universities.  Eight students participated in the summer research program in each of the three years.  Students attended a data science bootcamp in week one taught by the PIs.  Students then worked in small groups on research projects for the remainder of the summer.  Activities included external speaker presentations, a weekly update presentations among the program participants, IUPUI Summer Research Symposium poster presentations, and preparation of final research reports.  Social activities were also a part of the program, including start and end of program dinners, outings to baseball games, an astronomical observatory and the zoo.  In terms of preparing students for graduate school, the REU site was highly successful in training students in research.  Ultimately, 6 of the 11 group projects over the 3 year grant resulted in peer-reviewed publications with the REU students as first authors.  Publication venues included KDD, IEEE BigData, and Transactions on Spatial Algorithms and Systems.  Students also provided quantitative feedback on their intention to go to graduate school. Across the three years, from a scale of 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree), we saw increases pre/post-REU in the average score for intention to apply to graduate school from 2.71 (pre) to 3.18 (post).  Nine of the former REU students are now enrolled in CS, Math, or Statistics graduate programs and eight of the former REU students are working in industry as data scientists or software engineers (several students are still working towards undergraduate degrees as of Fall 2020).  Another objective of the REU site was to increase awareness of data science for under-represented students (women and minority).  The recruited cohorts comprised 45% women (n=11) compared to 55% male (n=13 students).  In terms of the student racial/ethnic distribution, 75% (n=18) students identified as Caucasian, 16% (n=4) students identified as Asian, 4% (n=1) students identified as Latino/Hispanic and 4% (n=1) students identified as Pacific Islander.   The research conducted through the REU grant had significant intellectual merit.  One project that focused on a novel survival modeling approach to analyzing transitions in drug addiction on reddit was published in KDD 2019, a top data mining conference.  Another project focused on coupling infinite Gaussian mixture models with generative adversarial networks (IGMM-GAN) for anomaly detection in human mobility data.  The method improves upon existing GAN-based anomaly detection techniques that do not accurately capture multi-modal patterns in the latent space and was published in Transactions on Spatial Algorithms and Systems.  We also proposed a novel problem named group link prediction, published at IEEE BigData, which focuses on evaluating the likelihood for a candidate to become a member of a group at a given time.  To solve the problem, we proposed a Long Short-term Memory based model that inputs the embedding vectors of the group and outputs the conditional probability distributions for the candidates.  Seven total publications (from six projects) with undergraduate students as first authors resulted from the REU grant.  There were also broader impacts that resulted from the project.  Students who participated in the program were more likely to self report as interested in graduate school after completing the program.  Nine of those students have already enrolled in STEM graduate programs and eight others are working in industry.  Several of the projects resulted in algorithms and software systems that have applications to criminal justice and emergency response.  A social harm modeling project was eventually extended into a software application that was used by Indianapolis Police Department in a 3 month field trial where officers focused on identified traffic crash hotspots, distributed drug treatment center information in drug overdose hotspots, and conducted foot patrols in property crime hotspots where local community members were engaged and alerted to elevated crime rates.  The low cost gunshot detector developed through the grant could be used to more quickly respond to gunshot related emergencies by smaller and mid-size cities that do not have the budget for high-end commercial systems.
