<AbstractNarration>The ocean's midwater realm is the next frontier for underwater robots.  The mesopelagic or "twilight" zone encompasses depths from 200 to 1000 meters where sunlight is dim. This vast region plays a key role in regulating ocean chemistry and biology, which in turn strongly effects global climate. The mesopelagic zone holds much of our planet's fish populations as well as poorly understood processes that couple the ocean surface to the seafloor including vertical fluxes of plankton, organic and inorganic particles, bubbles, and droplets. Mesopelagic features are often mobile, patchy, and ephemeral, so surveys and sampling can be very difficult.  Recent studies have found that mesopelagic biomass including fish are dramatically underestimated, yet investigations of patterns and processes in this region are strongly constrained by available technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This program will produce a unique new robot that will enable unprecedented scientific access to midwater environments, complementing existing survey and sampling tools. The robot will use cameras, lights, and oceanographic sensors to autonomously track slow-moving individual targets such as migrating mid-water animals, descending particles, and rising bubbles and droplets without disturbing those targets. It will also have the ability to detect and follow fine-scale oceanographic features such as thin layers that hold critical nutrients. Finally, the robot will take samples utilizing on-board intelligence to determine precisely when and where to sample. Under this program, the robot will be built and tested under a collaboration between the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute, Stanford University, and the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project was a collaborative effort by the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute, the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute, Stanford University and the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley.  The goal of this project was to create a new autonomous underwater vehicle, the Mesobot, designed specifically to explore the ocean?s midwater regions. The midwater is one of the most important, yet least explored regions of the Earth?s oceans.  Not only is it a critical fishery, the processes taking place in the midwater are a primary driver of the Earth?s carbon cycle and hence its climate.  To understand these processes, the ability to perform long duration (e.g. complete diurnal cycles) observations of the behavior of its inhabitants is required.  This capability, however, was very limited with existing technology.       Previously, most all in-situ observations of these animals were performed using remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) controlled by pilots through a tether from a tending surface ship.  While these data led to many remarkable discoveries, they provided only snapshots of an animal?s behavior, since observing time was typically limited to only a few hours.  To gain a more complete understanding, observing times greater than 24 hours is required, and the Mesobot was designed to meet this need. It is a 250kg AUV, that was designed to track midwater gelatinous animals (and other targets) for long periods of time, in-situ, autonomously and with minimal effect on the target?s behavior.  It is able to carry a suite of science sensors which includes a low-light camera as well as a pair of stereo cameras used by the control system for tacking midwater targets.      Besides developing the Mesobot vehicle, another goal of the project was to develop an autonomous tracking algorithm that was sufficiently robust to enable the Mesobot to maintain visual lock on a target for extended times.  Gelatinous midwater targets undergo large shape changes, they collide with or occlude each other, and they sometimes leave, and then return to, the field of view. They can also be enveloped in a school of squid or krill.  A human pilot typically has no trouble maintaining visual lock on a target in these situations.  However, matching the perceptive capability of a pilot is a challenge for an automated system.  During this project, significant progress towards this goal was also achieved.
