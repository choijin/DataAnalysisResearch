<AbstractNarration>Postdoctoral Fellow: Alyssa-Lois Madden Gehman&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: 1611651&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology for FY 2016, Research Using Biological Collections. The fellowship supports a research and training plan for the Fellow to take transformative approaches to grand challenges in biology that employ biological collections in highly innovative ways.  The title of the research plan for this fellowship to Alyssa-Lois Madden Gehman is "Past and present effects of multiple stressors on host-parasite interactions."  The host institution for this fellowship is the University of British Columbia and the sponsoring scientist is Dr. Christopher Harley.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project uses museum collections to address how environmental change fundamentally alters species interactions over several decades. Specifically, the Fellow is evaluating the effect of changing temperature and ocean acidification conditions on host-parasite interactions, using mussel-cyanobacteria interactions as a model system. Shell boring parasites, such as endolithic cyanobacteria, are unique in that they leave traces of their infection in preserved host shells. Mussels can be infected by shell boring parasites, and analysis of shell chemistry can estimate the ocean conditions at the time the mussels were alive. To accomplish the research goals, the Fellow is identifying endolithic cyanobacterial species and ichnospecies (a way of identifying the cyanobacteria parasite based on shell boring pattern), and measuring endolithic cyanobacterial growth and host defense using museum specimens from the Beaty Biodiversity Museum and the California Academy of Sciences. The Fellow is also conducting field sampling and experiments to confirm correlative patterns from collections.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In terms of training goals, the Fellow is gaining expertise in 1) paleontological methods of ichnospecies identification, 2) genetic techniques for identifying extant species, 3) stable isotope analysis, 4) biomechanical measurements and 5) conducting ocean acidification experiments. The Fellow is also integrating research with an outreach program that encourages community environmental awareness, leadership, diversity, self-confidence, and knowledge of the outdoors. To support this mission, the outreach program includes collaboration with a student-led outdoor education program associated with the public high schools in Seattle, WA. The Fellow is engaging students in hands-on field ecology, including the development of a coastal field trip during which the students aid with the field components of the Fellow's research.  An additional aspect of the outreach program includes communicating with local, national and international media, both through traditional radio and newspaper reporting and through more modern avenues such as blogs and podcasts.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit  Ecologists face a grand challenge to find generalities in the outcome of species interactions, such as predator-prey or host-parasites across time and space. In a world replete with interacting species, the relationships between hosts and endosymbiotic organisms can provide insight into how environmental context can alter species interaction outcomes.   Our work highlights generalities in the relationship between an ecosystem engineer and its endosymbiont; mussels and their shell-boring microbial communities (adjoining image, A). We experimentally demonstrated that mussel shell erosion is indeed biological in nature, and that bio-erosion resulted in lower energy absorption during low-tide exposure, which resulted in lower mussel body temperature during heat stress events. Thus, despite the reported direct negative effects of shell erosion (shell thinning, breakage, etc), bio-erosion also increased host survival during intertidal heatwaves at sites spanning 10 degrees of latitude, driven by decreased mussel body temperature during low tide exposure.

In the lower intertidal the bio-erosion rate on mussels was very low, likely because of light limitation on the shell-boring microbial communities which rely on irradiance for photosynthesis (adjoining image, B).  This endosymbiont-altered host experience of its environment could be determining when and where its host persists. Indeed, mussels that exist in the upper band of the intertidal may only be there because of the host-endosymbiont interaction.     Broader Impacts  This proposal achieved broader impacts: 1) By sitting on the alumni board of the outdoor education non-profit, Post 84, in Seattle, Washington.  Post 84 is a student-run outdoor education program, composed of ~350 public high school students.  In collaboration with the student leaders of the program I was able to provide scientific expertise to enhance the scientific merit of their program. 2) By co-leading a two-week marine science field trip provided to ~40 public high school students in Seattle, WA. 3) By sharing my research with the broader public, with an article in Hakai Magazine on my research, and through an interview with comedians on a Comedy Central show, ?The Opposition with Jordan Klepper?. 4) By training three undergraduate researchers.
