<AbstractNarration>CBET - 1640677&lt;br/&gt;PI: Narayanan, Ranga&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will support participation of scientists and engineers at the Eighth Conference of the International Marangoni Association, which will be held June 12-16, 2016 in Ban Honnef, Germany. The theme of the eighth conference in this series is Interfacial Fluid Dynamics and Processes. The conference will focus on industrial and practical applications in materials processing, biological transport and environmental remediation.  Fundamental problems to be addressed include crystal growth and solidification, gas-liquid systems, bubble dynamics in glass processing, and multiphase flow phenomena in a variety of applications.  The conference will have a balance of speakers from academia and industry and will be organized to promote connections between academic investigators and their international industrial counterparts. Support will be provided to emerging scientists, including students, post-docs, and junior faculty to help increase their participation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Session topics will focus at the interface of research and industrial practice and will include evaporation and drying, liquid bridges, droplet formation and spreading, particle accumulation and coating films, layered fluids, surfactants and foams, and electrohydrodynamics.  The proceedings of the conference will be published in the European Journal of Physics. Encouraging the participation of young investigators will help fill a national need to train a future work force in interfacial fluid mechanics and will provide a unique opportunity for young investigators to interact with leading researchers and industrial practitioners in this area.</AbstractNarration>
