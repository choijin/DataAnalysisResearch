<AbstractNarration>The Cyberlearning and Future Learning Technologies Program funds efforts that will help envision the next generation of learning technologies and advance what we know about how people learn in technology-rich environments. Cyberlearning CAP projects build capacity for research and development in the field of cyberlearning by improving technical infrastructure, human capital, and in other ways. The Annual Meeting of the Association for Educational Communications and Technology provides a forum for interchange of ideas around designing technological support for learning and training. This project supports an Early Career Symposium at the conference which allows early career scholars to receive mentoring from established cyberlearning researchers from both computer science and learning research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project supports travel for advanced graduate students and new faculty from U.S. universities to attend the Early Career Symposium at the AECT 2016 conference in Las Vegas, Nevada. Sessions during the Symposium are designed to help collaborators imagine forward-looking and viable technology-oriented research agendas, identify the types of collaborators who complement their strengths, and identify the funding agencies and programs that might support their work. An important goal of the Symposium is to add to the community of researchers interested in ways that technology can transform teaching and learning.</AbstractNarration>

The National Science Foundation (NSF)-Sponsored Early Career Symposium (ECS) was held at the International Convention of the Association for Educational Communications and Technology (AECT) on Monday and Tuesday, October 17-18, 2016, at the Westgate Las Vegas, Las Vegas, NV. The symposium was organized and hosted by the AECT Research and Theory Division with funding from NSF: Cyberlearning and Future Learning Technologies. Objectives of the Early Career Symposium were to:  Mentor doctoral students into the social/professional network as partners in ideation, prototyping, idea execution, and knowledge curation; Support early-career faculty and doctoral students in developing viable short- and long-term research agendas focused on cyberlearning technologies; Provide specific feedback and guidance to early-career faculty and doctoral students about their research agendas (e.g., how to build a research agenda, pursue funding, and maintain successful collaborations); Expand and strengthen the cyberlearning community by creating a community of researchers committed to designing the next generation of learning technologies and increasing understanding of how people learn in technology-rich learning environments.   SYMPOSIUM Participants This project supported five early-career faculty and five advanced doctoral students in developing viable short- and long-term research agendas in topics focused on Cyberlearning. Applicants were recruited through multiple AECT emails and postings. Interested participants submitted their curriculum vitae (CV), a statement expressing research interests and how they would benefit from ESC participation, and a letter of support from their advisor, in the case of doctoral students. A review panel of doctoral-level faculty rated each applicant on the quality of their application, their potential for research, and alignment of their research interests with topics of cyberlearning and future learning technologies. Five tenured faculty with established research agendas in the field of instructional design and technology served as mentors. Each mentor was matched with one early-career faculty and one advanced doctoral student whose research interests and methodologies aligned with their own. Each mentor interacted with mentees before, throughout, and for several months following the symposium. Activities  The symposium engaged participants in a day and a half of focused career mentoring and professional networking. Formal presentations, one-on-one mentoring, and discussion sessions featured topics of creating a research agenda, securing funding, and the logistics of networking, collaborating, and creating a digital presence.  Post-Symposium Activities  Mentors were asked to meet at least monthly with their mentees for the six months following the symposium to assist in refining their research agendas, preparing scholarly publications, and preparing grant proposals. A shared, online workspace was set up to support collaboration.  Evaluation  The Early Career Symposium was evaluated on three criteria:  Were the activities carried out as specified?      This was determined through observations and opportunistic interviews      conducted during the symposium by      the symposium coordinators. Were all mentees and mentors satisfied with the      experience? An online questionnaire featuring both Likert-scale and      open-ended questions was administered at the end of the symposium. It assessed the degree      to which the perceived needs of the mentees and mentors were met with      respect to supporting their personal research agendas, raising their      awareness about funding opportunities, and helping them join a community      of cyberlearning researchers. Did the activities of the symposium have a      lasting impact? Evaluations were conducted approximately six months after      the symposium to assess impact.     Long-term outcomes of success were the development of collaborations for seeking funding or conducting research in cyberlearning; continued mentoring/dialogue between mentees and mentors; and submission of collaborative grant proposals and/or manuscripts, where appropriate. These measures will be assessed as part of a larger evaluation conducted by the Research and Theory Division of AECT.  RESULTS  Post-symposium evaluations indicated that the symposium was beneficial to participants. Participants rated each presentation and mentoring session by topic area using a Likert scale (1=very unsatisfied to 5=very satisfied). The mean ratings for each item ranged from 4.56-4.89. When asked to rank order the symposium features in order of benefit, participants ranked presentation and discussion sessions as most beneficial, followed by formal networking opportunities (during meals and breaks), mentor?s expertise, and one-on-one mentoring sessions.
