<AbstractNarration>This proposal is concerned with several extensions and applications of the theory of homotopical higher categories.  Our first foundational objective is to develop equivariant versions of the many known models for homotopical higher categories and to establish equivalences between them.  Our first proposed application is the development of homotopical approaches to equivariant extended topological field theories.  The second application is the development of topological cluster categories arising from surfaces; extending to higher dimensions should allow for the development of new invariants of higher-dimensional manifolds analogous to ones for surfaces.  This second application should also inform the first, with higher-dimensional cluster categories giving new information about topological field theories.  The third application is concerned with connections between Hall algebras and algebraic K-theory.  In one direction, constructions of homotopical Hall algebras are expected to give rise to K-theory spectra which should give new information about Hall algebras, especially those related to quantum groups.  In another, variations of Hall algebra constructions have corresponding variants of algebraic K-theory which are worthy of further investigation.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broadly speaking, this proposal is concerned with incorporating algebraic information into categorical and topological structures which are currently being used in a wide range of kinds of mathematics.  We then seek to apply these enhanced structures in mathematical physics, manifold theory, and representation theory.  The educational component of this proposal consists of a series of four summer workshops for mathematics majors who are in the process of transferring to UC Riverside.  The goal is to help twenty participants each year to make the transition to upper-level mathematics via introduction to proof techniques, more theoretical concepts, and a broad overview of the range of topics in higher-level mathematics courses.  Students will be provided with some follow-up mentoring activities, including opportunities for participating in undergraduate research.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goal of the research done under this grant was to understand the interaction between algebraic and geometric structures arising in different areas of mathematics: homotopy theory, higher category theory, and algebraic K-theory.  The collaborative nature of many of the projects done here helped to make these interactions accessible to researchers working from different perspectives among these different areas.  The intellectual merit of this project was thus the advancement of these ideas.  The broader impacts of this project included support for research done by women in mathematics.  Several of the papers that came out of this project were done as part of the Women in Topology program, a series of workshops aimed at building collaboration among groups of women at different career stages.  This work thus not only brought together researchers who may not otherwise have collaborated with one another, but involved a mentoring component as I worked with more junior researchers.  As a CAREER grant, this proposal also involved an educational component.  In the first year, I organized a two-week summer program for incoming transfer students planning to major in mathematics, which faciliated their transition not only to a four-year university but also to upper-level, proof-based mathematics.  In subsequent years of the grant, a move to a new institution led me to change these educational goals.  I have directed undergraduate research projects, supported students and assisting graduate students during the summer to work on such projects, and have worked with the mathematics department and university-wide programs to faciliate more research by undergraduates in mathematics.  Both the transfer workshop and the undergraduate research projects included a number of students who are from under-represented groups in mathematics.
