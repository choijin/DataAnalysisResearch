<AbstractNarration>The goal of the proposed research is to greatly improve our ability to understand and predict&lt;br/&gt;space weather hazards to (1) electric power grids; and (2) electromagnetic wave propagation in&lt;br/&gt;the Earth-ionosphere waveguide up to ~20 kHz. The methodology of the proposed work is to&lt;br/&gt;advance and apply detailed, high-resolution Maxwell's equations models of the Earth-ionosphere&lt;br/&gt;waveguide developed by the project over the past decade. The project's three-dimensional (3-D) models&lt;br/&gt;uniquely include such details as the Earth?s complete topography, oceans, lithosphere&lt;br/&gt;composition, geomagnetic field, and ionospheric plasma. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research study is unique as existing analytical formulations or computational&lt;br/&gt;approaches applied to the investigated topics above do not solve the complete Maxwell's&lt;br/&gt;equations while also accounting for all of the 3-D geometrical details and time variability as&lt;br/&gt;permitted by the project's models.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A 2008 National Academies report indicates that extreme space&lt;br/&gt;weather events, "though rare, are likely to occur again some time in the future." However, a re-occurrence&lt;br/&gt;of an 1859-magnitude CME-driven geomagnetic storm could disrupt today's human&lt;br/&gt;society to a much greater degree than in 1859 due to the proliferation of vital but vulnerable&lt;br/&gt;electro-technologies. The first goal of the proposed modeling is to help individual power grid&lt;br/&gt;stations understand their specific vulnerability to space weather. The second goal of the&lt;br/&gt;proposed modeling is to help improve our understanding of electromagnetic propagation in the&lt;br/&gt;Earth-ionosphere waveguide under disturbed conditions. Applications that may benefit from this&lt;br/&gt;work include: remote sensing of the lower ionosphere, hypothesized electromagnetic earthquake&lt;br/&gt;precursors, propagation from lightning, geolocation, communications, and even global&lt;br/&gt;temperature change.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Storms (coronal mass ejections or CMEs) can occur on the sun and project particles and magnetic fields towards the Earth, resulting in geomagnetic storms on Earth.  The largest documented geomagnetic storm resulting from a CME on the sun occurred in 1859.  That storm caused telegraph operators communicating over 100-km-long wire lines to experience electric shocks, some nearly fatal.  Further, business transactions requiring telegraphic exchanges were completely shut down in the world?s major capitals.   A 2008 National Academies report indicates that extreme space weather events, "though rare, are likely to occur again some time in the future."  However, a re-occurrence of an 1859-magnitude space weather storm could disrupt today?s society to a much greater degree than in 1859 due to the proliferation of vital but vulnerable electrotechnologies.  Interruptions to radio communications, commercial airline flight plans, satellite operations, transportation, banking, financial systems, home and industrial computer electronics, and electric power grids are just some examples. The goal of our project was to create an ultra high-resolution electrodynamics model solving Maxwell?s equations within the Earth-ionosphere waveguide (within about +/- 100 km in altitude from the Earth?s surface) in order to improve our understanding of space weather hazards to electric power grids.  Specifically, we ran finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) models at resolutions of up to 300 x 300 x 1000 meters on a local or global scale to study the electromagnetic field behavior along the surface of the Earth during geomagnetic storms.  These models included the geometrical and material details of the ionosphere, topography / bathymetry, oceans, lithosphere, geomagnetic field, and disturbed ionospheric currents during space weather events.  Of particular focus this past year of our  modeling was the electromagnetic field behavior in coastal regions in order to determine whether space weather poses unique hazards to power grids along coastlines.  Our modeling did not find any evidence that large-scale blackouts could be caused by space weather-induced electromagnetic field behavior in coastal regions.  Our FDTD modeling greatly improves the state-of-the-art.  No other existing analytical formulations or numerical approaches for studying space weather effects on electric power grids simultaneously solve the complete Maxwell?s equations while also accounting for all of the 3-D geometrical details and realistic time variations as permitted by the PI?s models running on Blue Waters.  For example, our group accounted for realistic coastal topographical details and realistic ionospheric currents, whereas earlier analytical calculations were limited to infinite sloping coastlines.  The outcomes from this project in combination with future ongoing work may help individual power grid stations predict their specific vulnerability to space weather.  Since protective technologies are expensive to implement, our models may ultimately help station operators implement only those proteSave &amp; Submitctions that are necessary for their location and predicted vulnerability level based on the underlying rock structure, their vicinity to ocean-continent boundaries, latitude position, etc.  Further, the outcomes from this project along with future ongoing work may help society maintain the use of technologies that rely heavily on global electromagnetic wave propagation during space weather events (e.g. communications, radar, etc.).
