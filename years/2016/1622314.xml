<AbstractNarration>1512192(Kanso) &amp; 1509071(Sotiropoulos)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the proposed research is to investigate, experimentally and numerically, the motion of irregularly shaped objects as they cross fluid-air interfaces and the phenomena that occur at the interface and the bulk of the fluid because of the presence of the object. Understanding the underlying phenomena could lead to controlling the process by controlling the object shape or controlling the type of fluid. Results from this research can have implications for the design of small robotic vehicles that move across fluid-air interfaces or the design of off-shore wind turbines or oil platforms. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This problem of object entry is generally complex, even for regularly shaped objects, such as spheres and discs, but is particularly interesting for objects with sharp leading geometries, such as cone- or pyramid-shaped objects, where the interplay between the body geometry and the complex vortical flows that develop at and near the fluid-air interface could help to dissipate the impact energy away from the body crossing the fluids' boundary. This proposal will analyze the fluid-structure interactions of objects moving in and across multi-phase incompressible fluids, and will particularly explore how the interplay between the object's geometry and material properties and the complex flow structures (waves and vortices) that develop at and near the fluid interfaces can be exploited to hinder or facilitate the motion of the solid object. During this project, carefully designed experiments as well as through mathematical and computational models will be used to investigate  the following two problems: (i) Forward problem: for a given multi-phase fluid medium and shape/material properties of the object, what is the forward dynamics of the body and the surrounding fluids? (ii) Inverse problem: two types of problems: a. For a desired response such as aiding the motion of the solid object in a given fluid environment, what geometric/materials design principles should the object fulfill?  b. For a desired response such as hindering the motion of the solid object, what properties should the fluid medium have?  Activities are also proposed that involve undergraduate curriculum development at USC and at the University of Minnesota, as well as outreach efforts to K-12 students in the greater LA area through the USC VAST program and the Cabrillo Aquarium in San Pedro.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   This project developed new computational methods enabling the numerical simulation of the flow environment in both air and water occuring when a rigid or a felxible three-dimensional body crosses the air-water interface.  We demonstrated for the first time that integrating laboratory measurements with such powerful numerical techniques can provide striking insights into the flow dynamics and thrust production mechanisms for archer fish jumping out of the water.  We note that while such studies have been reported in the past for single phase flows (e.g. c-Start of fish in water, etc.), this is the very first time that we demonstrate the ability to study complex biological flows across the air-water interface.  Since experiments with live fish reported data only in the water phase, the simulations elucidated for the first time the dynamics of the flow in the air phase and paved the way for future more targeted experiments and numerical simulations. The numerical code we have developed and the overall approach for reconstructing fish anatomy and motion from digital video recording provides a powerful tool for the biological community to study a wide range of flows involving fish and birds crossing the boundary as well as to drive the development of biomimetically inspired autonomous vehicles crossing the interface. In terms of Broader Impacts, the project PI developed a lecture aimed at introducing women undergraduate students in the College of Engineering and Applied Sciences (CEAS) at Stony Brook University (SBU) to computational science in general and its impact on aquatic biology in particular (based largerly on the results of this project).  The lecture is part of the WSE 105 (Opportunities in STEM and Beyond) course, which is taken by all Women in Science and Engineering (WISE) Honors students at Stony Brook University during their first year of study. This is a seminar-type course composed of discussions and explorations of the various science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) disciplines, possible career paths, and its worldwide relevance.
