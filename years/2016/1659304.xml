<AbstractNarration>With this research, the Principal Investigator (PI) seeks to utilize data from an inter-hemispheric network of 13 conjugate-point all sky imagers (ASI) to investigate various upper atmosphere phenomena that are manifestation of a couple ionosphere-thermosphere-magnetosphere (ITM) system.  This study, utilizing data from instruments deployed globally, offers a unique way to make progress by studying the effects a single cause has in two hemispheres simultaneously; with high-resolution images illuminating the roles receptor conditions play for each phenomenon studied.  The broader impacts of this project are very strong, spanning education and training of students, outreach activities, and international collaborations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The scientific goals of this research, i.e., to study a broad set of upper atmospheric science topics that are manifestations of highly coupled systems within and connected to the ITM regions, are highly compelling, and the utilization of a global network of imagers would open new scientific investigations enabled by this comprehensive observational capability.  The distinguished high qualifications of the investigators, together with an impressive and long-standing record of significant productivity represent high likelihood of success.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[       This grant supported research dealing with the Earth's upper atmosphere---a region extending from about 50 miles above the surface to the threshold of outer space at a height of 500 miles.  Two main sub-regions are studied: (1) the Mesosphere (a domain of molecules of oxygen and nitrogen, with smaller amounts of "trace gases"&mdash;for example, atoms of sodium); (2) Above this region is the Ionosphere (a region when ultra-violet light from the Sun causes the dominate gas (atoms of oxygen) to be split into electrically charged ions (O+) and electrons (e-).  The collective name for ions and electrons is called a Plasma, the most common form of gases in the Universe.  Thus, by studying the plasma physics of the ionosphere, we learn about processes at Earth, but also about cosmic properties of the Universe.     At Boston University, we study these regions using the light emitted by both gases and plasmas, in conjunction with other methods of observations (e.g., radars and satellites).  Using in-house designed and built optical instruments called "All-Sky-Imagers" (ASIs), we have established a unique network of optical diagnostics on six continents (3 in USA and Puerto Rico; 3 in Argentina; and one each in Colombia, Peru, Chile, New Zealand, Antarctica, Italy, Germany and South Africa).  There are two fundamental regions for such a network: (1) different physical processes occur within specific latitude zones (sub-auroral, middle, trans-equatorial), and (2) common processes occur at the ends of the Earth’s magnetic field lines---foot prints in each hemisphere called Conjugate Points.  These regions of the ionosphere often experience disturbances initiated by solar activity (called Space Weather events), but also by meteorological storms.  Understanding simultaneous coupling from above and below makes the ionosphere a so-called Complex System, an area of forefront research world-wide.  Our studies of wave events in the Mesosphere, disturbances in the Ionosphere, on multiple continents, and it diverse regions of magnetospheric coupling, comprise a unique capability for upper atmospheric research.     The science products of this grant include an improved understanding of ionospheric irregularities at low latitudes that are not caused by solar activity.  This allows us to better understand the influences of both upward and downward coupling.  At middle latitudes, waves called Medium Scale Travelling Ionospheric Disturbances (MSTIDs) occur with origins somewhere at high latitudes and propagation paths to lower latitudes governed by electric fields.  Further poleward are phenomena called Sub-Auroral-Red (SAR) arcs that mark the boundary between the visible auroral and the mid-latitude domain.  We have documented case-study events of all of these process in both hemispheres.  Moreover, we have modelled, for the first time, conjugate point SAR arcs, with results showing hemispheric asymmetries in downward coupling from the Magnetosphere to the Ionosphere.     Each of these studies resulted in publications in refereed scientific journals and/or presentations at professional meetings.     In all of these studies, there are training opportunities for students&mdash;both undergraduate and graduate.  We are particularly proud of three seniors who graduate in 2021 from our Imaging Science Lab (Sarah Luettgen; Sophie Phillips, and Jessie Norrell)&mdash;with all three women moving on the graduate school or professional research positions.     Finally, even during the restrictions imposed by the CV-19 pandemic, we were able to maintain our team as a cohesive research group with frequent ZOOM meetings in small and larger groups.     We express our appreciation to the National Science Foundation of enabling these studies of fore-front research with significant student training opportunities, and the public outreach they provided for so-called "Citizen-science" programs in optical studies of the upper atmosphere.
