<AbstractNarration>Video has become a key tool for scientific communication because it increases the outreach and impact of projects, furthers scientific research within and across fields of study, and offers an accessible medium to engage the public in the understanding of science. This project supports the expansion of an interactive, online STEM Videohall where hundreds of NSF-funded researchers share their work through brief video narratives and interactive discussion. While the Videohall is accessible year-round, periodic annual Showcase events are used to drive visitors to the site where they can engage with one another, the project investigators and trained facilitators. The Videohall is a multiplier of NSF's investments in individual projects because it allows STEM education researchers to become aware of, and learn from, related work that is funded across NSF programs and directorates, and other federal agencies. In 3-minute video narratives, investigators share ideas, resources, data, evidence of impact, strategies and challenges. The Videohall platform supports open access and is designed to foster communication in ways that scale beyond traditional formats such as academic conferences. Moreover, because the online STEM Videohall is open to the public, it allows STEM investigators to share their work with multiple stakeholder communities including K-12 educators and school leaders, informal educators and community organizations, the STEM industry, education policy makers and families. Finally, because each video narrative is accompanied by a facilitated online discussion thread, investigators have a unique and valuable mechanism for receiving feedback from these various stakeholder communities. The STEM Videohall project is funded by the Discovery Research K-12 program (DRK-12), which seeks to significantly enhance the learning and teaching of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) by preK-12 students and teachers, through research and development of innovative resources, models and tools. Projects in the DRK-12 program build on fundamental research in STEM education and prior research and development efforts that provide theoretical and empirical justification for proposed projects. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project brings together seven NSF-funded resource centers who work with their respective communities to encourage Principal Investigators to share video narratives of their work through annual NSF STEM Showcase events. Each annual Showcase event presents videos created by 150-230 projects; many of the projects are affiliated with one of the seven resource centers, but others are from projects across NSF directorates and beyond. During a one-week period, Principal Investigators, their project staff, as well as the public at large, are invited to engage in interactive discourse, providing queries, comments, and feedback. Participants also vote for favorite presentations through "Presenters' Choice," "Public Choice," and "Facilitators' Choice," processes. This participant voting system serves to increase engagement and enhances outreach of the event through social media. After the one-week Showcase event concludes, all of the videos along with the related discourse remain available to the public online, who continue to access the Showcase throughout the year. Based on prior pilot work, it is estimated that over the course of a year, over 30,000 visitors, from over 150 countries, will engage with each annual Showcase. Videos from annual showcase events will be shared, reused, and repurposed to create new products with new constituencies. The project includes technical development efforts to iteratively improve its interactive platform, outreach efforts before each annual Showcase event, facilitation of the week-long event, and intensive dissemination efforts.  A research component examines the extent of participation on various constituencies, the benefit of participation to projects, and the success of the events in terms of dissemination nationally and internationally.</AbstractNarration>

The work was led by TERC, a non-profit organization in Cambridge MA, in collaboration with seven NSF-funded resource centers. It hosted three annual STEM for All Video Showcase events (05/17, 05/18, and 05/19) in which 627 STEM educational research projects presented their work by sharing short videos, and by discussing their work online with other researchers, educators, policy makers and the public.</p> <p>Videos presented spanned multiple disciplines including Engineering, Computer Science, Science, Mathematics and the use of emerging technologies, and addressed ways to broaden participation and increase access for under-represented groups. Videos depicted the problem being addressed, the innovative approach, the research, challenges encountered, and the impact of the work. Each three-minute video was accompanied by a discussion, open to the public. These facilitated discussions were robust, with queries and replies related to both theory and practice, project management, recruitment strategies, how to scale up initiatives, and methods to measure impact.</p> <p>Over the three years, more than 2,000 researchers from over 800 universities and organizations participated as presenters and co-presenters. The Video Showcase allowed these researchers and institutions to share their work in progress with each other and with a broad national and international audience.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>The <a href="https://stemforall2017.videohall.com/">2017</a>, <a href="https://stemforall2018.videohall.com/">2018</a>, and <a href="https://stemforall2019.videohall.com/">2019</a>&nbsp;Video Showcases have been visited by over 275,000 people from over 195 countries and territories.</p> <p>Presenters and co-presenters reported the following benefits of participation in post-showcase surveys.

While conferences, meetings, and peer-reviewed journals play essential roles in disseminating research, the STEM for All Video Showcase is an innovative platform that enabled tens of thousands of people across the globe, to engage with leading researchers in the field.
