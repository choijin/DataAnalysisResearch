<AbstractNarration>An award is made to Molloy College to acquire a multimode platform detection system with Western blot and imaging cytometry capabilities.  The instrument will be a vital part of several research projects representing a broad cross section of interests including molecular genetics, immunology, molecular biology, cell cycle biology, cellular physiology, developmental biology and environmental science. Biology and environmental studies students participate in these research projects as part of their education and training at Molloy. The students present their findings at regional and national conferences and publish in peer-reviewed journals. High school students are incorporated into the research groups through a high school internship program allowing for undergraduates to gain valuable mentoring experience. The high school students enter local, regional and national science competitions in line with Molloy's mission-directed goal of assisting high school districts in promoting a keen interest in science among their student body. In addition to research activities, the equipment will be incorporated into several courses in the Biology, Chemistry and Environmental Studies Department which will expose a majority of the biology and environmental studies majors as well as the biology education majors of the College to the many experimental techniques supported by absorbance, fluorescence, and luminescence detection. The use of this equipment in these research and training activities directly addresses the National Science Foundation's goal of increasing the use of modern state-of-the-art research equipment by scientists and undergraduate students.  Additionally, the STEM initiatives currently in place at Molloy will be strengthened and area students will be provided with advanced training in science that will ultimately make them more competitive for summer positions, research internships, civic engagement opportunities and careers in the biological sciences. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The multimode detection system will be used to augment ongoing and planned research projects that further understanding of the 1) mammalian immune system and clarify the role of the stem cell in this system 2) role of highly evolutionarily conserved hormonal systems in the regulation of bone and cartilage development and growth 3) biological role of BLM protein in maintenance of genomic stability in multicellular organisms 4) cell-death pathways initiated after DNA damage and 5) inflammation mechanisms activated by the milk protein, Beta-casomorphin 7. The enhancement of these research efforts at Molloy will in turn raise the research profile of the students, faculty and College.</AbstractNarration>
