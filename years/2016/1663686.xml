<AbstractNarration>The Magnetics Information Consortium (MagIC; http://earthref.org/MAGIC/) has been developed&lt;br/&gt;under collaborative NSF proposals. It forms an open community digital data archive for rock and&lt;br/&gt;paleomagnetic data with web portals, allowing users free access to upload, search, visualize, and&lt;br/&gt;download these data to improve research capabilities in the Earth Sciences.  This award provides support for  an open MagIC workshop, Earth?s Magnetic Field from the Beginning, at Scripps Institution of Oceanography on January 24-26, 2017. The PIs have two important goals: (1) to educate the paleomagnetic community about major modifications to the MagIC database including streamlined approaches to uploading their data and discovering those contributed by others; and (2) to engage a broader group of researchers in one of the major scientific challenges outlined in their motivations for developing the MagIC database. The topic they have chosen is the&lt;br/&gt;geomagnetic evolution of Earth from 4.6 Ga to the present.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
