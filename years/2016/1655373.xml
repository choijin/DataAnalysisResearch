<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is a high efficiency, affordable and aesthetically pleasing solar product. Not only would this product make solar energy more affordable, it might also accelerate the migration to renewable energy. The proposed solar product could be integrated into residential roofing or perhaps another building integrated solution. The ultimate aim is to provide a solar solution that has the utility of ordinary solar panels but is lower cost and has improved aesthetic.  Potential applications for lower cost, lighter, solar panels will be explored.  Also, solar shingles and other building integrated solutions will be investigated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-corps project aims at realizing high efficiency and affordable solar by fabricating hybrid solar devices using a simple and low cost surface treatment for the silicon light absorber with a low cost polymer coating to complete the cell. Initial modeling suggests that high power efficiencies are attainable with this device structure.  A fundamental innovation is the development of a unique carrier selective contact that can be fabricated at low temperatures with simple, earth-abundant technology. In addition to its advantage of simple processing and high efficiency, other advantages include the use of lower cost silicon substrates, and low-cost local manufacture without toxic by-products.  Because of the simplicity of the fabrication, including module fabrication, this technology can be rapidly scaled. Because modules made using this technology will also be substantially lighter in weight than conventional modules, they may also provide another market opportunity by substantially reducing the installation costs.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Our team (R. L. Opila, J. Hack, J. Iyer, K. Modzelewski) worked with NSF I-Corp team to determine if there was a market niche for our particular solar cell design.  After more than 100 interviews and innumerable business model canvasses that explored key activities, key partners, key resources, cost structure, customer relationships, customer segments, values propositions, channels and revenue streams, we concluded that our invention should not go ahead at that time.  However, it was clear what we needed to get in place technically, and what time line we had to meet.  Thus, we continue to develop our low-cost, high-efficiency, silicon-organic hybrid solar cell.  The I-Corp grant has definitely given us focus.  With the course mentors and the other participants, we were continually asked to examine our plans to see if there was a real niche for this invention in the marketplace.  Moreover, we were asked to examine how we would deliver it; for example, whether we would license the technology, or, perhaps, build our own fabrication facility.  We discovered that the solar cell industry is very conservative, and will only introduce new technologies at product nodes (analogous to product nodes in the semiconductor business).  The product node where our design could be best implemented would be approximately 4 - 5 years in the future.  At that point, we would have to demonstrate power efficiencies of better than 25%, and a long term reliability of better than 20 years.  We now have a plan for a path forward in the development of our technology.       Last Modified: 05/03/2017       Submitted by: Robert L Opila]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
