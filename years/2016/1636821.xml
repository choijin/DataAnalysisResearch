<AbstractNarration>1636821  &lt;br/&gt;Lynd, Lee R.     &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal seeks support for the Clostridium XIV Conference that will be hosted by the Thayer School of Engineering at Dartmouth College in Hanover, New Hampshire from August 29-31, 2016.  Clostridia represent an important class of bacteria that are used for the conversion of either plant-derived carbohydrates or gases into biofuels, such as ethanol or butanol and other useful chemicals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The scope of this international conference is to bring together the world's leading scientists, young investigators, industrial researchers and practitioners, and graduate students working on fundamentals and applications of solvent- and acid-forming Clostridia to assess the latest contributions and future opportunities in this field.  Discussion topics will include physiology and genetics of Clostridia, synthetic biology, metabolic engineering, feedstock utilization and ecology as well as bioprocessing and industrial applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Due to the interdisciplinary nature of the Conference, the award by the Biotechnology and Biochemical Engineering Program of the CBET Division is co-funded by the Systems and Synthetic Biology Program of the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ A 3-day meeting was held on the campus of Dartmouth College on August 28 to 31.  As noted in the meeting program (http://clostridiumxiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Clostridium_XIV_program.pdf). posted at he meeting featured 119 registered attendees, 33 oral presentations, 5 of which were given by younger presenters, 40 posters, and 2 keynote presentations, with strong participation by female and international scientists.    The genus Clostridium is a large, heterologous assemblage of microorganisms, unified by their ability to form spores and characterized by their extreme biocatalytic diversity.  Concerns and opportunities related to climate change and the supply and security of fossil resources have led to a resurgence of interest in using clostridia to produce a variety of fuels and chemicals. Of particular interest are fermentative processes based on the conversion of either plant-derived carbohydrate or gases (SynGas) into biofuels, such as ethanol or butanol. Moreover, with the advent of synthetic biology clostridia represent an important chassis for the production of all manner of useful chemicals.     The Clostridium meetings were initiated in 1990 (Salisbury, UK), and have since continued to be held every two years, usually alternating between the USA and Europe.  This series of meetings provides the only international forum at which the world?s leading clostridial experts assemble to present and discuss their findings and latest developments in the field. The success of these meetings has been due to both the quality of the science presented and the informal and welcoming atmosphere.       Disciplines engaged include microbiology, molecular biology, and chemical and biochemical engineering, including representatives from both industry and academia.  By design and as in fact readily observed, informal interactions provided opportunities discussions aimed at private sector initiatives, and for younger scientists to interact with each other as well as more senior scientists.  In short, the meeting supported the continued function and development of a research community.             Last Modified: 03/01/2017       Submitted by: Lee R Lynd]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
