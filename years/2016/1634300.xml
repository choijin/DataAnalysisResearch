<AbstractNarration>Radio frequency spectrum is finite and yet inefficiently used -- resulting from prior policy regimes that dispensed spectrum via methods initially such as administrative allocation and later via market mechanisms such as auctions. Accordingly, a key imperative today is to enable Spectrum Sharing whereby new services are allowed to operate in bands hitherto allocated to licensed incumbents (primary users) under new sharing rules, driven by a Presidential mandate directing 500 MHz currently held by various Federal networks to be re-purposed by 2020 for civilian use. A key enabler of any engineering solution for the above is deployment of (low cost) hardware in conjunction with appropriate networking and storage resources and a software infrastructure that allows for persistent monitoring of spectrum usage.  This pilot project will produce the first calibrated large-scale data sets (over frequency, time and region) of spectrum usage archived for post-processing. Such a database will be a unique national resource for any future spectrum engineering efforts; its impact will extend well beyond the academic community. The data-driven research that it enables will provide valuable inputs for spectrum policymakers charged with formulation of new spectrum sharing rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project significantly extends the state-of-the art in spectrum monitoring: first and foremost, it will result in the first wide-area, persistent and taskable spectrum monitoring and data collection infrastructure without using expensive high-end sensors, but still capable of gathering unprecedented amount of good quality spectrum data that will be stored and made publicly available for further investigations by research community. Further, the design will constitute the first step towards future networked monitoring infrastructure that can allow for distributed experimentation by researchers who will have the ability to task desired sensor sub-sets simultaneously for data acquisition in desired spectrum bands. This will enable data mining of spectrum usage patterns as a function of both space and time, which is currently not possible.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[Introduction The goals of this project are to develop and deploy a flexible metro-scale networked spectrum occupancy sensor infrastructure that integrates the desired control and security functions for reliable operations, while providing a hitherto unavailable rich I-Q data set for subsequent spectrum related analytics.  Our approach overcomes the main distributed spectrum measurement problem of high installation costs by using a collaborative approach (similar to WeatherBug, http://business.weatherbug.com/products/weather-stations/) where the local user installs and shares in the use of the spectrum data with the network operator (who controls the sensor and aggregates the data). This is a collaborative effort between  a) Daintree Corporation (Shyam Kannam, coPI: lead CityScape software developer and architect? responsible for all code development and prelim. testing), b) U. Washington (S. Roy PI: responsible for overall project management, system architecture definition and full system testing, assisted by graduate students K. Shin and A. Ashok) and c) Shared Spectrum Company (SSC) (M. McHenry coPI: responsible for RF sensor integration and testing and deployment at host locations).  The initial Station Hosts are UPENN, TEMPLE and RUTGERS CAMDEN.    Major Activities:  SSC assisted Daintree and U. of Washington to develop the software requirements. SSC built five spectrum sensors.  SSC tested the sensors for software stability, RF calibration, and the ability to remotely reset and reboot the sensors. SSC worked with UPENN, TEMPLE and RUTGERS CAMDEN to obtain permission from their administration staff to deploy the sensors. SSC deployed two of the sensors. The remaining sensor deployments are waiting on the university administration approval.   Specific Objectives: a)       Successful deployment of multiple (we have commitments for 5 and hope to add a 6th) sensors at various locations surrounding Center City, Philadelphia b)       Demonstrate stable and robust operation over a period of time (months) with data archived in the Microsoft Azure Cloud available to 3rd party users for subsequent processing c)      Demonstrate ability of Station owners to change parameter settings for data acquisition for their local station.   Significant Results: The sensors were completed. The collection software was tested for stability, remote control and RF calibration.  The system is complete and ready to install.    Key outcomes or other achievements: Besides two test stations (UW01 and MICROSOFT01 in Seattle, WA), the 1st Philadelphia, PA station UPENN01 has now been stably operational since Apr. 2017.
