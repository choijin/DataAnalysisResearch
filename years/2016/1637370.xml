<AbstractNarration>#1637370&lt;br/&gt;Ma, Yanbao&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With continuous decrease in the size of micro-/nano-/optoelectronic devices and structures, the manipulation and control of heat transport is becoming a bottleneck for the development of many nanotechnologies.  While thermal conductivity in macroscale heat transfer is a material property and independent of the sample size and heating method, the measured thermal conductivity in micro-/nanosystem may depend on the sample size and the frequency in unsteady heating. The size-dependent or frequency-dependent thermal conductivity indicates the breakdown of Fourier's law to describe nondiffusive heat transfer in micro-/nanosystems. The unified nondiffusive-diffusive model to be developed in this project will provide powerful theoretical and numerical design tools for thermal management in micro/nanosystems that is crucial for breaking the developmental bottleneck of nanotechnologies. The integrated research and education plan will encourage more women and students from traditionally underrepresented communities to enter STEM careers and participate in the proposed research activities at UC Merced.&lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;Phonons are the dominant heat carriers in insulators and semiconductors. The breakdown of Fourier?s law is due to the fact that there is significant ballistic heat conduction when the characteristic length scale becomes comparable to or even much smaller than the mean-free-path (MFP) of phonons. Currently, there are two major technical barriers in understanding nondiffusive heat transfer: (a) a lack of practical mesoscale nondiffusive heat transfer models that can be applied to experimental data analysis; and (b) a lack of ad hoc parameters to characterize the unique features of nondiffusive heat transfer. Consequently, most current studies of nondiffusive heat transfer focus on the predictions and measurements of effective thermal conductivity (ETC) within the framework of Fourier's law, but these provide little insight on the unique features of nondiffusive heat transfer. Although molecular scale models can describe heat conduction over a few nanometers, and Fourier's law delineates macroscale heat transfer over tens of microns or larger, a gap exists in heat conduction models between the molecular scale and the macroscale. The phonon Boltzmann transport equation (BTE) was supposed to fill this gap, but it is prohibitively expensive to solve with so many unknown parameters. Therefore, practical and computationally inexpensive mesoscale nondiffusive heat transfer models are indispensable to bridge this gap to describe heat transfer by phonons over length scales ranging from tens of nanometers to tens of microns.  The research objective for this project is to develop and validate a mesoscale nondifussive heat transfer (including ballistic and ballistic-diffusive) model to elucidate unique features that cannot be characterized by thermal conductivity. The success of this project will not only bridge the gap in heat conduction theories between macroscale and molecular scale models by developing high-fidelity unified nondiffusive-diffusive models for multiscale heat transfer, but also open up new venues to study unique features of nondiffusive heat transfer outside the framework of Fourier's law.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[A.   What was accomplished under these goals? A.1       Major Activities  Developed a wave-diffusive model for heat pulse propagation at cryogenic temperature    In this review period, we developed a wave-diffusive model to describe heat pulse propagation at cryogenic temperature.  The nondiffusive thermal transport phenomena in micro/nanoscale have been extensively studied in last three decades which is attributed to ballistic heat transfer by many researchers. However, ballistic heat transfer has not been directly observed in experiments at room temperature.  Up to now, experimental results on nanoscale heat conduction have only presented evidence for breakdown of Fourier’s law rather than characterizing ballistic heat conduction [8&ndash;13]. The direct evidence of ballistic heat transport has only been observed in heat-pulse experiments conducted in dielectric crystals at low temperatures, which provide important benchmark cases for the validation of ballistic heat transfer models. A thorough understanding of these benchmark cases will not only advance our knowledge in ballistic heat transfer, but also shine light on the development of appropriate thermal analysis models for nanoelectronics and modern optoelectronics.     We developed a simple wave-diffusive model to provide new perspectives for nondiffusive heat transfer phenomena. In this model, thermal energy is divided into two categories: the ballistic part and diffusive part.   The ballistic part  propagates like a damping wave while the decay of energy is converted to diffusive part.        We used this model to explain the thermal wave experiments at cryogenic temperatures. The thermal wave signals in all three transport regimes, ballistic regime, transitional regime and diffusive regime, have been successfully reproduced. Two key parameters in the wave-diffusive model, the resistive (R-) process relaxation time &tau;R and normal (N-) process relaxation time &tau;N, offer meaningful insights for the explanation of the transition mechanisms between different transport regimes. The R-process relaxation time &tau;R dominates the thermal transport in ballistic and diffusive regime, while the N-process time &tau;N enables a successful reconstruction of the phenomena in the transitional regime.    A.2     Specific Objectives  To develop a wave-diffusive model to explain nondiffusive heat transfer phenomena in heat pulse experiments at cryogenic temperatures     A.3     Significant Results  We developed a simple wave-diffusive model to provide new perspectives for nondiffusive heat transfer phenomena. In this model, thermal energy is divided into two categories: the ballistic part and diffusive part.   The ballistic part propagates like a damping wave while the decay of energy is converted to diffusive part.   This model is applied to interpret heat-pulse experiments in NaF at cryogenic temperatures reported in literature.  It is found that ballistic thermal wave propagation is dominant at T = 9.6 K, where resistive relaxation time is extracted to be 2.0 &mu;s.  When temperature is increased to 25.5K, the resistive relaxation time is reduced to 0.032 &mu;s.  Consequently, ballistic thermal energy decays in short time and convers to diffusive thermal energy.  This can explain why only diffusive thermal wave form is observed in experiment at this temperature.  Between 9.6 and 25.5 K, there are both ballistic and diffusive heat transfer.        The simple wave-diffusive model has been successfully applied to interpret ballistic-diffusive heat-pulse experiment in NaF at cryogenic temperatures.    A.4     Key Outcomes or Other Achievements     What opportunities for training and professional development has the project provided?  A graduate student is trained in this project.  The numerical simulations and data analysis were conducted by the graduate student who is partially supported by this project.  How have the results been disseminated to communities of interest?  A journal paper is under preparation for publication.      What do you plan to do during the next reporting period to accomplish the goals?  This project ended at the of July 2019. B.   Impacts  Currently, ballistic heat transfer has only been observed at cryogenic temperatures which can serve as benchmarks for modeling of ballistic heat transfer.  These benchmarks have not been well explained before this study.  A thorough understanding of these benchmark cases will not only advance our knowledge in ballistic heat transfer, but also shine light on the development of appropriate thermal analysis models for nanoelectronics and modern optoelectronics.     What is the impact on other disciplines?   The new nondiffusive heat transfer model validated in this project will provide a theoretical and numerical tool for thermoelectric material design and thermal management of nanoelectronics.
