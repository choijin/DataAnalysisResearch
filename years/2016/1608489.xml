<AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit:&lt;br/&gt;The 2016 GRC in Biointerface Science will explore Active, Adaptive, and Responsive Biointerfaces across natural and engineered biomaterial systems. We reason that broad classes of complex, cooperative, and adaptive behaviors in natural and biomimetic systems emerge through the central roles of interfaces - both intrinsic and imposed. Biointerfaces on the one hand compartmentalize disparate biological components within a functional living module (e.g., a cell) and on the other hand facilitate integration. The appreciation of how interfaces determine biological functions and how interfaces must be considered in devising biomaterial alternatives to their living counterparts requires an interdisciplinary discourse, ranging over biomacromolecules and single cells to tissues and organs. The 2016 GRC seeks to seed this discourse, help generate a common language across disciplines, and foster interdisciplinary collaborations. The constituency of the Biointerface Science GRC attendees is already multidisciplinary. The 2016 GRC and the associated GRS will engage bioengineers, chemists, physicists, materials scientists, and biologists - all participating in a meeting that addresses the challenges in translating ground breaking fundamental advances in biology and chemistry into products in biomaterials, biosensors, and the -omic sciences. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:&lt;br/&gt;The Biointerface Science GRC and GRS play important roles in enhancing the development of researchers in early stages of their careers. The GRC format is designed to foster an environment of in-depth scientific discussion and relationship building among participants. The associated Gordon Research Seminar (GRS) will draw in young scientists and researchers, and get them involved with one of the most lively frontiers of science. Graduate students, post-docs, and other scientists with comparable levels of experience and education will come together in a highly-stimulating and non-intimidating environment to discuss their current research and build informal networks with their peers that may lead to a lifetime of collaboration and scientific achievement. The GRS is organized by young investigators with the support of leading scientists from the associated GRC. The majority of the GRS participants will participate in the GRC, which follows immediately at the same site. The PI has made a concerted effort to achieve an appropriate representation of women, racial/ethnic minorities and persons with disabilities, and other individuals who in the past have been underrepresented in science and engineering.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Operational Summary  The Gordon Research Conference (GRC) and Gordon Research Seminar (GRS) on Bionterface Science were held at the Les Diablerets Conference Center in Les Diablerets, Switzerland from June 11-17, 2016.   The meeting covered a variety of scientific topics and the content presented was highly rated by participants.    Conference Participants  The Conference was well-attended with 129 participants. Scientists from academia represented 96% of the participants while attendees from government accounted for 3% and those from industry totaled 1%. The meeting also attracted a strong mix of young investigators and senior scientists.  Students and post-docs accounted for 43% of all attendees. Approximately 30% of the participants at the 2016 meeting were women.    Seminar Participants  The Seminar was well-attended with 49 participants. Scientists from academia represented 97% of the participants while attendees from industry accounted for 3%. Students and post docs combined accounted for 84% of all attendees. Approximately 33% of the participants at the 2016 seminar were women.    Conference Program  The 2016 GRC on Biointerface Science brought together scientists and engineers, including students, post-docs, young investigators, and thought-leaders in the rapidly consolidating field of natural and engineered biological interfaces. Biointerfaces &ndash; encompassing natural interfaces between clusters and assemblies of biomolecules and water, between cells and extra-cellular matrix, between populations of cells and their surroundings, and those between the biotic and the abiotic in engineered settings &ndash; are pervasive across a host of fields spanning materials science to medicine, sensing to synthetic biology, plants to pathogenesis, and oncology to the origins of life. Appearing across a range of length- and time-scales as emergent mesoscale features, biointerfaces offer a convergent theme across disciplinary boundaries affording an opportunity to dissect fundamental physical-chemical mechanisms at interfaces, unravel functional significance of interfaces, identify practical challenges, and explore new scientific and technological opportunities.     The 2016 Gordon Research Conference on Biointerface Science sought to explore this convergence by offering a broad scientific program, spearheaded by distinguished speakers and discussion leaders, to open a cross-disciplinary conversation. Sessions included (1) a keynote session on active, dynamic, and adaptive biological interfaces; (2) smart and responsive biointerfaces, including biosensors; (3) physics and chemistry interfaces; (4) advances in characterization of interfaces; (5) localization of functions at cellular interfaces, including signaling; (6) roles of interfaces in cellular colonies, including those of ECM and EPS; and (7) importance of interfaces in the origins of life and design of synthetic protocells.

The associated Gordon Research Seminar (GRS) on Biointerface Science &ndash; in contiguity with the GRC &ndash; provided a venue with sufficient intimacy for junior investigators and young scientists to readily establish informal networks for long-term collaborations and a life-time of scientific citizenship.

Biological interfaces exist in many varieties: interfacial and membrane associated proteins, natural and artificial membrane structures, bioelectronics, biofilms, nanomedicine, biomedical device development, cell-culturing scaffolds, etc. It is through interdisciplinary collaboration and discussion that we can find the answers to our own personal research barriers.  Related Meeting     Conference Feedback  Participants had an opportunity to provide feedback at the end of the Conference. The feedback collected from the meeting was extremely positive. Evaluations included numerous positive remarks regarding the intellectually stimulating talks, selection of topics and the poster sessions.  Evaluations from the GRS included positive comments regarding the poster presentations, career panel and connecting with people from a wide variety of disciplines.   GRC would like to thank the National Science Foundation for its continued support of the meetings.  The contributions received from the National Science Foundation have been critical to the success of the conferences and are having a measurable impact in advancing the frontiers of science worldwide.
