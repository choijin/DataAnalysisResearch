<AbstractNarration>Micro-organisms are found in virtually all environments. When there is an imbalance within a community, this can lead to severe effects, such as disease in the human gut or the inability for plants to grow efficiently in soil. An understanding of the composition and interplay within the communities allows us to potentially manipulate them. Metagenomics is the study of these different micro-organism communities, which is achieved by isolating the DNA from the organisms within an environmental sample (e.g. water, soil, animal stool), sequencing the DNA, followed by the computational analysis to decode which organisms are present and the functions they might be performing. This computation is complicated: 1) there is a huge amount of data; 2) The sequence data is a jumbled mix of fragments from different organisms; 3) Decoding the DNA is hard - typically &gt;90% of organisms within a sample are not well characterized. This proposal brings together three major resources within the field of metagenomics data archiving and analysis. The most immediate beneficiaries of the outputs from this proposal and associated resources will be the scientists worldwide who are involved in metagenomics research. This diverse, extensive and expanding community includes (but is not limited to) microbiologists interested in understanding microbial community structure and interactions, biochemists aiming to discover new proteins with functional applications, and clinicians seeking to investigate and modulate the microbial communities associated with healthy or diseased states. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) is a repository of DNA sequence data. Importantly, ENA also captures metagenomic contextual data, such as where and when the sample was taken, how the DNA was extracted and sequenced. The EBI metagenomics portal (EMG,UK) and MG-RAST (MGR,US) are 2 metagenomics sequence analysis platforms. The aim of this project is to initiate a long-term collaboration between the EMG and MGR platforms to build and operate a comprehensive data exchange system, the Metagenomics Exchange (ME). This resource will ensure that metagenomic sequence reads, derived data and associated metadata are permanently preserved and made available for the broadest future use. Crucially, it will ensure that these scientists can discover and mine pre-processed datasets and compare their analysis across varying platforms. There will no longer be the time consuming need for exhaustive searching of ENA, MG-RAST (MGR) and EBI metagenomics (EMG) to discover data, nor will there be the need to submit to both MGR and EMG-the cross submission will simply happen automatically. Furthermore, as a result of the work to make MG-RAST and EMG?s pipelines interoperable, scientists will have access to enhanced analyses that utilize a common set of parameters and allow mixing and matching of pipeline components to suit the data that is being processed, improving and enriching their analysis results. This will also reduce differences that are caused by non-biological artifacts, enabling greater clarity of results. Through the unification of result interfaces, standard users and power users will benefit, with MGR and EMG results accessible via each other's websites, helping the former set of user, and the ability to mine across multiple datasets offered for the latter user set.</AbstractNarration>

To do this, we propose a 3 year project with 6 major objectives:</p> <p>1) Implement the infrastructure for the ME using a 'hub and nodes' configuration. The European Nucleotide Archive (ENA, already part of the EMG project) will provide the 'hub' through which exchanged data can be discovered by MGR and EMG (the 'nodes'). The ME-registry will enable the formation of a service orientated architecture model between the hub and nodes, where data can be discovered and then fetched from the relevant source. We will engage with metagenomics resource providers and researchers to ensure that they are aware of the ME and will be offered training to utilise the new resource, ensuring that the work has the broadest possible impact.<br /> 2) Develop automated strategies to determine existing identical datasets in the different resources. Surprisingly, identification of such data sets is a non-trivial task, but is vital to enable reliable sharing of existing results and so that we can reduce the number of data sets present in MGR but not in ENA. We will evaluate different approaches to this problem, including sequence checksums and metadata (such as PI names, locations and dates), and use the results to populate existing datasets and results into the ME-registry.<br /> 3) Standardise the common pipeline features and enable crosstalk between the EMG and MGR pipelines. The expectation is that this will not lead to the establishment of one singular pipeline, but it will provide both groups with the capability to import pipeline intermediate from the other centre. This will lead to reduced computational overheads (and hence increased analysis capacity) and help the comparison of EMG and MGR taxonomic and functional assignments.<br /> 4) Harmonise pipeline outputs from EMG and MGR that are currently available from each website, allowing rational mixing and matching of derived results. Again, the aim is not to develop a single unified website, but to increase consistency across the sites, leading to a more standardised user experience and enabling both MGR and EMG results to be accessible, regardless of the website being visited.<br /> 5) Enable technology transfer between EMG and MGR. To this end, we will hold several workshops for the teams to explore the pipelines and pipeline technologies used and "import" technology as suitable into the two production systems. We will also devise benchmarks and perform analysis studies, examining combinations of middleware and workflows on large-scale data processing. We will apply the results to the analysis pipelines, and summarise them in a technical report/publication.<br /> 6) Research the optimal pipeline to use for a given data set. Currently, both analysis pipelines offer unique advantages for specific data sets.
