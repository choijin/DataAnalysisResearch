<AbstractNarration>This PFI: AIR Technology Translation project focuses on translating a new low power, high bandwidth, holographic optical switch that will enable new architectures, improve data flow and increase energy efficiency in data centers.  This new holographic switch is important because today's data centers consume 5% of the United States' electrical production and their power requirements are increasing exponentially as major companies such as Google, Facebook, and Amazon construct multi-acre data centers to satisfy consumer demand. The worldwide Internet traffic is forecasted to continue its rapid growth; doubling every 18 months due to new applications such as the Internet of Things.  Unless a disruptive technology can be implemented, data centers' energy consumption will continue to grow at an exponential rate. The proposed holographic optical switch will enable new data center architectures that can dramatically reduce energy consumption while improving performance.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will result in a prototype holographic optical switch and characterization of its performance in data center applications. This holographic switch has the following unique features: very low electrical power consumption, support for data rates to at least 1 Terrabit / second, and a flexible design that can provide a large number of input and output ports.  These features provide advantages in term of energy efficiency, scalability, throughput, and data center architecture flexibility when compared to the existing electrical top-of-the-rack switches in the market space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project addresses the following technology gaps as it translates from research discovery toward commercial applications.  Commercial hybrid switching technology suffers from limited port count (~300 ports), long configuration time (10s of milliseconds) and high cost ($300/port). The proposal implements a switch based on integrating a novel holographic technique with a piston MOEMS (micro opto electro mechanical system) system.  Our proposed system will overcome the limitations of the incumbent technology with the holographic switch which will provide high port count (10,000 ports), microsecond switching times (two orders of magnitude improvement), dramatically reduced cost per port (&lt;$10/port), enabling a 6Ã— reduction in data center power consumption. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The graduate students involved in this project will receive entrepreneurship training through seminars and lectures based upon the "Lean Startup" methodology described in "The Startup Owner's Manual" by Steven Blank.  The students will also have direct interactions with industry through the CIAN ERC's Industrial Advisory Board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project combines the holographic switching technology developed at U. Arizona with the Si-based piston MOEMS technology developed at UC Berkeley. TIPD, LLC will guide the commercialization aspects of this technology translation effort from research discovery toward commercial reality.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[Data centers are responsible for more than 2% of the electrical consumption in the United State. This power consumption is increasing at the same rate as the IP traffic which is exponential. The industry sector is very well aware of this unsustainable trend, and new innovations are constantly funneled from the laboratory into the real world to curb this progression. Among the most power hungry equipment of data centers are the electronic switches that redirect the signal from server to server. The goal this project was to dramatically improve the efficiency of circuit switching in data centers by developing a holographic optical switch to replace the highly inefficient electronic switches. During the course of this program we developed two generations of holographic chip able to steer optical beams from fiber to fiber. The first generation of chip was based on piton motion of micro-mirror and, although we succeeded to demonstrate a functional prototype, it was discovered that the actuator for the piston mechanism was too bulky to realize an effective design. Learning from this experience, our second chip generation used a unique shifting technique that allows for smaller and faster pixel elements, improving the switch characteristics. The chip has been packaged both mechanically and electrically and has been tested for performance in the optical switch configuration.  The performance of the holographic optical switch based on the shifting pixel chip are matching or exceeding the expectation of the program with a resonance frequency (reconfiguration speed) of 55kHz, a diffraction efficiency above 90%, and a filed of view (diffraction angle) of 6.6??4.4? at 1550nm wavelength (c-band telecommunication). This research program has helped to train 2 Ph.D. students, 1 master students, and 10 undergraduate students in engineering in the field of telecommunication, and photonics. Among these students, priority was given to female and underrepresented minorities. The results of this research program have been disseminated through multiple scientific publications. The IP generated during the program has been secured by the application of two patents. Both patents have been licensed to a start-up company that is now developing the holographic optical switch prototype into a commercial product.
