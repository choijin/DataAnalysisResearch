<AbstractNarration>Well-designed educational games represent a promising technology for increasing students interest in and learning of STEM topics such as physics. This project will research how to optimally combine and embed dynamic assessment and adaptive learning supports within an engaging game design to build effective educational games. The project will add enhancements to a physics game called Physics Playground.  The general goal of this research is to test a valid methodology that can be used in the design of next-generation learning games. The enhancement of Physics Playground will leverage the popularity of video games to capture and sustain student attention and teach physics to a much broader audience than is currently the case in traditional physics classrooms. To be most effective, this new genre of learning games needs to not only be highly engaging as a game but also to provide real-time assessment and feedback to students; support understanding of science content (i.e.,Newtonian physics); be accessible to beginners; accommodate a range of proficiencies and interests; and support equity. The research will have particular relevance to designers developing other science games and simulation by providing information about the kinds of learning supports and feedback to students are most effective in promoting engagement and learning.  The project is supported by the Cyberlearning and Future Learning Technologies Program, which funds efforts that will help envision the next generation of learning technologies and advance what we know about how people learn in technology-rich environments. Cyberlearning Exploration (EXP) Projects explore the viability of new kinds of learning technologies by designing and building new kinds of learning technologies and studying their possibilities for fostering learning and challenges to using them effectively.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will systematically develop, test, and evaluate ways to integrate engaging, dynamic learning supports in Physics Playground to teach formal conceptual physics competencies. More generally, the project aims to advance the learning sciences, particularly in the fields of adaptivity and assessment in educational technology. Using a design-based research approach spanning three years, the research team will: (1) develop and test the effectiveness of various learning support features included in the game in Year 1; (2) develop and test an adaptive algorithm to manage the progression of difficulty in game levels in Year 2; and (3) test learning supports and adaptive sequencing in a controlled evaluation study.  This research will provide evidence of the instructional effectiveness of an educational game designed using principles of instructional, game, and assessment design. It will advance understanding of the contributions of different kinds of learning supports (e.g., visualizations and explanations) and adaptivity to game-based learning and contribute to the design of next-generation learning games that successfully blur the distinction between assessment and learning. The project will generate research findings that can be incorporated into other types of STEM learning games.</AbstractNarration>

The project began with a previously developed 2D digital learning game, <em>Physics Playground</em>. The goal of the game is to move a green ball to hit a red balloon. In prior research, the game supported learning of a small set of conceptual physics topics and provided in-game measures of those topics through <a href="https://myweb.fsu.edu/vshute/pdf/Stealth_Assessment.pdf">stealth assessment</a>. Building on the success of the original game, we revised and expanded the game's original competency model with the help of two physics experts. The final competency model includes nine physics competencies (e.g., Newton's First Law) grouped within four main physics topics (e.g., Force and Motion) (see Figure 1).</p> <p>Expanding the competency model meant expanding the game. In the original game, students drew simple machines (i.e., levers, pendulums, ramps, and springboards) on the screen to move the ball (i.e., <a href="https://youtu.be/qiYtPngpUpA">Sketching Levels</a>). We created an additional type of level where students have to manipulate physics parameters in the level, such as gravity, air resistance, and mass of the ball (i.e., <a href="https://youtu.be/K7trh3Gkuug">Manipulation Levels</a>). To aid in the creation of levels, we developed a web-based level editor that even non-programmers can easily use. The level editor includes various features such as coloring, copying and pasting, and adding blowers to represent additional types of forces. The game and level editor are freely available on our <a href="https://pluto.coe.fsu.edu/ppteam/)">public website</a>.</p> <p>To maximize learning via gameplay, we iteratively designed and developed a set of in-game supports.
