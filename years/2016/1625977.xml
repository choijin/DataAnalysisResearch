<AbstractNarration>With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) and Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities (CRIF) programs Professor Shouzhong Zou from American University and colleagues Colin Saldanha, Matthew Hartings and Douglas Fox have acquired an analytical transmission electron microscope (TEM). A TEM propels a beam of electrons at a thin sample. The electrons interact with the material to produce an image of the substance much as an optical microscope. However, the magnification is typically better than with optical microscopes. The microscope is used in a broad area of fields from materials research, to chemistry and biology to medicine. The microscopic knowledge gleamed from the TEM images can help understand the properties of the material and perhaps improve them. At American University the TEM is used to advance a number of research projects and it also impacts undergraduate research training and it is used in lecture and laboratory courses. It is also used in outreach activities to local institutions such as the University of the District of Columbia and Montgomery College to further enhance research and student training. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposal is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels, especially in areas such as (a) revealing structure-catalytic activity relationships of catalysts for fuel cell reactions, carbon dioxide to organic fuel conversion and gas sensing, (b) understanding formation mechanisms and exploring structure-function properties of polymer-nanocomand organic ligand-stabilized noble metal nanoparticles, (c) developing advanced functional materials for water purification and disease detection, (d) understanding the expression and regulation of synaptic aromatase that synthesizes estrogens, (e) exploring structural modifications of retina associated with ambient light conditions and (f) revealing the reproductive system structure of decapod crustaceans.</AbstractNarration>

In addition, we were able to acquire a JEOL JSM-IT100LA scanning electron microscope (SEM). The renovation of labs housing these microscopes were finished in late 2017 and the scopes were delivered and installed early 2018. The onsite specification testing and staff training finished at the end of March 2018. These microscopes are first ever electron microscopes on American University (AU) campus. They came in the time when AU re-emphasized the importance of science education to its students and started to heavily invest in science programs. As a sign of such commitment, the microscopes will be moved into a newly built Hall of Science with rooms tailored to these scopes. These electron microscopes provide unprecedent nano- and atomic scale characterization capabilities that go beyond the traditional optical microscopes to AU students and faculty.

There are eight manuscripts that are being prepared for publication and contain results from these microscopes. We expect many more to come in the years ahead. The research topics enabled by these microscopes include detection of neurochemicals in brain by carbon fiber microelectrodes modified with polymers or gold nanoparticles, flame retardants from polymer-cellulose or chitosan-polymer composite materials, gold and silver nanoparticles embedded in metal organic framework for catalysis and sensing, xerogels, organic semiconductor crystals, metal nanoparticle modified polymers for lyme antigen test, breast cancer exosomes and probing calcium in osterocyte tissue cultures. The users of these microscopes come from AU and nearby institutions, such as Georgetown University, George Mason University and Catholic University of America. Students in the advanced laboratory courses at AU Chemistry Department have gained hands-on experience of using these microscopes. For the first time, they were able to ?directly? see the nanoparticles they made in the labs for the first time, instead of inferring from other techniques. The microscopes also strengthen STEM education across diverse groups, including women and underrepresented minorities, as about 80% of the users of these microscopes are from these groups.</p> <p>The goals proposed in this MRI project have been met. The microscopes provide imaging and spectroscopic capabilities previously unavailable to AU campus and have attracted diverse users from various research fields and different institutions.
