<AbstractNarration>While community college is a gateway to higher education in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) disciplines for large numbers of U.S. students, for many students this gateway does not lead to success. By combining financial assistance with academic and support services for students who are low-income and academically talented, this project at Skyline College in California is designed to increase the numbers of students who successfully attain an associate degree and/or transfer to a four-year university on the pathway to a career in a STEM field. In addition to scholarships, the project will incorporate evidence-based methodologies intended to address barriers faced by many community college students. This project is expected to have a broad impact on underrepresented groups because the college is a Hispanic serving institution, has a comprehensive plan to recruit underrepresented students, and has a history of success in recruiting and retaining students from underrepresented groups such as Latinos, African Americans, Pacific Islanders, and women. A research study will explore the impact of components of the project on attrition points for students pursuing STEM associate degrees and transfer to four-year universities. A formative and summative evaluation will document program implementation and outcomes and facilitate the potential replication of effective strategies. The project will disseminate lessons learned about the project model, tools used for the research study and program evaluation, their findings, and case studies, to other institutions seeking to improve outcomes for low-income, academically talented students in STEM disciplines; thereby helping advance post-secondary STEM education, and serving the larger goals of building a skilled, diverse workforce and a more globally competitive U.S. economy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Skyline College will award scholarships to students as they progressively deepen their commitment to a STEM pathway and advance toward a degree or transfer within six semesters. Along with the scholarships, students will participate in a set of core program elements, the impact of which will be tested through evaluation: (a) detailed mapping of a STEM pathway in the Student Education Plan (SEP), (b) enrollment in a cohort-based bridge program that supports success in pre-transfer level and gateway STEM courses, (c) intensive STEM pathway retention support, including academic, career, and transfer advising, (d) access to the college STEM/MESA Center, (e) STEM faculty mentoring, (f) Academic Excellence Workshops, and (g) for students enrolled in gateway STEM courses, engagement in an Embedded Peer Instruction Cohort (EPIC). First-year students will enroll in a cohort-based, intensive bridge programs such as MESA, the BioBridge Career Advancement Academy, or the Engineering and Technology Scholars (ETS) Learning Community. These programs incorporate accelerated and/or contextualized math and foundational science instruction, advancing students beyond common attrition points. Additionally, all scholarship students will participate in a comprehensive set of evidence-based, co-curricular services designed to support their persistence, completion, and transfer.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Skyline College Success in STEM (4S) Scholars Program has given outcomes that are far more than the target goals anticipated.  Outcomes that came from the 4S Scholars program were increased transfer rates, an increase in STEM majors on the campus, an increase in underrepresented students majoring in STEM, the development and construction of a STEM Center where there was none, the development of an Engineering department that did not exist, as well the expansion and diversification of the STEM support team.  In, that terms of educational goals, earning an AA/AS and transferring to a four-year college and/or transfer to a four-year college without earning an AA/AS, are the most common self-reported educational goal (goals combined = 91.2% based on institutional data gathered from college application). However, 100% of respondents to the student feedback survey reported goals of degree and/or transfer of some sort.  From the program, 37% of students in the program (across cohort years) have gone on to enroll at a four-year college or university since participating in the program. The majority of the four-year university students enrolled at University of California (UC) or California State University (CSU) campuses. In aggregation, 35 unique NSF S-STEM participants have gone on to either receive an associate?s degree and/or enroll at a four-year college or university (44% of all unique participants; 57% of Fall 2017 participants, 60% of Fall 2018 participants, and 16% of the Fall 2019 cohort).  The share of female participants in the 4S program averaged 35% of the program; females make up 53% of the college-wide population, compared to 45% of mathematics students, 41% of physics students, 60% of biology students, and 19% of engineering students.  Among those continuing their lower-division coursework, 56% have persisted to enrollment status Skyline College in Spring.  A unique count of 22 NSF S-STEM students have tentatively registered or waitlisted in at least one course in the upcoming Summer 2020 and/or Fall 2020 terms at Skyline College to continue their education.  Consistent with the objective of the grant to support low-income students? access and success in STEM fields, th students are considered low-income based on other state and/or federal aid they received to support them in reaching their educational goals. Based on the feedback survey, 56% of 17-18 respondents, 73% of 18-19 respondents, and 67% of 19-20 respondents report working for pay.  In terms of internship obtainment, over the course of the grant period, the annual data shows an increase in the share of students participating in internships in a STEM field by their starting fall of participation.  NSF S-STEM Project PIs cite the institutionalization of the Internship Hub as having played a positive role in improving student awareness and connections to internship opportunities in STEM fields.  When the Skyline College STEM Center launched in November 2019, it was the result of efforts to institutionalize a physical space to facilitate faculty and staff engagement with students and foster greater collaboration and connection across STEM programs (e.g. through tutoring, workshops, advising, community-building, etc.).  The Internship Hub is a formalized, institutionalized structure and process offered beginning in March 2019 through the STEM Center.  Its mission is to support participant career and internship growth.  Details of internship opportunities, requirements, and deadlines to apply are now formally maintained under the Scholarships &amp; Internships section of the Skyline College STEM Center website.  As evident from other services and activities that NSF S-STEM students report participating in, there is significant overlap between MESA and the Engineering and Tech Scholars (ETS) (4S) Program, which many respondents with overlapping program participation cited as helpful to them. One survey respondent notes that services and activities built up their confidence and helped them connect with their peers.  Another respondent from the 2019-20 survey notes:  "I really enjoy the community built (in the new STEM Center).
