<AbstractNarration>This SBIR Phase I project will enable the use of flexible and printed electronic technologies for heat-sensitive materials such as plastics, papers, and organic electronics that cannot employ traditional soldering or conductive adhesives because of temperature, cost, and/or performance limitations. The foundation for the proposed research is a no-heat-added solder paste made from liquid-metal particles that act like filled balloons, releasing a liquid metal when popped and then turning solid. Printed electronics offer potential for major manufacturing growth for the United States, because the device structure lends itself to being manufactured domestically, offering transportation advantages and overall lower costs of ownership. This technology may have applications in commercial flexible displays, wearable biomedical sensors, lightweight electronics for military equipment, and radio frequency identification tags for supply-chain connectivity. The development of the products enabled by this technology is expected to make U.S. citizens, institutions, military, and government agencies more efficient and effective with better inventory/waste tracking, biometrics collection, weight reduction, and object networking. Enabling new U.S. technologies creates market opportunities for the Internet of Things and telemedicine, as well as manufacturing opportunities to make electronics in the U.S., creating significant jobs, businesses, and tax revenue.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project focuses on developing unique undercooled metal microparticles for use in no-heat-added soldering of printed/flexible electronics. The research will decouple the heating from the joining of the metal?significantly lowering the processing temperature and thus preserving function for heat-sensitive electronics and substrates. The key to the innovation?an oxide encapsulating shell?prevents heterogeneous nucleation with a thin oxide shell and undercooling's enhancement on the micro- and nanoscale. It can be mechanically sheared or removed by chemical flux action to enable the liquid metal inside to first flow and coalesce, and to then solidify.  The metal alloys can remain as liquids at room temperature for months. Research will increase the production yield and reliability of bismuth alloys that melt at 139°C to less brittle tin/silver/copper SnAgCu solder that melts at 217°C.  Objectives are to 1) develop a material that can join/coat materials with solid metal without adding heat, 2) demonstrate the properties of the joint compared to conductive adhesives and traditional soldering, and 3) demonstrate a Wheatstone bridge and flexible Micro Electro Mechanical Systems (MEMS) prototype device. Undercooled solders will be applied using flux strategies to make mechanically and electrically robust joints in an electronic device at room temperature.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This feasibility project was conducted from July 2016 through March 2017 to demonstrate that undercooled liquid metal particles can be made in high purity, made of higher melting metal alloys, and most importantly used to solder without the need for heating.  Printed and flexible electronics are the next step to make electronics flexible, lightweight, rugged, energy efficient, wearable, and stretchable. These attributes are also of great importance in enabling new functionality, the internet of things, device integration into clothing, building structures, and packaging, size reduction, and weight reduction all of which have great impact in civilian uses but also can increase the effectiveness of US military personnel in the field. These new product features rely on the materials properties that plastics substrates, organic molecules, and liquid containing components can provide; many of these materials and components are heat sensitive and cannot withstand the heat during soldering of metal alloys or the curing of conductive inks.  The primary goal of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project was to utilize stabilized undercooled metal alloys to decouple the melting of the alloy from its application in soldering to limit heat stress, increase ease of use, and expand the catalog of joinable materials to include heat-sensitive materials such as plastics, liquid electrolytes, and organic components.  The progress of the Phase I project milestones that address the project?s intellectual merits is summarized below:  1.   Metal melting point and yield: The goal of this objective was to demonstrate that the core technology concept could be applied to higher melting metal alloys and that SAFI-Tech could produce laboratory scale quantities of high purity material. Through this project SAFI-Tech could produce undercooled metal alloys that have a melting point above 100 &deg;C and can undercool to below -10 &deg;C, with purities over 99% and with an 83% mass yield.  2.   Methods for mechanical or chemically activating the material: The goal of this object was to develop techniques for releasing the liquid metal. Shearing mechanical stress and chemical fluxing formulations were developed to activate the undercooled particle material on-demand and achieve electrical conductive structures with electrical and mechanical properties comparable to the parent solder metal alloy.  3.   Demonstrated no-heat soldering feasibility: The goal of this objective was to demonstrate that undercooled metal particles can be used to solder traditional components on heat sensitive substrates without damage caused by heat. SAFI-Tech demonstrated the creation of conductive traces on paper and polyethylene, fabrication of flexible LED displays on paper, fabrication of a microelectromechanical systems sensor on paper, and soldering of a Wheatstone bridge printed circuit board without heat.  The core benefit of this technology is the decoupling of the heating of the metal alloys from their applications, and this opens new options for electronics manufacturing at significantly lower temperatures than current soldering or silver paste technology&mdash;leading to a lower-cost, continuous and automated process that makes flexible electronics a viable industry for U.S. manufacturing while producing economic growth and jobs.  The market for flexible electronics is expected to grow from $27B in 2016 to $69B in 2026, with OLED displays and sensors expected to make up the majority of the printed, flexible and organic electronics market. New types of wearable biomedical sensors, flexible OLED displays and lighting, thin-film batteries, and emerging energy technologies such as organic photovoltaics can be made possible via advances in manufacturing such as the lower processing soldering being pursued in this project.
