<AbstractNarration>This project will analyze scientific, legal and political outcomes for fish habitat restoration. It will study how scientists and fisheries managers are adapting to uncertainty. The study will contribute to an understanding of how science relates to environmental management and policy. It will enable both environmental managers and scientists to be more effective in responding to environmental issues. This research will engage with scientists and managers, including Federal, State, and Tribal agencies, in order to consider how best to conceptualize, prepare for, and develop scientific and management models, scenarios, and tools. The project will develop tools for future researchers in the critical area of adaptive science, technology, and policy studies. The research will be of interest to fisheries, environmental scientists, policy makers, local residents and administrators. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project includes three interrelated case studies, focused on salmon habitat restoration in the Columbia River Basin. It will look specifically at the scientific practice of salmon habitat restoration, mandated by the Endangered Species Act. The project will explore how scientists and environmental managers adapt their epistemological and management practices to accommodate environmental uncertainty and to identify how and when the relationships between science, law, and natural resource management shift. The researchers will conduct interviews, archival research, policy analysis, and participant observation in order to answer these questions. This study will extend literature in the field of science, technology, and society (STS) on the history and development of ecological science and management, the intersection of science and law, and adaptive governance and resilience of social-ecological systems.</AbstractNarration>

The research publications and findings describe how:  Knowledge infrastructures and institutions that were developed historically in the basin influence the science that is being conducted today, including the kinds of scientific data that are valued and collected. This, in turn, has shaped the community and the culture of scientists, as well as the range of questions and data  to address environmental issues.  Values influence the ?best available science? in any adaptive management planning. These values should be clarified and communicated by making standards of evidence transparent, acknowledging aims and goals, and dealing with uncertainty by clarifying the parameters of this uncertainty. Setting environmental baselines enables and constrains potential environmental management actions because these baselines are enrolled in regulatory programs to meet legal mandates. How these baselines are determined should be an important consideration as climate change influences existing baselines and may require new baselines to be established that anticipate the effects of climate change in the region.  Ecological restorationists adapt their practices to climate change by using several strategies, including facilitating the emergence of new tools and methods, acclimating their practices toward the future, and employing models to anticipate future conditions. These strategies should be acknowledged and fostered in order to increase adaptive capacity within the scientific community.
