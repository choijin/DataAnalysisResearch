<AbstractNarration>The National Science Foundation uses the Early-concept Grants for Exploratory Research (EAGER) funding mechanism to support exploratory work in its early stages on untested, but potentially transformative, research ideas or approaches. This EAGER project was awarded as a result of the invitation in the Dear Colleague Letter NSF 16-080 to proposers from Historically Black Colleges and Universities to submit proposals that would strengthen research capacity of faculty at the institution. The project at Hampton University aims to study the merits of using monofiliment carbon wires in drift chambers, and to develop a low recoil proton detector. If this project succeeds, the resulting knowledge can be used to develop future carbon nanotube wire chambers, which would be a possibly transformative development in experimental nuclear and particle physics. The project involves training of the next generation of physicists at Hampton University.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As part of the project, the investigation into the usage of carbon mono lament wires for construction of the cathode layer and/or an additional inner wire chamber for the BONuS12 detector will be carried out in parallel with development work on the currently planned, but lower risk, design. The current project is one of the first to investigate usage of such wires in an cylindrical detector. More generally, the usage of carbon mono laments could be a boon for experiments requiring detection and tracking of low momentum protons and nuclei due to the potentially significant reduction in energy lost over traditional metal wires. The technology for producing carbon nanotube wires offering conductivity surpassing that of copper wires has just now become available, with mass production likely available over the next few years.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This EAGER is co-funded by the Directorates for Education &amp; Human Resources and Mathematical &amp; Physical Sciences.</AbstractNarration>

It also provided support for both a Hampton University postdoctoral and graduate student researcher to work on the the detector design, prototyping, construction, and installation in coordination with several other university groups and Jefferson Lab staff. <br /><br />The nuclei of ordinary matter are made up of protons and neutrons that are in turn made up of <em>up </em>and <em>down</em> quarks.&nbsp;&nbsp; Determining the momentum distribution of both quark flavors in the high momentum regime dominated by scattering from single, non-interacting, quarks provides a benchmark for hadronic physics and our understanding of the strong nuclear force described by Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD).&nbsp; While such studies have been carried out with high precision on proton targets utilizing hydrogen nuclei.&nbsp;&nbsp; Equivalent information on the neutron has been difficult to come by due to the lack of high density, free neutron targets.&nbsp; Historically, information on the quark structure of the neutron has been determined from scattering on deuteron nuclei (weakly bound proton and neutron).&nbsp; However, the uncertainties introduced in inferring the free neutron quark structure are quite large when utilizing such a target.&nbsp; To avoid these issues, the BONuS12 experiment was proposed to measure the scattering from nearly free neutrons.&nbsp; This is accomplished by tagging slow, backward protons that recoil from the struck neutron.&nbsp; This proton tagging assures that the scattering took place from a nearly free neutron.&nbsp; For this reason, BONuS12 has been chosen by the Jefferson Lab Program Advisory Committee for the <strong><em>High Impact</em></strong> physics designation.</p> <p>There where two key scientific aspects to the research:&nbsp; the development of the next generation of low energy proton detector for use by BONuS12, and the investigation of using a layer of carbon monofiliment wires for the cathode, which would provide the large electric field necessary for the operation of this detector.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Hampton University group successfully led the detector design, prototyping, and construction&nbsp; in collaboration with Jefferson Lab and collaborators.&nbsp; Construction was was carried out in a clean room environment on the Hampton University campus and provided an excellent project for training.&nbsp;

Subsequent analysis has confirmed that the detector as met or exceeded the design goals necessary for&nbsp; the experiment.</p> <p>During the design phase, a Hampton U. graduate student performed detailed studies of the wire cathode design, including the uniformity of the electric field for different wire spacing around a cylindrical surface, the forces present, and the tension required along each wire necessary.&nbsp; Mechanical testing was then performed to validate these calculations.&nbsp; It was found that the tension required for this design would necessitate increasing the thickness of the plates holding the tension and would negatively impact the experiment due to the increased interaction of the scattered electrons in this thicker material.&nbsp; While the wire cathode design was not ultimately utilized, the group intends to further investigate such a design in the future for other applications.&nbsp;</p> <p>There were a number of broader impacts of this project beyond the success of an important experiment in the study of the fundamental structure of ordinary matter.&nbsp;&nbsp; The detector is now available for use by other experiments as part of the infrastructure of Jefferson Lab Hall B.&nbsp; In addition, there were a number of new construction techniques developed that could be of critical importance the development of future detectors.&nbsp; One example of this is a vacuum tensioning technique developed by the Hampton group, which allowed an extremely thin&nbsp; layer of aluminized plastic film to remain without wrinkles in a cylindrical shape held with under tension only by rings at the ends.&nbsp; An example of the 1 micrometer thick cylindrical cathode layer is shown in the attached figure during examination.<br /><br />Finally, this project has allowed for training of the next generation of scientists at a range of career levels, as noted above, and, in particular, under-represented groups in physics, such as women and African-Americans.&nbsp; Some of the students participating in the installation of one of the detector amplification layers in the Hampton clean room is shown in the attached figure.&nbsp; The postdoc working on this project has since moved to a permanent position at the Virginia Governor's school, where he and his students have continued involvement in this research.&nbsp;
