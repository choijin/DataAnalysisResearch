<AbstractNarration>The International Computer Science Institute proposes SInRGI (a Shared, Integrated Resource for "Global Impact"), a collaborative effort among APÂ® Computer Science Principles (CSP) projects that will curate and develop teaching resources for CSP's "Global Impact" learning objectives. As the first official CSP courses roll out in Fall 2016, teachers will be looking for creative, engaging instructional materials to cover the learning objectives detailed in its curricular framework. That framework is organized around seven Big Ideas, including "Global Impact" (GI). For most of the CSP Big Ideas, there is already a wide range of solid instructional materials available, but that is not yet the case for GI. At the same time, the GI learning objectives are furthest from the programming core that has traditionally been the focus for many high-school CS teachers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The SInRGI resource will be developed as a collaboration between the International Computer Science Institute (ICSI) and seven of the groups that have been developing content aligned to the CSP framework: the Beauty and Joy of Computing (BJC), CISS (Computing in Secondary Schools), Code.org, CS4Alabama/CSP4HS, CS Matters, Mobile CSP, and Thriving in Our Digital World: AP. Each group will each contribute materials, and then they will all work together to identify the best combination of approaches, and to create any new materials that are needed to fill gaps. This combined resource will then be distributed via the NSF-supported CS10K Community of Practice and other outreach channels. Finally the project team will work with providers of CSP professional development to incorporate the new material.</AbstractNarration>

For middle and high school students interested in STEM, learning about online privacy and human aspects of security can be an effective entree to complex topics in cybersecurity and networking. Focusing on impacts helps attract under-represented groups to computer science. And even for students who don't go on to become computer scientists, a solid understanding of cyber threats will be increasingly necessary for any technical job -- not to mention daily life.  For these reasons -- among others -- cybersecurity is increasingly viewed as an important aspect of computing education at all levels, from online safety for children on up. But while we've found that high school teachers are keen to teach cybersecurity concepts, they often lack the time and subject-matter expertise to develop the lessons.  To meet the need for curricular materials to address this rising topic, researchers and educators at the International Computer Science Institute and University of California, Berkeley, have been developing the Teaching Security lessons.  The project was particularly inspired by the need to address the cybersecurity learning objectives in the recently inaugurated AP Computer Science Principles course and exam -- especially the learning objectives around human factors in cybersecurity -- but the lessons are appropriate for any high school classroom.   Our aim is to explain technical principles in accessible terms and engage students' interest through interactive, inquiry-based activities that allow them to explore how cybersecurity works. In addition to those hands-on activities, the resource also includes discussion guides, slide decks, educational videos, and assignments, as well as background information for teachers. Many of the activities are "unplugged", i.e. they do not require a computer.  Our first lesson begins with threat modeling and the "security mindset", which provides an overarching framework that students can continue applying as they engage with specific cybersecurity topics in later lessons. The foundational ideas for the threat modeling lesson are based on an approach to cybersecurity used in some college-level courses (for example, the introductory "Computer Security" at University of Washington) and on the way privacy and security threat modeling is used in industry to identify priorities for hardening systems.  Our other two lessons, on authentication and on social engineering, highlight how security affordances arise both from human psychological tendencies and from the way the Internet is structured. The lessons also emphasize the importance of the usability of systems, and why the human side of cybersecurity is vital to a developing a good threat model.  In addition to releasing the Teaching Security curriculum on our website, https://teachingsecurity.org, we are conducting professional development sessions and workshops for high school computer science teachers who want to introduce their students to the intrigue and excitement of cybersecurity.
