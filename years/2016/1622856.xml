<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Technology Transfer Phase I project will enable biomolecular research by developing a high precision micropump utilizing a magnetic shape memory (MSM) mechanism. The MSM mechanism translates magnetic energy into mechanical work through an MSM alloy. The MSM material replaces many of the mechanical parts found in other micropump technologies and can precisely manipulate the very small fluid volumes handled by many researchers, such as biomolecular physicists and electro-neurophysiologists. Precision micro-dosing will decrease the costs of such research by decreasing the volume of reagents consumed and by increasing the efficacy and efficiency of experiments. This project will develop laboratory instrumentation for the institutional research market and will later expand to enter the nearly $3 billion microfluidic devices market. It will further develop MSM technology that will translate to multiple markets including healthcare. The broader impacts range from improvements in personalized medicine through point-of-care diagnostics, to the development of more efficient drugs, for example in cancer treatment, through enhanced pharmaceutical research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this project focuses on increasing the pumping resolution of the MSM micropump for precision micro-dosing for laboratory research. The pump design is biomimetic and works similarly to how mammals swallow. By applying a magnetic field, a peristaltic motion is generated in the MSM material which can be used to repeatedly pump precise quantities of fluid. This technology boasts a unique combination of features including (1) contact-free magnetic actuation, (2) no mechanical parts, (3) combination of the pumping mechanism and valve into a single element, (4) reversibility of the flow direction, (5) operation even with a high back pressure, (6) applicability to gases and viscous liquids, and (7) high precision at small volumes. Reducing the size of the MSM magneto-mechanical transducer will increase the pumping resolution. Since the surface-area-to-volume ratio is larger for smaller MSM transducers, surface stresses must be controlled more delicately. One key outcome of this work will be the development of surface treatment methods to improve magneto-mechanical fatigue life and the performance of the device. Through systematic experiments, this project will establish fundamental processing-structure-properties-performance relationships for MSM transducers, and will also demonstrate prototype devices for biomolecular research.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This Small Business Technology Transfer Phase I project further developed magnetic shape memory (MSM) technology and applied it to the development of an MSM micropump which was used for biophysical research.  The MSM mechanism translates magnetic energy into mechanical work through an MSM alloy. Thus, the MSM alloy replaces many of the mechanical parts found in other micropump technologies such as diaphragms, check valves, gears and rotors.  This project developed post-processing surface treatment methods for the MSM material which improved its magnetomechanical performance as well as its fatigue life by a factor of one thousand.  These developments have a broad impact since they positively affect many MSM technologies beyond the MSM micropump which was the focus of this project.  Furthermore, the technical specifications of the MSM micropump were further improved, such as its pumping resolution, pumping pressure and controllability.  The improved MSM micropump was utilized in developing new research methods for studying lipid bilayer membranes and their transmembrane transport mechanisms.  These new experimental methods enable the development of biological microreactors and pharmaceutical delivery systems.  Advancements in the MSM micropump benefit researchers in biophysics, genetics and medicine.  Furthermore, this technology can be integrated directly into point-of-care devices.  Precisely and reliably manipulating fluid at the microscale required for these technologies is currently a challenge in the industry, and the MSM micropump is a solution that addresses many of the technical demands required for this application.  Point-of-care devices, such as lab-on-a-chip devices and portable insulin delivery pumps, can deliver efficient medical care and diagnostic services at a fraction of the current costs and at great convenience to the patient.  This project greatly improved the MSM micropump technology such that it now is viable for these important applications.
