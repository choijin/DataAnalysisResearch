<AbstractNarration>The chemical compound H2O, which in its liquid state is called water, when it occurs bound in minerals and other solids, influences melting, rheology and plastic behavior of the mineral or material, and the material's thermal and electrical properties.  In the case where H2O is bound in minerals deep in the ocean crust, this can result in enhanced generation of magmas, hence volcanic eruptions, and changes in the plasticity, deformation of the lithosphere. In areas where magmas rise to the surface, this H2O is released and forms an important part of the global cycle of H2O. Because most of the H2O on Earth is locked up in minerals in the crust and mantle, the concentration and distribution of H2O in various mantle and lithospheric reservoirs have been inferred primarily from analyses of undegassed glasses and melt inclusions in oceanic basalts through a comparison of their H2O content with incompatible rare earth elements like Cerium.  This only provides a rough estimate of the H2O content of the Earth. This research builds off the results of a pilot study and uses a novel new approach to determine how much H2O is stored in minerals in the oceanic mantle and lithosphere, the mechanisms that fractionate H2O from other geochemical tracers in mantle lithologies, and the fate of the H2O and how it impacts the electrical conductivity and rheology of the oceanic lithosphere.  Broader impacts of the work include support of a faculty member at an institution in South Carolina, an EPSCoR state (i.e., a state that does not receive significant federal funding), support of a researcher whose gender is under-represented in the sciences, and student training who will get trained on cutting-edge analytical instrumentation at NASA at the Johnson Space Center in Houston, TX. Impacts also include international collaboration with Belgian and Japanese scientists and making the data accessible to the public.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Questions to be addressed by this research include seeing if H2O varies independently from lithophile elements in the lithosphere and if diffusion is responsible if decoupling is observed; looking to see if pyroxenes are typically a high-H2O, low-solidus reservoir; examine if H2O solubility in minerals under lithospheric pressures and temperatures put an upper limit on how much structurally bound H2O is held in the unaltered lithosphere; whether H2O concentrations are reflected in the H2O systematics of lithospheric samples; and whether there are systematic correlations between H2O distribution in the lithosphere and the degree of melting, depth, and lithology and metasomatic agents. To address these issues, Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) will be used to determine the H2O concentrations in well-characterized, fresh (i.e., unaltered) peridotites and pyroxenites from a suite of locations and tectonic settings that include the Canary Islands in the Atlantic Ocean; the Kerguelen Plateau in the South Indian Ocean; the Hawaiian and Samoan Islands and the Ontong Java Plateau in the Pacific Ocean; and the Lena Trough in the Arctic Ocean. Additional geochemical indicators, such as trace element compositions of minerals and radiogenic isotopes of Sr, Hf, Nd, and Pb in minerals and rocks will be used to help determine if there is a link between process, mineralogy, and H2O content/behavior.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Did you know that there is more water locked up deep in the Earth than at its surface in oceans, rivers, lakes, aquifers and atmosphere? Minerals in the mantle, the solid silicate layer from ~30 km to 2900 km depth, contain trace amounts of water that, when added up to the huge mass the mantle represent, is the equivalent of several oceans' mass worth of water. This project was to determine the amount and distribution of water in the shallowest mantle, essentially the lower part of tectonic plates that underlies our oceans, i.e. in the oceanic mantle lithosphere (1 in Fig. 1). We want to understand why the bottom of tectonic plates do not delaminate in the convecting mantle below given that their mechanical strength depends in part on the amount of water their minerals contain. And we want to constrain the water cycle in the Earth because the water locked in the tectonic plates plunges down in the Earth at subduction zones (2 in Fig. 1), and the water they contain then contributes to the gases exsolved in volcanoes around the world (3 in Fig. 1).</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We used primarily mantle xenoliths, i.e. little chunks of the Earth's mantle, brought up by lavas to the surface of the Earth (see Fig.2: green mantle xenoliths in black solidified lava at Canaries Islands). We measured how much water is contained in the minerals of the xenoliths from oceanic islands all over the world. We also analyzed mantle rocks lying at the bottom of the ocean, i.e. abyssal peridotites sampled during a scientific cruise ship expedition in the Arctic. On the latter type of mantle rock, we evidence a cautionary tale of the role of hydrothermal alteration at the sea floor on abyssal peridotites that may enriched the mantle rocks in water so that they are no use to estimate their original mantle water contents anymore. The water distribution in the mantle xenoliths is very heterogeneous at all scales (mm to m and from island to island). Together with the analysis of the composition of these minerals (major and trace elements), we determined that this is the result of melting processes and of the percolation of various types of melts circulating through the mantle. Interestingly, this heterogeneity has not been erased by the fast diffusion of water at mantle temperatures (&gt;800?C) as previously suggested. And the oceanic mantle lithosphere is not more enriched in water where it was traversed by plumes, large hot upwelling from the deep mantle (4 in Fig. 1), compared to other areas far from plumes, as previously assumed. The generally low water content of typical oceanic mantle lithosphere (~50 ppm H<sub>2</sub>O) renders it strong enough to sustain plate tectonic rigidity and survival. Our estimation of the amount of water in the oceanic lithosphere is a crucial parameter that can use in models of deep Earth water circulation, in the past and present.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Several students were involved over the three years of the project: from undergraduates, to a Master thesis and part of two PhD projects.
