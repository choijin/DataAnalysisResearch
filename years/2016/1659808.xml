<AbstractNarration>Nanoscience and engineering represents a growing segment of research and employment in the United States.  There are, however, limited opportunities for undergraduate students to have access to the advanced facilities and equipment used to fabricate, synthesize, and characterize nanoscale devices and the materials used to construct these next-generation devices.  This collaborative Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site program, Collaborative Research: REU Site: Nano-NY, at Columbia University Nano Initiative (CNI) and City University of New York (CUNY) Advanced Science Research Center (ASRC) will provide hands-on research opportunities in nanoscience and engineering to a diverse cohort of undergraduates from institutions with limited STEM research. In addition to conducting lab research, students will have access to advanced instruments and training in use of laboratory characterization, including the use of two new cleanrooms, imaging facilities with advanced microscopes, and chemistry labs at the City University of New York and Columbia University.  In addition to participation in a 9-week long research program in a lab, students will participate in weekly seminars and a tiered mentoring approach to promote the development of relationships among students, mentors, and faculty in addition to the development of technical and laboratory skills by the participants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Students in the program will participate in and contribute to cutting-edge nanoscience and engineering research activities and will have the opportunity to delve into a specific aspect of nanoscience; develop skills in identifying a research question / hypothesis and devising a research proposal; and conduct experiments using advanced instruments. Over the 9-week summer program, 12 students will learn new methods and tools, have opportunities to present their research, and become engaged as part of a community of inquiry.  REU students will have opportunities to be fully engaged in cutting-edge nanoscience and engineering research activities. This research will encompass three thrusts -  synthetic nanoassembly, interfaces and heterostructures, and nanophotonics, each an exciting frontier of science. The REU will introduce underserved undergraduates to the array of opportunities that are open to nanoscience graduates. By actively participating in the REU research community, students will learn new skills, build their research resumes, and acquire the confidence that will enable them to pursue STEM opportunities in graduate school or along other career paths. Recruitment and tiered mentoring will enhance opportunities for URM undergraduates to succeed in STEM. Moreover, the Columbia CNI / CUNY ASRC collaboration will provide students a unique opportunity to experience two different types of academic institutions - private and public. The program evaluation will include a post-REU longitudinal study that will allow the project team to track program successes and provide a means for continuing mentoring beyond the REU.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This program recruited and hosted 32 undergraduate students from across the country to perform research over three summers in nanoscale systems, chemistry, and electronics.  More than half of the students in each cohort identified as female and URM groups in science and engineering  Students were hosted on campus and posted at laboratories at Columbia University's Nano Initiative (CNI), Barnard College, and the City University of New York's Advanced Science Research Center (ASRC), all located within walking distance from each other in New York City. Research included a range of topics in nanoscale science and engineering including microfabrication and measurement of 2D materials, synthesis and use of quantum dots, sensing using piezoelectric thin films, electrochemical sensors, and sensitive optical measurements.  Each cohort was further educated through a series of technical seminars specific for REU students, a series of seminars discussing research skill-related topics, and were invited to public seminars.  Workshops and seminars were hosted at both the CNI and the ASRC.  A program discussing research mentorship was also developed and delivered for the graduate student and post-doc mentors.  One or two field trips to local company or national laboratory was organized each summer.  The conclusion of the program included a symposium, open to the research communities at both institutions, at which the students presented their results and discussed future work with other students, faculty, and members of the community.  Assessment was further performed to assess student outcomes and impressions of the program.  Students and mentors reported significant improvement in skills related to research including project planning, delivering presentations, and understanding graduate school options.  Many of the students are still completing their undergraduate programs, but so far 12 have enrolled in graduate programs in science and engineering.
