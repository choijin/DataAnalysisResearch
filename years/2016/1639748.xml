<AbstractNarration>When viewed at the micro-scale, rocks reveal structures that help to interpret the processes and forces responsible for their formation.  These microstructures help to explain phenomena that occur at the scale of mountains and tectonic plates.  Interpretation of microstructures formed in nature during deformation is aided by comparison with those formed during experiments, under known conditions of pressure, temperature, stress, strain and strain rate, and experimental rock deformation benefits from the ground truth offered through comparison with rocks deformed in nature.  However, the ability to search for relevant naturally or experimentally deformed microstructures is hindered by the lack of any database that contains these data.  The researchers collaborating on this project will develop a single digital data system for rock microstructures to facilitate the critical interaction between and among the communities that study naturally and experimentally deformed rocks.  To aid in the comparison of microstructures formed in nature and experiment, we will link to commonly used analytical tools and develop a pilot project for automatic comparison of microstructures using machine learning.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rock microstructures relate processes at the microscopic scale to phenomena at the outcrop, orogen, and plate scales and reveal the relationships among stress, strain, and strain rate.  Quantitative rheological information is obtained through linked studies of naturally formed microstructures with those created during rock deformation experiments under known conditions.  The project will develop a single digital data system for both naturally and experimentally deformed rock microstructure data to facilitate comparison of microstructures from different environments.  A linked data system will facilitate interaction between practitioners of experimental deformation, those studying natural deformation and the cyberscience community.  The data system will leverage the StraboSpot data system currently under development in Structural Geology and Tectonics.  To develop this system requires: 1) Modification of the StraboSpot data system to accept microstructural data from both naturally and experimentally deformed rocks; and 2) Linking the microstructural data to its geologic context ? either in nature, or its experimental data/parameters.  The researchers will engage the rock deformation community with the goal of establishing data standards and protocols for data collection, and integrate our work with ongoing efforts to establish protocols and techniques for automated metadata collection and digital data storage.  To analyze the microstructures studied and/or generated by these communities, we will ensure StraboSpot data output is compatible with commonly used microstructural tools.  They will develop a pilot project for comparing and analyzing microstructures from different environments using machine-learning.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[The objective of this proposal was to develop data standards and data policies for three separate, but related communities: 1) Structural Geology and Tectonics; 2) Experimental Deformation; and 3) Microstructures (Microscopic Images of Deformed Rocks).  The goal was to come to agreement on vocabulary and metadata standards, so that scientists could interact more easily.  In addition, it is not possible to develop a community-accepted digital data system if there is not agreement on the terms that are used.  We met with these groups at the same time because the vocabularies for these communities overlap and communication between them is critical; mutual agreement between, and not just within, each discipline is necessary.  An additional outcome was to identify current gaps in data storage and discoverability needs for these communities.  A third goal was to coordinate the data standards in the United States with ongoing international work to develop data standards in these fields, most critically by the EPOS (European Plate Observatory System). The objective was achieved principally through two meetings and follow-on activities that are still happening.  One workshop was held immediately prior to the Fall American Geophysical Union meeting 2018 (on 9 December 2018) in Washington, D.C..  The workshop had 21 participants from across the disciplines of Structural Geology and Tectonics, Microstructures, and Experimental Rock Deformation.  This meeting provided the groundwork for all subsequent activities.  It was recognized at the first meeting that the data standards for microstructures were significantly less well developed than those for the other two communities.  To address this deficiency, we conducted an additional two-day meeting on 17-18 June 2019 &ndash; solely with the microstructural community - to further develop both vocabulary and digital standards for microstructural analysis.  The six participants included faculty, post-doctoral fellows and graduate students who obtain and use microstructural data in their research.   The act of creating data standard and data policies is a long-term commitment.  We have continued to have meetings at least once per month to continue working on these issues.  In particular, we are working with EPOS (European Plate Observatory System) participants to develop international standards, particularly for experimental deformation and microstructures.  There was no clear way of communicating the data standards to the community through peer-reviewed scientific publications, which is the typical venue for scientific communications.  So, we have taken a two-tiered approach to dissemination.  First, spreadsheets of domain vocabularies have been presented to the relevant user communities at national conferences.  Second, the results are being incorporated into the StraboSpot digital datasystem, specifically into the StraboMicro and StraboExperimental applications.  StraboMicro integrates microscope images and data while preserving all aspects of the real-world orientations, positions, and geologic context of the data.  StraboExperimental stores the relevant machine parameters and the results from experiments on rock deformation.  These two applications will be available to the community in 2021.
