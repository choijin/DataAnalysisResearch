<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is to provide an affordable mobile digital pathology solution to pathologists in order to facilitate their clinical practices in disease diagnosis, peer consultations, tumor board preparations, research and education. The low-cost smartphone based portable pathology slide scanner is a complementary solution to current high throughput expensive digital pathology equipment to allow whole slide imaging to penetrate across all tiers of market. Given the high owning rate of mobile devices, the increasing processing and transmission speed, and the versatility of mobile apps, this device brings whole slide imaging at fingertips of individual pathologists. This greatly simplifies intra- and inter- institutional consultations and tumor board preparations, which enhances our fundamental understanding of disease causes and in turn leads to possible cures with improved clinical outcomes. The device also reduces the needs for physical transport of glass slides or tissue blocks to centralized digital imaging equipment. It also provides strong support on timely and accurate diagnosis, especially for those remote to digital imaging equipment. Moreover, this study provides an effective approach for teaching foundational skills of whole slide imaging to the next-generation pathologists.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The proposed project is to validate the technical feasibility of using smartphone based portable slide scanner for acquiring pathological slide images with the optical performance comparable or close to those by commercial high-end slide scanners. This device is based on an innovative zoom-microscope design, where elastomer-liquid lenses with low optical aberration are used for changing the zoom ratio. This portable device can reach the optical magnification of 10X-40X and nearly diffraction-limited resolution with small lens diameters (&lt;10mm), meeting the imaging requirement by pathologists. In this study, a prototype will be developed to demonstrate image acquisition, scanning, and transmission capabilities using representative mobile devices on the market. The minimal resolvable feature size under each magnification will be examined and compared with those of high-end commercial slide scanners. The minimal magnification increment based on the selected actuation mechanism will be experimentally determined. The images of pathological slides acquired under the same magnification or different magnifications will be stitched together to generate a large field-of-view while retaining the resolution. The stitched images will be sent to pathologists to solicit feedbacks for iterative design optimization.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is to explore the technical feasibility of developing an affordable benchtop digital pathology solution for pathologists to digitize, archive and share pathology slides using their smartphones or tablets. The device scans the whole slide images with high magnification, high image resolution and large overall field-of-view at greatly reduced cost and time. It is expected to facilitate intra- and inter-institutional consultations among peer pathologists that are essential for improving the clinical outcomes of diagnoses. This low-cost solution will also make digital pathology, a new modality of pathological data acquisition, more accessible to doctoral, scientific researchers, and medical educators that do not have access to current costly digital pathology solutions. The enhanced accessibility will significantly increase the sample size of clinical pathological slides and will build a large database to help for the incorporation of artificial intelligence technologies in pathology practice for assistive or autonomous diagnoses.</p> <p>Different from current costly digital pathology systems that use delicate solid optical elements and precise motorized stages, LiveFocus LLC designed and developed a compact optical system that uses liquid lenses with adaptive focusing powers to allow microscopic imaging with high resolution and rapid scanning using a low-cost motorized stage. The liquid lenses dynamically change the focusing plane to compensate possible stage vibration. The optical magnification can be changed as needed without moving or replacing any optical components. The use of smartphones or tablets for image acquisition, storage, and sharing further reduces the cost and system complexity. Patented technologies were used to ensure that image quality can meet the requirement for clinical diagnoses by reducing optical aberrations. A scanner prototype was developed and tested. The measurements showed that optical resolution can reach 0.49 &mu;m/pixel under the magnification of 20X and 0.275 &mu;m/pixel under the magnification of 40X using the rear camera of an iPhone SE. These resolutions are comparable to commercial high-end whole slide scanners. The stitched whole slide images acquired by this prototype have been examined by practicing pathologists and were deemed satisfactory for clinical purposes. The system size has been reduced to about 1/5 of commercial high-end whole slide scanners, and the cost has been reduced to about 1/10 of commercial high-end whole slide scanners. The time of switching the magnification between 20X and 40X is less than 1 <em>sec</em>.</p> <p>With the superior performance and affordable cost, LiveFocus expects the device to be useful for three following major applications: (1) to significantly shorten the turn-around cycle of pathological peer consultations and lead to enhanced clinical outcomes; (2) to increase the database of clinical samples by providing an enabling digital pathology solution in the areas with low or inadequate medical resources; and (3) to provide a tool for teaching foundational skills of whole slide imaging to the next-generation pathologists. During the Phase I project, a provisional US patent application (Application No. 62/459,847) with a follow-up Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) conversion (application no. PCT/US18/00009) were filed. LiveFocus LLC has acquired a worldwide exclusive license from The Ohio State University for the commercialization of liquid lenses based optical imaging devices, including but not limited to this portable digital pathology device. Part of this study was presented to pathologists at 2018 US and Canada Academy of Pathology meeting (USCAP2018). LiveFocus will present at 2019 SPIE startup challenge competition in Feb 2019 for the dissemination of this device to professional communities and the society.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 01/31/2019<br>      Modified by: Hanyang&nbsp;Huang</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1648888/1648888_10467697_1548966560136_Product--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1648888/1648888_10467697_1548966560136_Product--rgov-800width.jpg" title="LiveFocus smartphone based whole slide scanner product"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1648888/1648888_10467697_1548966560136_Product--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="LiveFocus smartphone based whole slide scanner product"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Schematic of LiveFocus smartphone-based whole-slide scanner.</div> <div class="imageCredit">LiveFocus</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Hanyang&nbsp;Huang</div> <div class="imageTitle">LiveFocus smartphone based whole slide scanner product</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1648888/1648888_10467697_1548966654483_prototype--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1648888/1648888_10467697_1548966654483_prototype--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Laboratory prototype"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1648888/1648888_10467697_1548966654483_prototype--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Laboratory prototype"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">The laboratory prototype of the whole slide scanner.</div> <div class="imageCredit">LiveFocus</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Hanyang&nbsp;Huang</div> <div class="imageTitle">Laboratory prototype</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1648888/1648888_10467697_1548966866760_tumorslide--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1648888/1648888_10467697_1548966866760_tumorslide--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Stitched sample image"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1648888/1648888_10467697_1548966866760_tumorslide--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Stitched sample image"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">The image of a bladder tumor sample (7.5mm?5mm in size) is acquired by LiveFocus zoom microscope under 40X.
