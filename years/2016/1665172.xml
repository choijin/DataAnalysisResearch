<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;The nontechnical description &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a result of progress in science and engineering over the past 5-10 years, solar panels have become an economically viable means for generating electricity for homes, industries, and transportation.  In fact, the cost of providing clean power from solar cells has been cut in half in only 6 years, and consequently, the number of jobs in the industry has skyrocketed.  This project focuses on developing next generation solar cell technologies through new designs and manufacturing techniques that will reduce costs further while increasing overall performance.  Since solar panel technology has yet to reach maturity, tremendous benefits for society are possible if recently identified engineering and science hurdles can be overcome. A key goal is to implement new materials, manufacturing processes, and characterization tools to enhance the fraction of incident sunlight that is converted to electrical power.  Current commercial solar panel designs use a single absorbing semiconductor layer in the device that allows a theoretical maximum of only ~30% conversion of the power in sunlight to electricity.  To date, approximately two-thirds of this maximum has been reached.  Next generation concepts involve the use of two absorbing semiconducting layers in the so-called "tandem" device structure which will allow a theoretical maximum of ~45% conversion of the incident sunlight to electrical power.  Although high efficiency tandems have been fabricated from high cost materials for use in space power, the cost of these cells is too high for large-scale terrestrial use.  This project will use a novel strategy that enables dissimilar semiconductor materials to work together and promotes low-cost production technologies of the resulting high efficiency tandem solar cells.  Importantly, the approach we will use ensures that the developed devices will be amenable to high-volume manufacturing.  The project integrates educational opportunities for students as well as outreach efforts to stakeholders, both designed to increase diversity in our science and engineering workforce and to broaden the impact of this project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The technical description&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this project a new general approach will be developed for fabricating monolithic tandems from dissimilar materials, based on the capabilities of novel solution processable single-wall carbon nanotube tunnel junctions.   This approach will create avenues for unlocking the mass production potential of high efficiency, low cost monolithically integrated tandem solar cells for terrestrial use.  The general research plan is expected to lead to tandems with a PCE &gt; 30%.  The research program leverages existing high efficiency CuIn1-xGaxSe2 (CIGS) devices produced by vacuum co-evaporation and capabilities for producing high efficiency CIGS and perovskite devices based on CH3NH3PbI3 by solution processing in a move toward an all-solution processed monolithically integrated tandem that can be fabricated in one continuous, low-cost manufacturing process.  As an integral part of the research, analysis will be performed via spectroscopic ellipsometry and laser beam-induced voltage and current response measurements that will guide the synthesis work.  These tools will enable in-depth simulations for understanding of tandem cell performance and will expedite adjustment of the band-gap ratios and layer thicknesses to insure optimal collection and current matching between cells.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ A critical need exists to transition the nation’s and the world’s energy supplies to non-fossil sources that do not generate greenhouse gas emissions. The CO2 concentration in the Earth’s atmosphere continues to set records, having reached a monthly average of 417.1 ppm in May 2020, 2.4 ppm higher than the corresponding period in 2019 [NOAA Global Monitoring Laboratory].  Great progress has been made over the past decade in increasing the component of the nation’s supply that is derived from solar energy conversion. Of the 2.86 x 104 TW hr of energy consumption in 2010, 0.09% or 27 TW hr was generated by solar energy [DOE/EIA-0035(2020/6)]. In contrast, of the 2.94 x 104 TW hr of energy consumption in 2019, 1.0% or 305 TW hr was solar generated. This rapid expansion of energy consumption from solar sources has been driven by significant reductions in the cost of photovoltaic modules.  For multicrystalline silicon modules, prices have dropped by almost an order of magnitude from $2 per watt in 2010 to nearly $0.20 per watt at the end of 2019 [https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/ solar-pv-has-become-cheaper-and-better-in-the-2010s-now-what].  Over the last decade, a trend in the dominant photovoltaics technology has occurred, evolving from multicrystalline toward higher efficiency monocrystalline as the costs of the higher efficiency photovoltaics technologies decline. The highest efficiency laboratory scale monocrystalline cell employs heterojunctions to amorphous silicon, reaching 26.7% [https://www.nrel.gov/pv/cell-efficiency.html ], which is close to the theoretical limit of 29.4%, given the Si bandgap of 1.1 eV.  To exceed this limiting efficiency, a material with bandgap closer to the optimum of 1.34 eV is required or a tandem solar cell design must be developed.   In fact, an optimum two-terminal tandem can reach a limiting efficiency of about 42%.  Photovoltaic modules based on thin film CdTe absorbers have achieved costs competitive with those of multicrystalline and monocrystalline silicon while simultaneously operating with a much lower cumulative energy demand.  The cumulative energy demand is the amount of energy required throughout the life cycle of the photovoltaics plant, starting from the extraction of raw materials to the decommissioning of the plant.  In fact, for a 10 MW plant, this energy demand for CdTe technology is typically more than 40% lower than multicrystalline silicon technology and more than 60% lower than monocrystalline silicon technology [https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2020/03/30/assessing-the-sustainability-of-existing-photovoltaic-technologies/].     This project has initiated research at University of Toledo’s PVIC that combines the high efficiency potential of tandem solar cells with the significantly lower cumulative energy demand of an all thin-film solar cell.  In this project, CuInSe2 is being developed with possible future additions of Ga for use as the bottom cell of a tandem.  CuInSe2 (CIS) with a bandgap of 1.02 eV is the narrowest bandgap thin film absorber material that has been successfully fabricated in high efficiency single junction solar cells.  By enhancing the electronic properties of the CIS in this study through careful optimization, the potential of applying the material in tandem devices is enhanced.  In addition, the complex dielectric function database established in this project for all the components of the CIS/perovskite tandem solar cell enables design of the tandem for optimum performance.   Similarly, the wider bandgap perovskite solar cells are being developed. Through complex dielectric measurements of a range of perovskite materials, we were able to model the tandem configuration that will yield the highest energy yield over the lifetime of the device and allow researchers to focus their time and energy on the appropriate materials. In addition, we have successfully developed a method to include the materials in the high performance n-i-p structure into the inverted p-i-n structure without damaging them during subsequent device processing. This is a necessary step to allow CIS/perovskite tandems to work properly and achieve high efficiency.  These are important steps along the path to a photovoltaics technology with higher efficiency, lower cost, and lower cumulative demand toward future reductions in greenhouse gas emitting energy sources.
