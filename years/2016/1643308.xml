<AbstractNarration>This project will advance efforts of the Innovative Technology Experiences for Students and Teachers (ITEST) program to better understand and promote practices that increase students' motivations and capacities to pursue careers in fields of science, technology, engineering, or mathematics (STEM) by engaging in hands-on field experience, laboratory/project-based entrepreneurship tasks and mentorship experiences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Georgia Institute of Technology (U.S.) and Yildiz Technical University (Turkey) propose an international conference to provide a forum for ministers of education, researchers, and practitioners from countries with high- medium- and low-STEM achievement scores to assess the problem of achievement gaps in STEM disciplines from a global perspective and to develop more global solutions share information.  This conference will identify major challenges and opportunities for addressing the achievement gap that exist among racial/ethnic, socio-economic status and gender and subsequently suggest solutions and strategies to provide all children equal opportunities to acquire knowledge and develop STEM skills. More specifically, the major goals of the conference are to: (a) identify major challenges and opportunities for addressing the achievement gap in STEM fields for high-, low-, and medium-achieving countries; (b) focus on underrepresented groups in high, low, and medium achieving countries in terms of STEM knowledge and skills needed for 21st century careers; (c) systematically assess conference outputs to identify research, practice, and policies that are effective or at least promising to address STEM achievement gaps; (d) develop solutions and strategies to provide all children with equal opportunities to acquire knowledge and develop STEM skills; and (e)  provide an opportunity for countries with high-, low-, and medium- STEM achievement scores to share information and learn about achievement gap in STEM fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Six countries (South Korea, Singapore, Australia, United States, Turkey and the Ukraine) are selected to represent the range of achievement. Collaborations among multiple sectors, levels, and countries brought together by this conference will have a lasting impact on the development and enhancement of the quality of STEM education globally; this, in turn, will have direct positive effects on providing equal opportunities for all children in STEM fields.  The conference will provide an opportunity to provide a better understanding of the structural issues of achievement gap in STEM through the presentations on policies, research, and practices from an international perspective.</AbstractNarration>

Intellectual Merit  Education is essential for countries to improve the quality of life for their citizens. Because the achievement gap in STEM fields is a critical global problem, it is essential to address it from an international perspective.  Both developed and developing countries are making education reform a top priority.  By narrowing the achievement gap, countries develop well-educated citizenry with 21st century knowledge and skills that enhance not only individual life chances but also the social and economic well-being of the country.   Conference participants were successful in identifying initial strategies for building an international community of stakeholders committed to engaging in collaborative efforts that could inform policies, research and practices to reduce STEM achievement disparities across the global landscape. The conference served as a catalyst for discourse on global solutions to address achievement gaps. Collaboration among participants from countries with differential levels of achievement gaps provided a variety of perspectives to enhance and advance our understanding of the STEM education opportunities that young people need and deserve.  Broader Impacts  STEM education is increasingly framed in global terms because most countries are focusing on strategies to develop and enhance their capacity to achieve international standards of technology and innovation. In an increasingly global society, it is essential to share the experiences?failures as well as successes?of strategies to narrow the achievement gap. The conference began to identify barriers as well as strategies for improving awareness and access to high-quality mathematics and science  education in a global perspective for under-participation of groups whether based on race, ethnicity, gender, and/or socio-economic status.  Participants identified some common global factors underlying the causes of achievement gaps in STEM education (e.g., poverty, teacher quality, sexism, racism, etc.).  The  working group white papers captured the following conference take-aways:  Inclusivity.
