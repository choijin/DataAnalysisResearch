<AbstractNarration>Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) offer the promise for radical changes to our everyday life by enabling the physical world to be programmed in the same way that a computer is programmed. The physical world, however, is far less predictable than a computer and this renders the design of CPS very challenging. In order to reduce the impact of unforeseen events arising from the physical world, or even from the cyber world, this project develops a science of CPS robustness. A robust CPS will only modestly deviate from its desired behavior upon the occurrence of unforeseen circumstances and has the ability to recover once these disrupting circumstances subside. The intellectual merit of this project is the development of a science of CPS robustness that harnesses the intricate interactions between cyber and physical components to obtain CPS that are able to operate in a wide range of unpredictable environments. The project?s broader significance and importance is the enablement of vast number of applications requiring CPS to operate seamlessly in unpredictable environments such as the internet-of-things or smart and connected communities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the technical level, this project leverages existing notions of robustness for cyber systems, such as self-stabilizing algorithms, and for physical systems, such as input-to-state stability, to create a science of CPS robustness. Expected outcomes include new temporal logics to specify CPS robustness, verification and synthesis algorithms for CPS robustness, as well as compositional design flows.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[This project addressed the verification and synthesis of robust Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). CPS are characterized by a tight interconnection between cyber and physical components. If one thinks of physical components as control loops, then robustness is natural since every control loop is designed to ensure robustness to different types of disturbances. In contrast, if one thinks of cyber components as software, then robustness is typically absent as evidenced by the presence of software bugs that often make software modules fail catastrophically.   In this project, by drawing inspiration from the inherent robustness properties of feedback control loops, we proposed a new temporal logic, termed robust Linear-time Temporal Logic (rLTL), that allows one to specify robustness properties of software. The syntax of this logic closely mirrors the syntax of Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) that is typically used to specify software properties. In this way, engineers familiar with LTL that quickly transform LTL specifications into rLTL specifications. However, in contrasts with LTL, rLTL specifications encode the behavior of a system in an ideal environment as well as in environments subject to different types of disturbances that better describe the real environments where CPS operate.   In addition to introducing rLTL, we developed the verification algorithms that take a system and a rLTL specification and determine if the specification is satisfied in an ideal environment and how much it degrades as the environment deviates from the ideal one. Moreover, we showed that for a large fragment of rLTL, verification of rLTL properties is not computationally much more expensive than the verification of LTL properties. We implemented these algorithms in a toolbox called Evrostos and made it publicly available in github and the CPS-VO.   The new logic rLTL became part of the syllabus of the graduate class Verification and Control of Hybrid Systems taught by the PI at UCLA thereby enabling the training of a new generation of engineers and researchers acquainted with robustness verification and synthesis techniques for CPS.
