<AbstractNarration>The responsible and thoughtful care and use of animal in research, testing, training, and education is important from a moral and ethical point of view, as well as for the collection of high-quality, replicable data.  The mission of ILAR is to identify, develop, promote, and disseminate strategies and practices that provide for excellence in the welfare of animals in academic or industry research, training, and education. This award serves to provide renewed support for core mechanisms through which ILAR accomplishes its mission.  ILAR developed and continues to update the "Guide to the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals", a document that is the basis for governmental regulations on animal care and use in research and education, and that sets performances standards and best practices in animal care and use worldwide.  ILAR also produces reports that provide the basis of guidelines and policy development for the care and use of animals in specific research domains.  Further, ILAR oversees the content of the ILAR Journal, and ILAR is responsible for the ILAR Roundtable on Science and Welfare in Laboratory Animal Use, which organizes workshops on timely animal welfare-related issues of interest to research communities as well as government, industry, and professional societies, and whose outcomes ILAR disseminates worldwide.  Additionally, through its role as a collaborating center for laboratory animal science and welfare of the World Animal Health Organization and an international fellowship training program, ILAR influences animal welfare awareness and best practices in laboratory animal medicine and science worldwide. ILAR operations are carried out by ILAR staff working under the oversight of ILAR Council, which includes representatives from academia, industry, biomedical and wildlife research, veterinarian medicine, and safety and regulatory affairs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The specific ILAR activities supported through this award include the oversight of the ILAR Journal, ILAR Council meetings, and the development and dissemination of ILAR publications and on-line material resulting from the ILAR Roundtable workshops. Although the emphasis is on animals in laboratory research, ILAR has and continues to take steps to broaden its scope to include animals in wildlife as well as agricultural research.</AbstractNarration>

Also, for this project, the ILAR Roundtable organized and convened four public globally-webcasted workshops on the following topics: 1) Animal Models for Microbiome Research: Advancing Basic and Translational Sciences; 2) Advancing Disease Modeling in Animals-Based Research in Support of Precision Medicine; 3) Care, Use and Welfare of Marmosets As Animal Models for Gene Editing-Based Biomedical Research; and 4) Human-Animal Interactions in the Research Environment.  Proceedings for these four workshops are freely available for download by searching for the workshop name on the National Academies Press website at http://nap.edu.  Additional outcomes of this project include: 1) ILAR expanding its advisory council membership to include five new members having field experience in wildlife and/or with the use of wildlife species in non-laboratory settings; 2) the new ILAR Council meeting in-person and engaging with an esteemed panel of NSF scientists about their research activities using wildlife and non-model species in natural settings: 3) a series of subsequent meetings for internal and external development efforts for ILAR to set forth new strategic initiatives to address animal welfare challenges in research and education on wildlife and non-model species, and to further identify ways to enhance the welfare of animals used for research in non-laboratory settings, further improve institutional-level animal research programs and oversight, and build additional capacity to inform the future development of activities to expand ILAR’s mission into the broader animal researcher stakeholder community.
