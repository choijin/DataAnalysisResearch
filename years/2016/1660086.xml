<AbstractNarration>This project seeks to develop, manufacture, and evaluate a novel nervous system simulation platform consisting of freely connectable electronic neuron modules. These devices will be used in the secondary education and post-secondary education classroom to further students? conceptual grasp of neuroscience, engineering, and physiology, and to generate lasting enthusiasm for a career path centered on the science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) sector. Per a 2012 study by the Department of Education, undergraduate STEM major retention rates are only 35% from initial declaration through graduation. Studies have shown that unengaging introductions to STEM are partially to blame. The firm believes that their product?s positive effect on new knowledge formation and student enthusiasm for STEM has the ability to increase this low retention rate. They also believe that the company will grow at a similar rate to our benchmark companies in STEM and neuroscience education which, after approximately five years in business, each have several dozen employees and annual sales greater than $1 million dollars. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The outcome of our proposed project includes development of an electronic neuron simulation ecosystem, as well as development of instructions, experiments, and curricula for NeuroBytes secondary and undergraduate education classroom use. The prototypes produced during Phase I of this project were suitable for proof of concept demonstrations and testing, but much work is needed to develop robust and student-friendly devices for large scale manufacturing at the end of Phase II. Through our Phase I customer development interviews, much important insight was gained into needed and desired input/output devices, accessories, and kits in the secondary and tertiary education segment. These accessories and devices will be an important outcome for increasing the commercial potential of our products. The curricula will be developed in conjunction with partner educators at the middle school, high school, and college levels to ensure that they are properly structured and documented for the maximum possible benefit by our future customers.</AbstractNarration>
