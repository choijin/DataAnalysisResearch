<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the implementation of a disruptive technology that can transform the landscape of energy storage. This project aims to combine millions of copper wire used to transport electricity with energy storage technologies that are typically expensive, large, or heavy. This approach has many value generating applications in the aerospace, automotive, energy, defense, and IT industries. In the event of a power shortage in a data center or server room, websites or cloud services are at risk of going offline. By combining energy storage with copper wires, this project would ensure that these services stay online during a shortage and will maximize space in server rooms by removing backup batteries enabling the companies to offer more services. This same technology could cut the weight soldiers carry during military operations, reduce the cost of energy, improve the output of electric vehicles or wind turbines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project will further develop a cable-based-supercapacitor (CSC) technology. The CSC will simultaneously store and transport electricity. This is accomplished by a novel method of growing high aspect ratio nano-whiskers on the surface of copper cable/fibers which greatly increases the surface area. This increase in surface area provides highly enhanced energy storage capability to the CSC. A proof-of-concept device has demonstrated the CSC's function and durability in potential commercial applications.</AbstractNarration>
