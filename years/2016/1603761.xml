<AbstractNarration>Understanding nanoscale thermal radiation is critically important for advanced energy systems, nanomanufacturing, local thermal management, and high-resolution thermal sensing/imaging. Micro/nanoscale thermal radiation concerns both radiative heat transfer between closely spaced objects and the interaction of electromagnetic waves with micro/nanostructured materials that could modify the spectral radiative properties. Recent advances in graphene and other two-dimensional (2D) materials offer enormous potential to revolutionize current microelectronic, optoelectronic, and photonic devices as well as energy harvesting systems. The objective of this research project is to investigate the underlying mechanisms of hybridization of 2D materials with 3D nanostructures for active and passive control of thermal radiative transport and properties. The results may directly benefit the practical engineering applications mentioned previously. Graduate and undergraduate students working on this project will gain fundamental knowledge of thermal radiation at small length scales and research experiences in micro/nanofabrication, radiometric instrumentation, and numerical simulation. The successful implementation of this project will have a great impact on engineering education and human resource development, including opportunities for underrepresented groups. In addition, the computational codes developed from this research will be made available via internet to promote future research and applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hybrid graphene on metal grating structure will be fabricated and their radiative properties measured with spectrometers to explore the effect of coupled graphene plasmons with magnetic polaritons in gratings on the absorptance or transmittance. The potential of gating graphene to actively control the spectral radiative properties will also be experimentally examined. Simulation tools based on the rigorous coupled-wave analysis will be developed and applied to model the radiative properties of anisotropic hybridized 2D/3D structures. For example, hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) films coupled with grating structures will be investigated to shed light on the excitation of the hyperbolic waveguide modes in hBN using gratings. The far-field radiative properties of layered black phosphorus (BP) and other hybrid 2D/3D materials will also be analyzed. By combining the exact scattering theory with the anisotropic RCWA, this research seeks understanding of near-field thermal radiation for coupled plasmonic modes, such as the hybrid graphene surface plasmon and hBN phonon polaritons (SPPPs), and for structures with inherent in-plane anisotropy such as few layers of BP. Moreover, the validity of Kirchhoff?s law for anisotropic media will be evaluated based on fluctuational electrodynamics. Fundamental understanding will be gained as to how plasmons in 2D materials can couple with each other and with resonance modes in 3D micro/nanostructures, as well as how these coupling phenomena may affect thermal radiative properties and radiative energy transport in both the near-field and far-field regimes. The success of this project will advance the frontier of thermal radiation research.</AbstractNarration>

Micro/nanoscale thermal radiation concerns both near-field radiative heat transfer between closely spaced objects and electromagnetic wave interactions with micro/nanostructured materials that could potentially modify the far-field radiative properties. Recent advances in graphene and other two-dimensional (2D) materials offer enormous potentials to revolutionize current microelectronic, optoelectronic, and photonic devices as well as energy harvesting systems. This research project aims at investigating the underlying mechanisms of hybridization of 2D materials with 3D nanostructures for active and passive control of thermal radiation in both the far-field and near-field regimes.</p> <p>We have measured near-field radiative heat transfer between parallel doped-silicon plates at separation distances down to 200 nm, demonstrating greater than 10 times enhancement over that between two blackbodies. We have performed extensive theoretical studies on using graphene and other 2D materials, such as hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), together with micro/nanostructures for tailoring thermal radiation both in the near- and far-field regimes. The main mechanism has been elucidated by considering the slow-light effect in a hyperbolic waveguide, which can trap the incident light of different wavelengths in different regions of the trapezoid or pyramid. We have also investigated the effects of phonon polaritons in nanoparticles and multilayered structures, including graphene and hyperbolic metamaterials, on thermal emission and absorption. Image #1 shows enhanced near-field heat transfer with graphene-covered hBN films due to coupled surface plasmon-phonon polaritons; Image #2 demonstrates perfect absorption using hBN on Ag gratings. We have experimentally investigated the spectral radiative properties of ceramic materials and developed physical models to explain the results. We have also experimentally demonstrated magnetic polaritons (MPs) in deep metal gratings; this study validated our earlier theoretical predictions, as shown in Image #3. We have designed a dual-layer structure, based on polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE)&nbsp;sheet on an opaque Ag film, for sky cooling purposes. The measured results suggest a record-high solar reflectance using our design with diffuse reflection characteristics, as exhibited in Image #4 for three samples.</p> <p>The findings reflect important advancements in the field of heat transfer and thermal sciences with applications to solar energy and sky cooling. Our study on nanoscale thermal radiation helps us gain a deep understanding of the underlying photon tunneling mechanisms associated with 2D materials and nanostructures. The demonstration of using 2D material to control radiation absorption has important implications to the heat transfer analysis and modeling for energy harvesting and materials processing diagnostics. The theoretical and experimental results from this project are important not only for heat transfer research but also for the development of nanostructures, 2D materials, metamaterials, nanophotonics, and nanoplasmonics.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Broader Impacts:</span></em></p> <p>We have experimentally demonstrated a record-high solar reflectance using a dual-layer structure for potential usage in daytime radiative cooling, which may reduce fossil fuel consumption and environmental impact. We have numerically shown that trapezoidal nanostructures made of hyperbolic metamaterials greatly enhance solar absorptance for energy harvesting. Furthermore, the experimental demonstration of MPs in deep metallic gratings is important for tailoring the spectral emission and absorption properties for thermal management. The insight gained from this work may facilitate future design and applications of subwavelength periodic structures with desired radiative properties for advanced technologies. The research results have been disseminated in 18 journal publications and two book changes.</p> <p>Several Ph.D. students participated in this research and two of them received direct support from this project. They have also delivered many technical presentations at national and international conferences, and received the ASME Micro/Nano Forum Best Poster Award at IMECE 2013 and 2018. In addition, a visiting Ph.D. student has participated in the research work through an international collaboration program. Several undergraduate students have also worked in Dr. Zhang?s lab and gained first-handed research experience.</p> <p>Dr. Zhang taught Nanoscale Heat Transfer in Spring 2018 and Radiation Heat Transfer in Spring 2019. He has updated the course materials and revised by adding 35% new materials to the popular textbook Nano/Microscale Heat Transfer, which was published by Springer Nature in June 2020.
