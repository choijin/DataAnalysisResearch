<AbstractNarration>The Global Learning and Observations to Benefit the Environment (GLOBE) program is a cooperative international science and science education program jointly supported by NASA and NSF, with additional in-kind support from NOAA, Department of State, and USAID.  Using inquiry-based, place-based, and problem-based pedagogies, GLOBE directly supports national efforts to engage a new generation of diverse students in the science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) disciplines and encourage them to consider careers in STEM.  GLOBE annual meetings bring together GLOBE Country Coordinators and U.S. Partnership Coordinators, members of the scientific community that support GLOBE, and representatives of the sponsoring agencies.  Annual meetings provide a venue for both sharing of best practices for GLOBE implementation that have been developed through the creative efforts of the community, as well as additional training in the use of GLOBE program resources and technology. This will be the 20th annual meeting for GLOBE, offering an opportunity for the community to both reflect on and celebrate their many accomplishments and focus on effective implementation of emerging opportunities for the program.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award provides partial support for the 2016 GLOBE Annual Meeting, which is being held July 17-22 at the Estes Park Conference Center, Colorado.  Over 150 adult members and 50 student members of the worldwide GLOBE community are expected to attend.  The University Consortium for Atmospheric Research (UCAR) and the GLOBE Implementation Office (GIO) are leading the planning effort for this meeting, with contributions from other members of the GLOBE community.  This year's annual meeting is focusing on three main themes that reflect emerging priorities within the GLOBE program: (1) student research and science fairs; (2) STEM equity and inclusion; and, (3) citizen science.  The annual meeting is also being used to convene strategic planning meetings for the four GLOBE Working Groups related to education, technology, science, and evaluation.  The ~50 pre-college students attending the annual meeting will also participate in a concurrent 2-day hands-on research experience based on the GLOBE protocols that is being organized by the Estes Institute.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[Project Outcomes Report 20th GLOBE Annual Meeting Federal Award ID: 1623979  Intellectural Merit: Concerns over the number of Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) graduates have been mounting for decades. Recent publications reveal that these concerns have risen to a new level.  These publications all point to the lack of qualified STEM graduates to meet short and long-term workforce needs of the nation?s economy.  In addition, the last two federal administrations have touted the need for more emphasis on STEM education.  This needs to encompass all students so GLOBE is beginning to focus on STEM Equity and Inclusion.  GLOBE is an excellent vehicle for making this connection between information and formal environments and for creating the sustaining interest in students in the K-12 system. GLOBE annual meetings allow members of the community to learn from each other, share new ideas, and learn from world class scientists in order to improve the implementation of the program in different contexts.  Broader Impacts: Given its emphasis on science, technology and mathematics, GLOBE can play a large role in the current STEM offerings to K-12 students.  The GLOBE Program can create a mechanism for expanding the pipeline of potential future scientists and researchers for industry, academia, and government.  Because of its hands-on and inquiry basis, it can excite students about science.  Students of color and students in high needs school districts will become a focus of GLOBE.  In addition, with the release of the citizen science data entry app, more data collection will be possible.  Any citizen in a GLOBE country can enter data through the new app and have them visualized in the system.  With its emphasis on data collection and analysis, GLOBE can assist people in their understanding of Earth systems.   During the 20th GLOBE Annual Meeting several breakout session were dedicated to addressing the issue of STEM emphasis in education and of STEM equity and inclusion. A breakout on SciGirls and GLOBE demonstrated how to integrate inquiry-based STEM instruction with a commitment to gender equity and with a focus on underrepresented populations in STEM.  Other sessions focused on STEM Equity and Inclusion, as well as fostering an interest in STEM subjects among all students using GLOBE?s integrative, hands-on approach to learning about the natural world.   Concerns all over the world about mosquitos and vector-borne diseases have increased alarmingly. The new GLOBE mosquito protocol is one of the responses of the GLOBE community to this important issue. Student research using the mosquito protocol is published in scientific journals and can be used in raising community awareness about the insects, which is very important in preventing the spread of mosquito-borne diseases.  There is significant interest in the GLOBE Community and beyond in this protocol and the resulting data that will be collected and shared through the GLOBE Data Information Systems.  The GLOBE International STEM Network (GISN) has doubled in size over the past few years.  At the annual meeting, information was shared about how the GLOBE Community continues to benefit from this network.  Work is underway to collaboratively move the GISN forward.
