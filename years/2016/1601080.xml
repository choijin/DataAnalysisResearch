<AbstractNarration>This project will develop a new experimental diagnostic and an improved computational model to characterize interactions between a material surface and a low temperature plasma, a weakly ionized gas composed of electrons, ions, and neutral atoms and molecules.  Low temperature plasmas are essential for modern life as they form the basis for manufacturing a variety of high-technology products ranging from laptops and smartphones to displays and solar cells. They are also relevant for a variety of medical applications such as sterilization of medical equipment and wound healing. All these applications are based on the ability of the plasma to induce distinct surface reactions in a controlled way. In order to optimize these applications, plasma simulations, including a realistic implementation of plasma-surface interactions, are crucial. In this project, a new diagnostic to measure key aspects of the plasma-surface interaction physics will be developed, and results will be implemented into a computational model. Results obtained from this research will also be incorporated into graduate level lectures on low temperature plasma science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Most simulations of capacitive radio frequency plasmas (CCP) only include constant ion induced electron emission and electron reflection at guessed probabilities. Any dependencies on the incident particle energy, angle, and surface material as well as other effects are neglected. This leads to an incorrect description of the particle heating dynamic and flux-energy distribution functions (FEDF). For many surface materials and gases secondary electron emission coefficients induced by electron, ion, and neutral impact as well as particle reflection and sputter rates are unknown in the presence of plasmas that alter the surface conditions. In this project, a novel simulation based diagnostic to measure effective gamma-coefficient by Optical Emission Spectroscopy in the plasma will be developed. Realistic energy and surface dependent electron emission and reflection coefficients for different incident particle species will then be implemented into PIC simulations of CCPs.  The simulation code will be benchmarked against experiments and the effects of realistic surface coefficients on the electron heating dynamics and the control of FEDFs of different particle species will be studied.  All investigations will combine state-of-the-art simulations with experiments.</AbstractNarration>

In the frame of this project an advanced model for Argon discharges with realistic energy-dependent and material specific surface coefficients for various plasma-surface interactions was developed and implemented in kinetic Particle-in-Cell/ Monte Carlo Collisions (PIC/MCC) simulations of capacitively coupled plasmas (CCPs). This new simulation code was successfully benchmarked against experiments performed in geometrically symmetric CCP reactors (built up in the frame of this project).  This represented the first systematic experimental verification of PIC/MCC simulations of CCPs.The effects of realistic surface coefficients on the discharge operation and plasma parameters were studied in discharges driven by a single frequency and by multiple frequencies.

It was demonstrated that the flux of sputtered atoms can be controlled in multi-frequency CCPs by varying the phase shifts of the driving harmonics. A new discharge operation mode of CCPs was discovered (striation-mode in electronegative gases), new details of the electron power absorption mechanism in RF discharges were revealed. A new simulation-based diagnostic (&gamma;-CAST) to measure unknown SEE coefficients was developed. This novel non-intrusive and in-situ computationally assisted spectroscopic technique is based on a combination of experimental phase resolved optical emission spectroscopy (PROES) and self-consistent numerical plasma simulations. This method was successfully used to determine coefficients for a variety of surface materials. An ab-initio model for the calculation of ion induced SEE coefficients at metal surfaces with a wide range of surface conditions and for a variety of ion species was also developed, providing material speci&#64257;c SEE coefficients to be used as input parameters for plasma simulations.  The comprehensive studies on the plasma-surface interactions performed in the frame of this project provide new knowledge on low temperature plasmas and a scientific basis for enhanced process control in various applications. Outcomes of this project are considered to be of fundamental relevance to low temperature plasma science on an international level. This is illustrated by the fact that special sessions on this topic are organized at international meetings, special issues are published on this topic in leading journals in the field, and new research projects are started by researchers in the field based on the results obtained in the frame of this NSF project.
