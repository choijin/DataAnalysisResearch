<AbstractNarration>The Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP) through Targeted Infusion Projects supports the development, implementation, and study of evidence-based innovative models and approaches for improving the preparation and success of HBCU undergraduate students so that they may pursue STEM graduate programs and/or careers. The project at Hinds Community College-Utica Campus (UC3) seeks to establish strategies to strengthen interventions and instruction to enhance student performance of high school and college students in mathematics. Ninety-nine percent of the students on the Utica Campus are African-American, with 64% being first-generation college students and/or are from low socio-economic backgrounds. The project will contribute to the development of effective techniques by adding intrusive mathematics coaching to the developmental mathematics classes, outside STEM related experiences, and career exploration for college students. Effective techniques and approaches to be developed include providing ACT test preparation and state assessment boot-camps for high school/pre-college students. The project will also provide professional development for faculty, and include partnerships with industries and collaborations with 4-year HBCUs. Given the recognized and increasing importance of community colleges in the educational enterprise and ultimately the workforce, this project will contribute meaningfully to the knowledge base about the potential contributions and role of community colleges in developmental education, particularly mathematics.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The overall goal of the project is to recruit, support, retain and prepare developmental students who are interested in STEM to accelerate through mathematics developmental courses in order to complete associate degrees and transfer to 4-year institutions. The objectives are to: (1) increase high school students' mathematics scores on state assessments, performance-based assessments and ACT/COMPASS; (2) increase developmental students' mathematics performance and passing rates in developmental math and college level math scores; (3) increase developmental students'knowledge and interest in STEM education and careers; and (4) create a dynamic math teaching and learning community that improves the performance of students in developmental and non-developmental math courses and which transforms the Hinds Community College-Utica Campus academic/educational environment. The project could serve as a national model to encourage other community colleges to intervene effectively and early in mathematics.</AbstractNarration>

Through the project, students received math assistance from one transitional point to the next by offering tutoring intervention in developmental math courses that traditionally impede the persistence of minorities in Gateway courses, and ultimately in the attainment of associate’s degrees in STEM.

Intellectual Merit Statement. The attainment of STEM degrees continues to be a challenge for underrepresented and underserved minorities. To fill the equity gap, support services such as developmental education is essential in the success of minorities pursuing STEM degrees.  The outcomes of earlier projects have served as models and led to STEM educational guidelines within the HCC-UTC Natural Science Department and the college holistically through the implementation of transformative strategies in STEM. Community colleges have become the junction of educational institutions, and of STEM and workforce industries. Activities, as those outlined in this project, will provide a foundation for engagement, exposure, and enlightenment between high schools and employees, community college faculty, and community colleges. In addition, the results will be used to motivate other institutions to develop programs to increase the presence of minorities in STEM.  Broader Impacts. The M in STEM project increased the number of students from Claiborne, Copiah, Hinds, and Warren Counties (rural MS) majoring in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) by providing intervention and support services to recruit, develop, support, retain, and prepare developmental students for success in STEM.

Students at the community college level had opportunities to participate in research opportunities and develop early mentor relationships that support transfer success from the STEM granting 2-year to the 4-year institution.  Outcomes as a result of the Project:   High School Component  STEM Recruitment Days have been initiated twice per semester to increase the knowledge about STEM offerings, ACT Workshops will continue through other college sponsored programs, and New and current students will continue to participate in STEM engagement activities.   Community College Component  The Natural Science Department has increased its program offerings by adding a Computer Technology Instructor to its staff; A designated space for the STEM Active Learning Lab (part of the Tech-Nest Center) has been created and operational with updates that include lab top computers, a Samsung Smart TV to display student work, Bluetooth accessibility for projects and presentations of group assignments; two White boards for tutoring and collaboration; Partnerships will continue with external STEM industries including Ingalls Shipbuilding, NASA, Nissan, Army Corps of Engineers with continued efforts to expand the pool; Partnerships with external STEM research agencies/institutions&mdash;Emerging Researchers, Louis Stokes Mississippi Alliance for Minority Participation (LSMAMP), Mississippi I IDeA Network of Biomedical Research Excellence (INBRE), Jackson State University, Alcorn State University, Mississippi Valley State University, Tougaloo College, University of Southern Mississippi, Mississippi State University, The University of Mississippi&mdash;are in place and will continue; The Math Lab has operated out of an assigned space that can continue to serve as a math/STEM support lab or repurposed. The lab has computers and a promethean board; and Math lab courses will continue as a co-requisite based on ACT/Next Generation Compass test criteria.   Faculty Component  STEM faculty will continue to:    seek out and participate in professional development opportunities, work as part of the STEM recruitment team and creatively design activities that increase STEM interest, serve as mentors to incoming and current students, and work with STEM majors to assure transfer success to 4-year institutions.        The Natural Science Division will continue to:             collaborate with external partners and work with students on abstracts and papers for        submission to professional conferences.
