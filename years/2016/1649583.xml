<AbstractNarration>Small computing devices (e.g., smartphones, wearables, etc.) feature a set of hardware resources that programmers often find insufficient to implement an application's business logic. For example, a mobile application's geographic coordinates cannot be determined when running on a device without a GPS sensor. Existing software engineering approaches cannot address the resource scarcity of mobile devices, without either resorting to cloud-based execution or requiring nearby devices share executable code. This project will create a proof-of-concept software architecture and programming abstractions for distributed mobile services: nearby devices using each other's resources without having to accept code to execute from untrusted parties. These technologies can immediately enhance the extant mobile computing ecosystem. As the Internet of Things (IoT) is entering the mainstream of computing, this project can help address the resource scarcity in this domain as well. Involving underrepresented groups in the proposed research activities will provide an effective avenue for broadening participation, in line with the PI's prior activities in this realm.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project addresses the challenges of developing software for devices with limited resources. Although nearby computing devices may possess the missing resources they are willing to share, high dynamicity, lack of trust, and extreme heterogeneity stand on the way of such sharing. The expected contribution is three-fold: (1) a software architecture centered around the concept of the Mobile Service Market (MSM), which leverages the resources of nearby devices, without having the devices share executable code, (2) a programming model to statically select a needed service, configure its device constraints, and have the runtime dynamically select a nearby device to execute the service; the model will be realized as a domain-specific language tailored for the domain of service constraints and communication across heterogeneous, nearby, mobile devices, (3) a rigorous evaluation of the created technologies that realize the proposed new concepts by applying them to real-world mobile applications and benchmarks. Insights gained from conducting this research will help determine how static and dynamic approaches should be combined to be able to define requirements statically, while matching them dynamically with specific nearby devices in a context-specific fashion.</AbstractNarration>
