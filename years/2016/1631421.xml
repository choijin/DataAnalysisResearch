<AbstractNarration>This proposal requests funding to partially support a workshop that will promote greater communication between the Science of Science and Innovation Policy (SciSIP) academic community and science policy decision-makers within the National Institutes of Health (NIH). The goal of the workshop is to enhance the quality and relevance of SciSIP research by: (1) making S.ciSIP researchers more aware of the key policy issues and problems confronting NIH leadership, (2) enhancing understanding of both public and administrative data generated by NIH that may be useful for SciSIP research, (3) increasing NIH leadership?s understanding of how both public and administrative data might facilitate SciSIP research, and (4) identifying the major hurdles to data access for SciSIP researchers and propose solutions to resolve them.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop addresses this question by bringing together SciSIP researchers and officials at NIH, one of the largest funders of extramural basic science, in a structured format intended to concentrate discussion on key issues that require greater understanding on both sides. The outcome of the workshop will be smoother interaction between the research community and NIH officials and greater access to data necessary to advance the SciSIP research agenda.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The project's primary goal was to promote awareness within the National Institutes of Health (NIH) of the methods and findings of Science of Science Policy scholars to encourage more evidence-based policy decisions.  At the same time the project sought to make scholars aware of the policy issues and decisions most salient for NIH officials in hopes of stimulating new research that would address their practical concerns.  In April 2016 a two-day conference attended by more than 400 NIH officials, scholars and other individuals was held on the NIH campus at which NIH leadership outlined key concerns and Science of Science Policy scholars discussed research results relevant to the biomedical sciences.  One important outcome of this interchange was a sharper focus on areas of overlap between the two key groups.  This led to identification of a set of open questions related to federal policy generally, and NIH policy specifically that requires scholars to share data generated with federal funds.  To investigate this topic further a follow-up workshop was held on the NIH campus in October 2017. Attended by more than 50 people this one-day workshop identified important policy choices that will influence costs and benefits of data sharing and clarified specific areas of investigation where existing knowledge is insufficient to support well informed policy choices.
