<AbstractNarration>Comparison between the structures of closely related languages facilitates discovery of patterns of change, convergence and divergence of a uniquely human biocultural system, i.e. language. The Dene or Athabaskan language family, the largest Native American family of North America, constitutes an ideal laboratory for investigating such patterns. The family is constituted of closely related languages originally spread over central Alaska, Western Canada, California, Oregon, and the US Southwest, where the family is represented by the Apachean subgroup of languages. PI Willem de Reuse will organize a conference of linguists and interested community members to investigate Apachean as part of the 2017 Dene/Athabaskan Language Conference and Workshop, to be hosted by the Yavapai-Apache Nation, Camp Verde, Arizona, for three days. What is unique about the conference is that members from all Apache tribal communities and other Athabaskan communities will be present, providing insights via language and ethnographic data to stimulate further research in language relatedness and in language change. This Dene/Athabaskan Language Conference will be the first ever with a special focus on Apachean languages.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Whereas Apaches have played an iconic role in southwestern U.S. history, one both admired and reviled in popular films and literature, the history of Apachean languages and their relationships has been the subject of rather little scientific inquiry. Participants of the proposed conference will explore the history of the Apachean languages, the relationships between Apachean languages and the other Athabaskan languages, and similarities and differences in approaches to language documentation, teaching, and revitalization. The linguistic findings arising from this conference and workshop will also strengthen ethnolinguistic identity and awareness for all indigenous participants, leading to improved communication and understanding between the different Apache groups. Student training of both a Native American tribal student and a student from the University of North Texas will also be provided.</AbstractNarration>
