<AbstractNarration>This project will support attendance of young faculty, under-represented minority scientists, PUI faculty, along with graduate students and post-docs at the 2016 Plant and Microbial Cytoskeleton Gordon Research Conference to be held at the Proctor Academy in Andover, NH, August 14-19, 2016. The meeting will consist of short talks, poster sessions, communal dining, and conversations that will provide ample opportunity for sharing latest research results and for exploring collaborative possibilities.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The cytoskeleton of plant, fungi, and plants play important roles in cell division, cellular trafficking, and wall organization in these groups of organism.  The Broader Impacts of this work involves both the importance of the cytoskeleton to a range of organisms, as well as the training of new scientist to pursue research in these fields. Cutting-edge or late-breaking research will be highlighted in several short talks chosen from the abstracts. The primary purposes of this conference are to promote discussion between scientists with common professional interests, including those from non-research-intensive colleges and universities, to foster the exchange of ideas from advanced aspects of their field, and to enable scientific collaborations to evolve in new directions.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Operational Summary  The Gordon Research Conference (GRC) on Plant &amp; Microbial Cytoskeleton was held at Proctor Academy in Andover, NH from August 14-19, 2016.   The meeting covered a variety of scientific topics and the content presented was highly rated by participants.    Conference Participants  The Conference was well-attended with 120 participants. Scientists from academia represented 97% of the participants while attendees from government accounted for 1% and those from industry totaled 2%. The meeting also attracted a strong mix of young investigators and senior scientists.  Students and post-docs accounted for 46% of all attendees. Approximately 42% of the participants at the 2016 meeting were women.     Conference Program  The Plant and Microbial Cytoskeleton Gordon Research Conference brought together researchers studying diverse systems to understand how the cytoskeleton helps to pattern cells and organisms, using quantitative and interdisciplinary approaches. By emphasizing work on walled organisms, this conference spaned prokaryotic to eukaryotic systems in order to uncover potential cross over and molecular similarities that have evolved to shape cells. Importantly by comparing the molecular mechanisms in these diverse systems, fundamental principles are emerging governing cellular morphogenesis and cell division. This conference brought together geneticists, cell biologists, physicists, computational biologists, and biochemists, all of whom use inter-disciplinary approaches to decipher the cytoskeletal basis of cell shape. Within cells the cytoskeleton controls many aspects of shape, and this conference focused on topics including cell wall construction, cell division, cell polarity, intracellular compartmentalization, membrane trafficking, and chromosome segregation. Presentations included cutting edge approaches such as quantitative imaging, including super-resolution microscopy, in vitro reconstitution of cellular systems and computational modeling. The program included approximately thirty talks from invited speakers, another 12-15 talks from submitted abstracts, and many lively poster sessions. The meeting provided scientists from all career stages with ample opportunities to present, meet, discuss and brainstorm.     Conference Feedback  Participants had an opportunity to provide feedback at the end of the Conference. The feedback collected from the meeting was extremely positive. Evaluations included numerous positive remarks regarding the wide variety of talks, the networking especially when in small groups, and that the length of the talks and conference itself allowed attendees to really discuss the material.   GRC would like to thank the National Science Foundation for its continued support of the meetings.  The contributions received from the National Science Foundation have been critical to the success of the conferences and are having a measurable impact in advancing the frontiers of science worldwide.
