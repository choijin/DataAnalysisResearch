<AbstractNarration>This project, led by Drs. William Isbell (Binghamton University) and Barbara Wolff (Montgomery College/Binghamton University), will evaluate comparatively based generalizations about the nature of urbanism, archaic and modern, through archaeological investigation of residential life within Huari, the prehistoric urban capital of the arguably earliest Andean Empire.  The PIs, along with U.S. and Peruvian colleagues, will excavate vernacular residential remains at Huari where preliminary research suggests an urban pattern that significantly deviates from prevailing models of cities.  Traditional models of urban centers, and particularly archaic capital cities, emphasize the presence of large socioeconomically and ethnically diverse populations.  Urban diversity is typically understood to include occupational specialization promoting economies of scale, enabled by freeing part of the population from agricultural production, since they are then supported by markets and interregional trade that provide one of the greatest advantages of city living.  Contrary to expectations however Huari exhibits no apparent civic center suitable for large public gatherings, no evidence of markets, and negligible evidence for social, economic and ethnic diversity.  Questions then arise: Is Huari an anomalous example of urban living?  How did residents experience urban life; and how did they manage the seemingly universal demands of living in a populous capital city?  Over 3 or 4 centuries of occupation, did Huari move closer to or further from traditional models of urbanism?  This project will contribute to understanding variation in urban life while training student archaeologists, involving the descendent community, and contributing to heritage management across a landscape with great potential for sustainable development.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This  project will excavate residential remains of everyday domestic life. US and Peruvian students will work alongside archaeologists experienced in architectural excavation/analysis, ceramic analysis, lithic analysis, paleoethnobotany, zooarchaeology, residue and trace element analysis, and data base design as they gather diverse lines of information illuminating patterns of social and economic diversity, from dietary preferences to specialized economic activities, to the spatial and social organization of households and neighborhoods.  Project data and results will be published online and in print.  Huari significantly reshaped the trajectory of Andean imperialism and urban life.  This project will supplement comparative data sets describing archaic cities while significantly expanding current knowledge of "the variable" as well as "the universal" in urban life.</AbstractNarration>

Understand daily residential life of commoners in the ancient city, including spatial organization, economic structure, social and religious identity, material culture, and how these changed as the city emerged, grew, and declined.  2.  Evaluate models of ancient urbanism based upon this in-depth case study:  does Huari seem to confirm or contradict prevailing models of archaic urban organization?  3.  Develop a chronology for the Huari city synchronizing architecture, occupation phases, and ceramic styles in absolute time.   4.  Train young archaeologists in field and laboratory methods, and help them to establish lasting professional networks.  5.  Promote cultural resource appreciation and conservation within the area that includes and surrounds Huari.  Demonstrate that monumental ruins lie just below the surface even in areas that lack standing walls on the modern surface, such that the area where stewardship is essential is much larger than what is currently recognized.   COVID-19 has unfortunately paralyzed research in Peru, especially laboratory analysis planned for summer 2020. Conclusions based on what was achieved before quarantines were enforced include:    First, the Patipampa archaeological remains are indeed residential and different from nearby ruins in what is referred to as Huari?s ceremonial area.  We clearly demonstrated that extensive stone architecture is present in a substantial area of Huari where no walls are evident on the surface.  Wall tops appear after removing 30 cm or so of topsoil destroyed to that depth by a millennium of cultivation.  Large subsurface walls and architectural compounds at Patipampa suggest that the contiguous zone of several hundred hectares across the modern highway, not currently classified as archaeological, is almost certainly a part of the ancient city, as indicated by proximity to Patipampa and similar surface morphology ? irregular terrain, loose rocks, dense growth of tuna cactus, and lots of ancient pottery.   Although Patipampa?s large compounds fulfilled residential purposes, they are not the small structures centered around a hearth that archaeologists often think of as typical nuclear family ?houses.? Despite the abundance of food remains, Patipampa?s buildings lack hearths, and other household features such as flat grinding stones. Elsewhere in Wari contexts, including the residential buildings at Moraduchayoq (Huari), and nearby Conchopata, hearths are also scarce.  The absence of elements diagnostic of small family households at Patipampa, and perhaps Wari urban contexts more generally, suggests the need to explore other kinds of residential social organization.    Another observation at Patipampa that contrasts with our earlier expectations for ancient urban growth is the paucity of ephemeral architecture.  We expected to find evidence of incremental construction in multiple episodes.  Instead it appears that builders at Patipampa generally initiated construction with clear plans, quickly constructing large compounds of high-quality material that required immense amounts of labor, materials and land.  They seem to have been intended as common or institutional housing for numerous people. Patipampa?s partially excavated compounds exhibit features common to Wari patio groups and niched halls, although none of the buildings seems to have contained multiple stories.  Deep deliberate fill and  successive floors indicate a long occupation, with deliberate filling of some rooms at the time of abandonment.       Negligible activity specialization is apparent at Patipampa, apart from one space that yielded small lithic drills suitable for jewelry production.  Very few agricultural implements, pottery production tools, or textile working implements were recovered.  Lithic debitage was sparse.   The fills in Patipampa?s buildings contain remarkably preserved organic remains.  Faunal remains are abundant, especially young camelid bones.  Wood, beans, quinoa and maize predominate in the botanical samples, each present in over 95% of analyzed soil samples.  Beans are more common than maize. Molle berries are common at Patipampa as well, and probably relate to production of chicha beer that may be brewed from maize, molle, quinoa and combinations thereof.  Despite the abundance and variety of botanical remains, residents do not seem to have engaged in farming.  A single hoe from Patipampa contrasts with more than a thousand from the nearby site of Conchopata.  The lack of grinding stones for food processing, and cooking hearths also raises questions about who supplied food to Patipampa, and where it was prepared.     Most of Patipampa?s stone tools are obsidian, with the vast majority sourced to the Quispisisa quarry.  Marine shell and ceramic iconography are also indicative of Patipampa?s integration into interregional trade networks.     Ceramics, primarily utilitarian, are the most abundant excavated artifacts. Diverse styles constitute an outstanding resource for refining Early Intermediate Period and Middle Horizon chronology.  The data recording system employed at Patipampa was the same used in prior research projects directed by Isbell, Wolff, and other Wari scholars, facilitating comparison of Patipampa data with those from other sites.  Finally, the project had a significant impact on international collaboration and student training, with more than 55 students and scholars participating from universities in the United States and Peru.
