<AbstractNarration>Over the last few years, the AI and Robotics communities have begun to realize that the proliferation of relatively cheap but sophisticated robot hardware, and the development of robust and reliable robotics techniques for performing low-level control and perception.  These developments have created a demand for integrative AI and robotics research to fulfill the potential of today's robots. The project aims at fostering cross-fertilization between these research fields through a series of activities at the AAAI-16 conference that will be held in Phoenix, Arizona from February 12th to 17th, 2016.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will include the following activities at the AAAI-16 conference: (1) participation of PhD students interested in integrative AI and Robotics research, (2) presentations by researchers showcasing current problems and solutions in robotics research, (3) a "spotlight" presentation by a young researcher showcasing new and exciting research in the field of robotics, (4) a robotics exhibition, and (5) an open house day, open for the general public.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project provided funds aimed at highlighting and promoting the application of AI techniques in robotics, and establishing and consolidating links between the AI and robotics community. These events occurred at AAAI-2016, the 30th AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence, held in Phoenix, Arizona, from February 12th to 17th, 2016.  The specific activities and goals for the robotics activities at the AAAI conference included:  Incorporating the former robotics track into the main AAAI program. Running an "integrated systems" special track. An Artificial Intelligence and Robotics fellowship program for graduate students from robotics labs who are interested in artificial intelligence research. Inviting talks from selected papers from a peer conference in robotics (Robotics: Science and Systems). An Artificial Intelligence and Robotics Early Career Spotlight. A Robotics Exhibition.   Each of these activities was successfully executed, except for the early career spotlight, which was combined with the Panel on Autonomous Flight.  The activities were overseen by AAAI Robotics Co-Chairs Professor George Konidaris of Duke University, and Doctor Nick Hawes of the University of Birmingham.   The major findings of this project were:  1)    There is substantial community interest in, and support of, bringing robotics researchers to AI venues (as indicated by the high number of applications to the AI Robotics Fellowships).  2)    There is substantial interest in bringing AI research into robotics.  These two findings suggest that the AAAI Robotics events should be an ongoing process.                Last Modified: 08/01/2016       Submitted by: George Konidaris]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
