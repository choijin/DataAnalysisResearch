<AbstractNarration>Under the supervision of Dr. Sally McBrearty at the University of Connecticut, Alison Mant-Melville will study variability in Middle Stone Age (MSA, 300-40 ka) stone tool technology to test for underlying behavioural patterning and the factors influencing technological trends. The MSA spans the emergence of behavioral complexity, the evolution of Homo sapiens, modern human replacement of contemporary hominin species, and dispersals within and out of Africa. Previous research shows the pattern and pace of MSA behavioural change to vary within and between regions. In East Africa, technological patterning is ambiguous and novel behaviors are temporally and spatially patchy. It is unclear to what extent stone tool behaviors represent changing social networks between groups or responses to fluctuating climate conditions, raw material and reduction differences, chance, or some interaction among these factors. The researchers will apply a novel and quantitative approach to studying the degree of shared material culture among East African MSA assemblages and to provide new insight into the patterns and processes shaping technological variability in space and time. Unravelling these issues is fundamental to answering questions of why, when, and where the modern human species began to display the complex and diverse behaviors that constitutes "humanity."  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As numerous, widespread, and enduring artefacts, stone tool assemblages are well placed to investigate these behavioral changes as they represent repeated, cumulative, and time-averaged technological behaviors that transcend generations. This project will support the doctoral training of the Co-PI (Alison Mant-Melville) and museum training for East African students. The methodology emphasizes comparability and reproducibility, which will facilitate the integration of the open-access data with studies in other time periods and regions. Given the public interest in modern human origins, the results will also be shared widely through conference presentations, journal articles, and public lectures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project draws from robust middle-range theory and insights from knapping experiments to connect knapping behaviors with the social transmission of technical knowledge. Multivariate statistical methods on cores, flakes, and tools from 15 open-air assemblages in a range landscape contexts and from four sub-regions of Ethiopia and Kenya will identify "clusters" of similar technological decisions at different stages of the knapping sequence. The results will be assessed against model expectations for the effects of different sources of variability. Paleoenvironmental and climatic data for the models will be sourced from published lake cores and site sedimentary contexts. Modelling cultural transmission of technological behaviors between assemblages can serve as a generalized proxy for the degree of social interaction between groups. Systematically demonstrating such relationships is an essential component in any holistic analyses of behavioral change and for assessing the dispersals, contractions, and evolutionary relationships of MSA populations.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The biological and behavioral evolution of our species, Homo sapiens, occurred during the middle-to-late Pleistocene in Africa. This period documents the earliest fossils of Homo sapiens, our species subsequent dispersals out of Africa, and widespread evidence for increasing diversity and complexity in human behaviors.  Stone tool technologies represent the most abundant evidence for the behavioral developments occurring during this time and demonstrate a marked increase in the range of variability in human technological behaviors. Understanding how this variability is patterned in space and time, and whether these behavioral developments are driven by changing environments, resource use, or cultural processes is essential to understanding the relationship between technology and human evolution. At present, neither the structure nor causes of behavioral variability are well understood. For East Africa, evidence for spatial or temporal patterns is ambiguous or overly generalized, as are explanations of the mechanisms that underlie behavioral variability.  This doctoral dissertation presents a theoretically-grounded method for studying variability in stone tool technologies from the East African Middle Stone Age (MSA, 300-40 ka) as well as testable models for assessing the role of different factors in driving observed technological patterns. This study examines 14 MSA assemblages from Ethiopia and Kenya and uses multivariate statistical methods to test:         a)  how variation in technological behaviors is organised into groups of related tool knapping decisions that represent independent components of technological variability;       b) spatial and temporal pattering in these components between assemblages that reflect ?clusters? of similar technological behaviors or shared material culture;      c) which causal factors underlie and drive these clusters and patterns.     Preliminary results of this work indicate that:           1) MSA technology is organised into multiple independent components of variability that reflect different phases in the production and maintenance of stone tools;       2) technological variability is multi-patterned and multi-causal, with different components of variability reflecting both constraints and flexibility in technological decision-making;       3) the nature of variability shifts during the middle-to-late Pleistocene from within-assemblage to between-assemblage variability. In the early MSA, humans display increased behavioral diversity but limited regionalization in behaviors. Early MSA groups flexibly apply a diverse range of technological behaviors from a broadly shared pool of options. In the later MSA, there is greater inter-assemblage variability that may reflect changes in human mobility strategies and the degree of social interaction between Pleistocene groups.    This project has helped to build a regional picture of how technological variability is organised in the MSA of East Africa and to understand what processes affect different aspects of technology. It also contributes to some of the ?big-picture? issues in human evolution research, such as the development of human innovation and adaptability, the tempo and mode of technological change, evolutionary relationships between groups of MSA humans, and the timing and pattern of human dispersals within and out of Africa.  The project has also resulted in a large, comprehensive, and methodologically rigorous database that will be made freely available online via the Open Context digital repository. This database will be relevant for researchers world-wide who are interested in interactions between technology, environment, culture, and human evolution.
