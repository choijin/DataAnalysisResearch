<AbstractNarration>This EArly-concept Grant for Exploratory Research (EAGER) grant supports fundamental research to develop scalable computational design tools to enable efficient and effective materials design. Computational material design (CMD), such as identifying optimal material microstructures to achieve desirable performance, receives a growing interest as sophisticated material designs can be subsequently realized using advanced processing techniques such as additive manufacturing. Conceptually, solving CMD problems involves iterative search for the best solutions in a problem space. Since the cost of solution searching is sensitive to the size of the space, the lack of cost-efficiency hampers the application of existing CMD approaches to complex material systems, where the goodness of the material design depends on numerous details of the microstructure on multiple length scales. The use of CMD tools will enable the discovery of critical microstructure patterns and the reduction of the dimensionality of the problem space. The research will lead to efficient microstructure design and validation for high performance structural materials with superior durability and structural health. Therefore, results from this research will benefit various U.S. industries, and its economy and society. The required seamless integration of material science, engineering design, manufacturing, and data science will help to broaden student participation and positively impact engineering education.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two core technical enablers for tractable CMD will be developed. These include (1) a generative statistical model that learns important local microstructure patterns at multiple length scales, and provides a two-way detail-preserving conversion between microstructures and their low-dimensional design representations; and (2) a cost-effective modeling framework for processing-structure-property mapping using physics-based simulations and active learning, to facilitate effective processing- and microstructure-level solution space exploration and optimal design. Key challenges will be addressed to enable scalable microstructure feature learning by taking into account the physical interpretability of the learned features. Novel deep network architectures and learning techniques will be investigated to this end. The statistical modeling of the processing-structure mapping will be achieved by a physics-based simulation tool where both phase morphology and crystallographic information are explicitly considered; the modeling of the structure-property mapping is achieved by a novel lattice-particle simulation method.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Through this EAGER project, the research team achieved the following goals and derived new research questions.    Microstructure patterns can be learned and used to generate new material samples. Material microstructures are usually represented as high-resolution images and are limited in quantity due to high acquisition costs through experiments. We developed generative models that learn the latent dimensions of microstructures, and create new microstructure samples that are morphologically and statistically similar to the limited samples. The developed model allowed us to bootstrap limited material samples to improve predictive structure-property models.    While deep networks outperform conventional models, they are not yet capable of capturing highly nonlinear structure-property mappings. The physics-based structure-property mapping often involves high computational cost, due to nonlinear constitutive models of material systems. We validated the hypothesis that deep learning architectures can outperform conventional nonlinear predictive models (such as Support Vector Regression) in predicting structure-property mappings. However, we found that even state-of-the-art deep convolutional neural networks cannot obtain the required prediction accuracy for material microstructure optimization.    Microstructure evolution of Ti64 during selective laser sintering is modeled and quantified. We developed a hybrid finite-element cellular-automaton model for microstructure evolution. This model is used for processing-structure mapping for Ti-6Al-4V (Ti64) alloy microstructures.    An efficient lattice particle simulation is developed for Ti64 fractual strength computation. A new atomic finite element method based on lattice particle is developed to replace an explicit solver to more efficiently compute Ti64 fracture strength. Nonlinear elasticity and plasticity constitutive models will be added to further refine the lattice particle model.            Last Modified: 09/10/2017       Submitted by: Yi Ren]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
