<AbstractNarration>Science DMZs (SDMZ) have been widely deployed in the Research and Education networking community and recognized&lt;br/&gt;as a global best practice for supporting cyberinfrastructure and big data applications. Despite innovations&lt;br/&gt;in performance, security, and management, the SDMZs remain focused on the&lt;br/&gt;support of big data projects and cyberinfrastructure. It remains difficult to create physical "disk&lt;br/&gt;to disk" or virtual "scientist to scientist" connections. Researchers are increasingly interested&lt;br/&gt;in an emerging class of hybrid services focused on turnkey, on-demand integration of private/public&lt;br/&gt;clouds, cyberinfrastructure, scientific resources, and high performance networks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The RECAST project will develop and deploy a regional based Software Defined Science&lt;br/&gt;DMZ (SD-SDMZ) as a mechanism to provide flexible edge services that include traditional data&lt;br/&gt;transfer functions. RECAST leverages state-of-the-art Cloud and Software-defined networking technologies to transform&lt;br/&gt;an SDMZ --  that was historically focused on high-speed data transfer -- into a Software Defined Infrastructure that offers&lt;br/&gt;compute and network services in a fully virtualized, programmable and orchestrated fashion. Built upon technologies similar to those&lt;br/&gt;used in modern data centers, this "cloudified SDMZ" will  provide a scalable, multi-tenant environment, where&lt;br/&gt;each user or user group can allocate dedicated resources and use the resources in an isolated,&lt;br/&gt;Independent, and elastic fashion. Embedding this resource in the University of Maryland Mid-Atlantic&lt;br/&gt;Crossroads regional network will allow the SD-SDMZ to leverage rich connectivity to advance&lt;br/&gt;cyberinfrastructure to provide these new and advanced services.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Regional Embedded Cloud for As-a-Service Transformation (RECAST) project established a new paradigm for providing regional based Software Defined Science DMZ (SD-SDMZ) as a service to campus researchers.  Analogous to the outsourcing of IT services to public cloud providers such as Amazon and Google, using regional software defined SDMZ-a-a-S is a method for satisfying the special cyberinfrastructure needs of campus researchers.  In addition, the proposed campus network SDN based access to SD-SDMZ-a-a-S is an alternative to "parallel networks" deployments for domain science specific requirements.    The RECAST project developed and deployed a regional based Software Defined Science DMZ (SD-SDMZ) as a mechanism to provide flexible edge services that include traditional data transfer functions. Built upon technologies similar to those used in modern data centers this "cloudified SDMZ" is able to provide scalable, multi-tenancy environment, where each user or user group can allocate dedicated resources and use the resources in an isolated, independent and elastic fashion. Embedding this resource in the University of Maryland Mid-Atlantic Crossroads regional network allows the SD-SDMZ to leverage rich connectivity to advance cyberinfrastructure to provide new and flexible services.  In addition, researchers are increasingly interested in an emerging class of hybrid services focused on turnkey, on-demand, integration of private/public clouds, cyberinfrastructure, scientific resources, and high-performance networks. In many use cases, the standard SDMZ architecture does not readily provide a mechanism to offer a flexible service set that can be defined with clear service and security demarcation points.  From user's perspective, this offers a fast and convenient mechanism to acquire high-end network, compute and storage services to integrate into end-to-end workflows. From campus IT perspective, they can easily adopt the SD-SDMZ-a-a-S as an integral part of their overall service portfolio via the well-defined service and security demarcation points. This capability was provided in the form of a Regionalized SDMZ where the facility and services.  By sharing software defined SDMZ as regional services, campus IT groups can offload the complex work of developing specialized services and trust it to a regional team that has pooled and dedicated expertise in providing high-performance, integrated services.   While the deployed MAX SD-SDMZ-a-S serves a specific set of mid-Atlantic region campuses and institutes, this new paradigm applies to many other regions that have a high speed Regional Optical Network (RON) shared by regional participants. This is especially useful for the majority of underserved campuses who cannot afford offering their own traditional SDMZ, or a software-defined full-service SDMZ. Even for the campuses with a competitive IT team, using a regional SDMZ under "as a service" model can provide benefits from an economic, resource utilization/sharing, and management perspective.
