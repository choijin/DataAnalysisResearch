<AbstractNarration>Our current standard of living is highly dependent upon the materials and energy we consume, including plastics, automotive fuels, and pharmaceuticals. One of the critical and practical ramifications of this standard of living is the necessity for separating raw materials that contain mixtures of chemicals into pure (or at least purer) forms to serve as feedstocks for chemical processes. As a result of the vast scale of our material and energy consumption, chemical separations are a major player in the world's primary energy budget: up to 5-10% of all energy use worldwide (or ~7.5 GJ per person every year) is devoted just to the separations of chemicals. This heavy energy burden for separation processes can be alleviated through the design of more efficient processes. For example, advanced membrane separators - based on molecular-scale resolution between small molecules - are at least 10 times more efficient than existing separation processes that rely on thermally-driven phase changes, opening the possibility of offsetting a substantial fraction of global energy use by bringing new technology to this world-scale problem.  The proposed research program seeks to advance energy efficient fluid separation processes critical to the global energy infrastructure. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This CAREER project will lay the scientific foundation for increased energy efficiency of chemical separations through organic solvent reverse osmosis (OSRO) that utilizes membranes to differentiate organic molecules based on size and shape. The project will probe the diffusion, sorption, and permeation mechanisms of molecular transport in OSRO membranes for candidate organic solvent molecules that simulate complex feed mixtures. Foundational structure-transport relationships for the new OSRO separation platform will be developed that will lead to rational design of membrane materials for organic liquid separations, new experiments and techniques for exploring the OSRO separations, all of which will lead to proof-of-principle that organic liquids can be separated via reverse osmosis.  The proposed research will lay the foundation for osmotic separations of organic liquids, which have the potential to revolutionize molecular separations in the chemical, bio-based chemical, and pharmaceutical industries.  One graduate student and two undergraduates will be trained in this project.  An educational outreach plan includes outreach efforts to directly involve female and underrepresented minorities in the laboratory, as well as lead on-going outreach efforts to these groups.  The project will engage  students in the creation of hands-on demonstrations regarding laboratory modules, energy consumption of chemical separations, and increase the impact of these demonstrations through on-line dissemination.</AbstractNarration>
