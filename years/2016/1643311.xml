<AbstractNarration>This grant will enable students to attend the Logic Mentoring Workshop (LMW 2016) which will be co-located with the ACM/IEEE Symposium on Logic in Computer Science, in New York City (USA), July 2016. The Logic in Computer Science (LICS) is the flagship conference in logic and semantics, and one of the premier conferences in all of computer science. The purpose of the workshop is to encourage undergraduate students, women, and underrepresented minorities to pursue and thrive in research careers both in logic/semantics specifically and in computer science generally. Funded students will benefit greatly from the opportunity to engage in the critical technical, professional, and social exchanges that both conferences foster.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award provides full or partial support for approximately 8 students to attend the mentoring workshop and the main conference. The funded students will attend LICS, a top conference where they will learn about current research problems and interact with leaders in the field, and the LMW workshop which will focus on mentoring and career advice specific to early-stage graduate students who aim to pursue research careers in the area of computer-aided verification. During distribution of the travel funds, preference will be given to applicants who are women or underrepresented minorities.</AbstractNarration>
