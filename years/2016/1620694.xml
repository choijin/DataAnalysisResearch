<AbstractNarration>This project supports a workshop hosted by the Air &amp; Waste Management Association (A&amp;WMA) entitled 2016 Atmospheric Optics: Aerosols, Visibility, and the Radiative Balance. The objective of the workshop is to provide a technical forum on advances in the scientific understanding of the effects of small particles on urban, regional, continental, and global scale haze and climate. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference will take a multipronged approach by encouraging scientific submissions (e.g., related to measurements, modeling, etc.) as well as submissions addressing regulatory and policy issues. Key sessions include one on black and brown carbon, since recent research has shown the importance of these particles for radiative forcing, and sessions related to the synergistic and increasing concerns of the effects of atmospheric nitrogen and carbonaceous material on haze, climate change, and nitrogen deposition on ecosystems. This NSF project supports the registration, travel, and lodging expenses for graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and junior faculty from universities and research institutes within the U.S.A. who would otherwise be unable to attend.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The A&amp;WMA sponsored Visibility Conferences have been held since 1970 on an every three of four year schedule.  The total number of participants was 176, which is increase over attendance for the last four conferences in the series.  This international conference provided a technical forum on advances in the scientific understanding of the effects of aerosols on urban, regional, continental, and global-scale haze and the radiative balance.  The conference tool a multipronged approach and addressed scientific topics related to measurements and modeling, as well as regulatory and policy issues.  There were sessions on black and brown carbon, as recent research has shown the importance of these particles for radiative forcing.  In addition, there were sessions related to the synergistic and increasing concerns of the effects of atmospheric nitrogen and carbonaceous material on haze, climate change, and nitrogen on ecosystems.  Conference learning was enhanced with a half day excursion and hike in Grand Teton National Park and a Night Sky Program.  The project support received from NSF assisted in bringing young professionals, graduate students, and post-doctoral fellows to the conference where they could benefit from the program and share their research.  The availability of the NSF funds was advertised to the appropriate potential attendees and recommendations on support were made by the individuals themselves, by session chairs, and by the conference committee.  As funds were limited, use of the funds gave priority to those who could attend with partial support.       Last Modified: 04/04/2017       Submitted by: Stephanie M Glyptis]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
