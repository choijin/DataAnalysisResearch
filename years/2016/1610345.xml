<AbstractNarration>Nontechnical description: This study examines the electrical properties of flexible, transparent and conductive polymers - materials of tremendous importance to a variety of devices including solar cells and portable displays.  Although such polymer films are composed of numerous individual molecules, their optical and electronic properties are extremely different from those of their isolated molecular constituents. The study aims to understand how the properties of these polymeric films emerge from their molecular building blocks. Specifically, it aims to elucidate the role fabrication conditions and interactions between molecules play in the emergence of electronic properties of ordered, crystalline polymer films. To explore this evolution, the project implements optical measurements of single polymer molecules, as well as molecular aggregates of increasing size. In this manner, electronic properties of polymers are examined over increasing scales, ranging from individual molecules through ordered thin films. The research team comprises graduate students and undergraduate researchers from diverse backgrounds. Participants receive training in materials science, chemistry, and photonics. An international collaboration serves to enhance research efforts as well as interdisciplinary training opportunities. In addition, a teaching module on photonic materials is being developed.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical description: Conjugated polymers (CPs) are technologically important due to their ability to conduct excitons and charge. Most device applications of these materials utilize thin polymeric films. This project entails the use of a recently developed spectroscopic tool to elucidate how thin film electronic behavior emerges from the properties of its individual molecular constituents, as well as from intermolecular interactions. Specifically, studies implement single-molecule spectroscopy to address the nature of polarons - charge carriers in conjugated polymers - whose electronic structure and distribution are critical for ensuring optimal device performance.  Experiments encompass spectroscopic studies on a range of length scales, from isolated polymers, through globules and domains, to multi-domain structures. In this manner it is possible to identify the critical length scale over which film-like behavior emerges, and the control parameters influencing the onset of this transition. The study utilizes ultra-high quality-factor optical microresonators as platforms for electronic and polarization spectroscopy, enabling the probing of charged and conducting CPs. Through studies of the interplay of optical properties, electronic structure, and molecular ordering it is possible to construct a detailed model of the electronic properties of photonic organic materials.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Professor Randall Goldsmith at the University of Wisconsin Madison and his team performed investigations into the properties of electronic and photonic materials.  Central to the effort was the use of single-particle photothermal microresonator spectroscopy, which allowed us to measure the absorption spectrum, which reports on electronic structure, of a single non-photoluminescent particle by using the microresonator as a sensitive thermometer to record the dissipated heat.   In the first group of experiments, we used our microresonator spectrometer to study the materials properties of a transparent conductive polymer, PEDOT:PSS, an important component in solar cells and display screens.  The key idea is to understand how the properties of polymer films derive from the properties of the individual polymer molecules.  We used our microresonator spectrometer to perform spectroscopy on single polymers, small clusters of polymers, larger clusters, increasing in size all the way to nascent thin films.  This study is the first report of the absorption spectrum of a single conductive polymer. We found the spectra of these individual polymer globules were always flat, revealing that, even at the level of a single polymer chain, the polymer is already behaving as a film.   We further used the polarization of our excitation to explore the ordering of the polymer globules.  Essentially, if the molecules are oriented parallel to the polarization then they will absorb light and dissipate heat, and if the molecules are perpendicular to the polarization, they will not absorb light and no heat will be dissipated.  By exploring the polarization dependence, we were able to assess rotational ordering, and see how this ordering changes as a function of size.  We found that PEDOT:PSS polymer globules are very rotationally ordered, an unexpected result.  The fact that we found more rotational ordering than had been revealed in various x-ray studies suggests that the rotational ordering persists over much larger length scales covering multiple polymer domains.  This is a second major finding.   In a follow-up study, we then examined how this rotational ordering in single polymer globules changes as a function of various post-treatments.  These post-treatments, such as application of solvents or acids, are known to increase the film conductivity.  We were able to assess how solvent treatment affected the ordering of individual globules.  Specifically, we found that globules became more ordered.  However, rather than the origin of this reordering coming from the reorientation of individual chains, we determined that the dominant effect was the dissolution of large domains.  Taken together, these studies provide important mechanistic details on the physical and electronic structure of a technologically important material.   In a second group of experiments, done in collaboration with David Masiello at the University of Washington, we studied the absorption spectrum of individual gold nanorods sitting on the microresonator.  In these experiments, the gold nanorod?s plasmon, the collective oscillation of the mobile electrons in the gold, strongly interacts with photonic modes of the optical microresonator.  We studied this interaction as we changed the energy of the plasmon, and found that the hybridized system can demonstrate properties superior to the component system, including allowing stronger light-matter interactions.   In a follow up study, we examined the fate of light scattered into the microcavity via the plasmon and then outcoupled into a fiber optic.  By simultaneously fitting the scattered spectra and the absorption spectra, we were able to extract rate constants associated with all of the various energy transfer channels of the system, thus painting a picture of the hybridized system of unprecedented detail.  These studies will help the community understand how to use photonic materials to mediate interaction between quantum systems, an important step for quantum information and computing.   This project has helped to support 2 PhD students (including one woman).  These students received a highly interdisciplinary training experience that included elements of photonics, optics, nanofabrication, spectroscopy, and materials science.  Students were also able to participate in an internship in Germany.   Students and PI were also involved in activities to broaden participation in STEM, including the PEOPLE (Pre-college Enrichment Opportunity Program for Learning Excellence) program where they helped prepare science lessons on photolithography, a critical tool for electronics, for low-income or STEM under-represented highschool students. Supported students also contributed to the Wisconsin Science Festival, a curiosity driven science festival for all ages.
