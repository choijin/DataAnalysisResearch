<AbstractNarration>Many networking protocols have been designed without security in mind, and many cryptographic schemes have been designed without practical deployments in mind. Moreover, most of security-enhanced communication protocols still lack the provable-security treatment and hence the security guarantees. This project aims at bridging the gap between protocol design, implementation, deployment, and security guarantees by developing a novel general security framework that facilitates the provable-security analyses of practical networking protocols. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project has an interdisciplinary approach as it combines concepts from applied cryptography and algorithms with implementation and empirical analyses to provide a unifying framework for studying and developing secure communication protocols.  This joint design effort yields both new cryptographic foundations and fundamentally secure networking protocols.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    Secure communication is vital for all applications running on Internet. This communication is facilitated by network protocols. However, many network protocols have been designed without security in mind, and several security-enhanced communication protocols lack the provable-security treatment and hence the security guarantees.   Fundamental components that ensure secure communication over the Internet are TCP, TLS and QUIC protocols, as well as the X509 standard for public key certificates. Understanding the security of these components is essential for ensuring the security of all activities that require Internet communication.  This project studied the security of QUIC and TLS protocols, in combination with the underlying communication UDP or TCP. It created new security models, it analyzed these protocols under these models and showed what security quarantees they provide. It also studied them from a practical perspective, examining implementations and deployments with the goal of finding vulnerabilities.   Results from this project had a practical impact as these protocols are not theoretical proposals, but already deployed protocols that our society relies on a regular basis. Work resulted from this grant was awarded  the 2016 IETF/IRTF Applied Networking Research Prize.  Studying these problems required expertise in networking, network security, and cryptography. This project created synergies between these areas and contributed to the education of several students in the areas of cryptography and network security.
