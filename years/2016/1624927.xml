<AbstractNarration>This project is integrating scientific research in the Arctic with education and outreach, with a strong central focus on engaging undergraduate students and visiting faculty from groups that have had little involvement in Arctic science to date.  Science and society in the United States will be stronger in the long-term if the scientific workforce more closely reflects the racial, ethnic, and cultural diversity of its residents.  The Arctic research community currently does not.  Of the Principal Investigators funded by NSF's Arctic programs in the past five years, only 1% were African American, Hispanic, Native American, or Alaska Native.  This project is catalyzing change in these demographics by engaging faculty from Minority Serving Institutions (MSIs) and a diverse group of undergraduate students in cutting-edge Arctic research and providing them encouragement, mentoring, and opportunities to continue pursuing Arctic studies in subsequent years.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The central element of the project is a month-long research expedition to the Yukon River Delta in Alaska.  The expedition provides a deep intellectual and cultural immersion in the context of an authentic research experience that is paramount for "hooking" students and keeping them moving along the pipeline to careers as Arctic scientists.  The overarching scientific issue that drives the research is the vulnerability and fate of ancient carbon stored in Arctic permafrost (permanently frozen ground).  Widespread permafrost thaw is expected to occur this century, but large uncertainties remain in estimating the timing, magnitude, and form of carbon that will be released when thawed.  Project participants are working in collaborative research groups to make fundamental scientific discoveries related to the vulnerability of permafrost carbon in the Yukon River Delta and the potential implications of permafrost thaw in this region for the global climate system.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The primary goals of the Polaris Project are to 1) advance scientific understanding of the rapidly changing Arctic, 2) train the next generation of Arctic scientists, and 3) engage the public.  An overarching long-term objective of the Polaris Project is to diversify the Arctic research community.  To achieve these goals, the Polaris Project involves a diverse group of students in authentic, cutting-edge Arctic research and provides ongoing mentoring and guidance as their careers advance.   The Polaris Project was first funded by the National Science Foundation in 2007.  The first field season was 2008, when a group of faculty and undergraduate students traveled to the Siberian Arctic.  Fieldwork continued in the Siberian Arctic until the Polaris Project's field research was moved to Alaska's Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta in 2017.  Of the 35 students who participated in the Polaris Project expeditions 2017, 2018, and 2019, 70% were female and 56% were from racial and ethnic groups that are underrepresented in STEM.  A remarkable number were awarded prestigious fellowships and scholarships, including four NSF Graduate Research Fellowships and a Fulbright Fellowship.  Mentoring of these students continues, as the majority are in, or will soon be in, graduate school.  The metrics listed above demonstrate the success of the Polaris Project during the period of this grant.  The true impact of the Polaris Project will emerge over time, as this diverse group of Polaris alumni advance through the ranks of the Arctic Research Community.
