<AbstractNarration>Overview&lt;br/&gt;One of the major intellectual achievements of the 20th century was the development of the Standard Model (SM) of particle physics. This model succeeded in classifying all of the elementary particles known at the time into a hierarchy of groups having similar quantum properties. The validity of this model to date was recently confirmed by the discovery of the Higgs boson at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. However, the Standard Model as it currently exists, leaves open many questions about the universe. These include why matter dominates over anti-matter in the universe, the values of the masses of the fundamental constituents, the quarks and the leptons, the size of the mixings among the quarks, and separately among the leptons, and the properties of dark matter. Most explanations require the presence of new forces, which we call Beyond the Standard Model Physics (BSM). One of the promising techniques to look for BSM physics is to make precision measurements using standard particles like electrons and muons. One technique, in particular, is to make very precise measurements of the Electric Dipole Moment (EDM) of electrons or muons. To do the next generation of EDM measurements will require advances in accelerator techniques and this award will  focus on those advancements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;Direct EDM searches using all-electric storage rings, with measurements of stored electrons, protons, or radioactive nuclei are being considered. Historically only a very small number of all-electric rings have been constructed and none at the scale envisioned for these dedicated EDM measurements. Thus, the research enabled here will provide essential insights into the feasibility of using larger-scale high-gradient electric field devices for these important measurements. The success of the EDM experimental procedure is strongly connected to the ability to create a suitably robust storage ring that can perform the desired functions necessary for successful spin precession measurements of intense beams at the accuracies required. Through this award, studies will be performed in pursuit of storage ring arrangements and parameter sets suitable for use in EDM measurements. For verification of results, comparisons will be made, where applicable, to beam conditions being created for a present-day EDM measurement of the muon system. This award will provide students of accelerator science the opportunity to engage with expert members of the field to acquire first-hand experience in the design and specification process for relevant storage ring systems for future EDM experiments, yielding a more experienced workforce upon exit from the university program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;Accelerator science will lead the way to future accelerators for virtually every branch of science and for a broad spectrum of applications to meet national needs, and collaboration between national laboratories and research universities is a natural approach to attract, train and educate a new generation of accelerator scientists and engineers. The learning curve for scientists to cross into the applied field of accelerator science is often long, and hence acquiring practical skill and knowledge as graduate students will provide a highly desired early-experience for future members of the much-needed workforce. The training and experiences enabled through this award will ultimately reach into many areas of research as the workforce expands into other technical disciplines.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Precision searches for a non-zero electric dipole moment (EDM) of the muon, proton, electron and other charged particles are being pursued using polarized charged particle beams, containing them within storage rings tuned to the particle's "magic momentum" using magnetic and/or electric fields, and monitoring the evolution of the polarization of the beam distribution. At the so-called magic momentum, the influence of external electric fields on the spin direction, as viewed in the particle's rest frame, are null to lowest order such that only magnetic fields should cause spin precession. Operation at the muon's magic momentum has enabled the highly-accurate determination of the anomalous magnetic dipole moment (MDM) of that particle to unprecedented accuracy, along with an upper limit to its EDM. Utilizing the above technique developed for the muon MDM measurements, designs are being considered for storage rings to search for and directly measure the EDM values of muons and other subatomic particles at unprecedented accuracies. For measurements of the EDM of the proton or the electron to high accuracy, it is envisioned to use all-electric-field storage rings in order to abate the precession of the particle spin due to its large magnetic moment, especially for the case of the proton. Though the fundamental principles of this method are well founded, the relevant accuracies of the accelerator hardware design and the sensitivities of the measurements to construction errors and particle beam quality are not well understood at present.   The larger part of this project looked at the design of an all-electric storage ring.  The number of all-electric storage rings built to date has been very small.  The most significant project was that of an all-electric ring constructed at Brookhaven National Laboratory in the late 1950s for the study of transition crossing prior to the construction of the Alternating Gradient Synchrotron (AGS).  While studies and layouts have been described in various papers regarding EDM storage rings using all-electric fields, the sensitivities of the alignment and field distortions have not been systematically studied until the introductory studies of this project.  Many alignment studies of storage ring components investigate the overall alignment of rigid elements (typically steel electromagnets), while in the all-electric ring the independent alignment of high voltage plates will be important.  The study has found that alignment errors on the scale of 100 microns for each independent high-voltage plate is highly relevant, though it is anticipated that steering correction elements will allow for smooth operation of the overall device.   Other portions of this effort have looked at aspects of the polarization of the incoming particle beam as well as the reduction of its momentum spread.  As the precession rate of the particle's spin will depend upon the momentum of the particle, a smaller distribution of the momenta of the particles will yield a more precise measurement, as will a more highly polarized incoming beam.  Optimization of polarization at the end of a beam line through the efficient use of beam optical (focusing) systems was investigated and parameterized.  Also, by passing a beam of particles through a wedge-shaped material located in a region of space where the beam is spread out according to its momentum spread, the overall spread of momentum can be reduced.  Studies of the optimization of such a system for a muon beam were performed and shown to have the capacity to reduce the momentum spread by a significant factor (by tens of percent) while having no significant effect on the polarization.   A major purpose of the grant has been to provide direct training of tomorrow's particle beam physicists. Students on the grant have been able to work with experts in the field who have many years of experience with accelerator physics and design.  Whereas the electron and proton EDM searches are longer-term, with computational and hardware development continuing elsewhere within the community, advantage has been taken of the team of scientists participating in the Muon g-2 experiment at Fermilab in which the muon EDM and MDM signals are being measured.  The training and experiences enabled through this grant ultimately will reach into other areas of research as a portion of the student participants have moved into other technically related disciplines.
