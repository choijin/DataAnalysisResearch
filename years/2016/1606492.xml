<AbstractNarration>This award is made as part of the FY 2016 Mathematical Sciences Postdoctoral Research Fellowships Program. Each of the fellowships supports a research and training project at a host institution in the mathematical sciences, including applications to other disciplines, under the mentorship of a sponsoring scientist. The title of the project for this fellowship to Nicholas Edelen is "Regularity and free-boundary interaction of mean curvature flow and constant mean curvature surfaces." The host institution for the fellowship is Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and the sponsoring scientist is Tobias Colding.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Work supported by this grant focused on singularity analysis of minimal surfaces and mean curvature flow.  Minimal surfaces are models of static soap films, and mean curvature flow models moving soap films.  More generally, they model the geometry of interface boundaries in which energy is proportional to area.  Minimal surfaces have a long and rich history, and have found applications and motived developments in several different fields (including, e.g. general relativity, partial differential equations, knot theory).  Like the soap films they model, in general minimal surfaces will have a ``singular set'' where they are not smooth.  For example, just like the bubbles one observes in their bathtub, one can have triple-junctions or tetrahedral-junctions where smooth pieces meet (see attached figure).  Significant amount of research is devoted to understanding the size and nature of the singular set.  Below are some highlights of results obtained under this grant:   - With M. Colombo and L. Spolaor, the PI proved that in an n-dimensional cluster of soap bubbles, then away from a small (n-3)-dimensional set, this cluster locally looks like planes, triple-junctions, or tetrahedral-type junctions (higher-dimensional analogues of the pictures attached).  Our work was an important part of E. Milman and J. Neeman's solution to the so-called ``Guassian multi-bubble conjecture,'' which characterized sets with optimal boundary area, measured in a certain weighted sense.   - One common method of area-minimization give rise to soap films with only (n-7)-dimensional singularities (so, no triple junctions).  L. Spolaor and the PI proved a structure theorem for minimal surfaces near so-called Simons' cones, which are the most well-known examples of singularities.   - The PI proved an explicit (``isoperimetric-type'') bound on the (n-7)-dimensional area of the singular set in terms of the boundary geometry, for a certain subclass of the above-mentioned surfaces.   - Soap films or bubbles which are free to move along some barrier, such as a bathtub or sink, will meet this barrier at right-angles.  This is called a free-boundary condition.  With C. Li the PI proved a regularity theorem for free-boundary minimal surfaces when the barrier is not smooth.  For example, we addressed the nature of a soap bubble which is attached to a sharp corner of one's bathtub.  Our work was an important part of C. Li's work on a higher-dimensional version of Gromov's ``dihedral rigidity theorem,'' which characterizes scalar curvature of a region in terms of the geometry of geodesic cubes.   - With M. Ivaki, R. Haslhofer, and J. Zhu, the PI also investigated the dynamics of soap films with a free-boundary condition.  We proved results on the size and nature of singularities that arise in certain free-boundary mean curvature flows.  For example, we addressed the nature of a moving soap bubble attached to a bathtub.  In addition to the above listed research, while supported by this grant PI coorganized the geometry seminar at MIT, supervised an undergraduate research project, wrote and disseminated notes on recent (and, largely, poorly understood) results and techniques, and refereed 14 papers for 11 journals.
