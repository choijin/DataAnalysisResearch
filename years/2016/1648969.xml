<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is significant. The research results will address the resolution and detection speed requirements of autonomous driving in complex environments such as urban scenarios. The next major revolution of transportation is undoubtedly autonomous driving which will bring great potential benefits in terms of safety, mobility and related productivity. With the proposed advanced sensing system and intelligent algorithms, it is expected that future autonomous driving vehicle could eliminate mistakes due to human error which is the main cause of traffic accidents. Moreover, it may lead to reduced traffic jam, higher energy efficiency and much enhanced mobility for the aging and disabled population. The proposed effort will also have great commercial impact. In 2015, the global market size of automotive millimeter wave (30 ? 300 GHz) radars hit about $1.936 billion; it is expected to reach $2.46 billion in 2016 and $5.12 billion in 2020, having the most remarkable growth potentials in the field of electronic products. In addition, the expected research outcome may lead to advancement in a number of important market sectors including wireless communication, sensing, mobile internet, assistive technology, and additive manufacturing. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project attempts to realize a high performance automotive radar using 3D printed Luneburg Lens for autonomous driving. The existing automotive radar products do not have enough angular coverage and resolution for classifying and locating dense targets, which is critical for achieving autonomous driving. As a result, the current autonomous driving tests utilize LiDAR systems which are expensive and less reliable than radar especially under certain conditions such as heavy rain, snow, fog, smoke and sandstorms. Compared to conventional manufacturing techniques, this project utilizes 3D printing technique, which is much more convenient, fast, inexpensive and capable of implementing millimeter wave Luneburg lenses. Based on the Luneburg lens?s ability to form multiple beams with high gain and broadband behavior, novel automotive radar will be designed by mounting radar detectors around the lens. Moreover, with wide bandwidth and natural beam forming capabilities of Luneburg lens, an adaptive sensing approach is proposed to improve the scanning efficiency and avoid interference from nearby or intruder radar systems. With these proposed approaches, the objective is to achieve a high performance and low cost millimeter-wave sensing system which will be suitable for autonomous transportation applications.</AbstractNarration>

For autonomous transportation to become a reality, sensors with high performance, high reliability and affordability are necessary. A number of sensor technologies have been considered for self-driving applications, including Radar, Lidar, ultrasound, and camera based sensors. However, none of the existing systems are adequate for autonomous driving in complicated scenarios such as urban areas due to lack of resolution, sensitivity, all-weather capability as well as affordability. This NSF funded STTR Phase I project focused on developing a high performance and low cost radar that would be suitable for future autonomous driving applications. All innovative concepts and key radar performance indicators have been successfully demonstrated in the Phase I project. Figure 1 shows a photo of the demonstrated Lunewave radar prototype.</p> <p class="Default"><strong><em>Intellectual Merit Outcome:</em></strong> The Lunewave radar is enabled by a novel 3D printed lens antenna called Luneburg lens. Although well-known and highly desired for many wireless sensing and communication applications, there are no 3D Luneburg lenses commercially available for operation above 10 GHz due to challenges in fabrication. The Lunewave team has developed a design and fabrication methodology for realizing a3D Luneburg lens using additive manufacturing (3D printing) technology. Compared to conventional manufacturing techniques, the approach using 3D printing technique is much more convenient, fast, inexpensive and capable of implementing millimeter wave (mmW, 30 &ndash; 300 GHz) lenses.</p> <p class="Default">As the &ldquo;eyes&rdquo; of the radar sensor, several 3D spherical Luneburg lenses have been successfully realized and demonstrated with satisfactory performance.

Figure 3 shows the schematic of the implemented radar sensor. In addition, smart algorithms capable of faster detection compared to conventional radar algorithms as well as interference mitigation have been developed and integrated with the radar hardware. The final radar sensor prototype has been characterized and proof-of-concept of all the important design parameters has been validated. For example, the demonstrated radar detection distance of up to 350 meters, 180-deg field of view and up to 1-deg of angular resolution represent a considerable improvement in performance compared to the conventional automotive radars on the market. Figure 4 shows an example of a measured radar image in an external environment (i.e., a parking lot).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p class="Default"><strong><em>Broader Impacts Outcome:</em></strong> The outcome of this project has significant broader impact to the advancement of science and engineering and human society. The research results pave the way to address the sensor technology requirements (e.g., detection distance, accuracy and speed) of autonomous driving in complex environments such as urban scenarios which may enable autonomous driving in the near future. The project outcome will potentially bring great benefits to the society in terms of transportation safety, mobility and related productivity. For example, over a million fatalities occur in traffic accidents every year around the world and the majority of these accidents are due to human error. With the radar sensor technology developed in this project, it is expected that future autonomous vehicles could eliminate mistakes due to human error.
