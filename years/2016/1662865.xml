<AbstractNarration>Foreseen disasters, such as hurricanes, snowstorms and droughts, can be detected several days prior to their landfall. To ameliorate the consequences of these disasters, humanitarian and governmental agencies can utilize forecast information to conduct preparedness activities. However, one unresolved challenge is to obtain accurate estimation of spatial-temporal heterogeneous supply demand for supply prepositioning. To tackle this challenge, this research plans an approach which integrates data from social media and simulation to predict demand for humanitarian supplies. Resulting models and prototype tools are expected to contribute to support for improving communication with the public, for optimizing supply prepositioning strategies, and for facilitating decision-making to help prevent or ameliorate the impacts of extreme disasters. This research will also lead to new educational modules and software useful for teaching undergraduate and graduate students how to design, analyze and implement a humanitarian logistics system. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will investigate the potential for integrating social media data and agent-based simulation to reduce uncertainty associated with the demand for post-disaster relief supplies. This project will develop a new social sensing approach based on the integration of social media analysis and agent-based simulation. Trustworthy information will be extracted from social media by a new spatio-temporal Bayesian method. Second, this project will build a new forecast-driven multi-commodity supply prepositioning model that incorporates Markovian and decision theoretic perspectives within a stochastic optimization framework. Third, the outcome of the supply prepositioning will be realized by social delivery, an emerging delivery scheme that leverages delivery power from both fleet and volunteers' vehicles. Different optimization decomposition techniques will be examined and developed to handle the large-scale nature of the considered problem. To test the validity of the approaches, a range of case studies will be conducted.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Collaborative Research: Advancing Supply Prepositioning for Emergency Preparedness by Social Sensing  The major goal of this project was to investigate the potential of using social media and agent-based simulation as an integrated tool to reduce demand uncertainty and enhance delivery efficiency for dynamic supply prepositioning in preparation for a foreseen disaster (e.g. hurricane). The specific goal led by the University of Arizona team was to devise robust human behavior models in social networks with detailed expressions of individual decision-making processes and of the interactions among people. Another major goal was to test and demonstrate the proposed modeling approach and models for a real or realistic disaster data.  While the research team at SUNY Buffalo (lead institution) focused more on the mathematical programming approach, the research team at the University of Arizona focused more on the simulation-based approach to address the efficient disaster management strategy against severe natural disasters.  The outcomes of this research (algorithms, simulation and mathematical programming models, case studies used for demonstration, agent-based modeling framework) are expected to advance our operational ability to establish an efficient disaster management strategy against severe natural disasters to mitigate and relieve their catastrophic consequences. The research outcomes have contributed to the literature (journal papers, conference proceedings, PhD dissertation, MS report) of modeling a disaster situation by considering individual decision-making processes and the interactions among people explicitly. In addition, the algorithmic tools and agent-based simulation methods developed in this research are expected to promote computational science, which is a key to understand today’s complex, social, and economical world.  This project has contributed to workforce development. Four graduate students at the University of Arizona participated in the project and were introduced to the concept of using highly detailed agent-based simulation model in evaluation of disaster management strategies.  In addition, a prototype simulation system developed for disaster management has been demonstrated to the high school students via a summer engineering academy at the University of Arizona.  Finally, the developed agent-based modeling framework can be potentially applied to other disciplines involving complex systems of systems, such as extended manufacturing enterprise, infrastructures (energy, water, food, and transportation), and homeland security.
