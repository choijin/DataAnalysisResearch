<AbstractNarration>There is extensive empirical documentation about community economies alternative forms of economic organization such as cooperatives and social enterprises worldwide, but much remains to be learned about their emergence, the factors that make them more or less successful, and the prospects for them to be extended and scaled up from the local level. This research will examine how community economies come into being and become more or less sustainable in contexts where conventional forms of production, consumption, distribution, and marketing are prone to chronic destabilization. The project is expected to advance theories and concepts in economic geography and development studies by revealing the everyday relations that hold these enterprises together, the resources necessary for their success and resilience, the constraints and challenges facing them, and the processes that affect their stability. Its results will identify points of intervention for policy-makers, planners, and scholars; particularly those hoping to establish, sustain, and strengthen programs that seek to improve the well being and resilience of disadvantaged communities. The project's findings will be published in academic outlets, distributed through popular media sources, and presented in local and international conferences and workshops. Local informants will play a central role throughout the project, both during the field research and in the development and dissemination of research findings. The project will also be significant in supporting the training of the doctoral student. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study utilizes a novel conceptual framework that draws on the diverse literatures on community economies, assemblage theory, and actor-network theory to answer three sets of questions: 1) How do differences between actors affect the development of a community economy and the everyday production, marketing, distribution, and other practices through which it functions? 2) How do resources and constraints affect these practices and the relations among the actors participating in community economies? 3) What makes actors participate in a community economy and what factors and processes contribute to its stabilization or resilience? This study will examine community economies in east and southeast Turkey, a region that has faced long-standing socioeconomic hardships and will study three community economy initiatives; a worker cooperative, a consumer cooperative, and a community branding initiative. The project will be situated in a predominantly Kurdish city in eastern Turkey, where a comparative analysis of three case studies will be conducted. Data will be collected through interviews, focus groups, and direct observations, and then analyzed qualitatively.</AbstractNarration>

The purpose of the research was to understand the relations and socio-spatial processes (e.g., networks, spaces, and places) that shape the emergence and resilience of community economies - alternative forms of economic organization (e.g., firms, markets) that prioritize issues of justice, equality, and solidarity over profits, accumulation, and growth.   In examining community economies in the Kurdish Region, the project addressed three major research questions: 1) How do the actors that constitute a community economy and their relations shape the community economy practices?, 2) How do resources and constraints that are provided by a community economy affect the relations among the constituent actors and the community economy practices?, 3) How are community economies stabilized or destabilized over time and space?  Answers to such questions are critical in order to better understand how and why alternative forms of economic organization come into being, persist, or fail, particularly in contexts marked by instability and violence (e.g., the Kurdish Region).    During fieldwork, Turker traveled to five cities in Turkey?s Kurdish region and conducted semi-structured interviews with 51 research participants.

With the data collected through these observations, he further identified the key actors that constituted these community economies, evaluated their relations and interactions, and developed additional insights regarding how community-economy initiatives are rendered resilient despite political and economic turmoil in the Kurdish region.    The research findings were and are being disseminated in several ways.  First, Turker made presentations to each of the case-study cooperatives.  These presentations enabled him to present and discuss his preliminary observations and research findings with the participants who provided vital feedback that has subsequently been incorporated into the reports and articles coming out of the project.  Second, findings are being disseminated through peer-reviewed academic journals and conference presentations, as well as popular outlets that cater to more generalist audiences. Turker and (PI) Murphy have an article in final review for publication in Progress in Human Geography, and Turker co-authored another article in Turkish, published by Bianet (an online media platform).
