<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is the development of a tool to accelerate the discovery of new autoantibody biomarkers for the early detection and personalized treatment of human diseases.  Autoantibody biomarkers are broadly used to diagnose a variety of conditions, such as autoimmune disorders, infectious diseases and cancers. However, the limited reproducibility, cost and sensitivity of current autoantibody profiling methods frustrate the discovery of new biomarkers to improve management of these diseases. A cost-effective autoantibody profiling platform that is highly sensitive and robust could reveal changes in the autoantibody repertoire that might have been missed by current methods. Such a tool would serve as an invaluable pipeline for the discovery of new biomarkers, augmenting the ability to detect, treat and understand numerous diseases. In the $7.4 Billion/yr biomarker discovery array market, the proposed tool, sold as a service or as micro-arrays kits for client use, meets must-have needs of several customers, including biopharmaceutical companies seeking for new disease targets, improving clinical trials and academic groups pursuing better understanding of human biology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop a highly multiplexed and sensitive autoantibody biomarker profiling tool to expedite biomarker discovery. The proposed approach uses agglutination-PCR, a novel technique developed at UC Berkeley and Stanford.  Agglutination-PCR detects autoantibodies in the solution-phase to ensure proper folding of antigen probes while leveraging the sensitivity and multiplex power of standard qPCR instruments. This project employs an innovative synthetic strategy to prepare and optimize a large panel of probes at low cost. While a traditional synthetic route would take up to 3 months, the proposed strategy could reduce the time down to one week. In addition, the probe library for autoantibody detection will be validated using banked serum/plasma from healthy patients or patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). This experiment will serve as a powerful proof-of-principle, as SLE displays many distinct autoantibodies that are challenging to detect with other methods. The analytical sensitivity and reproducibility of the proposed product will be compared to standard protein microarrays. The platform will be tested to ensure reproducibility and ease-of-use. The probe library and protocols will function as a minimum viable product and the prototype for applications in other diseases.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[Project Outcomes Report: Enable Biosciences Phase I SBIR Award ID 1622257 Development of an ultrasensitive, high-throughput autoantibody discovery platform using agglutination-PCR (ADAP)  Medical research and clinical diagnostics depend on technologies that detect markers of disease within blood. Currently used methods can return incorrect results, erroneously detecting the presence of disease markers in healthy patients or missing indicators of disease in sick patients.  As medicine is enriched through "big data" and precision technologies, diagnoses are increasingly not made from the presence of single markers, but rather from a collective signature of many individual markers all contributing to an advanced diagnostic algorithm. Current methods lack the ability to detect multiple markers simultaneously in a fast, sensitive and inexpensive way, hampering progress towards improved diagnostics and better health outcomes.  With this Phase I award, Enable Biosciences advanced the development and validation of Antibody Detection by Agglutination-PCR (ADAP), an improved biomarker detection method. ADAP addresses many of the impediments of current immunoassays with an ultrasensitive, highly specific approach that also provides a high degree of multiplexing - the ability to test for many different diseases in a single sample at once. This capacity has the potential to accelerate lifesaving research and the development of powerful precision diagnostics.  In this Phase I project we successfully fulfilled all of the Aims and Objectives set forth in our original proposal.  First, we developed a fast manufacturing process for the core ADAP reagents and then successfully validated these reagents for performance using both a model system and real patient samples.  ADAP consistently showed incredible sensitivity with the ability to detect down to 0.1 attomoles of antibody (100-1,000 fold improved sensitivity over existing methods). These advantages were observed both for detecting single and multiple markers at once.  Finally, we analyzed 100 patient serum samples for the presence of 39 unique markers for a variety of autoimmune conditions. These data were compared to results obtained using a commercially-available gold standard assay methodology. Multiplex ADAP revealed biomarker signatures that strongly corresponded with known signatures, while at the same time showing greatly enhanced sensitivity (100-1,000x) and improved specificity. This critical attribute will help decrease the troublesome false positive rate observed with existing commercial technology.  These results strongly position Enable Biosciences and its multiplex ADAP technology for imminent commercialization. In Phase II we will seek support to further validate the technology for diagnostic applications and prepare both reagent kit and robotic platform options for commercial sales to meet the needs of our lead customers that include Stanford University and UCSF.
