<AbstractNarration>This Research Experiences for Teachers (RET) in Engineering and Computer Science Site, entitled Engaging Educators in Renewable EnerGY (ENERGY) at Georgia Southern University (GSU) aims to develop a diverse, competitive, and nationally engaged teacher workforce through activities and projects performed alongside graduate and undergraduate students, as well as faculty and industry advisors. The focus is on high-need rural areas in southeastern Georgia, in partner counties, that collectively are home to high populations of underrepresented minorities, economically disadvantaged and special needs students.  Target participants include those who are from historically underrepresented groups in the STEM disciplines and those who teach in schools characterized by a high level of poverty and/or a high percentage of minority learners. ENERGY was specifically chosen as the research theme because it is a current national topic of direct interest to students and teachers, and it can be easily embedded in the high school STEM curriculum.  In addition, there are regional industries involved in hands-on, cutting edge engineering research projects in energy-related fields. The research topics for the RET participants in ENERGY include: renewable and alternative energy (solar, wind, biofuels, thermoelectric), development of sensors and controls for energy applications, biologically-inspired wind turbines and solar collectors.  As part of their engineering and scientific research projects, the teachers will be linked with real-world applications through collaborations with university and industry partners and will build upon long-term collaborative relationships between the participating school districts and the College of Engineering and Information Technology (CEIT) at GSU. This research experience will give participants the ability to immerse themselves into various engineering disciplines, expand their knowledge of engineering through research in renewable energy while giving them concrete hands-on examples and pedagogical methods of incorporating engineering into STEM curricula.    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Over a three-year period the ENERGY RET Site will directly impact 30 STEM high school teachers, pre-service education majors, and community college faculty and approximately 4000 students. The goal of the ENERGY RET is to educate, engage, and inspire teachers to bring renewable energy to their classrooms through summer-term interdisciplinary STEM research experiences in the field of engineering and computer science.  The educational objectives of this program are to: increase basic understanding of interdisciplinary concepts through hands-on learning, introduce STEM problem-solving skills and the ability to apply them in lectures and laboratories, and to increase interest in conducting STEM research.  The program will develop the participants' ability to collaborate and communicate effectively at both the interpersonal and presentation level all while part of a diverse team.  RET participants, through fundamental energy-related research and transformational activities that are tied to industry, will leverage curricular approaches that allow them to transition this knowledge into highly inspirational STEM experiences for their students. The ENERGY participants, working with College of Education faculty, will develop activities and instructional practices that model and transfer their experience for integration of energy concepts into their classrooms during the academic year.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Engaging Educators in Renewable Energy (ENERGY) developed a diverse, competitive, and nationally engaged teacher workforce through engineering, educational and pedagogical activities and hands-on projects performed alongside faculty, graduate, undergraduate students, and industry partners and advisors at Georgia Southern University. There were 30 participants in the RET-ENERGY summers 2017-2019 of which 90% were minorities, veterans or special needs individuals.  Intellectual merit: The RET teachers participated in innovative research on vertical axis wind turbine model designs that were developed and evaluated in wind tunnel in dynamic tests and CFD. They worked on biologically-inspired fins that were used to extract waste thermal energy inspired by Sierpinski fractal patterns. The RET participants designed and built novel solar tracking system and minimizing the wasted power in smart homes as a distributed generation (pico-grid) which includes renewable power generation and storage. The RET teachers participated in several visits to cutting-edge industries.  The project outcomes and research projects aligned with the current Engineering standards approved by the Georgia Department of Education for the Engineering pathways and NGSS.    The RET program produced twelve journal papers, two textbooks, forty peer reviewed conference papers, seven Master theses, and large number of posters.  Broader impacts: The primary goal of this project was to educate, engage, and inspire teachers who work with historically underserved student populations to bring renewable energy and STEM skills and knowledge, to their classrooms through summer-term interdisciplinary research experiences in the fields of engineering and computer science. Additional goals were to increase participants' basic understanding of interdisciplinary concepts through hands-on learning, introduce STEM problem-solving skills and the ability to apply them in lectures and laboratories, and to increase interest in conducting STEM research. A final goal was to develop the participants’ ability to collaborate and communicate effectively at both the interpersonal and presentation level all while part of a diverse team.  The focus was on high-need rural areas in partner counties that collectively are home to high populations of underrepresented minorities (average of 55%), very disadvantaged economically (average 87%) and special needs students (average 12%).Target participants included those who are from historically underrepresented groups in the STEM disciplines and teach close to 4000 students of high school and post-secondary education characterized by a high level of poverty and/or a high percentage of minority learners at high schools.  The GSU RET program post assessment results showed that the majority of students (80-85% across all classrooms) "knew only a little about energy" at the beginning of the school year whereas the majority (89-97% across all classrooms) felt "ready to teach someone else about energy".   There were pre/post gains in circuits and circuitry (47% mastery pre-test compared to 83% mastery in the pos-test); and in solar panels/aquaponics (33% mastery pre-test compared to 91% mastery post-test).   Further, one teacher describes the impact on her students with the following statement, "the populations most impacted have been my students with Individualized Education Plans and 504 accommodations and my African American males, making over a 400% improvement from Pre-test to Post-test."   Their students' attitudes about the field of Science, Technology, Math and Engineering improved, as did their knowledge and attitudes about Renewable Energy with an overall increase in each survey. The hands-on nature of the curriculum developed under the NSF-RET grant provides them with meaningful learning experiences that help increase both academic understanding and make real world connections."    Teacher's comment:   "The data from the Physical Science Energy Unit student evaluations did an amazing job validating the success of the NSF funded ENERGY program hosted at Georgia Southern University. At the beginning and at the end of the energy unit, the students were given a twenty-two question multiple choice exam. The students scored a low 23% overall average on the pre-test. However, the students increased to an unbelievably high 92% overall average on the post-test at the end of the unit. Students also completed several lab reports and data analysis projects throughout the unit that had similar successful results".  RET teacher's comment:  "I found the GSU NSF RET Energy program, to be life and career altering. My professional practice did change, AND in the best possible way, to provide a much richer content experience for the students I taught."
