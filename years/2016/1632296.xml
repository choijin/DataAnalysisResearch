<AbstractNarration>Humans receive far more visual information in each moment than they can possibly process. A major question is how people attend to the information that is most relevant to their current goals and ignore distracting, irrelevant information. One strategy is that people focus their attention on specific properties of objects, such as their color, shape, or location.  However, previous research has shown that people do not always control their attention in an optimal way.  Additionally, little is known about the factors motivating how people choose to control their attention. The current project will investigate the role of three factors that may influence how attention is controlled: 1) performance maximization (the drive to achieve a goal as quickly as possible); 2) effort minimization (avoiding tasks that are cognitively taxing); and 3) novelty-seeking (exploring new stimuli in the environment). Using a new method to measure all three of these factors, the research team will establish each individual's unique "Attention Control Profile." Providing a detailed analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of an individual's attentional control strategies may have important implications for screening and training employees in professions that depend heavily on attentional control, such as drivers, security agents, and air traffic controllers. The Attention Control Profile may also be helpful for assessing attentional control deficits in special populations, such as individuals with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), schizophrenia, or damage to frontal or parietal brain regions. In addition to the broader scientific contributions, this project will provide training to undergraduate students, graduate students and post-doctoral researchers at The Ohio State University, with an emphasis on including women and members from groups underrepresented in science. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project uses a combination of behavioral and eye-tracking measures to develop an Attention Control Profile for each participating individual, using a new visual search task that is designed to reproduce essential aspects of real-world search. The task allows individuals to choose freely among multiple different attentional control strategies, in order to find one of multiple possible search targets.  Additionally, the task features a search display that varies continuously over time, which will prompt individuals to adjust their control strategies dynamically. The investigators will explore how effectively individuals choose search targets, adapt their control strategies to the changing environment, and ignore irrelevant information. This will, in turn, provide a metric for how much each individual's attentional control is influenced by performance maximization, effort minimization and novelty-seeking. The project also explores the underlying sources of individual variation in attentional control, by examining whether an individual's strategy depends on motivational state (e.g., when fast performance receives high rewards) or specific personality traits (e.g., impulsivity or deliberateness). These methods will enable the researchers to provide a tool for measuring individualized attentional control profiles and will help unpack the motivations underlying the use of different attentional control strategies.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ We live in a world that can be described as one of ?information overload.?  With so much stimulation available to our senses at any given moment, we are critically challenged to direct attention to what is behaviorally relevant while tuning out irrelevant distractions.  It is of great societal interest to determine why some individuals are more successful at meeting this challenge than others.  Much research has focused on how people vary in their cognitive abilities to control attention, but in this research project we focused on another vital but understudied variable: strategy.  That is, if two people possess the same abilities to control their attention, they may not take advantage of these abilities in similarly strategic ways, leading to dramatically different outcomes in the real world.  In this project, the research team carried out a comprehensive investigation of individual variation in how people use strategies to control attention.  The work made use of a novel behavioral paradigm, the Adaptive Choice Visual Search (ACVS), which offers new ways to probe how well, or how optimally, people strategically direct their attention when searching for targets of interest in the visual scene.  We obtained several major findings:  1.    Attention strategy is a trait-like variable.  Our investigation has shown that the way in which people use their strategy remains stable over time.  In particular, strategy usage during one behavioral testing session was highly correlated with strategy usage on a return session 1-10 days later.  This finding is important because it paves the way for exploring how strategy might be linked to real-world performance (e.g., in school, at certain jobs, etc.), or to psychological disorders (particularly those that are attention related, such as ADHD, schizophrenia, and additional disorders stemming from frontal and/or parietal lobe damage).  2.    Strategy is distinct from ability. Measurements of people?s attentional abilities proved to be unrelated to how they strategically used those abilities.  This finding is important because it offers a potentially new path for explaining attention-related disorders that have not been well explained by deficits in cognitive ability.  3.    Strategy use is linked to subjective cognitive effort.  We found that when people find it cognitively effortful to use the optimal attentional strategy, they tend to avoid that strategy, settling for a suboptimal strategy instead.  Thus, while one?s ability does not predict strategy use, one?s subjective effort does.  This might explain why people with similar abilities apply themselves to certain tasks in varying degrees.  4.    Several external factors can improve strategy.  When we provided participants with monetary reward, explicit instruction, and more time to process the environmental scene, they chose more optimal strategies.  These results open the door to future training manipulations to enhance strategy usage in the real world.  5.    Not all attention strategies are related to one another.  We found that the way in which people used a strategy on one attention task did not necessarily predict how they would use a strategy on a different task.  This means that there is not one single trait variable that predicts all strategy.  Instead, strategy use may be highly individualized across a number of different variables.  Overall, the work may inform selection processes for certain vocations (e.g., baggage screening, radiology), help establish individualized training regimens, and help understand a variety of special populations with attention-related disorders. We have disseminated these results widely, via conference presentations and peer-reviewed publications.  This project provided STEM training in the domain of laboratory-based experimental research, including eye-tracking, statistical analysis, computer programming, research presentations, institutional review board protocol management, and open science practices (e.g., lab notebook keeping and preregistration).  In total, two postdoctoral researchers, four graduate students, one full-time research assistant, four undergraduate thesis students, over a dozen additional undergraduates, and five high school students received training.  The trainees represented a highly diverse group, with representation among women, Latinx individuals, individuals of many faiths, members of low-SES groups, and LGBTQ+ individuals.  The diverse environment in the lab facilitated the exchange of novel perspectives, which led to creative discussions and enhanced the quality of the team?s work.  It has also advanced the STEM training of several highly deserving and promising individuals who may not have otherwise been able to pursue this career path.
