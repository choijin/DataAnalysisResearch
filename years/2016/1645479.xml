<AbstractNarration>1645479&lt;br/&gt;Seal&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main motivation of the Sustainable Nanotechnology Organization (SNO) Conference is to connect science and engineering researcher from industries, universities, and federal agencies to describe and discuss the present status in the field of nanotechnology as it relates to sustainability. The conference will take place from November 10-12, 2016, in Orlando, Florida. The proposed conference will address the vital role of sustainable nanotechnology in a systems context, including Food/agricultural, Energy, Air/Water, Environmental/Biological, Health/medical, Urban, Education, Industrial/Manufacturing, Social, and Solid waste management.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are many definitions of sustainability, but most include the balance of environment, economics and social responsibility. Current sustainable nanotechnology attempts to make sure that industrial development is sustainable, in addition to sustaining the environment and human health. However, currently, it appears that that several nanotechnology approaches may not be sustainable because they require enormous amounts of water, energy, and materials while producing waste and toxic chemicals. Furthermore, some nanofabrication processes use non-renewable supplies, intensifying resource and energy costs. This conference will increase the collaboration between industrial participants with academic researchers engaged in interdisciplinary research. This group of users, developers and investigators of nanostructured materials will provide a long-term, focused research objectives of engineered nanomaterials for sustainable nanotechnology. The conference objectives will provide: (i) Gathering of scientific professionals engaged in interdisciplinary research from industries, universities, and federal agencies from many parts of the world to describe and discuss the present status and research findings in the field of sustainability of nanotechnology; and, (ii) Promote the growth of new collaboration between participants for a better understanding of the challenges associated with the sustainable nanotechnology. The conference will support a minimum of 30 to 40 research students including underrepresent groups working in sustainable nanotechnology. Hence, the conference would provide networking and educational opportunities for young scientists at various career stages.</AbstractNarration>

The main objective of this conference was to bring together scientific experts from academia, industries, and govenment agencies from around the world to present and discuss current research findings on the subject of sustainability in nanotechnology. The 2016 conference addressed the important role of sustaibale nanotechnology using a systems approach to sustainable nanotechnology in food/agricultural, energy, air/water, environmental/biological, health/medical, urban, education, industrial/manufactring, social, and solid waste management. Plenary lectures and keynote speakers presented the issues such as the development of nanomaterials that, through their life cycle, and properties, governance of nanotechnoloy, provided a framework for achieving more sustainable technology, in developing eco-friendly preparation of nanomaterials and related products. Other features include simulation and theoretical analysis of nanomaterials and their role in nanomadicine, energy, and industrial applications including life-cycle aspects. Special focus was given to transformation, toxicity, and the interactions of nanotechnology with the biological system. A dedicated session on nanotechnology and educationwa highlighted including a plenary speaker from Singapore presented the status of nanotechnology in Asia and around the world. The conference feaatured a highly interactive poster session, presentations, and awards. In total, around 125 scientists and engineers attended the 5th SNO conference.
