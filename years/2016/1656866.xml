<AbstractNarration>Replication and reproducibility are critically important tenets of the scientific process.  Yet, many fields including education research struggle to regularly support and publish results from replication studies.  Although important strides have been made to ensure that more scientific data is available, substantive challenges remain with respect to making data from important publications widely available in a timely manner. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This conference proposal will bring together journal editors and early career researchers in education research to discuss issues related to open science including, replication, reproducibility, and data sharing related to the publication process. This 2-3 day conference that will help to develop a fuller understanding of the principles and purposes of journals in the data sharing process, consider the role of journals in publishing replication research, broaden knowledge about the mechanisms for sharing data and cultivating replication research,  and provide early career scholars with opportunities to play a critical role in replicating and reproducing research findings via open access to data.</AbstractNarration>

The emphasis on journal publishing reflects the fact that it is the logical and most appropriate point to share data. By this time, articles have been peer reviewed, further attesting to the quality of the published research before dissemination.  Also, the point when authors submit manuscripts for publication, they typically have datasets and other research-related products (e.g., code books, program scripts on which the analysis is based) in a clean and final form.  The focus of the workshop was on journal editors and early career education scientists drawn from the major research associations in education research and the learning sciences. With funding from the National Science Foundation, the conference brought together more than 60 participants including editors from 18 journals and 17 early career scholars representing 13 scientific societies; invited experts, association leaders, and federal officials to address data sharing and research transparency in education research and to consider how it can advance scientific knowledge.  Intellectual Merit:  The workshop provided ample opportunity for discussion and dialogue in plenary and breakout sessions. A key issue and point of emphasis throughout the workshop was the commitment to building knowledge in a process that is transparent and well-warranted and that can lead to new contributions. A significant takeaway from the discussions was that sharing data is an essential part of science. Sharing data lends legitimacy and credibility in making knowledge claims, and provides the proof and the basis for how we know what we know.  The workshop also focused attention on data archives as mediators of open data sharing, on best practices and guidance for ethical data sharing and responsible data use, and on model guidelines for data sharing at the article publishing stage. Representatives from data repositories including, the Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR), Databrary, the Qualitative Data Repository (QDR), and the Center for Open Science (COS) provided insights and information on managing and protecting data in safe and secure environments.  Federal officials discussed federal initiatives to incentivize data sharing and research replication, and emphasized the importance of strong data management plans in funding applications.  Breakout sessions included consideration of data sharing strategies for different types of data, issues of significance for editors and early career scholars (in separate breakout sessions), and next steps for participating associations to consider together as well as within their home associations.
