<AbstractNarration>RECOMB is an international scientific conference bridging the computational, mathematical, and biological sciences. The RECOMB conference series was founded in 1997 to provide a scientific forum for theoretical advances in computational biology and their applications in molecular biology and medicine.  Recomb 2016 will be the 20th Annual Meeting.  RECOMB features keynote talks by preeminent scientists, together with presentations of refereed research papers in computational biology, special sessions and poster sessions.  This proposal requests travel support for US conference participants, with priority going to graduate students who will be presenting paper or posters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact goal of this proposal is to increase the participation of students at the RECOMB conference by giving travel funding to students. Women, minorities and persons with disabilities will be given the highest priority for travel funding, in order to increase their access to scientific meetings and to broaden participation at RECOMB.  All individuals presenting posters or papers will be sent email making them aware of the student support possibilities.&lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;RECOMB is one of the top computational biology conferences.  The many events at RECOMB provide an excellent way for students to be exposed to new and exciting research areas, and learn of cutting-edge advances.  Further, student participation is vital for the growth and continuation of the field.</AbstractNarration>
