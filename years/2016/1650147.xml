<AbstractNarration>The recognition that climatically modulated erosion acts to govern the development of active mountain ranges is arguably one of the most transformative conceptual shifts in the geosciences subsequent to the plate tectonic revolution. Topography in tectonically active regions results from an interplay among climatic, tectonic, and surface processes. The building of mountains increases topographic slopes, which directly influences the rate and efficiency of erosional processes. Rising landmasses can also influence climate by altering patterns of airflow and heating, influencing the magnitude and pattern of precipitation. Feedbacks between the redistribution of mass by climate-driven erosion can influence the state of stress, thermal structure, and subsequent deformation patterns within mountain belts, the very mechanisms that drive the growth of topography. The strength of these various interactions and coupling, however, is still contested. Furthermore, these processes have strong impacts on the well being of humans living in mountainous terrains. This project supports a U.S.-Taiwan workshop that would assess the current state of research and identify future interdisciplinary research directions. A key objective of the workshop is to increase partnerships between the U.S. and Taiwan through the development of collaborative research projects that benefit from research expertise in both countries, thereby strengthening research activities within each country while advancing understanding of the complex linkages among mountain building, climate, and surface processes. The participation of students and early-career scientists in the workshop will ensure the development of long-term collaborations that are mutually beneficial both from the perspective of the development of the scientific workforce and the exchange of scientific ideas. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project supports the participation of U.S. based scientists in a U.S. Taiwan workshop, which will be held at Oregon State University in 2017. The overarching purpose of this workshop is to promote interdisciplinary research on the linkages and feedbacks among mountain building, climate, and surface processes. The active Coast and Cascade Ranges, which will be explored during pre- and post-meeting field trips, will provide the backdrop for the workshop. Specifically, the workshop goals are four-fold: (1) evaluate the current state of understanding in how feedbacks among climate, mountain building, and landscape evolution govern the trajectory of orogenic systems; (2) identify and refine research goals that capitalize on transdisciplinary approaches that will lead to the next set of advances in our understanding of coupled solid and fluid earth systems; (3) strengthen emerging collaborations between U.S. and Taiwan scientists and to foster the development of specific research strategies to address research goals; and (4) broaden the scope of research goals to include systems beyond the Taiwan orogeny and to increase participation from a broader swath of U.S. researchers. The workshop is organized around two key themes: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is supported by the Tectonics Program and the Geomorphology and Land Use Dynamics (both in the Earth Sciences Division, Geosciences Directorate) and NSF's Office of International Science and Engineering.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project supported a second community workshop and field trip as part of the Feedbacks And Coupling among Climate, Erosion and Tectonics (FACET) initiative.  The workshop was held in July, 2017 in Oregon and involved both and academic conference and field excursions to the Cascade Mountains and Coast Ranges of Oregon.  The workshop was designed to promote interdisciplinary research on how the growth and erosion of mountain ranges is influenced by Earth's climate and to consider how improved understanding of these processes can help us anticipate the natural hazards they present.  72 individuals participated in the workshop and field trips.  52 researchers from United States attended, representing 29 different institutions. 18 Taiwanese scientists participated, as did individuals from Germany and Canada. Approximately 1/4 of the participants were graduate students or postdoctoral researchers in the early phases of their careers.  These individuals exchanged ideas, presented the results of their individual research, and strategized about the outstanding challenges faced by the field.  Through engaged dialogue, the workshop nurtured the development of scientific collaborations between teams from the US and Taiwan and supported a growing international community of researchers in the field of mountain erosion, climate, and active tectonics.  At least three of these teams are currently engaged in ongoing research projects that derived from ideas considered during the workshop.
