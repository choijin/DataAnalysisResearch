<AbstractNarration>1643237 &lt;br/&gt;Boss, Stephen K.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant is to help support participation of researchers and students in the 4th AASHE Workshop on Research for Sustainability: Colloquium on the Food, Energy, Water Systems Nexus. The workshop will be convened as a 1-day, pre-meeting workshop in association with the annual conference of the Association for the Advancement of Sustainability in Higher Education (AASHE) in Baltimore, MD on Sunday, 9 October 2016. The workshop will focus on presenting opportunities for research across the FEWS nexus from the National Science Foundation, Department of Energy, Environmental Protection Agency, and U.S. Department of Agriculture for academic researchers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The emphasis of this workshop on issues at the nexus of food, energy, and water and opportunities for this research through programs of several federal agencies will aid in expanding the audience of prospective researchers competing in these programs. Assembling academic sustainability researchers at this workshop will facilitate synergy between the sustainability research community and federal agency programs providing resources for innovative and interdisciplinary solutions across the FEWS nexus.</AbstractNarration>

U.S. federal agencies (National Science Foundation, Department of Energy, Environmental Protection Agency, and Department of Agriculture) recognize these essential challenges which are compounded by climate change and population growth, and are taking steps to lead through agency initiatives (e.g. INFEWS) mobilizing the research community to engage in interdisciplinary research resulting from such interdependencies.&nbsp;</p> <p>The symposium featured 1-hour presentations from representatives of leading U.S. government agencies (National Science Foundation, Department of Energy, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, U.S. Department of Agriculture) with research priorities in the Food, Energy, Water Systems nexus (FEWS). The symposium also provided information for participants on opportunities to align collaboration between government agencies and academic institutions.</p> <p>Featured speakers were:</p> <p>Dr. Roderick Jackson, Group Leader, Building Envelopes System Research, Energy and Transportation Science Division, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, U.S. Department of Energy. Dr. Jackson&rsquo;s presentation, &ldquo;From &lsquo;What If&rsquo; to &lsquo;What&rsquo;s Next&rsquo;, began with an overview of ORNL mission areas and organizational structure. ORNL research efforts and opportunities addressing questions &ldquo;What if we could make our power systems independent and resilient?&rdquo; and &ldquo;What if we could share energy for our vehicles and our buildings?&rdquo; provided insights into progress with integrated energy systems for buildings and transportation. Future research questions were outlined and opportunities for academic participation in research were provided.</p> <p>Ms. Lana Suarez, Director, Sustainable Food Management Program, Resource Conservation &amp; Sustainability Division, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Ms. Suarez&rsquo; presentation was entitled &ldquo;Food Waste: &nbsp;Challenges &amp; Opportunities&rdquo; documented annual food waste of 70 billion pounds, representing economic costs of $161 billion. She provided information U.S. EPA information, education, and outreach on food waste issues and methods to minimize food waste. She also presented a number of research opportunities related to food waste issues that would be of interest to U.S. EPA efforts in this domain.</p> <p>Dr. Kim Green, Director, Office of the Chief Scientist, United States Department of Agriculture. Dr. Green presented &ldquo;FEWS at USDA:&nbsp; Current Research and Opportunities for Innovation&rdquo; provided an overview of significant challenges facing world agriculture such as increasing efficiency of water use, reducing the environmental footprint of agriculture, biofuels and bioenergy synthesis, and producing safe and nutritious food.

Boss, Professor of Environmental Dynamics and Sustainability, Department of Geosciences, University of Arkansas. Prof. Boss made two presentations. The first, &ldquo;Energy Output of Global Agriculture, 1961-2013&rdquo;, documented the total energy derived from agricultural products and partitioning of that energy among food for humanity, feed for livestock, appropriation for biofuels synthesis, and waste. It concluded that societal decisions regarding this partitioning are more critical factors than increased agricultural production.
