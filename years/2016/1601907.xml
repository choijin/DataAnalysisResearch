<AbstractNarration>This research project concerns algebraic geometry, a branch of mathematics that studies the structure of the solutions of systems of polynomial equations. In the last twenty years, the pace of development of algebraic geometry has accelerated due to its mutually beneficial connections with mathematical physics, more specifically to string theory. The first two parts of this project aim to contribute to this growing area of research by verifying some of the mathematical predictions that are inspired by string theory. A third part of the project is expected to involve research by undergraduate students. In addition to its intrinsic scientific value in algebraic geometry, this part of the project is aimed at expanding the opportunities for undergraduate students to participate in cutting-edge mathematical research in a way that makes them cognizant of deep connections between different areas of mathematics.      &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project focuses on the double mirror phenomenon in algebraic geometry as well as some combinatorial aspects of the Eisenbud-Goto conjecture. The research involves three main directions of study. The first part of the project will further investigate the Pfaffian-Grassmannian double mirror example, with the goal of transferring ideas and techniques developed in the context of Calabi-Yau complete intersections in toric varieties to this new, more sophisticated setting. The second part of the project continues research in the direction of the Kawamata's conjecture, which states that birational Calabi-Yau varieties are derived equivalent. This is a fifteen-year-old conjecture of key importance to the area of homological mirror symmetry. The third part of the project tackles the longstanding Eisenbud-Goto conjecture in the particular case of toric varieties, which can be reformulated as a question about the structure of the sets of integer points in certain integer polytopes.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Lev Borisov works in algebraic geometry, which is a large area of mathematics that studies solution sets of systems of polynomial equations. During the course of the project, he co-wrote seven research papers with six different co-authors.  Five of these papers are driven by the questions arising from string theory, in particular the so-called concept of mirror symmetry. While string theory may or may not end up being crucial in the study of the Universe, its mathematical implications are quite striking and have been the subject of intense study over the last several decades.   One of the main ideas of string theory is that, in addition to the four space-time dimensions that humans readily perceive, there are additional higher dimensional geometric structures. In most general terms, mirror symmetry is a certain equivalence between these conjectural geometric structures that has been observed in multiple situations. Borisov's work in this area has improved mathematical understanding of the mirror symmetry phenomenon. In particular, Borisov's joint paper with Chengxi Wang on Clifford noncommutative varieties introduced a novel way of calculating the Euler characteristics invariant in an unorthodox setting of noncommutative geometry. His joint paper with Orlov used ideas developed in the study of mirror symmetry and related questions to construct interesting new invariants of the well-known mathematical structures called simplicial complexes.   Two papers of Borisov involved so-called surfaces of general type. Their main goal was to find explicit equations of these surfaces starting from their subtle geometric features. Borisov's work introduced a novel way of approaching such problems by making use of modern computing resources. The joint paper with JongHae Keum gave the first example of explicit equations for a surface known as a fake projective plane. Such description had eluded mathematicians for several decades. The Cartwright-Steger surface found in a joint paper with Sai-Kee Yeung is given by one degree two and 74 degree three equations in ten variables.   The project helped Borisov train two graduate students, Chengxi Wang and Vernon Chan, in this very central area of mathematics.
