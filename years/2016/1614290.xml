<AbstractNarration>Shorelines in coastal cities are heavily modified by introduced, man-made structures. These structures support novel assemblages of marine organisms, but their impact on marine food webs is unknown. This project will use modern chemistry techniques to characterize marine food webs on natural and man-made shorelines in Sydney Harbor. The study will be conducted under the guidance of Dr. Emma Johnston, a pioneer in studies of urban marine ecosystems, who has advanced the field through an extensive publication record and a strong commitment to communicating science to the public. Findings from the study will provide insight into the effects of urban shoreline development on food web complexity and the ecological goods and services that marine ecosystems provide. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We will use stable isotope analysis to compare trophic linkages within two types of urban marine habitats: hard-bottom substrates (man-made seawalls versus natural rocky shorelines) and soft sediments (where artificial structures have been added versus where they are absent). Research on these habitats in Sydney Harbor is unparalleled compared with other coastal cities; this will allow the researcher to develop conceptual food webs and identify key species for stable isotope analysis based on past literature prior to collecting tissue samples. Selected organisms will be collected from random quadrats and sediment cores at three sites in Sydney Harbor and their tissue will be analyzed for carbon and nitrogen ratios using a new elemental analyzer at the University of New South Wales. The researcher will use mixing models to determine the relative trophic position of each organism sampled and derive trophic webs and isotopic niche calculations. Resulting quantified food webs will then be compared between habitat types to evaluate the effect of man-made shorelines on food web relationships and ecosystem complexity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award under the East Asia and Pacific Summer Institutes program supports summer research by a U.S. graduate student and is jointly funded by NSF and the Australian Academy of Science.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Over the next ten years, the percentage of people living in coastal areas is projected to rise from 50 to 75%, increasing coastal populations by an estimated 2.5 billion people globally. Most of this growth will take place in coastal cities, where rapid urbanization is likely to cause substantial changes to marine seascapes. Though we know a great deal about the effects of urbanization on land, our understanding of urban effects in marine ecosystems is extremely limited.  One way in which urbanization alters marine environments is by introducing man-made structures. Shorelines in coastal cities are typically comprised of a combination of natural and man-made habitat types, including seawalls, pilings, and other novel structures. Past studies have found that man-made shoreline habitats support distinct assemblages of marine organisms. However, it has been unclear whether the food webs and species interactions on man-made habitats differ from natural shoreline types. Knowledge of food web structure and the interactions between species is essential for understanding how marine ecosystems will respond to further urbanization and environmental change.  In this project, we compared food web relationships between marine communities associated with pilings, seawalls, and natural rocky shorelines (these three categories are referred to as "habitat types" henceforth). We used stable isotope analysis to compare food webs across habitat types, and examined both surrounding soft sediment food webs (which include numerous polychaete worms) and hard-substrate food webs (which include herbivorous and predatory snails, seaweeds, and other species that are physically attached to natural rock, seawalls, and pilings).  Stable Isotope Analysis (SIA) is an extremely useful tool for discerning differences in food web relationships. By measuring the relative weight of carbon and nitrogen in the tissues of collected organisms, SIA determines the original source of primary production (which photosynthetic organism is at the base of the food chain) and the trophic level (how many steps are between the photosynthetic organism at the base of the food chain and the consumer species being evaluated) of each species of interest.  We used SIA to compare three types of polychaete worm in soft sediment habitats: Capitellids (carnivores), Lumbrinerids (deposit feeders that feed of detritus in sediments), and Chaetopterids (suspension feeders that filter food particles from the water immediately above sediments).

Implementing SIA requires some prior knowledge of the species that are present and their likely trophic levels and sources of primary production. Because research of urban marine ecosystems is extremely limited in most coastal cities, past knowledge of Sydney Harbor?s hard-substrate and sedimentary communities, which has been developed over decades of unprecedented, meticulous study, provided an unparalleled opportunity for applying SIA to understand urban marine ecosystem function.  Results from our analysis are still being evaluated and will be presented in peer reviewed manuscripts in summer and fall of 2017. Preliminary findings indicate that:  (1)   Pilings may change environmental conditions in ways that are critical to sedimentary communities. The isotopic signature of carbon in sediments surrounding pilings tended to be more enriched and coincided with finer sediment grain size, more sediment organic content, greater amounts of kelp detritus, and distinct assemblages of sedimentary organisms. Deposit feeding polychaete worms may have different nitrogen isotopic signatures, either due to differences in the original source of primary production or fewer interrum microbial species in the food web.

As people move towards the coasts and nearshore environments become increasingly urbanized, knowledge of which forms of shoreline alteration cause the greatest changes to marine communities will be essential for ensuring that nearshore ecosystems remain healthy and continue to provide the services, such as fishing and pollution remediation, upon which coastal populations rely.
