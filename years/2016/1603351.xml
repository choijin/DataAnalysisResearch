<AbstractNarration>The Differential Geometry conference will take place in Montreal, Canada, from July 5 - 10, 2016. The primary aim of this event is to gather together leading experts in Differential Geometry, Geometric Analysis, and Mathematical Physics. The dual aim is to expose graduate students and young mathematicians in the USA and Canada to the new developments. Participation by both U.S. researchers and graduate students is crucial and is greatly encouraged. As a branch of Mathematics, Differential Geometry studies the shapes of spaces through distances and angles. The key concept involved is that of a so-called curvature, the simplest kind  being the scalar curvature function on a space. The existence of a constant scalar curvature  metric, the twistor theory and the special structure in geometry and physics are of major importance in Differential Geometry. It lies in the inter-play of geometry and physics, thus it naturally has impacts in both differential geometry and physics. Moreover, the main topics of the proposed conference has impacts on algebraic geometry and partial differential equations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In recent years, important progress has been made in the understanding of the geometry of 4-manifolds where we have seen fundamental progress in the theory of  self-dual and Einstein metrics, Seiberg-Witten theory, the Yamabe problem on 4-manifolds, and the Calabi  problem in Kahler geometry.  The conference centers around the topics below (but not limited to): (1) special structures in geometry and physics; (2) complex methods in conformal geometry and twistor theory, and (3) extremal Kahler metrics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For details, please check the webpage http://www.crm.umontreal.ca/2016/LeBrunFest16/aidAutreLEBRUN_e.php.</AbstractNarration>
