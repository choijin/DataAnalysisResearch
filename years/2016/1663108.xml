<AbstractNarration>Soil moisture is an important variable in the climate system. Relatively little work has been done to assemble and homogenize in situ measurements of soil moisture and to utilize these measurements for investigating land-atmosphere interactions. The research goal of this project is to understand how soil moisture influences climate on seasonal to interannual timescales in the U.S. Great Plains. This work will address four scientific questions: (1) How do land-atmosphere interactions, specifically those related to soil moisture, vary over space and time? (2) Are soil moisture and land-atmosphere interactions accurately simulated in global land surface models? (3) What are the processes through which soil moisture influences climate on seasonal to interannual time scales? (4) Why are there substantial spatial and temporal variations in the strength of land-atmosphere coupling?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study will develop a soil moisture database for the U.S. Great Plains using station-based observations. These data are important for developing climate forecasting tools, calibrating land surface models, and validating satellite-derived soil moisture algorithms. The Community Land Model (CLM) will be used to investigate land-atmosphere interactions, interannual to interdecadal variability and to identify the physical mechanisms that are responsible for spatial and temporal variations in the strength of land-atmosphere coupling. The scientific outcomes of this project will support the development of more accurate climate forecasts and is readily transferable to other mid-latitude regions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of this project include (1) disseminating the obtained results to stakeholders through National Drought Mitigation Center workshops and the federal government's drought portal (drought.gov), (2) teaching a Freshman Year Seminar (FYS) focused on drought science to 15 students/year, (3) establishing a Drought Science Learning Community to encourage integration of learning across courses and to involve students in one of the grand challenges facing society, (4) training and supporting three undergraduate students, and (5) involving actively a PhD student in all aspects of the research, including mentoring the undergraduate students.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The research goal of this project was to understand how soil moisture influences climate on seasonal to interannual timescales in the U.S. Great Plains. This goal was achieved by addressing five objectives:  (1)  Document how land-atmosphere interactions, specifically those related to soil moisture, vary over space and time.  (2) Validate the accuracy of soil moisture simulations in global land surface models and evaluate their ability to realistically represent land-atmosphere interactions.   (3)  Describe how soil moisture influences climate on seasonal to interannual timescales and identify the physical mechanisms that are responsible for the spatial and temporal variations in the strength of land-atmosphere coupling.  (4)  Educate, train, and mentor undergraduate and graduate students in climate research.  (5)  Disseminate the result of this project to state and federal stakeholders.   Intellectual Merit  The major findings of this project are:  (1) Land-atmosphere interactions are highly variable in time and space  Our analysis of SM-EF relationships has demonstrated that they are highly variable (both in models and observations). This is important because it has implications for seasonal climate/drought forecasting.  (2) Land-atmosphere interactions have a much stronger and more direct influence on temperature than on precipitation  We demonstrated that in situ soil moisture can be used to provide skillful forecasts of extreme temperatures on monthly-to-seasonal timescales. Therefore, soil moisture should be considered in seasonal climate forecasts because the soil moisture has "memory". Soil moisture also has an influence on future precipitation, but it is more difficult to utilize this within seasonal climate forecasts because the connection is less direct than it is with near-surface atmospheric temperature.  (3) The sign of soil moisture-precipitation feedback (positive or negative) depends on the synoptic conditions  There has been considerable discussion in the literature regarding the sign of soil moisture-precipitation feedback. Model-based analyses typically suggest that the feedback is positive in the central North America, while observations are equivocal and tend to indicate that the feedback is negative. Our results do not demonstrate a direct (causal) link between soil moisture and precipitation, but they suggest that both wetter and drier than normal soils can influence, depending on the overall synoptic and dynamic conditions.  (4) Land-surface models that use an interannually invariant measure of vegetation condition do not accurately simulate soil moisture conditions, especially during drought events.  We demonstrated that land-surface models may not provide a realistic simulation of SM conditions if they use static vegetation. This can have a significant impact on SM, especially during drought conditions   (5) Model representations of land-atmosphere interactions are not always consistent with observations  The discrepancy between model and observed SM-EF interactions demonstrates that the model-based representations of SM-EF coupling may be not be accurate. Further work is needed to assess the performance of land-surface models and identify the source of these discrepancies.  (6) Observed soil moisture can provide early warning of drought onset  Soil moisture measurements have utility for predicting drought onset (or at least providing early warning). To date, observed soil moisture has been under-utilized in drought early warning systems.  (7) High resolution soil moisture maps can be developed using observed soil moisture   Although in situ measurements are sparse, it is possible to develop high-resolution gridded maps of soil moisture by utilizing information on soil characteristics and advanced interpolation algorithms.  Broader Impacts  The key outcomes of this project include:  (1) Public launch of the North American Soil Moisture Database (nationalsoilmoisture.com). The world?s largest and most comprehensive soil moisture database is now publicly available and will support a variety of research applications.  (2) This project resulted in 22 peer-review journal articles, &gt;30 conference presentations, a special issue on drought in Earth Interactions, and co-organized land-atmosphere sessions at the AGU meeting in 2013, 2014 and 2015 (&gt;160 papers/posters).

Three of the undergraduates who have worked on this project have gone on to grad school and the other undergraduate students who have graduated have gone on to work in climate/environmental science-related careers in government agencies and the private sector.
