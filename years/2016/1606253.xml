<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Research supported by this grant focused on proving the existence of equilibria in financial markets that are incomplete.  Incompleteness refers to randomness that is not spanned by the available traded securities and randomness that is not spanned due to trading frictions.   Incomplete financial markets are ubiquitous in theory and in practice, but the ability to model them in an equilibrium setting is challenging.   The project has: (i) established tractable, feasible mathematical modeling frameworks for incomplete equilibria, including those with frictions; (ii) developed the mathematical tools needed in those frameworks for proving existence results; and (iii) analyzed the equilibrium outcomes in order to understand how the presence of these features changes our existing knowledge base.   The first two projects identified an annuity as a sufficient traded security in order to establish a state variable reduction in individual agent optimization problems with exponential preferences.  The PI leveraged this variable reduction to prove the first equilibrium existence result for an economy with proportional transaction costs, a finite number of agents, and market clearing in all traded securities.  In a frictionless incomplete setting, the PI and her co-author proved an equilibrium existence result in which the agents have general continuous-time consumption streams.  Both results rely on the state variable reduction from a traded annuity.   Another project supported by this grant includes two simultaneous frictions in equilibrium: transaction costs and price impact.  The two frictions cause qualitatively different effects.  Whereas price impact causes agents to trade less throughout the trading period, transaction costs can cause agents to stop trade early.  Both of these frictions are of interest in mathematical finance, especially in single-agent models.  Many single-agent models treat price impact and transaction costs in the same manner; in fact, transaction costs are often treated as a special case of price impact.  Our results show that this approach is not valid -- these two frictions have different effects and each should be given the special modeling considerations necessary to ensure that they are modeled in a financially relevant manner.   The broader impacts of this research include providing a rigorous foundation for studying price formation with market incompleteness and frictions.  In the financial industry, frictions in financial markets are always present.  This work helps to understand price formation and the behavior of agents based on the presence specific frictions, including in models with multiple simultaneous frictions.  Additionally, the project involved a large mentoring and outreach component at all levels.  The PI mentored both undergraduates and a postdoctoral researcher.  Outreach involved undergraduates, middle schoolers, and kindergarteners.       Last Modified: 10/28/2020       Submitted by: Kimberly Weston]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
