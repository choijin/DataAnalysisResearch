<AbstractNarration>This archaeological project is designed to study the early rise of inequality, privilege, and elite standing among nomadic pastoral populations.  This research is pertinent to the anthropological investigation of how social differentiation between individuals and groups came about in the history of our species and how these earliest social structures may have set precedents for the kinds of extreme inequalities seen in modern day societies.  Moreover, the research focuses on communities of people who moved seasonally with their herd animals and, according to anthropological theories, are not expected to indigenously manifest inequality and social hierarchy.  Rather, pastoral nomads generally live in marginal environments with risk-prone subsistence systems and therefore are expected to form corporate communities that share resources and information broadly.  These expectations raise questions about the massive stone monuments, known as "khirigsuurs," that mark the Mongolian steppe during the Bronze Age and which many researchers have attributed to the personal aggrandizement of nomadic "elite" chiefs and warriors.  This study seeks to investigate the degree to which inequality and social differentiation may have been responsible for the building of these impressive labor intensive monuments or, on the other hand, whether these structures were built as a way to create community solidarity and cohesion.  These issues are pertinent to the understanding of social inequality today and whether such differentiation should be seen as a "natural" expression of society or as systems constructed by human beings based on social precedents from many millennia ago.  This project will also train US and Mongolian students in field methods and research strategies for archaeological anthropology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In order to test the different explanations for monument building among Bronze Age nomads in Mongolia, the Tarvagatai Project employs systematic pedestrian survey and excavation of monument and habitation sites.  Analysis of animal bones, site sizes, bronze metallurgy, isotopic signatures, and high resolution radiocarbon chronology will help archaeologists to differentiate between different hypotheses for the construction of "khirigsuur" monuments.  In addition, the Tarvagatai research will develop and employ new laser scanning methods for the analysis of skeletal deformations in ancient horse skulls in order to determine whether horse riding and traction may have contributed to early social differentiation among nomads.  These novel methods will not only help archaeologists to explain the presence of horse burials in monumental construction but will also help to solve the mystery of when human beings first began riding horses on the Mongolian steppe.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Project Outcomes Report  Large-scale monuments are often considered to be the results and embodiments of decisions made by and established elite social stratum. However, without understanding the social and economic foundations of monument-building societies, and without understanding whether large-scale monuments were built in a single event or built over extended time period, we cannot simplistically equate their presence with the existence of social hierarchy.   Such is the case of the most prominent monuments of the Late Bronze Age in Mongolia (c. 1450-750 BC) - the khirigsuur stone mounds. This study proposes a novel 'communal-territorial' model that views khirigsuur monuments as embodiments of pastoral communal decision-making and reflect collective event-oriented activities on the part of sparsely located pastoral groups. These monuments had ceremonial and collective impetus and had the effect of organizing pastoral resources by marking the landscape at strategic locations and marking the local community's cohesiveness and organization to both community members and to outsiders.  The multi-stage and multi-year project, carried out in the Tarvagatai Valley of north-central Mongolia, adressed this issue by developing and implementing several field research and analytical methodologies some of which were used for the very first time using the Late Bronze Age record as a focus. These include systematic pedestrian survey with sub-surface testing using auger probes followed by additional two-staged sub-surface testing in order to determine locations of possible ephemeral campsites, spatial analysis of khirigsuur monuments in relation to local topography and pastoral resources, comparison of dates of different parts of the khirigsuur monuments to restore their construction phases, and subsequent analysis of the material evidence recovered from khirigsuur excavations including horse crania analysis based on their high-resolution digital models and stable isotope analysis of horse teeth.  The National Science Foundation's Doctoral Dissertation Improvement Award has greatly assisted me to carry out the field works of the last stage of my dissertation project and conduct the subsequent analysis in the US and German laboratories. The last season of fieldworks included pedestrian survey over the Uurgiin pass that connects the Tarvagatai Valley and the Egiin Gol Valley to the south. Crossing over the east-west oriented Khantai Mountain Ridge, this pass was actively used by local communiities up until the intorduction of Soviet trucks in the mid-20th century. The purpose of the survey was to test whether the pass was used in times of khirigsuur monumentality and how it could be incorporated to Tarvagatai spatial analysis. The results suggest that the Uurgiin pass could have been used in the Late Bronze Age for inter-valley movements based the presence of a khirigsuur monument right along the pass trail on the southern side, and based on the GIS analysis that highlight the visual aspect of the largest khirigsuur concentration in Tarvagatai Valley from the northern side of the pass.  Radiocarbon dates from different satellite features and statistical analysis conducted using these dates suggest that while medium size khirigsuurs might have been built over relatively short time period or in a single construction campaign, the largest khirigsuur (site 2) was built over several centuries through repeated visits and editions to the site.   Analysis of horse remains support the hypothesis that horse selection was subject to typical pastoral decision-making and not chosen for their high value as would be expected of elite driven cospicuous consumption. Rather, they were entirely chosen in accordance with a her management strategy that promoted maintenance of herd reproduction and stable herd composition instead of elite display.  Isotope analysis of horse teeth shows that horses had access to various water resources: mountain rivers and lakes. This fact shows that Tarvagatai herders were already part of a larger interaction network that extended over several major river valleys (closest two lakes form Tarvagatai are 40-50 km apart) which contradicts the argument of elite presence whose activities were thought to be very local.  The results of the multiple approaches have provided a body of evidence that, when combined together, demonstrate that khiirgsuurs were constructed by pastoral communities in order to stabilize a social and productive landscape. Mobile pastoralism required the establishment and maintenance of interaction netwroks with other communiities in the region that were essential in times of social and/or natural disasters. In this case, collective construction of monuments that involved horse sacrifice and perhaps communal feasting was used as areans to engage in new relationships or strenghten their exsitng alliance ties.  Answering how and why Late Bronze Age communities started the tradition of khirigsuur monumentality and what were the social and economic foundations is important for anthropological study of early mobile pastoralists as it gives different perspectives of development of large-scale monumentality in societies without agrarian subsistence base and in a setting characterized by low population density, dispersed households, and high mobility.
