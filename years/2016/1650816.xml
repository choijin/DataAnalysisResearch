<AbstractNarration>The Sixth Programming Languages Mentoring Workshop (PLMW) will take place on January 17 2017, as part of the flagship programming language conference, Principles of Programming Languages (POPL), which will be held in Paris, France. This grant will support approximately 8 students to attend the PLMW event plus the POPL conference. While there is other funding available (through ACM SIGPLAN PAC) for students who are presenting papers at POPL, this proposal is intended specifically to increase the numbers of students from underrepresented groups and gives priority to US citizens and permanent residents. The broader significance and importance of the grant relate to the need to broaden participation, provide opportunities for students to receive mentoring from leading members of the programming languages community, and build the next generation of researchers and knowledgeable practitioners in this important research arena.</AbstractNarration>
