<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be to enable significant improvement in the shelf-life of unstable natural food ingredients and enable replacing artificial with natural colors in a large portfolio of products of interest to the food and beverage industries. Consumer demand for all-natural ingredients in food has increased multifold, primarily due to health concerns. Despite the strong consumer demand, delivery and stability of natural food colors pose a great challenge for the food and beverage industry. This challenge results due to an inherent chemical instability of natural ingredients and due to their accelerated degradation during food processing and storage. But the current solutions are not cost-effective and require the use of synthetic additives and preservatives, which are not desired by the consumers. This project is aimed at providing an array of low-cost, stable natural ingredients that will improve the overall stability of the finished products both during food processing and storage. This will also address the unmet societal needs for healthy food ingredients and improving sustainability of food products.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This SBIR Phase II project aims to develop bio-based encapsulation solutions to improve natural food color and phytochemical stability in food and beverage products. Current solutions are sub-optimal providing limited pH (color), heat or oxidative stability and short expiration dates on food and beverage products. To address this unmet need, this project aims to develop encapsulation of natural colors and bioactives that will enhance the overall stability of a finished food product. This will be achieved by working on the primary objectives of this project: Selection and screening of the carriers and natural ingredients to be encapsulated, physico-chemical stability testing of the encapsulated ingredients, scale-up methodologies, stability testing in a finished food/beverage product, consumer evaluation and customer validation of the formulations. As a result of the proposed approach, solutions will be provided that will allow the food and beverage industry to replace artificial with natural colorants as well as significantly extend shelf-life of their desired food products. This will also benefit the consumer who is seeking natural health-promoting ingredients in what he/she consumes.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p><span>InnovaNutra has revolutionized the storage and delivery of plant-based antioxidants in food. Consumer demand for plant-based foods which are wholesome, healthy and nutritional has increased tremendously in the past several years. But plant-based ingredients are normally unstable to heat, light or air during processing. Most of them have an unpleasant taste, due to which food manufacturers add excess sugars to both enhance the flavor and shelf-life. These ingredients are also poorly absorbed by the body. In addition, secondary problems such as weight gain, diabetes and heart disease are associated with intake of foods with excess sugars. In this regard, InnovaNutra's work has led to the discovery of a range of unique SuperFruit powders (berry- and grape-based) which are antioxidant-enriched, without the sugars and acidity associated with many fruits. On an average, one gram of InnovaNutra's SuperFruit powder has 100 times more antioxidants than that in a gram of the fruit itself. InnovaNutra's proprietary process preferentially removes the inherently present sugars in fruits and vegetables while greatly enriching our powders with healthy antioxidants. For example, consuming a gram of our grape SuperFruit powder is equivalent to eating about 200 grapes in one shot. Bitter/sour taste masking is achieved without any added sugars or sugar substitutes. Our SuperFruit powders could be directly added to a finished food product like juice, smoothies, oatmeal, yogurt, nutrition bars and much more. Thus, InnovaNutra has addressed several unmet needs related to plant-based ingredients - enhanced shelf-life, antioxidant yields, sugar reduction, unpleasant taste masking, application of the SuperFruit powders in diabetic foods.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>A great upside to our innovation is that our formulations can also be used to improve stability and delivery of bioactive compounds in oral care, skin care and pharmaceuticals.
