<AbstractNarration>The grant supports travel for graduate and undergraduate students to attend the 32nd IEEE International Conference on Software Maintenance and Evolution (ICSME 2016), in Raleigh, North Carolina on October 2-10, 2016, which is the main international conference in this Software Engineering research area.  The funds are to increase participation of qualified US-based students with attention to for underrepresented groups. The grant gives students an opportunity to engage in technical, professional, and social components of the meeting, which will contribute to their formation as researchers in the field, will provide them with feedback about their work, and will create and strengthen collaborations.  It will help build the next generation of researchers in the field.</AbstractNarration>
