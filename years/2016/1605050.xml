<AbstractNarration>1605050 (Olivetti)/ 1602916 (Beach)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Life cycle assessment is a tool for modeling the environmental impact of products, processes and services. Consequential life cycle assessment (cLCA) focuses on how changes, resulting from a stakeholder decision, impact the market of study as well as other markets. Current modeling approaches are either too restricted in scope or too conceptually challenging, limiting their applicability to a small subset of systems. The aims of this project are to develop the general methodology and develop the qualitative aspect of cLCA with a focus on enhanced stakeholder interaction. The methodology will be applied to the paper/paperboard and aluminum systems with a focus on how the presence of separate markets for primary and recycled material, as well as substitute materials, influences policy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will provide a general framework to expand the number of cases to which cLCA can be effectively applied. Building upon the research team's previous work evaluating materials markets and land use impacts, this will be accomplish by: 1) quantifying the economic and response characteristics of supply through a combination of empirical analysis, econometrics, and material flow modeling 2) quantifying the economic and response characteristics of demand through quantitative description of the utility function and decision processes of key sectors, and 3) demonstrating a simulation of supply-demand interaction coupled with parametric life cycle inventories. This project will develop a combined  environmental, physical, and economic model in an endogenous feedback simulation platform. The recycling policy arena consists of a diverse set of stakeholders and this work will investigate how effective use of communication tools, such as material flow diagrams, can make policy models both more transparent and more interactive. The authors hypothesize that strong intellectual contributions can be forged in melding methodological developments across the set of fields that model consequences of change in complex materials systems, including materials availability assessment and LCA. Policy measures such as subsidies and taxes are often used to promote materials recycling or substitution to materials with perceived improved environmental performance. The problem faced by decision makers is how to direct policy to have the greatest positive impact given limited legislative resources. Current analysis tools evaluate the direct impact of recycling locally, i.e. for a specific material, product and region. The methods described herein will inform industry and policy makers seeking to evaluate the impact globally, i.e. maximize (and optimize) the benefits of recycling over many materials, products, and regions. For example, this would be useful for policy makers at the federal or state level wanting to understand the net impact of a policy and the new baseline following change. While cLCA is currently used to inform the US policy for biofuels, it may be extendible to inform legislation towards improved materials sustainability. The cLCA approach has the potential to answer questions such as: What would future scenarios look like with and without proposed policies in materials recycling and substitution? Which products should be recycled, landfilled, and used to produce energy? What are the specific implications of policy for other parts of the economy? In the case of the paper system, stakeholders have expressed a strong need for a tool that is supplemental to the ones they currently use to assess environmental impact of recycled paper (current tools are based on attributional LCA). Excitement has been particularly strong for the possibility to communicate with a broad set of stakeholders from the initial stages of model development and all the way to the results. It is therefore expect that our final model will find immediate use as decision-support tool for environmental policy in the pulp and paper industry.</AbstractNarration>

This was done by building analytical capability to assess the consequential life cycle assessment (cLCA) of recycling and substitution in metal and paper-derived products. The objectives of this work were to develop quantitative methods for consequential analysis of material recycling and substitution and apply these methods to case studies in close collaboration with the relevant materials industries. More specifically, we developed and use a cLCA model (exploring varying levels of complexity in the modeling approach) to evaluate how two particular materials industries?and their environmental impact?respond to changes in the demand for products containing recycled content. We focused on metal availability and responses to recycling particularly looking at byproduct materials as well as materials relevant to the battery industry. Finally, efforts were made to quantify the impact of recycling paper. The intellectual merit of the work was to develop methodologies that more accurately capture this impact. The broader impact of this work was in developing educational modules that could be used within a higher education context as well as educating stakeholders about recycling impact more broadly. There were several conclusions made from this work based on several different types of case studies. Within aluminum we explored recycling process that require two stages because of particular contaminants in the stream, such as used beverage cans. Here we found that integrated planning between these two facilities can reduce material costs and increase use of undervalued raw materials. For the case of battery materials, we learned that there may be constrained supply of cobalt in the near future, but that there is limited benefit from recycling in the short term because of the long lifetimes of these products. In addition for paper recycling, an outcome of the work was that policy mismatch exists between how material is collected (frequently through single-stream recycling) and sinks for that material (typically higher grade products that residential material cannot be used within). Finally, regarding metal recycling more broadly we learned that policy to increase recycled content may not directly reduce the environmental burden of a metal because of rebound effects with the price of that material. All of these findings can help direct policy actions towards improved benefit of materials recycling.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 08/05/2019<br>      Modified by: Elsa&nbsp;A&nbsp;Olivetti</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Image         </div> <div class="galControls onePhoto" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation onePhoto" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1605050/1605050_10431079_1565015388888_reyccling--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1605050/1605050_10431079_1565015388888_reyccling--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Dynamics of recycling system"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1605050/1605050_10431079_1565015388888_reyccling--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Dynamics of recycling system"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Recycling Loop diagram showing interactions between the recycled content of tissue paper (a lower quality product and copy paper (a higher quality product).</div> <div class="imageCredit">Elsa Olivetti</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Public Domain</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Elsa&nbsp;A&nbsp;Olivetti</div> <div class="imageTitle">Dynamics of recycling system</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
