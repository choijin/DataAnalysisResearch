<AbstractNarration>This award is made as part of the FY 2016 Mathematical Sciences Postdoctoral Research Fellowships Program. Each of the fellowships supports a research and training project at a host institution in the mathematical sciences, including applications to other disciplines, under the mentorship of a sponsoring scientist. The title of the project for this fellowship to Jesse Thorner is "Analytic Number Theory." The host institution for the fellowship is Stanford University, and the sponsoring scientist is Kannan Soundararajan.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ During the course of this Mathematical Sciences Postdoctoral Research Fellowship, the PI studied the L-functions associated to automorphic forms and number fields.  More specifically, in joint work with Soundararajan, the PI proved the best-known unconditional upper bound for automorphic L-functions at the central point s=1/2.  This followed a highly nontraditional route, which included proving the first unconditional log-free zero density estimate (ZDE) for a large class of L-functions which includes all automorphic L-functions.  This provides, in a certain sense, a "statistical approximation" to the generalized Riemann hypothesis (GRH), showing that very few zeros of these L-functions could lie in regions far from the line Re(s) = 1/2 (such zeros violate GRH).  In joint work with Brumley and Zaman, the PI proved several ZDEs (both log-free and otherwise) for several families of L-functions in families (associated to Hecke characters over a number field, the family of all GL(n) automorphic representations, families of Rankin-Selberg convolutions, and certain families of Artin representations).  A key feature of these results is circumventing the need for conjectures like the generalized Ramanujan conjecture or Artin's conjecture for Artin representations.  With these estimates in places, we prove pointwise and on-average results commensurate with what GRH predicts.  Appications include improving the uniformity in the Chebotarev density theorem, proving hybrid-aspect mass equidistribution for almost all GL(2) Hecke--Maass forms, proving uniform results on the distribution of primes represented by binary quadratic forms, and proving statistical results on the distribution of \ell-torsion in class groups of number fields.  The PI's work has resulted in 10 preprints, 5 of which have been accepted for publication or are already published.  The others are under consideration for publication.
