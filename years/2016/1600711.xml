<AbstractNarration>Forty-Six Years of Statistical Signal Processing&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The influence of geometrical ideas in statistical signal processing dates to the inception of the field. Linear subspace ideas have had enormous impact and their success has led to exploitation of increasingly sophisticated geometrical structures, such as Grassmannian manifolds of linear subspaces, as domains for statistical reasoning about signal detection, parameter estimation, and inference. There is a trend in recent statistical signal processing research (and in related areas, such as statistical learning) toward exploitation of low-dimensional structure in data presented in ambient spaces of much higher dimension. This development continues to bring new geometrical machinery into the foundations of the field. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the forty-six years since completing his doctoral studies at the University of Washington, Louis Scharf has brought geometrical insights to almost every aspect of statistical signal processing.  Because his work in the discipline has been so widespread, contributing significantly to almost every major topic within the field, building this workshop around the theme of his career?s influence on statistical signal processing provides a natural framework for a snapshot of the history of the field and how key geometrical insights continue to shape it. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The organizers anticipate that this workshop will promote awareness of the power of the geometrical perspective advanced by Scharf?s work in shaping the forefront of today?s research. They believe this is a particularly important message to upcoming researchers and practitioners in the field at a time when geometrical ideas beyond linear subspaces are becoming increasingly relevant in signal processing. And holding the workshop in coordination with the Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems, and Computers, where many Ph.D. students and early-career researchers in statistical signal processing from the western U.S. attend regularly, provides the workshop access to this audience.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   A one-day workshop on statistical signal processing was held on November 10th, 2015 in Pacific Grove, California.   The main objective for the workshop was to disseminate a set of research results at the leading edge of statistical signal processing in a forum that highlighted the highly significant influence of Louis Scharf in advancing the state of the discipline. The aim of the workshop was to promote awareness of the power of the geometrical perspective advanced by Scharf?s work in shaping the forefront of today?s research.   The workshop was held in conjunction with the 2015 Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems, and Computers. Asilomar is one of the leading international meetings in which statistical signal processing is a primary focus. Most of the key researchers in this area from the western U.S. attend the conference nearly every year. The conference also attracts other top domestic and international researchers and a large number of studnets with some regularity.   The workshop featured presentations by key collaborators and former students of Louis Scharf representing a cross section of the main aspects of statistical signal processing to which he has been a seminal contributor over nearly five decades.   The workshop had broad impact on training and professional development by welcoming a large body of students and researchers to a wide-angle snapshot of the history of the field of statistical signal processing, provided by some of its most influential figures.  It imparted the message that geometry has and continues to be, in increasingly sophisticated forms, a central ingredient in the progress of statistical signal processing.
