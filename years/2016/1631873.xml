<AbstractNarration>Two of the most important properties of structural materials are their strength and their ductility - the ability to withstand deformation without breaking. High strength is desired for structural components so that they can carry high loads, and a good ductility is essential to avoid catastrophic failure in load-bearing applications.   This Designing Materials to Revolutionize and Engineer our Future (DMREF) award supports fundamental research to engineer strength and toughness into metals, by establishing a framework of strengthening and toughening mechanisms in metals.  The research program will investigate fundamental mechanisms of deformation in structural metals at the microscopic scale, and relate these to the performance of these materials.  This research involves collaborations between the University of California at Davis, Georgia Institute of Technology and Los Alamos National Laboratories, with a synergistic approach encompassing experimentation, modeling and simulation, and diagnostics.   This research will accelerate materials discovery by building a knowledge base to design materials that have specific combinations of strength and toughness.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this DMREF research is to engineer twin-twin meshes.   The hypothesis is that these meshes can simultaneously impart strength by introducing a high density of barriers to slip, toughness by crack deflection and blunting, microstructural stability by nature of an interlocking network, and isotropy in these superior properties due to their three-dimensional configuration.  Results obtained from this research will help formulate the scientific framework required to design twin meshes and to implement experimental studies to acquire data for refinement of physical models and enhancement of model predictions.  Ultimately, the strategy of this research program is to establish an original synergistic experimental-modeling approach, which can be implemented to engineer strength and toughness into metals via the novel concept of "twin mesh engineering."</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The goal of this DMREF research program is, via twin mesh engineering, to impart simultaneous strength<strong> </strong>by introducing a high density of barriers to slip, toughness by crack deflection and blunting, and microstructural stability by nature of an interlocking network. Novel, state-of-the-art in-situ experimental techniques in TEM and HRTEM, atomic-scale simulation, and multi-scale, microstructure-sensitive 3D simulation tools are implemented to establish the interrelationship between slip and twinning, the role of slip in twin thickening and the strengthening of solids by slip/twin and twin/twin interactions. First, in-situ TEM techniques were successfully used to capture events revealing the onset of twin nucleation and propagation at multi-scales, with molecular dynamics (MD) analysis of the influence of nanopillar geometry on stress fields under compression that can induce intersecting slip paths (see Image 1). Consistent with MD simulations, in-situ compression of nanopillars showed that the two corners of the pillar tip act as dislocation sources to emit dislocations into the crystal, which then intersect to form a twin embryo. The findings provide clear evidence that slip dislocations can form twins, and, that one mechanism for forming a twin embryo involves the reaction of two gliding dislocations.&nbsp; Second, an "unconstrained" pillar-on-pillar design was developed to eliminate the influence of the lateral system stiffness effect in conventional nanopillar compression, which is applied to provide evidence of twin shearing (see Image 2).&nbsp; Compared to rotation/bending in constrained pillars, the substrate can elastically deform sideways to accommodate the twin shearing in the unconstrained pillar after twinning. Third, in-situ TEM revealed the configuration and dynamics of "c+a" dislocations (Image 3). Compared to the pervasive "a" dislocations, new "c+a" dislocations were infrequently nucleated with various initial configurations. These "c+a" dislocations at best moved briefly, then became mostly aligned with the trace of the basal plane, which has a low energy sessile state. Limited bowing out from some non-basal portions or ?unpinning? of the basal-dissociated end can enable movement of "c+a" dislocations. This finding is not only crucial for understanding "c+a" slip itself, but also has important implications on deformation twinning and slip-twin interactions. &nbsp;Fourth, a 3D Crystal Plasticity Fast-Fourier Transform (CP-FFT) model was developed to analyze the local stress field produced by a twin. The CP-FFT calculations supported the observation that the formation of a compression twin (CTW) at a tension twin (TTW) tip can be driven by local stresses generated by TTW propagation (Image 4). The model also provides principles to select a particular twin variant to form twin-meshes. Guided by CP-FFT, we successfully introduced a V4 CTW at a pre-existing TTW tip, through the in-situ application of a local stress, and thus obtained a CTW-TTW mesh in Mg. Fifth, by uniquely isolating and testing different twin morphologies grown in-situ, we demonstrated that compared to the cases of no twins, or to a regular array of twins, a 3D twin mesh is a much more powerful strengthener (Image 5). The strengthening/toughening observed in the pillars containing twin-meshes was attributed to slip-twin and twin-twin interactions. Our in-situ studies demonstrate that the twin-twin interactions impede thickening of the participating twins, which results in the stress bursts in the compression curves. Post mortem TEM characterization demonstrated the "obstacle effect" posed by a twin boundary (TB) when acting as an impedance to dislocation slip. Sixth, we designed an experimental strategy to impose loads in multi-directions to achieve twin mesh structures (Image 6).&nbsp; As revealed by post-mortem electron back scatter diffraction (EBSD) and TEM studies, two or more twin variants were activated in most grains in the twinned coarse grain region due to multi-directional deformation strain. The twin meshes also effectively randomized the initially strong texture of the starting material. These results clearly indicate that twin meshes could lead to less plastic anisotropy and tension-compression asymmetry, as well as high strength.</p> <p>Through the performance period (November 1, 2015 to September 30, 2018), this program has generated 5 published journal papers, 5 manuscripts under review, 4 manuscripts in preparation, and 5 conference presentations/papers, and trained 8 graduate students, 6 undergraduate students and 3 postdoctoral researchers.</p> <p>This DMREF program has generated fundamental knowledge that enhances our understanding of the long-standing problem of strengthening and toughening in HCP metals via "twin mesh engineering", which allows us to design twin meshes that can be used to attain unprecedented combinations of strength and toughness in HCP metals.&nbsp; This approach will have generic application to materials that deform by twinning.&nbsp; The research activities have promoted intellectual collaborations and academic exchanges between UC Irvine, UC Davis, Georgia Tech via joint research efforts in experimental investigation and modeling analysis.

This DMREF program has generated fundamental knowledge that enhances our understanding of the long-standing problem of strengthening and toughening in HCP metals via "twin mesh engineering", which allows us to design twin meshes that can be used to attain unprecedented combinations of strength and toughness in HCP metals.  This approach will have generic application to materials that deform by twinning.  The research activities have promoted intellectual collaborations and academic exchanges between UC Irvine, UC Davis, Georgia Tech via joint research efforts in experimental investigation and modeling analysis.
