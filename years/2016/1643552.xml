<AbstractNarration>This award supports the principal investigator's research in number theory and its cryptographic applications.  Number theory serves as the basis for modern  cryptography and internet security.  The underlying mathematical  theories, of elliptic curves and integer factorization, have been  studied for centuries.  This project includes components of basic  research, concerning the relationship between geometry and number  theory, as well as foundational research in cryptographic applications, with an eye toward the advent of quantum computers.  In  particular, the cryptographic community is currently searching for cryptosystems secure against quantum computation (a property not shared by the systems currently in use), and the PI will investigate  one of the prime candidates from a number-theoretical perspective.  The broader impacts of the project involve the mentoring of students and women in mathematics through early research collaboration.  This  will take place through summer research experiences for undergraduate and early graduate students, and a mentoring research collaboration  conference for women.  The PI will also reach out the general public through art and software.    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The scientific component of the project has three parts.  In the first, the PI will  evaluate the security of the lattice-based cryptographic Ring Learning with Errors problem by developing and addressing questions concerning  the lattice properties of number fields and their subfields and ideals.  She will determine the extent of known number-theoretical attacks on the problem, as it relates to known parameters of provable security and suggested parameters for implementation.  The second concerns Bianchi groups, as providing a geometric view of imaginary  quadratic fields.  The PI will develop connections from orbits of the Bianchi group to class groups, continued fractions, Apollonian circle packings, quadratic forms, thin groups, abelian sandpiles and elliptic curves.  Finally, the PI will also build on her prior work defining  elliptic nets.  Elliptic nets provide a different computational framework for elliptic curves and have given rise to new algorithms for pairing-based cryptography.  The PI will extend this work to the context of abelian varieties, and investigate applications.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The project investigated several branches of research in number theory.   One aspect of the project concerned itself with post-quantum cryptography.  Our current standardized cryptographic protocols are based on number theoretic problems, like factoring, which are `hard problems' in the sense that the security of the protocol rests on the algorithmic difficulty of the problem for large numbers.  However, quantum computers, which are now being developed, will be able to factor, and solve other current hard problems, much more easily.  As a result, the race is on to develop and deploy so-called `post-quantum' cryptography, which will be secure against quantum computers.  This requires the development of new hard problems to replace those in use.  It also requires the concerted effort of the entire research community to find fast algorithms for these problems, to see if they are indeed secure for future cryptographic use.  This research developed several new algorithms against hard problems in lattices and isogeny-based cryptography. In another branch of the program, the project studied the curvatures of circles in certain circle packings related to Apollonian circle packings.  The study of these curvatures is a test case for methods that can be applied to certain groups (systems of symmetries) arising from geometry.  The project advanced these methods, applying them to new cases and extended the tools toward new situations.  Relating to this study is the study of continued fraction algorithms, some of which are related to these Apollonian circle packings and other related structures.  Continued fraction algorithms, which date back hundreds of years, have wide algorithmic application across many fields, including cryptography and quantum computing.  This project developed some new algorithms and studied their properties and consequences. And in a final branch of the program, the project studied number fields (which are a type of number system).  The study of number fields dates back hundreds of years, as these are among the most fundamental objects in number theory.  The project investigated certain specific number fields related to the study of elliptic curves, among others.  One property under consideration was whether the integers of the field can be generated algebraically from powers of a single element.  This property was proved or disproved for certain families of fields, and new methods for making the determination were developed.
