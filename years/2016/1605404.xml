<AbstractNarration>PI:  Zaki, Tamer&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: 1605404&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a GOALI project that is focused on the computational investigation of the fundamental interactions between free turbulence and the turbulent boundary layer. The proposal will employ high fidelity direct numerical simulations and conditional sampling techniques. The industrial collaborator is at GE, and this collaboration can lead to a project that will be concerned with flow conditions that are relevant to practical applications. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed work aims to fill a gap in current understanding and practice of designing engines with low emission goals. Currently, the design process is based on correlations that are extracted from studies of flows without accounting for background disturbances. Often efficiency is sacrificed in favor of reliability and safety. However, background disturbances can cause distortions that are not predictable.  This GOALI proposal address this gap by providing the missing fundamental research that will enable more efficient and reliable designs and, in turn, better engine performance and cleaner operation. There is also a strong outreach plan that will leverage existing activities at Johns Hopkins, including activities for K-12 students. The graduate student involved in this project will benefit from the mentoring of the industrial co-PI and will spend time at GE.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    When the flow near a solid boundary is turbulent, both the wall friction and heat-transfer rate are higher than in laminar conditions.  The impact spans a wide range of applications, and has motivated detailed studies and modeling of the dynamics of these turbulent boundary layers.  Most academic research has focused on a canonical configuration where the turbulence is confined to the near-wall region, and the free stream is quiescent.  This choice is motivated by the desire to eliminate environmental uncertainties and facilitate reproducibility, comparisons and detailed analysis.  In contrast to the canonical configuration, most practical and realistic flows involve environmental, or free-stream, vortical disturbances that interact with the near-wall turbulence. The outcome of such interaction on the flow dynamics, drag and heat transfer are significant, and the dearth of data for this configuration motivates our high-fidelity numerical simulations to address this gap. Our collaboration with industry ensures that our efforts are directed and yield maximum impact.  Using direct numerical simulations that resolve all the turbulent flow scales, both inside the boundary layer and in the free stream, we examined two flow configurations of interest.  On flat and curved surfaces, we studied the hydrodynamic modifications of the flow due to external vortical forcing, and in the former geometry we also evaluated the modification of the thermal boundary layer.  We were able to explain how the environmental forcing changes the flow structures in the near-wall region, both directly by mixing of the outer and near-wall fluids and indirectly by a modulation effect.  The turbulence in the near-wall region becomes more vigorous, and its coherent structures become larger in size and more energetic.  The turbulent stresses in the boundary layer are enhanced, and the net power requirements are increased. These findings motivate and provide the necessary data for future modeling of turbulent boundary layers in presence of environmental uncertainties.
