<AbstractNarration>Variational inequalities appear in areas that involve differential equations and optimization.  They are fundamental tools for the modeling of phenomena in science, engineering and finance that involve inequality constraints.  The goal of this project is to design, analyze and implement reliable and efficient numerical algorithms for variational inequalities that involve higher order differential equations, with applications to optimal control and materials science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Novel finite element methods for higher order elliptic and parabolic variational inequalities will be developed together with fast solution techniques (adaptive, parallel and multilevel) for the resulting discrete problems. The emphasis is for problems on nonsmooth and nonconvex domains where the regularity of the solutions of the variational inequalities is much more subtle, and for problems on three dimensional domains where numerical computations are much more demanding.  An important application is to optimal control problems constrained by elliptic partial differential equations. By reformulating these optimal control problems as fourth order variational inequalities for the state variable, various finite element methodologies(classical conforming and nonconforming finite element methods, discontinuous Galerkin methods, partition of unity methods, mixed finite element methods, etc.) and techniques (error estimators, local mesh refinements, inclusion of singularities in local approximation spaces, etc.) can be employed in their numerical solutions.  The new numerical methods designed from this approach will be fundamentally different from the ones obtained by the traditional approach where the emphasis is on the control variable.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Variational inequalities that involve partial differential equations are important mathematical tools for modeling phenomena in science, engineering and finance where the quantities of interest must satisfy   certain inequality constraints.  The goal of this project is to design and analyze numerical methods for variational inequalities that involve spatial derivatives of order four, while the state of the art is mostly on problems that only involve second order derivatives.  The challenge is that, unlike the second order case, solutions of fourth order variaitonal inequalities are less smooth and hence more difficult to capture numerically.  We have suceeded in demonstrating rigorously that many finite element methods  originally designed for fourth order elliptic boundary value problems  (i.e., steady state problems with equality constraints along the boundary of the physical domain) can also be applied to elliptic problems where inequality constraints are imposed everywhere in the physical domain. Over the last four decades finite element methods have become the method of choice in the engineering community and a vast arsenal of finite element  techniques have been developed for elliptic boundary value problems. The key implication of our research is that all of these techniques are now relevant for fourth order variational inequalities.   Based on this realization, we have designed many novel finite element methods for fourth order variational inequalities and efficient algorithms for their fast solution.  In particular, we have substantially increased the variety of finite element methods that can solve elliptic optimal control problems, after they have been reformulated as fourth order variational inequalities.  Such optimal control problems are important for engineering design processes.  The outcomes of this project will enable practitioners in diverse areas to include fourth order variational inequalities in their toolkits for the construction of mathematical models.
