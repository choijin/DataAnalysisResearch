<AbstractNarration>Eastern Iowa Community College is meeting a need for highly trained technicians in additive manufacturing (AM) by developing AM content across  a set of programs as well as adopting multidisciplinary project-based instruction within courses. Faculty will collaborate with industry to develop AM content for welding, computer numeric control machining, mechanical design technology, logistics, information technology, and engineering technology. Incorporating problem-based instruction will promote students working together as well as developing critical thinking skills. A professional development webinar for high school and community college faculty will also be developed. Advanced manufacturing is Iowa's largest industry contributing $28 billion to the state's economy, representing 18% of Iowa's GDP and representing 13.5% of Iowa's employment.  Most growth is in cutting edge applications of big data, the Internet of Things, bio-based products, advanced materials, AM and electronic design. Broad incorporation of additive manufacturing content within the programs will result in increased skilled workers in advanced manufacturing, and the use of the integrated project-based learning method will result in workers with increased critical thinking and problem solving skills.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the Integrated Project Approach to College Teaching (3D ImPACT) project is to increase the number of skilled workers in AM through curriculum development; an integrated, project-based capstone course; and professional development for faculty. Activities include 1) collaborating with business and industry to conduct a Job Task Analyses and develop AM curriculum; 2) using the Digital Manufacturing and Design Innovation Institute training programs; 3) developing a project-based capstone course to allow students from different programs to work together to improve learning, performance and industry skill acquisition; 4) providing professional development for college and high school faculty; and 5) developing a project website. In addition, the project will help advance understanding of the circumstances under which integrated project-based learning methods will increase critical thinking and problem solving skills in a diverse workforce.</AbstractNarration>
