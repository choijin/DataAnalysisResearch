<AbstractNarration>Funds are provided to study nitrogen (N) cycles in the Brazilian Amazon. The research aims at quantifying N transformation and transport pathways in natural and agricultural settings in the Neotropics. The shift in agriculture combined with the increase in nitrogen fertilizer inputs in tropical regions have the potential to drive profound losses of nitrous oxide to the atmosphere, or increased movement of soluble N to rivers and streams. The proposed field research will quantify N2O fluxes and N fate in the vadose zone, groundwater and streams under natural conditions (tropical forest), single cropping of soybeans, and double cropping with soybeans and maize.  Remote sensing will be used to scale up results from the field and model to the Amazon region, and incorporation of research results into a dynamic vegetation model (IBIS) that has been parameterized for the Amazon and will be used to estimate N emissions under different climate and land use management scenarios in the future. The work will test two hypotheses: (1) that increased N fertilization will lead to moderately but not greatly higher N2O emissions compared to natural forest because soils are well-drained and are not expected to go anaerobic long enough for accumulation of N2O, and (2) that N losses to streams will be minimal in N-fertilized plots because of high rates of uptake by maize crop and retention of any residual N leachates in deep, clay soils through anion exchange.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will aid in understanding effects of changing agricultural practices on greenhouse gas emissions and stream pollution in the Amazon. Partnerships with local Brazilian scientists and training of US and Brazilian students will be important impacts from the research. Public outreach and broad dissemination of results will be achieved through regular presentations to agricultural producers and policy makers in Brazil through established contacts, as well as the support of a US journalist to visit the research field sites, which are locations of long-term ecological and biogeochemical research.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The area and intensity of production of globally-traded commodity crops, soybeans and corn, has increased faster in the tropical southeast Amazon and savanna regions of Brazil than anywhere else on Earth. Land use and agricultural practices in the center of this region, the Texas and Oklahoma sized Brazilian state of Mato Grosso, shifted from forest to pasture to single-cropped soybeans since the mid 1980s. During the last ten years, more than half this cropland shifted from single-cropped soybeans to double-cropped soybeans with corn during the same growing season. This rapid expansion and intensification has the potential to increase emissions of greenhouse gases and nutrient runoff to surface waters in ways similar to those that have been caused by expansion and intensification of fertilizer-intensive cropping practices in major temperate-zone soybean- and corn-producing regions of North America, Europe and Asia. Because the climate and soils in tropical regions differ from those in the temperate zone, it is not clear whether the magnitude and controls on greenhouse gas emissions and nutrient runoff from tropical cropland will follow patterns observed in other places. This is important to understand because most future expansion of croplands worldwide will occur in the tropics.</p> <p>&nbsp;This project quantified the emissions of the greenhouse gas nitrous oxide and the runoff of nitrogen and phosphorus from native forest and from intensifying crop agriculture on a large commercial soybean farm in Mato Grosso. It used experimental watersheds of 2 to 13 km<sup>2</sup> with different land uses to compare water runoff and nutrient concentrations in groundwater and stream water in three watersheds in forest, three watersheds single-cropped with soybeans and three watersheds double-cropped with soybeans and corn. It also conducted a controlled nitrogen fertilizer addition experiment in soybean-corn cropland that compared the fate of nitrogen applied at levels that ranged from no nitrogen, to the current practice of 80 kg N per hectare, to a potential future application rate of 200 kg N per hectare.</p> <p>&nbsp;Transition from forest to cropland increases water discharge from small watersheds by about four-fold. However, the transition from forest to single-cropped soybeans then to double-cropped soybeans and corn did not increase the concentrations of dissolved inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus in groundwater or streams. This surprising and important buffering against change in the concentrations of nutrients in runoff was caused primarily by deep and highly-weathered tropical soils and deep, groundwater-dominated water flowpaths that result in nutrient adsorption and retention. Comparison of the fate of applied nitrogen fertilizer to the corn cropping phase showed that at current nitrogen application rates most nitrogen is used by the corn crop and little ends up as surplus in soils. Higher rates of nitrogen fertilizer resulted in excess N that ended up adsorbed in soils at depths to 4 meters or greater. This demonstrated a mechanism that currently prevents nitrogen from moving from crop fields to groundwater and streams. Emissions of the greenhouse gas nitrous oxide were similar among forest, single-cropped soybeans and double-cropped corn and soybeans under current management practices. Increasing rates of nitrogen fertilizer application also resulted in very modest increases of the greenhouse gas nitrous oxide from less than 0.3 kg N per hectare with no nitrogen fertilizer to 0.8 kg N per hectare at 200 kg N per hectare. The project also found that losses of other nitrogen gases nitrous oxide and di-nitrogen gas were more important sources of losses of applied nitrogen fertilizer but these losses were still small compared with total amounts of nitrogen added by nitrogen-fixing soybeans and nitrogen fertilizer.</p> <p>These results show that understanding of nitrous oxide emissions and nitrogen runoff derived from experiences in temperate croplands is a poor predictor of patterns that occur in intensifying Amazon croplands. Deep soil retention of nitrogen in the form of nitrate is an underappreciated mechanism that buffers ground and surface waters from the negative effects of nitrogen runoff. The magnitude of this adsorption capacity is not known but will likely determine the time frame over which intensive Amazon cropping can occur while avoiding nutrient pollution of surface waters.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 01/09/2018<br>      Modified by: Christopher&nbsp;Neill</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1655432/1655432_10282941_1515530953966_Fertilizerexperimentsetup--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1655432/1655432_10282941_1515530953966_Fertilizerexperimentsetup--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Fertilizer experiment set up"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1655432/1655432_10282941_1515530953966_Fertilizerexperimentsetup--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Fertilizer experiment set up"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Planting of the corn crop in a double-cropped soybean and corn field by Tanguro Ranch equipment at the start of a controlled nitrogen fertilizer addition experiment.
