<AbstractNarration>CBET-1623659, Mueller&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Experiences in attending technical conferences are extremely beneficial to students. These experiences will not only help with the students' professional development, but also stimulate their critical thinking in formulating future research directions. This award is to partially support the travel expenses of graduate and undergraduate students in attending the 2016 Spring Technical Meeting of the Eastern States Section of the Combustion Institute. This conference is one of the most important regional conferences on combustion science and engineering. Presentations in this conference represent the most updated research outcome in combustion. The conference facilitates the exchange of combustion research results through plenary lectures and oral presentations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Due to its effect on energy conversion, environmental quality, and climate effects, understanding of combustion processes and practical combustion systems is of paramount importance to society. Exchange of information at conferences increases the rate at which research breakthroughs can be made to make combustion more efficient and cleaner with fuel-flexibility. A particular focus of this conference is on graduate and undergraduate students: providing an opportunity for these students to present and get feedback on their research and running a workshop that enhances their "soft skills" such as oral presentation and technical writing skills. This award will be used to offset the travel expenses of non-local students in an effort to increase student participation at the meeting, particularly students from underrepresented institutions that may not have the financial means to fully support student travel to conferences.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Eastern States Section of the Combustion Institute 2016 Spring Technical Meeting was held on the campus of Princeton University in Princeton, New Jersey during the dates March 13-16, 2016.  The meeting consisted of four invited lectures, a workshop on technical writings, 111 contributed presents, and a conference banquet.  Conference attendance included 138 delegates, of which 82 were students.  The funds from the National Science Foundation were used to support non-local graduate student (i.e., not Princeton University students) travel to the conference.  To receive travel support, graduate students were required to be the lead author on a contributed presentation, be enrolled at an institution within the geographic area of the Eastern States Section of the Combustion Institute, and be accompanied by an advisor or senior co-author on their work.  Forty eligible students were provided awards of $250 per person, distributed amongst 13 universities in the Eastern United States.  Intellectual Merit: The technical sessions included recent research on topics across a broad range of areas related to combustion science: reaction kinetics, laminar flames, turbulent flames, sprays and droplets, coal and biomass, heterogeneous combustion, soot, engines, new technologies, and fire.  In addition, invited lectures were delivered on the topics of turbulent combustion (Prof. James F. Driscoll, University of Michigan), sustainable refrigerants and fire suppressants (Dr. Gregory T.

Socolow, Princeton University).  Broader Impacts: The travel support for the graduate students enabled many of them to attend the conference to present their research findings and exchange other researchers.  In addition, a major thrust of the conference, since it is so heavily attended by students, focuses on professional development.  At this conference, a workshop was held on technical writing, specifically, the writing of abstracts.  Dr. Judith A. Swan, Associate Director for Writing in Science and Engineering for the Princeton Writing Program, facilitated the workshop.
