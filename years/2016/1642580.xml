<AbstractNarration>To explore how advanced network technologies address important public benefit problems, US Ignite will gather teams working on these next-generation applications at the 2016 Application Summit, June 14- 15, 2016, in Austin Texas.  Participants will demonstrate that advanced networking technologies such as software-defined networking, virtualized networks, gigabit to the end-user, and GENI racks can address societal problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objectives of the 2016 Application Summit are to 1) create a collaborative venue to demonstrate applications that take advantage of next-generation network technology,  2) provide a public forum around gigabit applications, 3) convene current and potential future Smart Gigabit Community representatives, and 4) demonstrate the important role that advanced networks will play in the emerging smart city / Internet of Things ecosystem. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Summit hosts academic, research, commercial and community leaders who are experts in next-generation technologies that serve the public benefit. By providing thought-leadership as well as practical expertise in successful application of next-generation technologies, these experts help educate and engage industry labs, federal agencies, foundations, venture capitalists, entrepreneurs, open source developers, students and faculty. The Summit provides a collaborative environment wherein researchers, developers, students and faculty can share their work with and learn from one another.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ US Ignite, in collaboration with the Global Cities Team Challenge (GCTC), hosted the 2016 Application Summit from June 13-15 in Austin, Texas. Over 2,100 individuals across a broad range of organizations: academia, research labs, Universities, corporations, non-profit entities, and municipal government, came together to explore and discuss the real-world benefits of advanced networking technologies that will be accessible to policy-makers and the business, technical, and popular press.  The summit?s goals were two-fold &ndash; education and community building. By convening the public-private community aligned with the US Ignite mission, showcasing next-generation technologies, and educating the community about the characteristics and capabilities of what is possible, the Application Summit serves the mission to stimulate the development of compelling next-generation applications that benefit society.  Participants demonstrated several "firsts" &ndash; applications or technologies that had not previously been demonstrated or seen, including:  4K gigabit-enabled digital microscopy, whereby Summit attendees witnessed a live 4K image of a specimen under a microscope in Los Angeles and manipulate that microscope from the Summit location in Austin, TX;   Attendees learned about Microsoft HoloLens that illustrated a future of mixed-reality. The HoloLens is the first fully self-contained, wire-free holographic computer that allows the users to place holograms in the physical environment. Holographic objects can be viewed from different angles and distances, which is ideal for educational purposes. The holograms can appear life-like, and can move, be shaped, and change according to interaction with users or the physical environment in which they are visible.   The future of performance collaborations and the power of Low Latency Network was demonstrated as two musicians, one in Chattanooga and the other on stage in Austin, performed over gigabit internet. Their perfect synchronization depicts the capabilities of the gigabit network and the future of Internet. The director of Cleveland Museum of Art illustrated ways gigabit communities would enjoy art pieces in the very near future. Due to the 4K visualization, art patrons will be able to interactively see the exquisite details they would not otherwise see at a museum.   The Summit provided two full days of education and learning for participants. During day one, attendees heard from leaders in the field who have witnessed how gigabit broadband has driven economic growth, collaboration and teamwork, and influenced the development of applications that can change the way we live, work, learn, and play.

At Demo Night Tuesday evening, attendees witnessed over 60 applications that utilize next-generation technology and gigabit-speed Internet.  The highlights were the application demonstrations. To recognize the greatest achievements, US Ignite presented the following Summit awards:  Best App in Show:  ViatoR  Most likely to have a big impact:  NextGen BEOC  Best connectivity across communities:  Real time Monitoring of Air Pollution via Mobile Sensors  Most unconventional use of gigabit:  Networked Virtual Energy Center for Teaching Alternative Energy Technologies   Best use of low latency:  ViatoR          Last Modified: 08/15/2017       Submitted by: Joseph Kochan]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
