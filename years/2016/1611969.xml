<AbstractNarration>The IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory (ISIT) is the premier international conference in information theory, the scientific discipline that studies the mathematical foundations of reliable communications, whether by telephony, television, wireless or optical systems, and the fundamental limits of data storage, such as CDs, DVDs, flash drives, or other semiconductor media.  The symposium series has run since 1954, originally every two years, and yearly since 2000.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Students form an integral part of the Information Theory community, and the IEEE Information Theory Society continues to promote student participation, including the ISIT Jack Kiel Wolf Best Student Paper Award, the creation of the ISIT tutorial series, and the Information Theory Society Student Committee.  In recent years, students comprise about one-third of the participants to ISIT, and the travel funds offered through this award will support the attendance at the 2016 ISIT by students enrolled in a graduate or undergraduate program in the United States and whose papers have been accepted for presentation.</AbstractNarration>

The opportunities for cross-fertilization are immense and it is very important that those who are new to the field and bring fresh ideas to it be present to discuss their work with thosewho are more experienced. The 2016 Barcelona ISIT was a major success with the largest attendance of any ISIT outside USA (888 participants). The major goal of this grant was to provide financial support to students attending the Barcelona 2016 ISIT. Thanks to this award, the organizing committee was able to extend support to 36 graduate students with individual grants ranging from $500 to $600. The students came from the following institutions:University of California, UC Irving, Stanford University, Carnegie Mellow, University of Illinois, University of Delaware, University of Maryland, Iowa State University, Pennsylvania State University, Northwestern University, California Institute of Technology, Ohio State, University of Notre Dame, Princeton University, UCLA, Purdue University, Texas A&amp;M and Columbia University.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 11/30/2016<br>      Modified by: Sergio&nbsp;Verdu</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
