<AbstractNarration>The Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP) through Targeted Infusion Projects supports the development, implementation, and study of evidence-based innovative models and approaches for improving the preparation and success of HBCU undergraduate students so that they may pursue science, technology, engineering or mathematics (STEM) graduate programs and/or careers. This project seeks to infuse the undergraduate biology curriculum at Texas Southern University with geospatial informational science and technology (GIST). This will help prepare students to address global challenges in the fields of geospatial information, ecology, environmental science, and natural resource management. The activities and strategies are evidence-based and formative and summative evaluation are an integral part of the project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project has the objectives to 1) promote student interest in geospatial informatics thereby addressing the global need for an increasingly diversified geospatial workforce, 2) foster critical thinking and enhance problem solving skills to better prepare students for future careers demanding geospatial skills in a range of fields, 3) equip students with cutting edge geospatial technology skills to collect field data, create and interpret geospatial maps, and 4) increase the number of underrepresented students applying for graduate programs and internships in geospatial-related STEM-fields.  This will be accomplished by adding geospatial content to modules in existing courses, creating a GIST-focused course, developing a new undergraduate certificate in geospatial science, and implementing a GIST undergraduate research program.  Through a range of planned dissemination activities, this project has the potential to affect the implementation of GIST components at a range of institutions.</AbstractNarration>
