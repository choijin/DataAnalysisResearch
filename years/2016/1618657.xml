<AbstractNarration>Many scientific laws are captured as differential equations --&lt;br/&gt;formulas that relates a quantity (such as position) to its derivatives&lt;br/&gt;(velocity and acceleration). Differential equations are common in&lt;br/&gt;science, mathematics and engineering.  They can be solved numerically,&lt;br/&gt;but may also have a closed-form solution -- an exact solution written&lt;br/&gt;in terms of familiar functions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Except for small equations, closed-form solutions were thought to be&lt;br/&gt;rare.  Algorithms for second-order equations, which were developed by&lt;br/&gt;the PI and his students, have demonstrated that closed form solutions &lt;br/&gt;of linear differential equations with polynomial coefficients&lt;br/&gt;are actually common; solutions can often be written in terms of&lt;br/&gt;Gauss's hypergeometric function, a familiar function in differential&lt;br/&gt;equations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project aims to find out if closed form solutions are also common&lt;br/&gt;for higher order equations.  The PI will work with two graduate&lt;br/&gt;students to develop algorithms to search for solutions in terms of&lt;br/&gt;A-hypergeometric functions, which were introduced by Gel'fand,&lt;br/&gt;Kapranov and Zelevinski.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;There is a wide variety of A-hypergeometric functions, which&lt;br/&gt;correspond to polytopes. A-hypergeometric functions can be&lt;br/&gt;multivariate, so several tools that currently only exist for&lt;br/&gt;univariate equations need to be generalized.  A key motivating&lt;br/&gt;question is if convergent integer-series solutions can always be&lt;br/&gt;written in terms of A-hypergeometric functions. If true, then&lt;br/&gt;A-hypergeometric solutions would be common in areas of mathematics and&lt;br/&gt;science that involve combinatorial structures or integrals, such as the Ising model&lt;br/&gt;or Feynman diagrams in physics. This question leads to several others&lt;br/&gt;on A-hypergeometric functions, some of which can be settled by the&lt;br/&gt;algorithms to be developed in this project.</AbstractNarration>
