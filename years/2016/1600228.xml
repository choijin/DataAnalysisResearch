<AbstractNarration>While computability theory studies complexity of mathematical objects from a computational point of view, model theory studies complexity of mathematical objects from a structural point of view. This project aims to deepen understanding of the interactions between these two different notions of complexity. In general, one expects that the more structured an object is, the easier it is to compute information about it. This research project aims to elucidate how a mathematical object having an understandable theory relates to computability of facts about the object.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In particular, this project works towards understanding certain problems in computable model theory: the spectrum of computable models question asks which sets of dimensions can arise as the dimensions of computable models of some uncountably categorical theory. The project will investigate distinguishing this problem based on the geometric nature of the theory, with the goal of advancing understanding in the cases where the theory satisfies the Zilber trichotomy. This project also aims to advance understanding of the degree spectra of theories. The degree spectrum of a theory measures how hard it is to compute any model of that theory. The investigator aims to develop a newer notion that will highlight connections between properties of the theory and the properties of the spectrum, providing a further link between computability and model theory. The project also investigates index sets of model theoretic notions; this is a computability-theoretic way to measure the complexity of a property. Knowing the exact complexity of a property aids in working with these properties in the most direct and efficient manner possible, thus spurring further research progress.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ We examined questions of computability theory and model theory, including work in computability theory and work touching on both fields.     In pure computability theory, we had a focus on computable reducibility of equivalence relations. Computable reducibility gives a way of measuring when one equivalence relation is simpler or more complex than another. This gives rise to a degree structure representing the full hierarchical system ERs of all equivalence relations. We also consider the restricted system CEERs of only the equivalence relations which are computably enumerable. That is, if two elements are equivalent, then you can computably witness this fact. We performed a deep structural analysis of these hierarchies answering many questions in the literature. For example, we showed that the theories describing facts about these structures are as complicated as possible. This shows that the whole topic is rich with content.     In computable model theory, the interplay between computability and model theory, we focused on questions around computably presenting strongly minimal models. These are the prototypical building blocks of mathematics, the smallest 1-dimensional objects.      A major result of research was to answer an old question in computable model theory about how different it can be to attempt to compute different dimensional models of a strongly minimal theory. We gave an exact characterization of this difference. If one model is computable, then every other model is computable from any degree which is ``high over 0'' ". Further, we show this is sharp, so this technical notion exactly answers the question of "how much harder can it be to compute the 6-dimensional model than the 2-dimensional model?"     In one collection of projects, we examined the connection between the geometrical properties of the objects and questions around their computation. We examined ``flat'' geometries, those with a purely combinatorial nature, and essentially characterized the possible sets of models which can be computed.      In a set of 3 papers, we examined methods of expanding the concept of computing a structure into the uncountable setting. Here we used the new notion of Generic Muchnik reducibility. Essentially, we move to working in a different mathematical framework where the uncountable structure looks countable and we do computability there. We present in these papers two starkly different approaches to studying this new topic and show that each method has its own strength, being able to prove theorems that the other method cannot.     Research was conducted together with many coauthors though they are not named explicitly in this brief summary.     Throughout the grant period, the PI was a mentor for undergraduate students, graduate students, and postdoctoral scholars. The PI also organizes the Madison Math Circle to offer mathematics educational content to local elementary, middle, and high school students.
