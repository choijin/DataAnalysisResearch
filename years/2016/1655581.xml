<AbstractNarration>In this Award from the NSF Science, Engineering and Education for Sustainability Fellows (SEES Fellows Program) Dr. Frank Leibfarth from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology will develop recyclable solid supports for the efficient and economical production of complex molecules, including polysaccharides, peptides and oligonucleotides.  This award has support from:  the Directorate for Engineering; and the Division of Chemistry and the Division of Materials Science in the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed work will combine solid phase synthesis on a polymer support with dynamic covalent chemistry with a continuous flow system to carry out the reactions that create the target molecules. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aim of studies like that proposed in this work is to develop better, more efficient methods for the synthesis of complex molecules (e.g. pharmaceuticals) with minimum production of chemical waste.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Leibfarth will be working with collaborators Prof. Timothy F. Jamison of the Department of Chemistry at the Massachusetts Institute of and Dr. Sejal Patel of Novartis Institutes of Biomedical Research.  Dr. Leibfarth will also work with the MIT Office of Engineering Outreach as well as the Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers on educational projects. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is supported under the NSF Science, Engineering and Education for Sustainability Fellows (SEES Fellows) program, with the goal of helping to enable discoveries needed to inform actions that lead to environmental, energy and societal sustainability while creating the necessary workforce to address these challenges. With SEES Fellows support, this project will enable a promising early career researcher to establish themselves in an independent research career related to sustainability.</AbstractNarration>

No current technology can recreate the structural fidelity of biopolymers in synthetic materials. As a consequence, synthetic polymers are traditionally used as static materials for packaging and structural support. We envisioned a new approach to the synthesis of structurally precise synthetic polymers by combining the benefits of continuous-flow chemistry and modern synthetic methods using iterative exponential growth.

Subsequent iterations through the Flow-IEG system enable an exponential increase in molecular weight, providing rapid access to unimolecular polymers. Introduction of monomers with alternate structures and/or branching units to the Flow-IEG system provides control over both polymer sequence and architecture. Employing this system, the synthesis of a unimolecular, sequence-defined macromolecule with a molecular weight of 4,023 g/mol has been achieved.
