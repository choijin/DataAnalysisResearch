<AbstractNarration>1665343&lt;br/&gt;Wang&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On August 27, 2016, a decline of the water level in a process water (wastewater) holding pond was observed at a fertilizer plant in Polk County, Florida. It was determined that the declining water level was due to a sinkhole formed under the pond, which resulted in the liner rupturing. The opening of the sinkhole was approximately 45 feet in diameter and the depth of the sinkhole reached the Upper Floridan aquifer. As a result of the sinkhole, approximately 980 million liters (260 million gallons) of contaminated radioactive water was drained into the Floridan aquifer. A contaminant transport model that incorporates an innovative tracer will be developed for this karst (calcium carbonate) aquifer system to characterize the spatial and temporal distribution of the contaminants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goals of the project are to assess: 1) what is the spatial and temporal distribution of the contaminated, radioactive processed water, that was discharged into the aquifer, 2) what is the impact to the environment and local community drinking water supplies, 3) how can the impacts of this hazard be minimized through optimal measures such as pumping or treatment, and, 4) what recommendations can be developed for the sinkhole site for purposes of remediation and repair. To achieve the goals the team will take water samples, at time intervals, from groundwater wells and surface water. These samples will be analyzed for constituents and parameters that are indicative of the released contaminated water. The site will be characterized by, but not limited to, hydrogeological data, satellite images, and, existing geotechnical data. The proposed project addresses the potential impact of the release on the public water supply and environment with a focus on monitoring and modeling contaminant transport in the karst aquifer systems. Although the process of contaminant transport in aquifers has been investigated in great detail, little is known about the effect of a large amount of contaminated water released into the karst aquifer in a short time period through a sinkhole. Groundwater is essential to the health and economic welfare of west central Florida, as 90 percent of the population in central Florida relies on groundwater resources for their drinking water supply. Pollution of groundwater by direct recharge through sinkholes thus presents a major threat to west central Florida drinking water supplies, impacting the environment and local economies. Understanding the fate and transport of contaminated water through the sinkhole is prerequisite for quantifying the impacts on water supply and receiving water bodies prior to the design and implementation of remediation procedures. The project will also contribute to the education and training of two graduate and two undergraduate students who will participate in the field work of water sampling and sinkhole site characterization, lab analyses of water samples, and developing a groundwater model for simulating the transport of contaminated radioactive water.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The proposed project addresses the potential impact of contaminated water, released into the Floridan aquifer system through a massive sinkhole in Mulberry, Florida, on the public water supply.  An investigation to determine possible impacts to the environment and local community drinking water supplies was conducted that included the monitoring and modeling the transport of the contaminated plume with focus on several public water production wells and two Polk County Utilities (PCU) water treatment facilities in proximity of the sinkhole event.

Adsorption was simulated as a removal mechanism that could further reduce the intensity of the plume.  The aquifer?s response to the release of contaminated water from the collapsed stack was quantified by simulating a number of scenarios, including variable radionuclide leakage quantities.  Results suggest that it may take between 11-17 years and between 5.2-8.3 km from the sinkhole leak to reduce radionuclide concentrations to previous levels.  Coupling the adsorption effect with minerals in the Floridan aquifer (e.g., ferrihydrite, carbonate) can reduce radionuclide migration time to 9-16 years and distances between 4.3-7.8 km from the sinkhole leak.    With the help of Tampa Bay Water (TBW) and Polk County Utilities (PCU), local community groundwater drinking water supplies identified to be most likely at risk were evaluated.

This project has supported fully two graduate students, partially three graduate students, and one undergraduate student.  One fully supported graduate student has graduated in Spring 2018 and her master?s thesis is assessing the impact of radionuclides released into the Floridan aquifer by a massive sinkhole on local municipal water supplies; and the other fully supported graduate student is expected to graduate in Summer 2019, and his PhD dissertation is modeling the fate and transport of radionuclides.  The project results have been published in three journal papers, one conference paper, and three conference presentations.
