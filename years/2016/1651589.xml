<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is a high efficiency, affordable and aesthetically pleasing solar product. Not only would this product make solar energy more affordable, it might also accelerate the migration to renewable energy. The proposed solar product could be integrated into residential roofing or perhaps another building integrated solution. The ultimate aim is to provide a solar solution that has the utility of ordinary solar panels but is lower cost and has improved aesthetic.  Potential applications for lower cost, lighter, solar panels will be explored.  Also, solar shingles and other building integrated solutions will be investigated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-corps project aims at realizing high efficiency and affordable solar by fabricating hybrid solar devices using a simple and low cost surface treatment for the silicon light absorber with a low cost polymer coating to complete the cell. Initial modeling suggests that high power efficiencies are attainable with this device structure.  A fundamental innovation is the development of a unique carrier selective contact that can be fabricated at low temperatures with simple, earth-abundant technology. In addition to its advantage of simple processing and high efficiency, other advantages include the use of lower cost silicon substrates, and low-cost local manufacture without toxic by-products.  Because of the simplicity of the fabrication, including module fabrication, this technology can be rapidly scaled. Because modules made using this technology will also be substantially lighter in weight than conventional modules, they may also provide another market opportunity by substantially reducing the installation costs.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Cancer impacts millions of Americans each year and has a staggering cost on both the patient and his or her family. Cancer surgery is one method to deal with this, however, it can have serious drawbacks.  For example, standard prostate cancer surgery currently has significant side effects, primarily sexual and urinary dysfunction, impacting more than 40% of patients.  These issues can be eliminated or greatly reduced through the use of minimally invasive MRI?guided thermal surgeries. However large-scale implementation of these techniques has been limited due to the inability to reliably monitor temperature during the procedures.  Our team has developed and patented a novel MRI temperature-sensitive contrast agent.  This original idea may transform current methods of MRI thermometry, providing reduced MRI guided surgery time, expense and improved outcomes.  Our objective is to commercialize this new technology.  The NSF I-Corps program allowed us to start this process.  During the I-Corps program, we completed more than 100 interviews with possible costumers. Among them were medical doctors from the Mayo Clinic in Rochester and the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) Medical College.  They agreed to perform ablation animal trials using our technology and help us developing MRI sequence to improve acquisition time of MR images.  We have been working with them after I-corps program was completed in order to eventually bring our technology to market.   The NSF I-corps program helped us to develop two parallel tracks that we need to pursue on the path to commercialization.  One is related to the FDA approval process of our technology and the implementation of the appropriate MRI sequences on the clinical scanners.  The second is associated with the production of nanoparticles and their distributions.  Currently, we plan to license our technology to the MRI agents? distributors.  Another important benefit of the I-corps program for us was guidance we obtained in the assessment of the total addressable market (TAM) value for our technology at this stage of technology development.   As a result, we have established a company, MRX Analytics PBC to commercialize our invention. We actively persuaded funding for our company and obtained one grant from the Colorado Advance Industrial Accelerator Program as well as a gift ($75,000) from Kairos Venture Partners.  We have submitted SBIR grants to NIH and NSF.  Moreover, to solve certain technical issues we secured access to different MRI scanners at the National Institute of Standards and Technology in Boulder, CO, and Mayo Clinic in Rochester, MN.  To summarize &ndash; without I-corps program it will not be possible for us to pursue commercialization for our invention.  This program gave us valuable directions on how to start this not easy path.             Last Modified: 10/04/2018       Submitted by: Zbigniew J Celinski]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
