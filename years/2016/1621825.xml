<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be to transform how substance use disorders (SUDs) are diagnosed, monitored and treated by creating an integrated technology platform for health care providers. One important application is the early detection of risky substance use behavior that, if treated in the beginning stages, will reduce the rate of fully developed SUDs. The research and development performed on this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be key to creating a novel bio-sensor based approach to diagnosing, monitoring and treating substance abuse patients.  The collected bio-sensor data can also inform treatment solutions to help address this tremendous problem, which affects millions of people, costs the US economy billions of dollars annually, and incurs a significant human cost in terms of lost lives, broken families, and unfulfilled potential.  There is also strong demand for a robust solution in places where substance use detection and monitoring is mandated for safety reasons, including the court system and the military services, as well as occupations like air traffic controllers, pilots, train operators, truck drivers, bus drivers, and operators of heavy machinery.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project will focus on integrating biosensors with smartphone technology to detect, collect, transmit, store, and analyze relevant biodata and to push resulting behavior change instructions to the user. By establishing a connection between the sensors and a smartphone application we will report substance abuse treatment outcome data much more accurately than is currently possible via self-reporting.  This system will address engineering, manufacturing, and calibration challenges of a highly accurate diagnostic tool. This technology bypasses the limitations of existing methods with a dramatically different approach. The technology aims to greatly simplify the process of SUD diagnosis and treatment by empowering health care providers to implement accurate data collection, early detection, and custom-tailored intervention within the context of any routine office visit.  The proposed project will address the development of a substance use measuring biosensor and assess the sensor lifetime, stability, reproducibility, and sensitivity.  It is intended to develop a biosensor that patients can wear for a period of time, that we can establish a meaningful connection between the sensor and the mobile application to replace self-reporting, and that concept support can be gained from broader representation of primary care physicians and major insurance companies</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   Accomplishments: CARI Therapeutics successfully built an ethanol biosensor that is highly selective, sensitive, accurate, and stable in phosphate buffer solution (PBS) and serum.  In addition, CARI Therapeutics successfully linked this biosensor to a wearable device that non-invasively collects physiological measurements, such as heart rate (HR) and galvanic skin response (GSR), which could be proxy indicators for stress.  Finally, the team successfully connected CARI, the App to data from the ethanol biosensor and the wearable device, displaying it on a clinician's dashboard.On June 9, 2017 the University of San Diego, California (UCSD), a sub-awardee of this grant, filed a provisional patent application via EFS Attorney Docket No. 37866-607P01US/2017-342-1 titled: IMPLANTABLE BIOSENSOR.  CARI Therapeutics subsequently signed an evaluation license agreement for the commercialization of this innovative technology.  Major Activities:During Phase I the team conducted a series of experiments to assess the alcohol biosensor performance, including measuring spiked ethanol in phosphate buffered saline (PBS), generating calibration curves, and assessing reproducibility.  In addition, the team measured sensor lifetime through repeated measurements and performed development work on a wearable sensor platform to measure heart rate as well as galvanic skin response with the prototype. Those results were then compared to electrocardiogram (ECG) and commercial instrument measurements. In order to demonstrate a Bluetooth link between a smartphone and wearable device the team developed a user interface on CARI, The App to display blood alcohol concentration (BAC) and stress indicators on the App as well as on a web based clinician?s dashboard. Finally, the team conducted more than 200 in-person and phone interviews via 3 I-Corps programs for hypothetical receptivity to our proposed solution, in addition to 205 online surveys with potential patients.Potential ImpactsContinuous monitoring, whether it is conducted invasively or non-invasively, would be adopted broadly if mandated by the judicial system or other organizations. While many experts we spoke to validated the merits of our approach, they expressed concerns about the invasive nature of our sensor, which may delay organizational mandates from insurance companies, active duty military, the Veteran?s Administration, the judicial system, and workplaces. Therefore, until one or more of the larger market segments implement a mandate, the adoption of this kind of a sensor will rely on high motivation from individuals.  The overall feedback was encouraging and many professionals were receptive to the concept of the proposed monitoring system. The customer discovery process yielded a beachhead target market with highly motivated individuals: Licensed professionals who are on probation for violating substance abuse policies. These professionals are highly motivated to use a more convenient alternative to current drug monitoring methods because their monitoring program requires them to undergo random urine testing for up to 5 years, which is extremely inconvenient, and they must pay for each test out of pocket.  The societal impact of successful penetration of this market is high, since this technology will not only help the licensed professionals preserve their livelihoods, but it will also allow them to continue serving others. Overall, the conclusion from our customer discovery efforts was that it will likely take some time for the markets we have identified so far to issue a mandate, making broad adoption a lengthy, but worthwhile process with the potential for high societal impact.
