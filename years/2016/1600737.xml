<AbstractNarration>The 2016 "Houston Summer School on Dynamical Systems" will take place May 17-26, 2016 at the University of Houston.  This event will introduce graduate students to recent progress and novel techniques in probabilistic dynamics and ergodic theory, as well as giving a bird's-eye view of fundamental areas of dynamics.  The school will also cover applications to other areas where these ideas are useful, such as mathematical neuroscience, statistical mechanics, and information theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The core of the school will consist of four lecture series covering topics in uniform hyperbolicity; partial hyperbolicity; parabolic dynamics and renormalization; and decay of correlations via spectral gap, coupling, and cones.  These lectures will be given by internationally recognized researchers in dynamical systems:  Boris Hasselblatt (Tufts University); Keith Burns (Northwestern University); Jayadev Athreya (Washington); Vaughn Climenhaga (Houston); Matt Nicol (Houston); Will Ott (Houston); Andrew Torok (Houston).  The school will also include: further lectures on advanced topics and applications; informal review sessions; problem sessions; and project sessions, with particular emphasis on maximizing interactions between students and lecturers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The summer school URL is: http://www.math.uh.edu/~climenha/2016-school.html</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The "2016 Houston Summer School in Dynamical Systems" was held from May 18-26, 2016 at the University of Houston.  There were 49 graduate student participants.  The event consisted of four short courses in dynamical systems theory, emphasizing the study of dynamical systems displaying some degree of hyperbolic ("chaotic") behavior, and in particular, what statistical properties are satisfied by such systems; to what degree do observations of such a system behave randomly in the long run?  This involved mini-courses on decay of correlations (given by the co-PIs of this grant); hyperbolic systems in smooth ergodic theory (given by Federico Rodriguez Hertz, from Penn State); multiplicative ergodic theory and applications to atmospheric dynamical systems (given by Anthony Quas, from Victoria); and applications to number theory via diagonal actions (given by Yitwah Cheung, from San Francisco State).  As part of the event, the participants also completed short projects that involved reading and reporting on a paper from the literature.  Video recordings of the lectures have been made available at https://www.math.uh.edu/dynamics/school/school2016/  In a survey given at the end of the event, student feedback was very positive; every respondent indicated that they would recommend the summer school to other students interested in dynamical systems.  A similar event was run in May 2017 (video recordings can be accessed through the above website), and another such event is being run in May 2018.
