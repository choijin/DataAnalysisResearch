<AbstractNarration>Electrochemistry provides a clean and efficient way of producing structural metals at industrial scales.  Electricity can be used to produce metal and oxygen or sulfur gas from raw ore whilst avoiding the emissions associated with traditional carbon coke-based production methods.  This project seeks to understand how bubble evolution (whether oxygen or sulfur gas) affects the distribution of current across the anode (oxidizing electrode) in an electrochemical cell.  Electrochemical engineering principles will be applied so that the results will be applicable to a wide variety of chemical systems and geometries. This research will be performed in collaboration with Professor Takayuki Homma at Waseda University and Professor Toshiyuki Nohira at Kyoto University, both of whom have great expertise with interfacial characterization.  The findings will be critical designing more energy efficient electrolysis reactors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will utilize the high speed camera capabilities at Waseda University to observe directly the production of electrolytic bubbles and correlate the effect on the current density distribution.  Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) convection will serve as a tool to enhance mass transfer at the anode surface.  Confocal laser scanning microscopy at Kyoto University will be used additionally to characterize the interfacial phenomena.  Experimental results corresponding to different values of the mass Rayleigh number (Ram) relevant for metal sulfide electrolysis will be analyzed with previously developed computational methods within the Japanese labs.  By developing a correlation between mass transfer and current density distribution, this project will aid in the design of more efficient electrolysis reactors with the industrial scale in mind.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award under the East Asia and Pacific Summer Institutes program supports summer research by a U.S. graduate student and is jointly funded by NSF and the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Many structural and strategic metals such as copper, molybdenum, rhenium, lead, zinc, silver, cadmium, and nickel are mined as sulfide-bearing ores.  Traditional pyrometallurgical methods of producing these metals invariably generate sulfur dioxide as a by-product which must be captured and converted to sulfuric acid which is a capital-intensive process.  Direct electrowinning of these sulfide bearing-ores is an energy-efficient and environmentally-friendly method of producing these important metals.  Electrowinning of metallic ores, whether they be oxide-based, chloride-based, or sulfide-based, all have the common feature of evolving gas as the complementary reaction to producing the metal of interest.   This award was utilized to gain fundamental insight into gas evolution and its effect on energy efficiency in electrochemical cells.  Specifically, oxygen evolution in aqueous based electrolytes was recorded under different hydrodynamic regimes and the effect of physicochemical properties such as viscosity and surface tension of the electrolyte on the voltage (power) required was quantified.  Similar experiments were conducted in a molten salt electrolyte consisting of liquid metal chlorides where instead of oxygen, chlorine gas was evolved.  Due to the dynamic similarity between oxygen evolution and chlorine evolution, the PI is working towards establishing a non-dimensional correlation that accurately describes the mass transfer involved in both cases.  It is the non-dimensional nature of this correlation that allows one to describe systems of seemingly very different properties.  This correlation will be used to investigate sulfur evolution in molten metal sulfide electrolytes, where the hydrodynamic conditions are not yet known.  The PI has presented some of the preliminary results at the Twelfth Workshop on Reactive Metals (RMW12) which focuses on high temperature electrolysis to produce metals that cannot be produced using water-based electrolysis methods.  The PI will present a more comprehensive analysis of the results at the 68th Annual Meeting of the International Society of Electrochemistry that highlights the similarity between oxygen evolution in water-based electrolytes and chlorine evolution in molten salt electrolytes.  The findings covered in this presentation will be submitted to a peer reviewed journal for dissemination to a wider audience.  Because gas evolution is so ubiquitous in electrolysis, the findings of this award can help guide the energy-efficient design of electrochemical reactors of many different industries.
