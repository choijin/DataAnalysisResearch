<AbstractNarration>1623816&lt;br/&gt;Georgen&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Division of Earth Sciences Instrumentation and Facilities Program grant supports acquisition of computational equipment to support research and research training in geophysics and geodynamics.  Funding would allow for purchase of two Mac Pro desktops with 3.5 GHz six-core CPUs, 64 Gb RAM and dual GPUs each to support larger numerical model domains and smaller grid resolutions to better model geological processes with high spatial and temporal gradients, better handling of time-dependent solutions, and higher overall higher model throughput.  This support is congruent with NSFs mission of promoting the progress of science and advancing the national health, prosperity and welfare given the importance of training the next generation scientific workforce in computational modeling techniques and the societal importance of understanding the impacts of changing climate and sea level on terrestrial hydrologic reservoirs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research will focus on modeling of geodynamics processed including mantle plume ? mid ocean ridge interactions, subduction zone dynamics and effects of sea level change on groundwater hydrology and submarine groundwater discharge along the eastern Mid-Atlantic shore.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This award funded the upgrade of hardware and software in a computer lab for marine geology and geophysics research at Old Dominion University.  In addition to the research of the PI, the laboratory also supports the training of graduate and undergraduate students in the Department of Ocean, Earth, and Atmospheric Sciences, contributing to workforce development in the geosciences.  Lab members utilize a range of numerical models and perform analyses of large datasets such as bathymetry, marine gravity, and seafloor magnetics.  Areas of research investigation include volcanic activity along mid-ocean ridges, magmatism generated by mantle plumes, and groundwater flow in the continental margin.  Insights gained from these investigations allow for better understanding of fluid flow processes at many spatial and temporal scales within the Earth.  For example, one project involves constraining how rising sea levels affect flow of groundwater from the terrestrial to the marine domain, the location of the freshwater/saltwater interface, and the rate of submarine groundwater discharge.  Another focus of activity in the laboratory is the development of digital geoscience education modules, which are aimed at the undergraduate level and are available to any instructor at no cost to download.  These modules help to make geology more accessible to those who might not be able to participate in traditional outdoor field trips due to factors such as disabilities or family care obligations.  Many of the exercises are customizable so that educators can adapt lesson plans to most benefit their curriculum requirements.
