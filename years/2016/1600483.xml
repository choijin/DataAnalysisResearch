<AbstractNarration>Extremal graph theory studies properties of very large networks. Especially with the advent of interest in big data, such networks appear in a host of very important applications. In this project, the researchers focus on the density of small substructures appearing in large networks. The goal is to further develop a powerful method based on semidefinite programming, allowing its application to more complicated structures and longstanding problems in the field.  The project involves undergraduate and graduate students.  Open-source software under development in the project will be made readily available to other researchers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research project aims to extend and develop the flag algebra method to new models in order to solve longstanding open problems, principally in extremal combinatorics. In prior work, the investigators and collaborators created a stability method and a blow-up technique using flag algebras. The stability method can be applied to solve problems, previously impervious to attack, where the extremal construction has an iterative structure. The blow-up technique translates questions on small graphs into the language of graph limits accessible to flag algebras, building bridges from one area of graph theory to another. This project will develop these techniques further for application to a number of important topics, including crossing numbers and small Ramsey numbers. It is expected that the work will draw on tools from linear and nonlinear programming to obtain exact results. The investigators will involve graduate students at their schools in the project and will work with graduate students from other schools during annual workshops.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project funded an REU involving two students in the summer of 2019: Dalton Smith and Michael Burgher.  For eight weeks, the students together with the PI determined the inducibility of several small directed graphs using flag algebra methods.  The students presented the results at Math Fest in Cincinatti. A journal article is still a work in progress.  The inducibility of a graph is the maximuym density of induced copies of that graph in a very large (or infinite)  host graph. These quantities are a central question in extremal grap theory. Nevertheless, exact answers are known only for very few graphs and even fewer directed graphs.  The extremal graphs can have beautiful structure. Sometimes, they look like a blow-up of a small structure. Other times, they have fractal structures with self similarities on every level of magnification. Yet other times, they can have random or pseudo random structure, or a combination of all the previous elements.  Subgraph densities are central to the theory of graph limits. They help to determine the structure of very large graphs, too large to study directly. As in many applications, graphs of immense size appear, the fundamental questions on subgraph density are a focus of recent research activity.  Flag Algebras were developed by Razborov to study such and related quantities. Polynomial inequalities of subgraph densities can be expressed as linear inequalities of other densities. Then, semidefinite programming is used to find optimal inequalities for a given problem.          Last Modified: 01/09/2020       Submitted by: Florian Pfender]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
