<AbstractNarration>This project is funded by the Chemical Measurement and Imaging program of the Chemistry Division of the National Science Foundation. Professor Shigeru Amemiya of the University of Pittsburgh is developing new experimental strategies to measure the high electrochemical reactivity of clean graphitic surfaces of traditional carbon materials and emerging carbon nanomaterials. A simple approach is developed to maintain clean graphitic surfaces in the research laboratory as well as in industrial settings where the mass production of carbon electrodes is important. Clean graphitic surfaces may improve the performance of the low-cost carbon electrodes that are widely used for fuel cells, batteries, solar cells, and supercapacitors. In addition, undergraduate students, female students, and students from underrepresented groups are recruited and trained through various nanoelectrochemical research activities. Other activities include industrial collaborations, and the implementation of nanoelectrochemistry experiments for the undergraduate laboratory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is focused on the electrochemical study of clean graphitic surfaces for a greater fundamental understanding and better future applications of carbon electrochemistry. New technologies developed in the Amemiya laboratory are combined to enable the first reactivity measurement of unambiguously clean graphitic surfaces. Specifically, the clean graphitic surface is protected from airborne hydrophobic contaminants by condensing a nanometer-thick adlayer of water on the surfaces in humidified air.  The surface is maintained in electrolyte solutions containing extremely low concentrations of organic impurities. The ultrafast electron-transfer kinetics of water-protected clean graphitic surfaces are then measured quantitatively and reliably by employing nanogap voltammetry and scanning electrochemical microscopy.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The proposed research made enormously broad and sustainable impacts on the advancement of fundamental and applied electrochemistry, which is central to devices for clean energy generation and storage including batteries, solar cells, supercapacitors, and fuel cells. Many of these electrochemical devices require the fast transfer of electrons between a graphitic surface and a redox-active molecule in solution. In this project, we not only revealed the intrinsically fast electron-transfer kinetics of clean graphitic surfaces but also understood the origins of the extraordinary electrochemical reactivity. The first measurement of the unprecedentedly high electrochemical reactivity of unambiguously clean graphitic surfaces was enabled by combining two of the new methodologies developed in our laboratory through the NSF support. Fundamentally, this project enormously augmented our knowledge and understanding in various scientific fields beyond electrochemistry such as chemical sensor, material science, nanotechnology, and nanoscience.  Practically, the proposed work enables researchers to readily and reproducibly obtain clean graphitic surfaces and take advantage of their high electrochemical reactivity, thereby transforming the large and important fields of carbon electrochemistry and carbon material science to realize an energy-efficient, clean society. The establishment of clean graphitic surfaces in this project is highly significant, because graphitic materials have been used as important electrode materials for almost any type of electrochemical energy applications. Specifically, we developed methods to coat removable thin films on clean graphitic surfaces for protection from adventitious contamination in air and electrolyte solutions. Such an extra effort will be affordable in large-scale industrial settings to improve the performance of commercial electrochemical devices. In fact, ultralow-humidity high-energy-consuming clean rooms have been developed to mass produce large lithium ion batteries for electric vehicles. Moreover, the U.S. Department of Energy conducted a four-year project to thoroughly address the organic contamination of proton exchange membrane fuel cells for electric vehicles including airborne contamination.
