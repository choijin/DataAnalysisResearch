<AbstractNarration>In this project funded by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Sean T. Roberts of the University of Texas at Austin and his graduate students study very small inorganic particles called semiconductor nanocrystals.  Nanocrystals are tiny particles that contain thousands of atoms. While they are much larger than chemical molecules, which contain only a few atoms, they are still much smaller than solid materials that are large enough to see with the naked eye, containing trillions of atoms. Nanoscale materials are unique because they have sizes intermediate between molecules and solids, but sometimes have properties not easily predicted by averaging the two size extremes. The optical properties of these nanocrystals can be tuned by altering their size and shape, which makes them useful for applications such as displays, photovoltaic cells, and photodetectors. However, processing these materials into conductive thin films needed for electronics remains difficult. The researchers approach this challenge by combining the nanocrystals with surface-bound molecules designed to improve the electrical conductivity of nanocrystal thin films. The resulting structures are studied using spectroscopic techniques and photoconductivity measurements. This project also includes an outreach effort entitled GReen Energy At Texas (GREAT) designed to attract Community College students to the physical sciences by introducing them to green energy research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The specific goals of this project are to understand the key factors that facilitate electronic coupling between semiconductor nanocrystals and their surface ligands and to use interactions of this type to improve charge transport in nanocrystal optoelectronic films. The nature of the ligand can impact the bandgap and optical properties of semiconductor nanocrystals. This suggests some degree of electronic coupling between the nanocrystals and the ligands that involves charge transfer. This project quantitatively assesses the degree to which ligands facilitate charge transfer between nanocrystals in thin film. To accomplish this goal, time-resolved Raman spectroscopy is used to map charge density changes within nanocrystal ligand shells following photoexcitation. Two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy and photo-CELIV (charge extraction by linearly increasing voltage) measurements determine how exciton-delocalizing ligands (EDLs) modify charge carrier transport in nanocrystal thin films.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Semiconductor nanocrystals are an interesting form of matter as their electronic and optical properties can be readily altered by adjusting their size and shape. This degree of chemical tunability has made semiconductor nanocrystals attractive light absorbers and emitters for a range of applications that extends from solar cells and light sensors to light emitting diodes and fluorescent tags for imaging. However, while these materials are seeing integration within the commercial marketplace in products such as displays and fluorescent tags wherein nanocrystals serve as light emitters, applications where nanocrystals act as light harvesters, such as in solar cells and sensors, are hindered due to challenges associated with moving charge and energy from a nanocrystal into its environment.</p> <p>To address these challenges, in this project we have investigated several nanocrystal systems wherein we have attached molecular ligands that are designed to aid charge and/or energy extraction from a nanocrystal. First, we have characterized the impact of exciton-delocalizing ligands (EDLs) on energy transport in nanocrystal solids. EDLs are molecules that, due to orbital mixing, relax the spatial confinement of charge carriers when bound to a nanocrystal surface. In nanocrystal solids, we have found that EDLs reduce tunneling barriers for charge transfer and hence can speed the transport of excitons (electron-hole pairs) by several orders of magnitude (Azzaro et al, <em>Nano Lett</em>., <strong>18, </strong>(2018), 3259; <strong>Figure 1</strong>).</p> <p>Second, we have examined hybrid materials comprised of silicon nanocrystals functionalized with anthracene molecules. When photoexcited, these nanocrystals pass energy in the form of spin-triplet excitons (electron-hole pairs) through the anthracene and into their local environment. Pairs of these excitons can merge via a process known as triplet fusion to produce a molecule in an emissive, high-energy state. This allows the system as a whole to function as a photon upconversion system that absorbs green-to-red light but produces violet emission (Xia et al, <em>Nat. Chem.</em>, <strong>12</strong>, (2020), 137; <strong>Figure 2</strong>). As silicon is nontoxic, this material may find application in deep-tissue imaging and other biological applications.</p> <p>Lastly, we have studied how tin-doped indium oxide (ITO) nanocrystals transfer energy to their environment following photoexcitation. The high level of tin incorporated into ITO nanocrystals allows them to support a large number of free charge carriers that cause the nanocrystals to exhibit metal-like properties. We find photoexciting thin films of these nanocrystals using near-infrared light significantly heats these free electrons, which in turn alters the film?s optical properties. While ITO nanocrystal films are nominally transparent to visible light, we find that under near-infrared illumination these films become highly reflective due to heating of their electrons (Blemker et al, <em>ACS Photonics</em>, <strong>7</strong>, (2020), 1188; <strong>Figure 3</strong>). Upon near-infrared light removal, these hot electrons dissipate their energy to their environment in less than a picosecond, suggesting these films may be of use as fast photogates for photonic circuits and related optoelectronic applications.</p> <p>In addition to the scientific outcomes from this project, we have also created an educational program, Chemical REsearch At TExas (CREATE), in partnership with Austin Community College.
