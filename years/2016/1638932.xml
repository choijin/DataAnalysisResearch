<AbstractNarration>The world is being changed by Big Data, and data science is receiving a remarkably rapid uptake across the nation and the globe as it institutionalized in university curricula, state governance, and industry strategy. Across the sciences, state and industry, new forms of data collection and analysis hold the prospect of our being able to address the major social and scientific issues of our times: from responding to natural disasters to monitoring the environment to developing fundamental technological insights which will revolutionize industry.  None of this will happen by fiat ? the development of the appropriate data analytics must be accompanied by new organizational alignments between research, policy and industry.  The Big Data Hubs and Spokes (BDHubs) program is a key site for analyzing the nature of these alignments with a view to gaining a basic understanding of the stakes as the terrain shifts.  All long-term research and innovation infrastructure must adapt to such ongoing changes. This research will contribute to understanding institutional flexibility: strategies, techniques and organizational innovations to adapt to changes in regulatory, policy and funding environments.  We can expect but not precisely predict, continuing transformations in the sociotechnical, scientific and institutional ecologies of today?s research and scientific infrastructure.  This project will investigate the ongoing activities at the BDHubs and its partner institutions, their emerging plans for the future, and tie these to the long-history of developing research infrastructures (50+ years) to understand the changes we can expect BDHubs to encounter over time (scientific, technological and institutional), and what strategies they employ in the face of transformations to the landscape of science, information technology and institutional environment. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many challenges facing contemporary science such as environmental research or chronic disease management require long-term studies and supporting infrastructures. This project will contribute directly to NSF and other efforts to build more open, effective, and sustainable knowledge communities across the sciences, industry and government. Improving understanding of the long-term trajectory of research infrastructure will lead to smarter and more sustainable investment and design choices on the part of project leaders, participants, tool builders, and funders. Many other science agencies are in the midst of funding such cross-cutting projects. This research will inform science policy and regulatory environments to help develop sustainable and productive research infrastructures. In order to do so, this study will develop a general organizational understanding of the development of large-scale and long-term endeavors in the data sciences and map the institutional landscape of modern data science with particular focus on the activities of infrastructure building, policy development and community formation. In addition, this study will help to develop an understanding of the ?rise of the data sciences? in the US both as an institutional movement and as a form of technical research, with special focus on establishing a framework for evaluating and understanding large-scale, cross-disciplinary collaboration on big data tools, techniques and methods.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In this first of its kind study, we engaged with the development and initial stages of establishment of a novel organization intended to provide a knowledge-infrastructure and consortium for the institutionalization of the data sciences called The Big Data Hubs and Spokes. This ethnographic study engaged with organizational leadership, history and outreach efforts to better describe and understand how a nascent field of study becomes a part of the institutional landscape - in academia, in industry, and in government.  Resulting from this study we published papers describing how data scientists initially engage with, learn about, and select from existing resources in a dynamic we call 'Prospecting', and considering a fundamental logic that has become a key organizing principle for contemporary computing projects and in broader science policy wherein collectives of expertise are parsed into ‘domains’ that are to be studied or engaged in order to inform computational advancements and/or interventions on the domains themselves. An additional publication in-progress will reconsider how we evaluate and understand the outcomes of infrastructural, consortium-building and other coordinating efforts in terms of those outcomes that are resistant to quantification and tracking, and propose a model for accounting for those outcomes ecologically in understanding and representing the impact of these efforts.  In our engagement with a regionally-seperated, yet national-scale effort to coordinate and empower data science across sectors, we contributed to the growth and development of multi-sited ethnographic methods, and provided an understanding of how the infrastructures of science work to coordinate and empower those who make use of them.
