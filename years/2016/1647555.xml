<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will investigate novel&lt;br/&gt;approaches for biopolymer materials that uniquely enable oxygen incorporation into hydrogel&lt;br/&gt;dressings to improve and accelerate chronic wound healing. The proposed work differs drastically&lt;br/&gt;from other research programs and commercial efforts to use oxygen in chronic wound healing as&lt;br/&gt;it is the first to combine oxygen, a moist and clean healing environment, and antimicrobial&lt;br/&gt;properties into one cost-effective and easy-to-use product. Current commercial oxygen-delivery&lt;br/&gt;therapies for wound care, e.g., hyperbaric oxygen chambers and topical oxygen devices, are&lt;br/&gt;intermittent, inconvenient to use, and require access to expensive specialized equipment.&lt;br/&gt;Successfully introducing oxygenating wound dressings to the market will allow addressing the&lt;br/&gt;serious and pervasive burden on healthcare facilities and the exorbitant costs associated with&lt;br/&gt;chronic wound care. In the USA alone, diabetic chronic wounds cause direct healthcare-related&lt;br/&gt;costs of $1.5 billion and total direct and indirect costs of $20 billion.&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research incorporates proprietary patent-pending biopolymer materials and&lt;br/&gt;processing methods to create oxygenating hydrogels that can be made into wound dressings.&lt;br/&gt;The dressings have the unique potential to provide uniform and tunable oxygenation to heal&lt;br/&gt;chronic wounds. Dressing embodiments, syntheses, and manufacturing techniques will be&lt;br/&gt;explored to improve product performance and characteristics, reduce costs, and demonstrate&lt;br/&gt;commercial feasibility and viability of the production process. Thus, knowledge of biomaterials for&lt;br/&gt;wound care will be significantly advanced by the proposed research. Prototype wound dressings&lt;br/&gt;will be characterized and tested based on customer requirements.</AbstractNarration>
