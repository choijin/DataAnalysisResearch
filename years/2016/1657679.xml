<AbstractNarration>CBET - 1441457&lt;br/&gt;This proposal is to conduct a workshop to examine fundamental science needs in NanoEHS.  Research in this topic has reached a plateau of understanding by using fundamental testing methods.  New approaches to deeper scientific questions are needed.  The workshop will identify new questions in order to bring a better understanding of the interactions of nanomaterials with living systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goals of the workshop are as follows:&lt;br/&gt;1. Engage a broad range of participants to focus on the theme of the workshop topic NanoEHS: Fundamental Science Needs&lt;br/&gt;2. Identify areas where fundamental studies are needed to better understand NanoEHS.&lt;br/&gt;3. Identify challenges and opportunities in understanding NanoEHS: Fundamental Science Needs, i.e. identify problems, techniques and methods including, but not limited to, the role of computation and theory, size-dependent behavior for very small particles such as quantum size effects, and surface structure.&lt;br/&gt;4. Articulate the importance of fundamental physics and chemistry within interdisciplinary approaches to NanoEHS: Fundamental Science Needs and identify opportunities for collaboration.&lt;br/&gt;5. Prepare a manuscript to a journal that summarizes and highlights the workshop discussion and findings.&lt;br/&gt;6. Disseminate workshop findings further in a symposium at an upcoming Sustainable Nanotechnology Organization (SNO) Meeting or some other appropriate meeting venue.</AbstractNarration>

Following the workshop, a workshop report was written with input from all attendees. This report was then submitted for publication  in the journal Environmental Science:Nano where it was peer reviewed and then published.   A number of recommendations were given within the article and a conceptual framework for this important topic was outlined. The peer-reviewed publication insures widespread dissemination of the workshop discussion and recommendations.  Additionally, the workshop recommendation has been presented and discussed at scientific meetings.       Last Modified: 06/25/2017       Submitted by: Vicki H Grassian]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
