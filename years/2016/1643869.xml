<AbstractNarration>The Scholars of Excellence in Engineering and Computer Science (SEECS) program will be an interdisciplinary, multi-year, mixed academic-level program offering scholarships to engineering and computer science majors with academic talent and financial need. The goals of the scholarship program will be to: (1) increase the number of low-income, academically talented students in engineering and computer science majors, (2) assist students in continuing their STEM education through graduation, (3) foster professional development for STEM careers and graduate education, and (4) study the impact of targeted intervention strategies on retention of STEM majors. Students awarded SEECS scholarships will be required to attend a seminar with a team-based, project-based environment structure. The SEECS seminar will encompass three components: engineering design, professional development, and personal development. Facets of STEM majors' professional and personal development will be addressed through workshops, university support services, lectures, and invited speakers. While the professional and personal development facets will occur through typical seminar activities, such as guest speakers and reflective activities, the engineering design component will be the pivotal experience to connect and build engineering competency and personal confidence. Additionally, the design projects will benefit regional service organizations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The SEECS academic-research project will assess the effect of academic interventions on retention rates of high-performing students at the University. University-wide data will be analyzed to monitor the individual effects of intervention strategies. Peer-assisted study strategies (PASS) will be utilized as an intervention to address potential low academic performance. PASS uses peer-tutored extra help sessions for identified attrition point courses. SEECS will evaluate the success of PASS programs in reducing attrition. Project resources will be utilized to investigate the research question: Does peer-assisted study have a measurable positive effect on academic performance for nominally high-achieving students? Additionally, the project will continue to study and disseminate the effect of experiential education as expressed through community-service design projects. The expected outcomes of the proposed work include the dissemination of: (1) research study results, (2) program structure and successes to provide a model for implementation, and (3) student-generated STEM solutions to support local non-profit organizations.</AbstractNarration>

Paired with a community non-profit organization, the team of scholars identified and designed a solution to a STEM-related problem to aid the organization.  Such enrichment activities made the scholars more aware of the role of STEM professionals and helped them develop the social and leadership skills for their future careers.  The active projects during the last year of the award and the nonprofit they support follow:  -          Green Gym (energy recovery from fitness equipment and distribution) for the Recreational Wellness Center, Gannon  -          Hydroponics Systems for three L'Arche, Erie homes  -          Extended data collection during the winter months for the Regional Science Consortium  -          Raised Garden for the Alzheimer Unit in the Pennsylvania Soldiers and Sailors Home     Results: SEECS has successfully met its objectives of providing scholarships to targeted students, achieving 80% freshmen-to-sophomore retention, creating a professional development course for the scholars, and achieving and maintaining over 24% of women representation (refer to Table 1).       Table 1: Summary SEECS at Gannon   University (2017-2021)           Year 1  (2017-18)    Year 2  (2018-19)    Year 3  (2019-20)    Year 4  (2020-21)      #   of SEECS-eligible university applicants (Obj. 1)    96    91    96    80      #   of applications for freshman cohort (Obj. 1)    18    21    34    22      #   of accepted awards, freshman cohort (Obj. 1)    7    8    10    9      Female   applications, freshmen (Obj. 1 &amp; 4)    38%    33%    50%    27%      # of accepted awards, all cohorts   (Obj. 1)    25    22    24    26      Females, across all cohorts (Obj.   4)    44%    41%    58%    58%      Average award (Obj. 1)    $6,067    $6,402    $6,325    $8,460      Freshmen-to-sophomore retention   (Obj.2 ? target 80%)    86%    88%    80%    88%      Year-to-year retention in STEM    100%    95%    100%    100%      Graduates of SEECS Program (Obj.   4)    9    5    5    5      Graduates   employed in STEM field or continuing their education (Obj. 4)    9    5    5    5          Four design projects were completed for regional non-profit organizations during this grant period.  These projects have had significant regional impact and have significant global implication, addressing both environmental and human needs.  Students have showcased their community-based design project yearly via poster presentations at the American Society for Engineering Education (ASEE) North Central Section Conference.    During this grant period, four conference papers (ASEE Annual Meetings) have been published by the PIs reporting many aspects of the SEECS program.   Finally, the program has met the intellectual merit and broader impact criteria of SEECS by having: (1) enhanced the disposition of the scholars towards engineering, service, and professionalism, (2) achieved retention objectives, (3) enabled collaborative PI-students scholarly activities, (4) disseminated the program structure and successes through professional outlets, thereby providing a model for implementation, (5) increased the involvement of women in STEM professions by continuing with successful recruitment practices, and (6) provided enrichment and professional development activities.
