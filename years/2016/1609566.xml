<AbstractNarration>The overarching theme of this Research Experiences for Teachers (RET) in Engineering and Computer Science Site at the University of Pittsburgh, entitled, "Quality of Life Technology (QoLT) Research Experience for Teachers," is related to the development of products and processes that transform lives in a growing segment of the population-people with reduced functional capabilities due to aging or disability. QoLT is a natural fit for this site because the Pittsburgh region is presently a world leader in research and development related to the aging and disability communities; therefore a high density of rewarding research opportunities are available for RET participants.  All of these opportunities are grounded within a common QoLT research focus, through collaborations between University of Pittsburgh's Department of Rehabilitation Science and Technology (RST) Human Engineering Research Laboratories (HERL) and Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) Human Computer Interaction (HCII) and Robotics Institutes (RI). The research and development projects will build upon recent advances in QoLT that enable people with disabilities to live more independently in their homes and maximize their community participation.  This site builds on previously successful RET programs at the University of Pittsburgh with the core objective of improving the STEM capacity of the nation's students by using product innovation techniques to provide applied outlets for teachers and their students.  The RET research focus is of social significance and will contribute towards the development of technologies that will increase persons with disabilities' independence. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Over three years, 30 STEM high school teachers, from high need urban high schools in Pittsburgh comprised of minority and low socio-economic status students, will take part in a 14-week research experience, including a product innovation course in the fall and a 4-week curriculum development experience over the summer.  This RET Site retains a QoLT engineering research theme and a focus on math through product development economics, while adding a focus on design and peer assessment pedagogy. The site will continue to integrate military veterans with disabilities transitioning to college into project teams, allowing for cross-mentorship and a personal connection to the research.  The site's approach involves a seamless transition between the research experience and teaching via a common product innovation focus, drawing upon institutional strengths in the research and innovation of HERL and curriculum reform expertise from the Learning Research and Development Center (LRDC). This RET will become a vehicle to develop and strengthen teachers' skills in design based learning (DBL) through unique peer assessment approaches that can reduce burden and increase students' learning outcomes.  The unique approach of incorporating flipped classroom modules for the innovation course and an online high school student design competition promotes scalability through potential adoption of the program's methods throughout the full RET network and other interested teachers throughout Pittsburgh and the nation.</AbstractNarration>
