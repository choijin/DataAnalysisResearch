<AbstractNarration>The proposed project seeks financial support for graduate students who will attend their first national meeting, young faculty who will give oral presentation, and those who belong to the underrepresented groups to attend a Workshop that will be  held October 2-7, 2016 at the Hilton Orlando, Buena Vista Hotel in Orlando, Florida, The Workshop will allow to promote science by providing a forum for exchange of knowledge among scientists and engineers working in the field of III-nitride semiconductor materials and devices It will address  a large variety of topics with emphasis on growth, devices, defects and new material and device concepts. The workshop will include 20 invited talks and poster sessions. There will be three short courses and a rump session has also been planned. The courses will be on X-ray diffraction of GaN-related materials; Growth of GaN-on-Silicon applied to LED and HEMTs; and Simulation and modeling of GaN LEDs and HEMTs. The timing of this workshop is perfect for this generation of students to learn how the new science and technology of semiconductors is developing. It will help students and other young scientists to develop a multidisciplinary understanding of nitride semiconductor research.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The International Workshop on Nitride Semiconductors (IWN) is the preeminent international conference in the field of III-Nitride semiconductors. The IWN 2016 conference drew attendance of approximately 900 including attendees from Ameicas, Europe and Asia.  All types of research institutions (acadmia, government research institutes and industrial laboratories) were represented.   Nitride-based semiconductors are among the most promising materials for the next generation of electronic and optoelectronic applications.  Through this project, NSF supported the organization of the IWN 2016.  Thanks to NSF funding, the organizers were able to reduce the registration cost of 26 graduate students who attended the conference.  This support allowed the student participants to gain exposure to the  new concepts of gallium nitride materials and devices.  The timing of the conference was ideal for this generation of students to learn how this new family of semiconductors has developed and how companies all around the world are positioning themselves to take advantage of the new opportunities enabled by gallium nitride.  These lessons will be useful beyond current gallium nitride devices, as these students will be able to apply them to any future new materials and technologies that they will encounter during their career.  The presence of a large number of young researchers helped create a vibrant and stimulating atmosphere, and there was ample opportunity for young researchers to engage in scientific discussions with their peers and senior plenary speakers.
