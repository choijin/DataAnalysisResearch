<AbstractNarration>1601245 &lt;br/&gt;Schandl, Heinz&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Gordon Research Conference on Industrial Ecology (GRC-IE) will be held at the Stoweflake Conference Center, Stowe, Vermont, June 19 to 24, 2016. A companion meeting for graduate students and post-doctoral researchers, the Gordon Research Seminar on Industrial Ecology (GRS-IE), will be held in conjunction with the GRC-IE. This is a grant for U.S. participant support: conference fees and travel focused on post-docs and students. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Industrial ecology is an emerging field that examines local, regional and global uses and flows of materials and energy in products, processes, industrial sectors and economies as a means of exploring opportunities for sustainable production and consumption. The 2016 Gordon Research Conference on Industrial Ecology will examine decoupling human well-being from environmental pressures and impacts. This conference will investigate the newest insights from the science of industrial ecology to support technological solutions, policy innovation and new business models for sustainable development. Industrial ecology has the potential to contribute importantly to the development of knowledge, technologies and policies that can reduce the environmental impacts of industrial systems directly and by situating technological analysis in a broader economic and social context as a basis for private strategy and public policy.</AbstractNarration>
