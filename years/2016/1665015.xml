<AbstractNarration>Metal-Metal Cooperativity Effects in Synthesis and Catalysis&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Developing new catalysts to convert simple and abundant raw materials into important chemicals and pharmaceuticals is essential for a sustainable and responsible chemical industry. Efficient and selective catalytic processes lower both the cost and waste associated with chemical synthesis. Inspired by natural metal-containing enzymes, Dr. Michaelis is developing new catalysts that contain two distinct metal centers. The two metals work cooperatively to achieve much more efficient catalysis than that of a single metal. Understanding how this process occurs is enabling the application of this strategy to a broad number of catalytic reactions.  Dr. Michaelis is also actively involved in recruiting and retaining promising high school and undergraduate students, including women, into science, technology, and engineering (STEM) majors. These efforts are involving students in research, service, and outreach opportunities within the STEM field at an early stage of their career. The activities include summer internships at the high school and college freshman levels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Transition-metal catalyzed reactions represent a hallmark of modern organic synthesis and play a critical role in areas ranging from basic synthetic research to large scale manufacturing. Traditional ligand design in transition metal catalysis seeks to control reaction mechanism, reactivity, and catalyst lifetime by varying the electronic and steric properties of organic supporting ligands. Ligands that contain a second metal represent a conceptually distinct approach to catalyst design because metal-metal cooperativity can impact the reactivity, mechanism, and selectivity of catalysts in unique ways. Despite significant efforts to synthesize and characterize bimetallic complexes, their application to organic synthesis remains relatively unexplored.   In addition, it remains unclear to what extent metal-metal interactions can enable mechanistically distinct reaction pathways. With funding support from the Chemical Synthesis Program of the Chemistry Division, Dr. Michaelis is developing strategies to investigate the impact of M-M interactions on reactivity and mechanism in synthetic transformations. These goals are being achieved by (1) synthesizing new titanium-containing ligands, including chiral enantiopure ligands, and investigating the assembly of electrophilic Ti-M (M = Ni, Pd, Pt) heterobimetallic catalysts for olefin and C-H activation reactions, and (2) Synthesizing (NHC)Ni-M2 complexes (NHC = N-heterocyclic carbene) and investigating the impact of M2 in Ni-catalyzed cross coupling reactions. Dr. Michaelis is also actively involved in STEM outreach activities, including high school and undergraduate research internships, and is developing a freshman mentoring program for chemistry and biochemistry majors. This mentoring program is ensuring that a diverse group of undergraduate students participate in undergraduate research, outreach, and service opportunities within the STEM field.</AbstractNarration>

The overarching goal of this NSF-funded project was the design, development, and application of catalytic systems that employ bimetallic transition metal complexes to achieve faster catalysis and new chemical processes. As a result of NSF funding, we developed various new and efficient catalytic processes and catalysts and discovered a new class of catalytically active bimetallic complexes.</p> <p>Our early results on this project included the development of highly selective carbon-nitrogen bond forming reactions that employ titanium-palladium bimetallic catalysts (Figure 1a). Based on this early work, we then discovered two new catalytic systems that use titanium and nickel cooperatively to enable faster reaction processes. During these early studies, we also discovered a new acid-catalyzed, boron-templated cyclization/dimerization process that efficiently generates complex products in a single step (Figure 1b).</p> <p>Our later work on this project involved the design of new organic ligands to enable bimetallic catalysis. We discovered a new class of organic ligands that enable the formation of catalytically active palladium and rhodium complexes. These new bimetallic complexes have allowed us to develop new reactions that do not occur with monometallic palladium and rhodium complexes. &nbsp;With our new bimetallic palladium complexes, we reported a new single step synthesis of naphthalene products, which are valuable both for pharmaceutical and materials applications (Figure 2). Our mechanistic investigations and computational studies provide evidence for the critical role of the bimetallic catalyst in facilitating this new transformation. We also demonstrated the reactivity of our bimetallic palladium complexes in highly valuable carbon-nitrogen bond-forming reactions. With our new di-rhodium complexes, we have also discovered a new class of carbon-nitrogen bond forming reactions that are highly efficient and that do not work with traditional monometallic rhodium complexes. These results are providing new avenues for efficient synthesis of nitrogen-containing complex molecules.</p> <p>During our studies in bimetallic catalysis, we found that our ligand framework also facilitated formation of monometallic palladium complexes (Figure 3). These new complexes have a unique structure that enables them to be activated during catalysis by removal of an acidic N-H bond. We found that these new palladium complexes are highly active in cross coupling reactions, especially with cheap and readily available aromatic chlorides.</p> <p>Future work in our laboratory is seeking to build upon these early catalytic results. We have expanded our bimetallic catalysts to include bimetallic platinum complexes, and are working on the synthesis of bimetallic nickel complexes. We are also optimizing and expanding the reactivity of our bimetallic palladium and rhodium catalysts. These new bimetallic complexes, and those currently under development, will continue to add important transformations to our toolbox of catalysts for organic synthesis, which will continue to streamline the synthetic process and enable faster access to important complex molecules for myriad applications.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 08/06/2021<br>      Modified by: David&nbsp;Michaelis</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1665015/1665015_10502083_1628280192506_Abstract--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1665015/1665015_10502083_1628280192506_Abstract--rgov-800width.jpg" title="SummaryImage"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1665015/1665015_10502083_1628280192506_Abstract--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="SummaryImage"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Bimetallic catalysts developed on this project</div> <div class="imageCredit">David J Michaelis</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Public Domain</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">David&nbsp;Michaelis</div> <div class="imageTitle">SummaryImage</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1665015/1665015_10502083_1628280254038_Final_Figure1copy--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1665015/1665015_10502083_1628280254038_Final_Figure1copy--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure1"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1665015/1665015_10502083_1628280254038_Final_Figure1copy--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure1"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">titanium palladium catalysis</div> <div class="imageCredit">David J.
