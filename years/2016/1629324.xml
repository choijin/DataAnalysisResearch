<AbstractNarration>Changing demographics, poor health behaviors, concomitant increase in non-communicative diseases combined with escalating costs are increasingly challenging healthcare delivery on a global scale. To counter these trends, healthcare needs to be transformed to be more widely available and less resource dependent. An emerging precision healthcare solution based on advances in high throughput and connective computing appear to have the potential to transform medicine and healthcare by accelerating discovery, improving patient outcomes, decreasing costs, and addressing the complexity of challenging health problems. The anticipated solutions will include novel data acquisition and processing approaches, combined with advances in computational statistical learning. These data acquisition approaches will be combined with the utilization of diverse information and data to provide automated and augmented insight, discovery, and evidence-based decision support and health services on a global scale. A successful application of technology to achieve the necessary transformation requires collaboration between computing and engineering expertise and the health domain knowledge. This workshop will introduce computing and information science researchers from the United States (US), funded by the NSF SCH program, to health researchers in Finland to foster international interdisciplinary collaborations in the area of Smart and Connected Health (SCH).  In Finland, the Academy of Finland in concert with Tekes, the Finnish Funding Agency for Innovation, has nine multidisciplinary research consortia designated to tackle complex health topics utilizing methods of personalized health (pHealth).  The participants will explore opportunities and challenges to transform health research while advancing fundamental science and fostering international collaboration. Realizing the promise of disruptive transformation in health and healthcare, this workshop aims to drive innovation in computer science and engineering in the health domain through new perspectives and  international collaborations.  The funding is provided from Smart and Connected Health and the Office of International Science and Engineering..</AbstractNarration>

In this paper, we explore some of the interdisciplinary recent advances within the realm of personalized health and share a research agenda developed by thought leaders in this area, as exemplified by a workshop co-organized by National Science Foundation (NSF) and Finnish Academy in 2016.  The workshop, entitled "Personalized Health&mdash;from Genes to Society (pHealth)", was held in Helsinki, Finland on March 17 and 18, 2016 as an informative and interactive opportunity for US and Finnish investigators to identify knowledge gaps and research opportunities in personalized health while fostering unique international, interdisciplinary collaborations between researchers in health, computer and information science, and engineering.

In order to facilitate networking and collaboration, each researcher or research consortium was given the opportunity to present a two-minute oral presentation and poster highlighting their research, as well as areas where collaborations with other disciplines would enhance their science, engineering, and the potential to innovate.    The diversity in the backgrounds and expertise of workshop participants led to multifaceted and productive discussions within each multidisciplinary group, after which a representative from each group presented their findings in a short summary.  Three challenge areas emerged to yield a research agenda for the area of Personalized Health: data science, analytics, and engaging consumers.  The pHealth area has received a significant increase in attention since the workshop was conducted in 2016. The advances range from sensor technology, interoperability in the domain electronic health records (EHRs), advances in combining genetic research with health outcomes, and behavioral medicine.   Despite the significant advances achieved during the past five years, there remains much to do.  The results of this workshop reveal the need for a clear, central research agenda to drive aggressive advances in data science, analytics, and consumer engagement.
