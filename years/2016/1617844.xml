<AbstractNarration>"Geoengineering" is the idea of taking purposeful action to offset global greenhouse warming, in this case by artificially increasing Earth's reflectivity and thus reducing the solar energy available to the climate system.  This project uses climate models, particularly the Community Earth System Model (CESM) to examine the potential consequences of injecting sulfate into the stratosphere to produce reflecting aerosols, mimicking the effect of large volcanic eruptions. The award is a continuation of previous work by the PI under AGS-1157525.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Previous work by the PI and others raised concerns that stratospheric geoengineering would result in a reduction in monsoon rainfall, with negative impacts on tropical agriculture. Here the PI proposes that the negative impacts could be mitigated using a geoengineering technique that preferentially cools the Southern Hemisphere ocean.  The idea is based on research suggesting that cooling the Southern Hemisphere pushes the intertropical convergence zone northward, thereby causing preferentially greater amounts of rainfall in Northern Hemisphere monsoon regions.  Numerical experiments to test this idea would be conducted by artificially altering ocean surface albedo in CESM simulations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A second topic pursued here is the effect of stratospheric sulfate injection on terrestrial vegetation and agriculture.  Previous work using vegetation models embedded in climate models suggests a small reduction in photosynthesis due to stratospheric aerosol injection, in part because scattering of sunlight by stratospheric aerosols increases diffuse surface insolation at the expense of direct sunlight (in addition to reducing total sunlight reaching the ground).  But other effects could be important, in particular the increase in ultraviolet (UV) sunlight due to the reduction of stratospheric ozone as a consequences of aerosol injection (an effect seen following volcanic eruptions).  The impact of increased UV on agricultural production  is studied through the use of the Community Land Model (CLM), the land surface component model of CESM, using the CLM-Crop version which allows representation of agricultural crops.  Some of the effort is devoted to developing CLM-Crop to include more crops and represent processes relevant to the UV impact.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to the work with CESM, the project also supports the Geoengineering Model Intercomparison Project (GeoMIP), a coordinated international project in which multiple climate modeling centers perform a specified set of simulations, so that the range of possible outcomes can be assessed.  The project supports annual workshops for GeoMIP participants, and is also launching an intercomparison project for crop model simulations of the agricultural impacts of geoengineering.  The crop model intercomparison effort is organized under the existing Global Gridded Crop Model Intercomparison (GGCMI) initiative.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this project stem from the need for studies such as this one to inform policy makers and the public regarding the potential costs and benefits of geoengineering schemes. In addition, the proposed developments to CLM-Crop will provide an enhanced resource for the research community. The project support a graduate student and a postdoc, thereby providing for the future climate science workforce.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This grant supported computer modeling to study the potential benefits and risks of proposed climate intervention (also called "climate engineering" or "geoengineering") schemes designed to reduce incoming sunlight to reduce the impacts of global warming.  The grant provided continuing support for the Geoengineering Model Intercomparison Project (GeoMIP), which organizes standard computer model experiments following agreed upon scenarios, and analyzes and compares the results.  To that end, GeoMIP held annual workshops in 2017 in Newry, Maine, in 2018 in Zurich, Switzerland, in 2019 in Beijing, China, and in 2020 online.  There were 63 GeoMIP peer-reviewed publications from 2016 to the middle of 2020.   Researchers specifically supported by this grant examined a proposal to spread foam on the ocean to cool Earth.  If it were put in certain locations in the Southern Hemisphere, it could produce cooling without reducing precipitation in important agricultural regions.  But there is currently no technology to do this, and there are a number of potential serious risks.  In another study, we examined the impacts on stratospheric and tropospheric ozone from two schemes to reduce the amount of energy reaching Earth's surface, artificially reducing sunlight or producing particles in the stratosphere.  Stratospheric aerosol intervention would deplete both stratospheric and tropospheric ozone, but would allow more ultraviolet radiation to reach the surface.  There would be complex spatial patterns of these changes, and the impacts on crops, humans, and natural ecosystems deserve additional study.  We examined the impacts on natural ecosystems under the scenario that fleets of airplanes were flying up into the stratosphere every day spraying sulfur to create an artificial sulfuric acid cloud to reflect sunlight to cool Earth and counteract global warming, and then had to stop.  The result would be rapid global warming, at as much as 10 times the rate that would have occurred without the geoengineering, and strong changes in precipitation patterns and other climate elements.  Working with a team of ecologists and geoengineering climate modelers to tackle the problem, using climate velocities, the rate that animals would have to move to keep their climate constant, we compared the resulting temperature and precipitation velocities at implementation and termination of the sulfur injections to the rates that would have happened with global warming without climate intervention, and to those that different animals could normally move.  We particularly paid attention to biodiversity hotspots on both land and in the ocean.  We found that not only would climate velocities outpace the average dispersal speed of 93% of mammal species at geoengineering termination, the temperature and precipitation velocities on land would move in different directions in many places, fracturing ecosystems in biodiversity-rich tropical oceans and in the Amazon.  Extinction would be threatened, particularly for corals, mangroves, amphibians and land mammals.  One surprising side effect of rapidly starting geoengineering would be an El Nino warming of the sea surface in the tropical Pacific Ocean, which would cause a devastating drought in the Amazon.  We also studied scenarios of using stratospheric aerosols to keep global warming to 1.5 or 2 degrees C above preindustrial temperatures.  We examined the impacts on ocean circulation, ocean net primary productivity, ice sheets, sea level rise, precipitation, and the Antarctic ozone hole.  We also looked at the impacts of geoengineering on the production of apples in the Himalayan foothills.  We found that geoengineering could benefit deciduous fruit production by reducing the intensity of global warming; however, if geoengineering was terminated abruptly, the rate of change in temperature would be quite high. This could lead to a rapid change in land suitability and might result in total crop failure in a shorter period compared to global warming.  Overall, the work supported by this grant studied several proposed climate intervention schemes designed to reduce the potential impacts of global warming while avoiding the worst negative impacts.  Some of the ideas indeed reduced some of the negative impacts as compared to more simplistic schemes that had been studied before, but currently there is no scheme that clearly has benefits that outweigh the potential risks and concerns.  Even though no technology currently exists to conduct stratospheric climate intervention, there are designs that have the potential to be constructed in the next one or two decades.  In the meantime, many more ideas about how to conduct stratospheric geoengineering should be evaluated to help make a decision whether to ever implement it.  In the meantime, mitigation remains crucial to help reduce global warming and its impacts, no matter whether climate intervention is ever implemented.
