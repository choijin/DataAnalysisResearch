<AbstractNarration>The research objective of this award is to study nanostructured interfaces in polymer fiber reinforced composites such that lightweight materials can be designed for both structural and ballistic performance.  To achieve this objective a nanostructured interface consisting of ZnO nanowires will be grown on the fiber surface.  The nanowire growth process is highly controllable and acts to enhance the load transfer between the matrix and fiber and provide out of plane reinforcement.  The controllable nanowire growth provides a means for optimizing the interfacial properties such that an ideal material response can be obtained at both high and low strain rates.  The optimal interface will be designed through a series of experimental tests and molecular dynamics simulations performed under this research effort to provide a fundamental understanding of how a nanostructured interface carries load and how it fails at both high and low strain rates.  The findings will be used to illuminate other potential materials for further gains in strength.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this this award focus on creating a better understanding of interfaces in composite materials.  Specifically, the award will identify a theory defining the relation between a nanoscale interface and the bulk composite properties and a first of its kind lightweight multifunctional material that provides excellent loading bearing properties and blast resistance.  The findings will be used to illuminate other potential materials for further gains in strength and applications for the technology.  Additionally, Improved understanding of the interaction between materials with a nanostructured interfaces and how the properties of nanomaterials translate to the bulk could lead to improved interfacial performance in carbon fiber composites or fiber reinforced ceramics and metals.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Fiber reinforced composites have extraordinary specific strength and toughness making them excellent materials for ballistic applications, however they are not often designed for use in both high (armor) and low (structures) strain rate applications. A fundamental study of multifunctional materials with carbon fibers such that lightweight composites has been performed to allow the design of a material which simultaneously provides both static and dynamic strength.  Since current systems typically have separate armor and structural components, this research has provided a set of materials that can be used to reduce the weight and complexity of existing systems.  Furthermore, the creation of lightweight armor with load bearing properties would allow for the integration of ballistic protection into materials and structures that were previously left unprotected.  Our ultimate goal was to provide the fundamental understanding of the failure of nanostructured interfaces across a spectrum of loading rates such that composites with tailored behavior can be developed to provide greater performance to composite structures.  This effort has studied the behavior of a novel ZnO nanowire surface treatment under varying strain rates to produce an interface with significant strength under static loading, but one which fails more easily under high strain rate loading to allow the load to be carried by the tough fibers.  For reinforcing fibers, the interface is of paramount importance due to the typically un-reactive nature of the fibers, which leads to weak bonding with matrix materials.  The ZnO nanowires serve two purposes: to provide a gradient between the dissimilar fiber and matrix materials, thus, reducing stress concentrations, and to provide out of plane reinforcement.  By functionally grading the material properties, we can redesign the microstructure to emulate biological systems, which rarely exhibit discrete boundaries between two materials of vastly different mechanical properties.    This research effort has developed a new approach to the design of composite materials with the goal of created interfaces that behave optimally across strain rates.  The science required to define these new systems requires a multidisciplinary approach that incorporates chemistry, materials science and engineering and thus has made impacts across disciplines. This research has developed a novel experimental technique to measure the interfacial shear strength of fiber reinforced composites at strain rates up to 104 sec-1.  Furthermore, we have shown the nanowires can enable the design of novel multifunctional materials with tailorable interfaces such that under static loading the nanowires act to strengthen the interface but under impact or a ballistic event, the ceramic nanowires fail due to their brittle nature allowing the tough fiber to carry the load.  The results of the work will impact the performance and design approach used for armor systems as well as primary structural components that require a higher level of toughness to potential ballistic impact.
