<AbstractNarration>The National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) will be a shared-use, continental scale research platform for ecological research.  The network will consist of geographically distributed infrastructure deployed across the continental US, Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico. The concept, design, and selection of sites and instruments for the various NEON sites and activities have evolved over many years, during which community consultation has been an important activity. NEON is now entering an important phase of changes in management structures, and consultation with the communities of site owners/hosts, users of NEON Sites, and other stakeholders is necessary. The Smithsonian Institution, along with other site owners/hosts, will host a workshop to bring together these communities for interactions and to provide input to the new NEON project management group. The proposed workshop will improve the planning, implementation and long-term operations of NEON, thereby enhancing the capabilities of this important research resource. This community workshop will reinforce the network of institutions and researchers involved in NEON and will improve their coordination and communication with NEON's management entity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NSF is in the process of reassigning NEON's management responsibilities, making this an appropriate time to review and re-think the working relationships between NEON-supported activities and those managed by the NEON site owners and hosts. Participants in the workshop will engage in open discussion of issues and opportunities, identify constructive approaches towards enhancing the utility of NEON sites and data, and provide suggestions about how to best maintain effective communications with site owners/hosts.  Outcomes of the workshop discussions will be made available to the new managing entity and distributed through a white paper or other means.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[The National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) is the largest biological component in the National Science Foundation’s (NSF) Major Research Equipment and Facility Construction portfolio.  The NEON concept, design, and site selections were the result of extensive consultation with and planning by the biological research community.  The Smithsonian Institution and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) are two important owners/hosts of NEON sites,  In August 2015 NSF announced its plan to ‘descope’ NEON by reducing construction at many sites, and in March 2016 announced the reassignment of management responsibilities to Battelle Memorial Institute.  NSF’s announcement s generated uncertainty at NEON sites and prompted plans for a two-day workshop for information exchange and coordinated planning. A two-day workshop in March 2016 took place on the campus of the Smithsonian Mason School of Conservation.  It brought together representatives of Battelle’s NEON management team, NSF officials, and a variety of NEON stakeholders that included representatives of organizations that own and host NEON sites.  Researchers at these sites as well as members of the research community who were involved in NEON’s design and planning also participated. The workshop produced two sets of outcomes.  The first was a series of issues that would require consideration by the new NEON management team.  These included: the need for better coordination between intramural research activities of NEON site host organizations with the research activities of others who use those sites; the impact of inadequate outreach on the engagement of potential site users; and the need to consider potential DNA-based research in planning the capabilities of NEON’s Biorepository. The second set of workshop outcomes consisted of six Action Items adopted by participants.  These involved communications planning, re-launching technical and advisory groups, and future events for engaging the research community and general public.
