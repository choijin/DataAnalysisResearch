<AbstractNarration>The increased demand for wireless communications over the last 25 years has led to the emergence of a new national priority: dynamic sharing of the radio spectrum among different stakeholders.  Users with different rights and priorities must now collaborate to share a common resource without interfering with each other.  A reliable enforcement regime that ensures rights is a way to make these rights meaningful and mitigate the associated risks.  As spectrum sharing becomes a more widely adopted paradigm for utilizing the spectrum, it will become necessary to deploy a systematic enforcement regime that can be automated to the maximum extent possible so that the enforcement processes can occur in near real time and at scale while incurring reasonable financial costs.  Much of the research and practice to date has focused on interference protection of the incumbents and on preventative (i.e., ex ante) approaches.  This research examines approaches to improving ex ante protections, detecting interference events, identifying the interfering parties, and determining how these events are best enforced and adjudicated using techniques that can be readily automated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Static ex ante approaches (e.g., exclusion zones) are not readily adaptable to policy changes, and have high social costs.  Database-driven approaches can be more responsive to changes, but require constant connectivity with radios and may not be geographically fine-grained.  The investigators will develop the core components for enabling efficient policy-based spectrum access to reduce the social cost of ex ante enforcement. The investigators also aim to advance techniques to automate the enforcement of events after they occur, i.e., automate ex post enforcement.  This involves detection, forensic analysis and adjudication.  To automate the detection of events, the investigators will develop an efficient technique that uses mobile agents that have different roles in identifying, verifying and localizing a potentially enforceable event. The adjudication process involves identifying the non-compliant transmitters and ensuring that they comply with the necessary standards. To this end, the investigators propose to develop a transmitter identification scheme and a remote attestation scheme.  Finally, the investigators will examine the different institutional strategies for ex post enforcement (i.e., third party enforcement, self-enforcement, and cooperative mutual enforcement) with the goal of understanding under what circumstances each approach would apply to spectrum sharing. These approaches promise to improve ex ante enforcement techniques and to advance ex post enforcement processes in a way that can be used to construct a comprehensive, robust and cost-effective enforcement system.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Spectrum sharing is a rearrangement of a rights regime among stakeholders. This rearrangement creates new real and perceived risks for these stakeholders (licensees and entrants). A reliable enforcement regime that ensures rights is a way to make these rights meaningful and to mitigate these risks. As spectrum is shared more intensively, it will become necessary to treat enforcement comprehensively to improve the confidence of all stakeholders, and automate enforcement procedures to the maximum extent possible so that the outcomes of the enforcement process can occur in near real time and at scale.     Methods for enforcing spectrum sharing/access rules can be broadly classified into two categories: ex-ante enforcement and ex-post enforcement.  Ex-ante approaches prevent or constrain users with subordinate rights to spectrum (i.e., secondary users) from accessing spectrum when and where other users with superior rights (i.e., primary users) are operating.  Ex-post approaches are designed to remediate malicious or selfish behavior after a potentially harmful interference event has occurred by identifying the violator and/or enacting punitive actions.         In this research project, the investigators have developed effective and flexible approaches for enforcing spectrum access/sharing rules that can be fully or partially automated, and they include ex-ante as well as ex-post enforcement schemes. The key outcomes from the research include the following: (1) The research team developed a novel and systematic framework for dynamic protection zones that can be used by a geolocation database (GDB) for prescribing the protection boundaries of primary users (PUs) in real time.  This framework ensures that PUs are protected from harmful interference by providing a probabilistic guarantee of interference protection. (2) The investigators developed a privacy preserving database-driven dynamic spectrum sharing scheme.  This scheme preserves the privacy for both PUs and secondary users (SUs) in database-driven dynamic spectrum sharing ecosystems without the need for an online trusted third party. (3) The project team developed a scheme for "crowd-sourced" Blind Transmitter Authentication (BTA). The harmful interference caused by rogue radios poses a serious threat to spectrum sharing ecosystems.  One approach for mitigating this problem is to adopt an enforcement scheme that can be used by an enforcement entity to uniquely identify transmitters by authenticating their waveforms.  Such a scheme is referred to as Blind Transmitter Authentication (BTA).     The project included a number of education and student outreach activities.  The project findings were leveraged to develop new course modules and enhance existing curriculum at the investigators' home institutions.  Moreover, the project provided opportunities for rigorous training and professional development of several graduate students.        Project findings were disseminated to communities of interest, primarily through peer-reviewed journal and conference papers.  The investigators expect that the findings will have a significant impact on the ongoing research on spectrum sharing technologies, especially those that are being developed to ensure secure and efficient spectrum access.  The research findings are also expected to make an impact on relevant spectrum regulatory policies that are currently being discussed or planned.
