<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project in the long term has two main components.  First, the development has potential to reduce the country's overall energy consumption by funding the development of low cost air quality sensors for energy efficient buildings.  And second, the project will enhance the safety of our natural gas infrastructure with a low cost, low power methane (natural gas) sensor technology.    This work will develop a methane (natural gas) sensor prototype with 10x lower cost, size and power consumption than current solutions.  The proposed methane sensor will meet several currently unmet needs.  These include enhanced public safety by enabling methane leak detection for natural gas distribution systems, and protecting first responders by enabling more and better methane detection in hazardous environments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop the world's most porous materials, Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) as a sensing material.  MOFs have been an active topic in material science research for over a decade, but they have yet to find a commercial application.  This project promises to be the first commercialization of this exciting new class of materials.  Nearly 40,000 different MOF structures have been identified to date.  The crux of this work is to use a combination of computer models and laboratory experimentation to optimize a MOF structure that selectively and rapidly absorbs methane gas.  The end goal of this project is to develop a commercial prototype methane sensor 'on a chip' that consists of a solid state mass transducer with the MOF coating that has been tuned for sensing methane.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Overview  The original goal of this project was to build a prototype solid-state methane sensor for leak detection in natural gas distribution, but very early in the program we pivoted to focus on carbon dioxide (CO2) sensing where we made significant technical and commercialization progress.  CO2 sensors have broad commercial applications since CO2 is the primary marker for assessing and monitoring indoor air quality.  These applications include energy efficient HVAC control for commercial buildings, residential IoT, and automotive.   Problem  The current state of the art for CO2 detection is with an optical technique called Non-Dispersive Infrared (NDIR) sensing.  This mature technology is effective but it is decades-old technology and suffers from high cost, high power consumption and high maintenance (yearly manual calibration).  Because of this, NDIR CO2 sensors have limited adoption today relative to the demand that would be enabled by a lower cost solution.   Solution  Our proprietary approach uses a new class of porous, gas absorbing materials called Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs) as the specific and high resolution sensing layer.  Our product will represent the world’s first large-scale commercial application of MOF materials as a gas sensor.   Our sensor architecture is simple (see figure) and consists of two parts: 1) an off-the-shelf quartz timing crystal that acts as a ‘scale’ and 2) a MOF thin film coating on the crystal that acts as a ‘sponge’ for carbon dioxide.  When the concentration of carbon dioxide near the sensor increases, it absorbs into the MOF, increasing its weight.  This added mass causes a change in the quartz crystal that we can detect and convert to a gas concentration in parts-per-million (ppm).  Results  The primary result from the project is the demonstration of a working CO2 sensor prototype that meets or exceeds our target specifications including selectivity, accuracy, sensitivity, measurement range, and response time.  To do this, we developed:  Several proprietary methods for MOF thin film growth and deposition Our own proprietary (and patented) humidity compensation method that is based on a MOF capacitor to separately monitor the amount of water absorbed into the MOF A temperature compensation method A first generation readout electronics and software   This progress has enabled Matrix Sensors to raise private venture funding and enter into a strategic commercialization partnership with a global sensor component manufacturer.
