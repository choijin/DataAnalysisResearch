<AbstractNarration>This award will partially support a conference focused on Electron Backscatter Diffraction (EBSD) planned for May 24-26, 2016, at the University of Alabama, under the sponsorship of the Microanalysis Society (MAS).  EBSD is a core microanalytical technique that utilizes the diffraction of high-energy electrons to determine the orientations of crystals in natural and engineered materials. This approach has major applications in both material science and geology related to understanding everything from crystallization processes to microstructures that record geostructural deformation and affect material properties (such as strength, fracture toughness and thermal conductivity). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The EBSD topical conference series has become the de facto meeting in North America for the development and application of this core microanalytical technique. This meeting?s importance is reflected in part by invited speakers from three continents (North America, Europe, and Australia) who are all at the absolute edge of development in new directions for this diffraction approach. This conference will provide a venue for ideas to be shared between the primary disciplines utilizing the technique: geoscience and materials science and engineering. The exchange of cutting-edge knowledge from these communities will facilitate dissemination of knowledge and further research developments throughout the community. Students will particularly benefit from these interactions while also having the opportunity to present their research via oral or poster presentations.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This NSF project provided student travel support for the international meeting on the specialized microscopy technique of electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD).&nbsp; EBSD is a technique that allows us to map, visualize, and measure how the crystal structure of materials changes at the micron scale.&nbsp; This technique collects data of great value for science, e.g. to determine patterns of mineral deformation in geology, and for engineering, e.g. how different heat treatments can make steel stronger.&nbsp; This meeting, EBSD 2016, was successfully held as the fifth installment of an ongoing Microanalysis Society topical conference series on the development and application of electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) as a microanalytic technique.&nbsp; EBSD 2016 was hosted by The University of Alabama in Tuscaloosa, Alabama from Tuesday-Thursday, May 24-26, 2016.&nbsp; The conference had 175 total attendees with 70 students attending.&nbsp; The meeting was robustly supported by seventeen corporate sponsors who provided $33,000 in financial support and who brought two field emission gun scanning electron microscopes (SEM&rsquo;s) and one plasma-focused ion beam instrument to the meeting.&nbsp; The meeting had significant technical programming with a total of 60 technical presentations (platform and posters).</p> <p>The significant student involvement was one of the real highlights for EBSD 2016!&nbsp; We had a record number of students, 70, at the meeting.&nbsp; To encourage student attendance at the meeting, we successfully applied for NSF funding for student travel ($22,500).&nbsp; This funding helped 41 of the 70 students to participate in this meeting. &nbsp;We had students and early career scholars from four continents, 5 countries, and 18 states at the meeting.&nbsp; Students presented 7 of the 23 platform presentations.&nbsp; Students also had many informal opportunities to interact with the international leaders of this specialized field, an experience that can really encourage them in their studies and provide future mentoring as they enter the technical workforce.&nbsp; Thanks to financial support from other microscopy societies (Microanalysis Society, Australian Microanalysis Society, and European Microanalysis Society), we were able to host two early career scholars from Australia, Dr. Mitchell Nancarrow (University of Wollongong), and from Switzerland, Dr. Ana Teresa Fontenla (CERN). &nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Tutorials were a key educational element for EBSD 2016.&nbsp; A day-long tutorial was held on Tuesday, May 24, 2016.&nbsp; As in years past, we had a basic tutorial that included lectures that covered everything from the basic physics of EBSD to sample preparation to applications in the geological sciences.&nbsp; In the afternoon, ten groups of 4-5 students had the opportunity to spend an hour in the laboratory on one of six EBSD-SEM platforms to see the basic collection and indexing of EBSD patterns performed in a laboratory setting.&nbsp; As a new approach in 2016, we also held a set of advanced tutorials.&nbsp; We organized three advanced tutorials on the topics of high angular resolution EBSD, precession electron diffraction, and transmission Kikuchi diffraction.&nbsp; A leading academic in the field gave a one-hour lecture on each topic on Tuesday morning.&nbsp; From 1-3PM on Tuesday, laboratory demonstrations were provided so that attendees could see how this data is collected and analyzed in a laboratory setting.&nbsp; Feedback from attendees and presenters on these advanced tutorials was quite positive.&nbsp; We would recommend including advanced tutorials in the programming for future EBSD topical conferences.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 07/27/2017<br>      Modified by: Luke&nbsp;Brewer</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1625120/1625120_10418874_1501203320371_1605101_BH_019_EBSD_conference_group-small--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1625120/1625120_10418874_1501203320371_1605101_BH_019_EBSD_conference_group-small--rgov-800width.jpg" title="EBSD 2016 group photograph"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1625120/1625120_10418874_1501203320371_1605101_BH_019_EBSD_conference_group-small--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="EBSD 2016 group photograph"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">EBSD 2016 group photograph</div> <div class="imageCredit">University of Alabama Photograph</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Luke&nbsp;Brewer</div> <div class="imageTitle">EBSD 2016 group photograph</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1625120/1625120_10418874_1501203405291_1605101_BH_005_EBSD_conference_group-talk-small--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1625120/1625120_10418874_1501203405291_1605101_BH_005_EBSD_conference_group-talk-small--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Student platform presentation"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1625120/1625120_10418874_1501203405291_1605101_BH_005_EBSD_conference_group-talk-small--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Student platform presentation"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">A graduate students supported by NSF presenting her research at EBSD 2016</div> <div class="imageCredit">University of Alabama Photograph</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Luke&nbsp;Brewer</div> <div class="imageTitle">Student platform presentation</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1625120/1625120_10418874_1501203497633_1605101_BH_017_EBSD_conference_group-poster1-small--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1625120/1625120_10418874_1501203497633_1605101_BH_017_EBSD_conference_group-poster1-small--rgov-800width.jpg" title="EBSD 2016 student poster"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1625120/1625120_10418874_1501203497633_1605101_BH_017_EBSD_conference_group-poster1-small--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="EBSD 2016 student poster"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">An NSF-supported student presenting his technical poster at EBSD 2016</div> <div class="imageCredit">University of Alabama Photograph</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Luke&nbsp;Brewer</div> <div class="imageTitle">EBSD 2016 student poster</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
