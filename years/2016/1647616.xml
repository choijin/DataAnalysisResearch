<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is the development of software that automatically identifies and labels problems that patients encounter when they receive care.  This information tells health care providers exactly what they need to fix to improve patient care.  Applications of the software include: a) the developing different software versions for different health care situations, the technology can be used to improve the patient experience in clinics, emergency departments, primary care settings, outpatient centers, etc.; b) Early interventions.  Healthcare leaders are asking for an early warning system.  By recording patient conversations with nurses and doctors while they are still in the hospital, this feedback can be used to identify and resolve problems before the patient is discharged; c) New health care delivery models.  One hospital wants to reduce the length of stay for heart patients; doctors want to be sure that patients are ready to go home.  The software is analyzing the stories of heart patients who did well versus patients who had problems when they left the hospital early.  Their feedback will help keep patients out of the hospital and if they are admitted, improve their care before and after they leave; d) Following the doctor's orders.  When chronic care patients don't follow through on the treatment plan recommended by their doctor, their health problems often get worse.  This software can be used to collect feedback from chronically ill patients and identify patterns in why these patients are not following doctor's orders solutions that motivate and engage patients can be implemented; and e) Other industries.  This software can be used to analyze patient feedback during clinical trials.  The resulting information will make it easier to recruit and retain patients in clinical trials as well as improve clinical outcomes.  Ultimately, results from these analyses could be used to inform FDA decision making within the pharmaceutical industry. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project develops software that uses advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze patients? responses about their health care experiences in interviews and open response survey questions in order to provide hospitals with concrete, actionable information on how to improve care and patient outcomes. To date, hospitals have relied primarily on surveys to inform their attempts to improve patient experiences.&lt;br/&gt;This research will develop an NLP application for mining patient feedback across health care settings. Data where patients freely tell their "stories" provides a clearer and more precise view of the patient's experience than a standard survey with ratings on predefined questions. The challenge is that the variability of expression and experiences requires sophisticated techniques to be able to classify the information, determine the sentiment, and extract essential details that can provide actionable recommendations to hospitals. The team proposes a combination of data annotation, pattern matching, and machine learning techniques for classification and information extraction of core concepts like problem root causes from unstructured patient feedback. Since interviews comprise much of the most informative data, we will also evaluate which speech recognition technologies can best convert audio to text, for subsequent classification and information extraction.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goal of this project was to show that patient comments can be harnessed and used in a meaningful way to improve patient experiences during health care encounters. The team discovered that many hospitals accumulate mountains of patient feedback that go unexamined because providers lack the resources and tools to convert patient comments into useful insight.  When hospitals try to make sense out of patient feedback, they are often overwhelmed by what appears to be endless diversity, impossible to quantify.  However, these same patient comments also contain valuable details on why recent health care encounters were either satisfying or frustrating.   This software identifies patterns in patient feedback using the topics and sentiment expressed by the patients themselves. The company?s state-of-the-art software was built using new techniques for labeling patient feedback patterns &ndash; techniques that can be applied across departments and health systems.  Output from the software is converted to summary measures like percent patients mentioning a specific topic or average sentiment by department.  These metrics and details from patient comments are displayed in dashboards.  Traditional survey questions ask patients, "Was your hospital room noisy at night?"  In their comments, patients rarely complain about their room being noisy.  What they do complain about is hospital staff repeatedly waking them up in the middle of the night.  This is money and time-saving insight for the clinicians and quality improvement teams working to implement solutions that improve patient experiences and hospital operations.      Statistical models also use software output to answer the pressing questions facing hospital administrators such as "Why is patient satisfaction not improving?" or "What do we work on next?"  When patients and families see positive change and realize their health care provider is listening, it builds loyalty, market share and long term financial stability.  It also opens up a dialog between clinicians and patients that enables improved adherence to treatment protocols and reduces costs.   The techniques developed during this project go beyond the scope of existing work in two areas: the sophistication of the methods used to label the patterns in patient feedback and the machine learning models that are able to classify and label these rich patient data sets.
