<AbstractNarration>This project is funded from the Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Sites program in the SBE Directorate. As such, it has both scientific and societal benefits, and it integrates research and education. This project brings together a dynamic and creative group of faculty from the University of Wisconsin-Stout for an 8-week interdisciplinary REU site to train first generation and minority students underrepresented in the scientific community. Students and faculty will engage in an apprentice-style training model with the overall theme of studying phosphorus pollution in a highly eutrophic Wisconsin watershed. The REU site will study social networks among farmers, inclusive decision-making, responsive policy implementation, economic impacts, sediment geochronology, remediation strategies, and land-use impacts on phosphorus run-off. Data will be integrated into a comprehensive strategy for economically sustainable phosphorus use. Students and faculty will participate in professional development programming, interdisciplinary data sharing, and original research activities designed to empower and prepare students for science careers, particularly those underrepresented in the scientific community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work offers significant intellectual contributions by improving student learning and development in response to research experiences, creating innovative approaches to interdisciplinary research, and understanding the complex processes contributing to phosphorus pollution while developing sustainable solutions. These efforts dovetail well with a project at UW-Stout in watershed research jointly funded by the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources and US Army Corps of Engineers. The proposed project will result in lasting impacts for students, faculty, and local community alike. The efforts at synthesizing different research projects centered on the same substantive problems will improve effectiveness in collaborative problem solving. The results will be broadly disseminated via student presentations, peer-reviewed literature, local media outlets, and policy stakeholders. By sharing the results with land users in the watershed, other citizens, and government workers, the new knowledge will impact public policy, the local economy, and regional water quality. This project overall will have a significant impact on developing a more competitive work force in the social and natural sciences in the US, increasing participation of underrepresented minority groups and women in the sciences, expanding public scientific literacy, advancing water quality remediation efforts, and improving undergraduate education in the social and natural sciences.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Phosphorus is a necessary element in the regular functions of an ecosystem; unfortunately, in excessive quantities it becomes a costly environmental pollutant resulting in surface water eutrophication, blue-green algal blooms, and loss of aquatic biodiversity throughout the Midwest and around the world.  The amount of phosphorus entering waterways has increased significantly in recent decades with the rise of industrial agriculture.  The Red Cedar Watershed, and especially Lakes Tainter and Menomin, was the research site for the LAKES (Linking Applied Knowledge in Environmental Sustainability) REU.   These impoundments are perfect examples of the effects of a system overrun with phosphorus.  Solving this issue is a complex interdisciplinary problem that requires an understanding of the biological science governing the system as well as the social science governing the stakeholders acting on the system.   Phosphorus pollution will not get better without the focused, cooperative work of stakeholders to make changes that will protect and improve water quality.  The LAKES REU site not only gave undergraduate students an opportunity to contribute to real, meaningful research, but it also allowed them to engage the community in their research and work together to find ways to mitigate the phosphorus pollution and invest in a better tomorrow.  Included in the scope of the LAKES REU were objectives associated with the social networks and connections existing in the watershed, the economic and biological impacts of impaired waters, and the strengths and weaknesses of the community in handling water quality issues.  The LAKES REU site has involved students from the disciplines of biology, geology, anthropology, sociology, geography, economics, and political science.  The economic studies asked questions about what kind of value people place on clean water, how the local economy interacts with impaired water, what kind of water quality policies the community would support, and how water quality affects the housing market.  We found that improvements in water quality would greatly boost the economy around the lakes within the watershed.

The anthropology and political science projects focused on the history of the community and the lakes, the structure and limitations of government agencies, the process of policymaking, and the efficacy of farmer-led councils.  Personal memories and experiences with the lake influence people?s current attitudes about the health of the lake and what kind of solutions are feasible, as do patterns of local media consumption.  Fatalistic attitudes and misconceptions about the condition of the lake hinder and even derail efforts to improve water quality.  Policies can improve water quality, but the best policies recognize the community?s values and use those values to create and implement water policies.  The Red Cedar Watershed is comprised of forest and agricultural land, but the expansion of conventional agriculture land use has produced most of the problems with phosphorus pollution from run-off.  Interviews and surveys of farmers and Non-Operating Landowners (NOLs) to learn about what drives their farming practices were important to understanding social networks and connections among farmers, NOLs, and county/state. Geographic Information Systems approaches were leveraged to map soil erosion using the Agricultural Conservation Planning Framework (ACPF), Remote Sensing Methods, and ground mapping of riparian buffers.  Studying the physical aspects of the watershed and movement of phosphorus through the system was also important.  Seasonal variation in phosphorus and chlorophyll concentrations were measured in relation to hydrodynamics and nutrient availability.  It was also important to have a grasp of how much natural occurring phosphorus there is in the system, and our geological research discovered that parts in the eastern watershed, where brachiopods were captured under the surface, produced higher levels of phosphorus, introducing the importance of implementing more mitigation efforts in that part of the watershed given its already high natural phosphorus base.

Each of these individual projects provide a greater understanding of how this social, cultural, economic, and ecological system works.  Through constant interaction with the community, the LAKES REU worked to produce new strategies for the best ways to address the phosphorus in the system.  These included regular posters presentations of our findings at local coffee shops to facilitate community discussions, presentations for various stakeholders throughout the watershed and state of Wisconsin, and integration in the EPA approved TMDL implementation group for the watershed.
