<AbstractNarration>This award is made as part of the FY 2016 Mathematical Sciences Postdoctoral Research Fellowships Program. Each of the fellowships supports a research and training project at a host institution in the mathematical sciences, including applications to other disciplines, under the mentorship of a sponsoring scientist. The title of the project for this fellowship to Alex Blumenthal is "Random and infinite-dimensional dynamical systems." The host institution for the fellowship is University of Maryland, and the sponsoring scientist is Dmitry Dolgopyat.</AbstractNarration>
