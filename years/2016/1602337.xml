<AbstractNarration>Parkinson's Disease (PD) poses a serious threat to the elderly population, affecting as many as one million Americans. There is no cure, and medications can only provide symptomatic relief. In addition, costs associated with PD, including treatment, social security payments, and lost income from inability to work, is estimated to be nearly $25 billion per year in the United States alone. The current state-of-the-art in PD management suffers from several shortcomings: (1) frequent clinic visits are a major contributor to the high cost of PD treatment and are inconvenient for the patient, especially in a population for which traveling is difficult; (2) inaccurate patient self-reports and 15-20 minute clinic visits are not enough information for doctors to accurately assess their patients, leading to difficulties in monitoring patient symptoms and medication response; and (3) motor function assessments are subjective, making it difficult to monitor disease progression. Furthermore, because they must be performed by a trained clinician, it is infeasible to do frequent motor function assessments. This project aims to promote a paradigm shift in PD management through in-home monitoring using wearable accelerometers and machine learning. Novel algorithms and experimental protocols are developed to allow for robust detection and assessment of PD motor symptoms during daily living environments.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specifically, this project develops algorithms for weakly-supervised learning, time series analysis, and personalization of classifiers. In previous studies, data was collected in controlled environments for a short amount of time (1-4 hours) and manually labeled for fully-supervised learning. In contrast, this project collects long-term (several weeks), in-home data where the participants' actions are natural and unscripted. Participants use a cell phone app to label their own data, marking segments of time as containing or not containing the occurrence of a PD motor symptom. Since the exact time of the symptom is unknown, this constitutes weakly-labeled data. This project extends multiple-instance learning algorithms for learning from weakly-labeled data in time series. Additional major technical challenges include detection of subtle motor symptoms and local minima during optimization. To further increase robustness and generalization, this project explores the use of personalization algorithms to learn person-specific models of motor symptoms from unsupervised data. The proposed techniques for weakly-supervised learning and personalization are general, and they can be applied to other human sensing problems.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ An   estimated   10   million   people   worldwide   live   with Parkinson’s Disease (PD), a chronic, neuro-degenerative disorder that leads to both non-motor and motor symptoms. These symptoms include, but are not limited to, depression, anxiety, sleep disorders, slowness, muscle rigidity, postural instability,and tremors. While there is no cure, medication can provide symptomatic  relief.  However,  dosages  need  to  be  adjusted as  a  patient’s  disease  progresses  and  symptoms  worsen.  This research presents a continuous  PD  motor  symptom  monitoring for tremor that would  potentially enable  clinicians  to  better  adjust  medication  andthereby improve their patients’ quality of life. Our eventual goal  is  to  build  a  system  for  continuous  monitoring  of  PD motor symptoms "in the wild" &ndash;i.e., in natural environments without  requiring  any  specific  interaction  from  the  patient. Such  a  system  would  use  machine  learning  algorithms  to detect symptoms in data collected from wearable accelerometers (see Fig. 1).      Fig.  1.Depiction  of  automated  tremor  detection  with  wearable  sensorsduring everyday activities  Machine  learning  algorithms  for  symptom  detection  typ-ically require accurate labels (i.e., the start and end of each symptom).  Labels  are  time  consuming  to  annotate  and  the exact onset of a symptom can be subjective. These issues are compounded  in  wild  settings.  Therefore,  researchers  oftenuse  data  collected  in  laboratory  settings  for  training.  Fewer researchers  have  explored  the  use  of  wild data  for  trainingbecause labels for these data are typically supplied by PD patients via paper diaries. Therefore, only approximate tremor  timestamps of symptom occurrences are available (typically&plusmn;1 hour). That is, these data are weakly-labeled.   In   this research,   we   assess   how   well   laboratory   data represents  wild  data  by  comparing  PD  symptom  detection performance  of   three  models  on  laboratory   versus  wilddata.   Similar   performance   across   datasets   would   imply that   findings   on   laboratory   data   should   transfer   to   the wild.  Results  from  each  of  the  models,  however,  show  that laboratory  data  is  not  representative  of  wild  data.  Of  the three models, we find that the one trained on weakly labeled wild data has better performance on wild data than the onestrained  on  accurately  labeled  laboratory  data.  While  this research focuses on upper-limb PD tremor, we expect results totranslate  to  other  PD  symptoms.  The  findings  in  this research may also generalize to other problems in human activity understanding, such as monitoring of other motor impairments,activity tracking, or sports performance analysis       Last Modified: 05/06/2021       Submitted by: Jessica Hodgins]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
