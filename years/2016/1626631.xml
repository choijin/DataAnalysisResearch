<AbstractNarration>The "Scaling an Effective Program for Recruiting and Retaining Women in Undergraduate Computing" is a pilot study conducted by the National Center for Women &amp; Information Technology (NCWIT) that will gather evidence to support a subsequent full-scale implementation of the Extension services for Undergraduate Programs (ES-UP) program.  The ES-UP program has been shown to be successful in addressing gender imbalance in undergraduate computing.  Rather than preparing women to function in an educational system designed for men, ES-UP advances sustained change to attract and retain men and women equally in computing majors.  Combined, the departments served by ES-UP over the past eight years have sustained a 6% climb in graduations of women, while national figures remain flat.&lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;"Learning Circles" consisting of one former ES-UP client (Guide) and four committed departmental teams will be piloted to determine their effectiveness in scaling the ES-UP to a national level.  Learning Circle members will meet regularly via online events throughout the year, learning, sharing, and developing approaches, discussing lessons learned as they implement their solutions, and building a sense of community. The project team will collect data and conduct analysis to understand what works for Learning Circles and how to extend the model more broadly. The team will publish and present the results of the analyses.  The result of this work will be a model that will be used to accelerate large-scale reform in the national computing community, leveraging the knowledge and experience of former ES-UP clients in a "train-the-trainer" approach that integrates the critical components of the model, which includes personalized advice, community, and peer knowledge sharing, into an existing infrastructure of expert staff and consultants, tools, and evidence-based resources.</AbstractNarration>

ES-UP's infrastructure of expert researchers, consultants, and evidence-based tools and resources served as an underlying foundation for each LC.

Data included NCWIT Tracking Tool data (applicants, acceptances, new enrollments, declared majors, and graduation rates by gender and race/ethnicity); participant focus groups, interviews, and surveys; and departmental strategic plans and final reports. Data were collected from 30 departments (five NSF-funded LCs and five Pivotal Ventures-funded LCs). Twelve minority serving institutions participated in the LCs to advance initiatives to increase the meaningful participation of women within their computing departments. Project Highlights:   Increase in numbers of women in programs: Cumulatively, LC participants that provided analyzable Tracking Tool data had a 38% increase of women applicants, a 47% increase of women acceptances, a 38% increase of newly enrolled women, and a 22% increase of women declared majors above their baseline year. Percentage increases for women (examining the number of women relative to the total number of students) from the client departments' baseline year(s) to the latest year (AY 2018-2019) were also observed for applications, acceptances, and declared majors (Table 1).   Increase in student retention: Year 1 LC participants (those that have had the most time to implement strategies and see long-term improvements) decreased the retention gap between men and women in their computing programs to 3-percentage points (men vs. women: 79% vs. 73% in AY 2015-2016 and 87% vs. 84% in AY 2018-2019 (Figure 1).   Change efforts across the departmental ecosystem: A key outcome of LCs is that each participant completed the program with a departmental strategic recruitment and retention plan that included evidence-based strategies that were applicable and feasible for their own departmental and institutional contexts. These plans were approved by deans and department chairs and included specific processes for evaluating the effectiveness of each strategy. Plans incorporated initiatives across multiple areas of the NCWIT Undergraduate Systemic Change Model.

This demonstrates a project-wide understanding of the importance of developing multi-pronged plans to support sustained systemic change.   Departmental accountability: External evaluation reports emphasized the importance of accountability within the LC structure. Departmental participants repeatedly stated that LC meetings and the tools shared fostered accountability for their work.   Importance of peer community support: Feedback from participants reflected substantial enthusiasm for a community-based learning model, with the participants highly valuing the ability to discuss change efforts with others at similarly situated institutions. Several participants indicated that the LC community increased their sense of duty to the work and gave them more creative ideas, and they described informal mentorship that they received from other departments in their LCs.   Need for support through implementation: While external evaluation reports indicated that most participants were positive about their ability to sustain their work after completion of the LC (e.g., 94% in the Year 3 LC cohort), they also indicated that participants desired additional support for a longer implementation period for their initiatives, thereby potentially increasing the likelihood of success of their change efforts.   New materials: Several resource tools (e.g., Self-Assessment Documents, Introductory Course Entry Survey Template, Strategic Plan Template), guiding materials (e.g., LC Preparation Guide, Introductory Course Entry Survey Guide), and content videos were created for the project. They facilitated change leadership work by allowing participants to work in a more self-guided manner, increasing the number of possible participants. They can also be modified to guide computing departments outside of ES-UP in change leadership work in meaningful, informed, and strategic ways.   Findings support the view that LCs had a strong impact on participants while scaling ES-UP's reach across a greater number of computing departments. Not only did departments make improvements in recruiting and retaining women in their programs, they have a path forward for success and gained knowledge and confidence in their ability to lead systemic and sustainable change efforts through this community-based approach.
