<AbstractNarration>The National Science Foundation's (NSF) Inclusion across the Nation of Communities of Learners of Underrepresented Discoverers in Engineering and Science (NSF INCLUDES) intiative supports models, networks, partnerships and research to ensure the broadening participation in STEM of women, members of racial and ethnic groups that have been historically underrepresented, persons of low socio-economic status, and people with disabilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The University of Cincinnati, lead for a tri-state (OH, KY, IN) project, will convene a three-day conference to convene national and local experts to explore the best practices that support the development of a backbone organization in the context of using a social innovation model for broadening participation in STEM.  The intent is to strengthen the network among participants and leverage learning from the Cincinnati Strive experience with collective impact across the Midwest and beyond.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Results from the NextLivesHere:  Social Change Innovation Summit, will be disseminated in the tri-state region through the Greater Cincinnati STEM Collaborative (GCSC and the Ohio STEM Learning Network (OSLN).  National dissemination will occur through informal and formal STEM professional organizations and publications as well as through participation in the NSF-developed national backbone organization.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The <em>NextL?vesHere</em> <em>Social Change Innovation Summit</em> advanced knowledge and understanding of effective backbone organizations  in order to support collective impact for the purpose of addressing  problems of underrepresentation in STEM. This was done by incorporating  the framework of collective impact and backbone organization development  into a deep dive case-study of collective impact work being done in  Cincinnati. Experts and practitioners were engaged in a series of design  sessions to recognize issues, discuss implications, and identify  solutions for &ldquo;wicked problems&rdquo; in backbone development. Finally, the  ideas, insights, and learnings of the summit were captured in a variety  of ways to be shared across the nation.</p> <p>There were three key takeaways that came from this work. 1) STEM  pipelines need to be leveraged with additional informal and formal  relationships to become wider and more inclusive robust pathways. 2)  STEM collective impact efforts need resources, tools, and formalized  approaches to support authentic engagement of the community. 3) A STEM  backbone organization needs to support full community participation with  the partners it pulls together in order to drive impact and inclusion  at scale.<strong> </strong>This conference was in fact a collective  impact effort from its inception, to its design, to its implementation.  Nine different partners with over 10 years of experience in collective  impact came together to create a different type of conference; a  conference that actively immersed a cross-sector group in the real work  of what it takes to listen, understand, dream, argue, and create a  different outcome for our children and our community! The conference  worked to achieve desired societal outcomes by equipping a broad  audience (local experts, national experts, and practitioners) to create a  conception of a viable backbone organization that can support  collective impact to increase representation in STEM education and  careers. The products and results of the conference are being  disseminated in the Cincinnati tristate region through the Greater  Cincinnati STEM Collaborative (GCSC) and the Ohio STEM Learning Network.</p> <p>In this work, it was discovered that authentically engaging the  community as well as achieving impact and inclusion at scale is truly  monumental work that will take all of us working together differently to  accomplish. Thus, one of the central tasks is to find ways to organize  that will drive community-level outcomes, developing processes that are  necessary to create social change. Additionally, the critical work to be  accomplished in order to increase representation in STEM involves  moving from pipelines to the creation of robust pathways that truly  support our nation&rsquo;s children as they pursue STEM study and careers.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 12/11/2017<br>      Modified by: Kathie&nbsp;Maynard</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1650433/1650433_10460943_1513020914644_5D4_0019NLHStoryWall--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1650433/1650433_10460943_1513020914644_5D4_0019NLHStoryWall--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Reflective roadmap of the summit"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1650433/1650433_10460943_1513020914644_5D4_0019NLHStoryWall--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Reflective roadmap of the summit"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">A graphic recorder captured the essential foci of the three day conference on a 6 by 15 foot whiteboard as the conference progressed.</div> <div class="imageCredit">J P Leong</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Public Domain</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Kathie&nbsp;Maynard</div> <div class="imageTitle">Reflective roadmap of the summit</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1650433/1650433_10460943_1513021353567_66_170304Carl--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1650433/1650433_10460943_1513021353567_66_170304Carl--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Keeping a record"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1650433/1650433_10460943_1513021353567_66_170304Carl--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Keeping a record"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Ideas, insights, and learnings of the conference were constantly recorded on whiteboards and archived.</div> <div class="imageCredit">J P Leong</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Kathie&nbsp;Maynard</div> <div class="imageTitle">Keeping a record</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1650433/1650433_10460943_1513022736029_76_170304Mikeadj--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1650433/1650433_10460943_1513022736029_76_170304Mikeadj--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Design session discussions"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1650433/1650433_10460943_1513022736029_76_170304Mikeadj--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Design session discussions"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Experts and practitioners worked together to recognize issues, discuss implications, and identify solutions, maintaining authentic community engagement.</div> <div class="imageCredit">J P Leong</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Public Domain</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Kathie&nbsp;Maynard</div> <div class="imageTitle">Design session discussions</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
