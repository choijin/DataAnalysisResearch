<AbstractNarration>Nontechnical description: Photonic metamaterials are artificial constructs whose optical characteristics may be engineered by altering their geometrical structure, as well as their chemical composition. In this project, the research team explores new phenomena that arise when structural features of the metamaterials are of only several nanometers in size. On such a small scale, traditional optical properties such as color and sheen are no longer discernible. Instead, the properties of the materials may now be precisely tuned by carefully varying their nanoscale structure. The overarching goal of this project is to conduct basic science and engineering research on such precision-structured metamaterials, and elucidate their potential applications. This study particularly addresses fundamental aspects of electronic and optical characteristics of nanoscale metamaterials. In addition, undergraduate and graduate students receive hands-on training in the fields of nanoscience and nanotechnology, materials synthesis, characterization, and device design. Achieving a fundamental understanding of artificial optical materials and their fabrication is anticipated to have broad ranging impact on assessing their potential in new optical devices. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical description: This project addresses the prospects for achieving fundamental understanding of a new class of hyperbolic metamaterials at the quantum level, and the ability to engineer and fabricate such structures. In particular, the research team is interested in developing quantum engineering methodologies through an approach which combines materials optimization, detailed optical studies and theoretical modeling. The project fosters a systematic investigation, starting from ab-initio modeling of thin films, followed by studies of multilayered systems, and subsequently a detailed study of patterned nano-photonic structures and devices. By combining skills in thin film synthesis, device fabrication and characterization, ultrafast optics and nano-photonics a comprehensive data set is obtained. Given the current trends for nanophotonics, device miniaturization and photonic-electronic integration, the ability to engineer new photonic materials is expected to significantly extend current applications of existing devices, enabling yet unforeseen implementations of quantum photonic metamaterials.</AbstractNarration>
