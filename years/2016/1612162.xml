<AbstractNarration>This travel grant provides partial support for U.S. participation in the Young Topologists Meeting 2016, held at the University of Copenhagen, Denmark, July 4th-8th, 2016. The Young Topologists Meeting (YTM) is an annual European conference focused on the work of graduate students and young researchers in topology, that brings in participants from all over the world. At the YTM, junior topologists present their work to a large international audience, and also attend mini-courses taught by senior topologists. The conference provides opportunities for the participants to meet new colleagues and mentors, and to form research collaborations. Its open and supportive atmosphere encourages young mathematicians, including those from underrepresented groups, to pursue research careers in topology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The YTM is an annual event, first started in 2007, and alternating between Copenhagen, Denmark and Lausanne, Switzerland. The conference features parallel sessions of contributed talks by graduate students and young researchers, covering a broad spectrum of topics in topology. In addition to these talks, there will be mini-courses by three senior topologists, discussing the connections between algebraic topology and other fields, including representation theory and K-theory, geometric topology, and mathematical physics. This year Akhil Mathew (Harvard University, US) will give a course on Mackey structure and algebraic K-theory. Oscar Randall-Williams (Cambridge University, UK) and Nathalie Wahl (University of Copenhagen, Denmark) will give courses on homological stability, diffeomorphism groups, cobordism categories, and topological field theories.
