<AbstractNarration>This award provides three years of funding to help defray the expenses of participants in the conference series "Southern California Analysis and Partial Differential Equations," the first installment of which will be held in Fall 2016 on the campus of the University of California-San Diego.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Southern California Analysis and Partial Differential Equations (SCAPDE) is a regional conference series that was started in the 1980s and that twice yearly brings together, at rotating sites, roughly forty mathematicians from Southern California and surrounding areas whose interests cover a wide spectrum of topics within analysis. The following are typical subjects of SCAPDE meetings: dynamical systems, harmonic analysis, mathematical physics, nonlinear partial differential equations, complex analysis, spectral theory. The conference format provides ample opportunity for graduate students, postdocs, and other young scientists to present their work.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The grant was used to support the organization of several conferences in the general fields of mathematical analysis and partial differential equations (PDE) in the Southern California area, and could be seen as a continuation of some previous grants which funded similar meetings. At this time one could say that these meetings constitute a well-established sequence of conferences which have been happening every year, sometimes on several occasions per year, covering a range of topics in analysis and PDE.   Several successful meetings took place during the tenure of this grant. Leading researchers at different career stages and from all over US attended the meetings, delivered  lectures on topics of high interest and interacted with the audience. Participants from virtually every university in Southern California and most in Northern California have joined this sequence of  conferences; participants from other US institutions have attended as well. With the help of the grant, the organizers facilitated and financially supported the participation of a large number of graduate students, this being another successful goal of the grant.   The conferences reflected to a certain extent the research interests of the faculty in these fields at UC San Diego and the other Southern California universities which traditionally participate in organizing  the conference series. The conferences were helpful in further strengthening the connection among the researchers working in analysis and PDE in Southern California, and gave visibility to recent important mathematical developments in these fields, which would have been more difficult to accomplish without the existence of these conferences.
