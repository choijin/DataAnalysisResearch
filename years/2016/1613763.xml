<AbstractNarration>Additive manufacturing a technique for near-net shaping and rapid prototyping of both industrial products and novel alloy systems. More specifically, direct laser deposition techniques such a Laser Engineered Net Shaping (LENS) can be used for depositing compositionally and functionally graded materials. This research aims to optimize laser additive processing technologies such as LENS to process a class of magnetic materials from elemental powders, and to use LENS-deposited compositionally-graded magnetic alloys to assess the relationship between microstructure and magnetic property. This research will be conducted in collaboration with Dr. Raju Ramanujan, an expert on magnetic alloys, at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore. The outcomes of this project would include advancements in energy and power transmission sector, high efficiency motors, as well as in solid-state refrigeration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Laser Engineered Net Shaping allows for the use of elemental blends of powders for novel alloy prototyping. By utilizing multiple powder feeders, it is possible to alter alloy composition as a function of build distance and yield a single system with continuum of compositions. Soft and semi-hard magnetic alloys, and graded alloys of different types will be processed using LENS. These include those of the permalloy type, based on Ni-Fe-V and Ni-Fe-Mo compositions, compositions based on Finemet, Fe-Si-B-Nb-Cu, as well as magneto-caloric compositions based on Fe-Mn-Ni. The scale of this microstructure in these LENS processed alloys can be varied via the laser deposition parameters and this, in turn, influences coercivity (Hc) and saturation magnetization (Ms) of these laser-deposited magnetic alloys. Various instrumentation for magnetic property testing including Anisotropic Magnetoresistance (AMR), Vibrating Sample Magnetometer (VSM), and Physical Property Measurement System (PPMS) are available for use through collaboration with Dr. Raju Ramanujan and Nanyang Technological University in Singapore. Furthermore, the Singapore Center for 3D Printing (SC3DP) is conveniently located at Nanyang Technological University and contains several other additive manufacturing systems such as Selective Laser Melting (SLM) and Selective Laser Sintering (SLS) which can also be used during this project. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award under the East Asia and Pacific Summer Institutes program supports summer research by a U.S. graduate student and is jointly funded by NSF and the National Research Foundation of Singapore.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The NSF EAPSI award titled "Laser Additive Approach to Rapid Assessment and Development of Promising Magnetic Alloy Compositions" has successfully been completed in the Summer of 2016. Several alloy compositions were manufactured via the Laser Engineered Net Shaping (LENS) process, a direct laser deposition additive manufacturing system, located at the University of North Texas (Denton, Texas) prior to arrival in Singapore. These alloy compositions included Fe-30at%Ni, a model soft magnetic alloy, Ni-Fe-Mo and Ni-Fe-V soft magnetic permalloys, and an experimental graded complex composition alloy or "high entropy alloy" with composition FeNiAlCoxCr1-x where x is between 0 and 1. The first two alloys were chosen in part due to the plethora of published literature and the fact that the viability of these systems in various machines such as read/write disk heads has already been explored. These two model alloys allow for the direct comparison of additively manufactured materials to commercially available counterparts. The third complex system is an experimental system with several objectives: First: to further explore the viability of utilizing additive manufacturing for the rapid assessment of novel alloy systems, second: to establish the viability of utilizing additive manufacturing for the near-net shape processing of functional alloys, and third: to further study complex concentrated alloys and individual elements? effects on microstructural evolution.    After arrival to Nanyang Technological University in Singapore, magnetic hysteresis curves and temperature dependent magnetization curves were generated using a vibrating scanning magnetometer (VSM) and a physical properties measurement system (PPMS), respectively. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) coupled with electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) were also performed in order to image the samples and determine the phases present.   For the Fe-30at%Ni alloy, microstructural transformations were observed during the LENS deposition process. By changing the deposition parameters such as laser power and travel speed, the microstructure can be tuned between fcc phase and a martensite-like bcc phase, which result in significantly different saturation magnetizations. Further studies are required to properly characterize the nature of this fcc-bcc transformation and the effect on magnetic properties.  The Fe-Ni-V and Fe-Ni-Mo alloys were deposited utilizing only one condition. A single phase fcc microstructure was observed in scanning electron microscopy and subsequent transmission electron microscopy diffraction analysis. The magnetizations of these two alloys were similar to the reported values found in the literature. The coercivity values were significantly higher, and were associated with microstructural defects that occur in the additive manufacturing process.  The complex concentrated alloy FeNiAlCoxCr1-x requires further study to understand the effects of varying cobalt and chromium additions on microstructural development. The cobalt rich alloy was found to have a higher saturation magnetization than the chromium rich alloys, which was expected due to the magnetic nature of cobalt. The change in composition prompted a change in microstructure, which had significant impact on the coercivity of the alloy.
