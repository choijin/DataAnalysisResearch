<AbstractNarration>This award provides funding to help defray the expenses of participants in the "Conference on Infinite-Dimensional Analysis" that will be held October 28-30, 2016, on the campus of Kent State University.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this conference is to bring the participants up to date on the latest developments in infinite-dimensional holomorphy, with special emphasis on the interplay between operator theory, the geometric theory of Banach spaces, spaces of multilinear mappings and polynomials, linear dynamics, and lineability and universality. The conference program provides ample opportunity for graduate students, postdocs, and other young scientists to present their work.

Many other graduate students and Postdoctoral fellows presented their work during the poster sessions.  There were nearly 90 participants with many students, postdocs and women. One of the primary goals of the grant was to foster collaboration between different analysis groups in USA and abroad. In this respect, as we indicated above, the meeting was a great success, the conference showcased a variety of new perspectives and was  venue for early-stage researchers and graduate students to present their results, through talks and a poster session.  The graduate students,  early-stage researchers had an opportunity to  interact with  leading experts in the field, contributing to training of young mathematicians and prospects for future collaboration.    The remaining funds from the grant were spent on partial travel and local support for early stage researchers from USA  participating  in our ?Informal Analysis Seminar? during Spring 2018. This was in line with our goal of fostering greater collaboration between the Analysis Groups in USA and promote different prospective of the field as well as the applications.  The conference futured  series of lectures by Robert Connelly (Cornell University) and Peter Sternberg (Indiana University).  The conference attracted over 50 participants,  including graduate students and both junior faculty from a number of national schools such as  Washington University, University of Cincinnati, Michigan State, Carnegie-Mellon, Cornell, University of Toledo, University of Texas Rio Grande Valley, University of North Carolina, University of Michigan, Clemson University,  Case Western University, Virginia Commonwealth University, University of Alberta, Courant Institute, New Jersey Institute of Technology and Indiana University.
