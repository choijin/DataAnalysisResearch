<AbstractNarration>This Exploration and Design project in the Engaged Student Learning track in the Improving Undergraduate Science Education program seeks to address the intractable concept of transfer of learning to new settings. A central assumption in most systems of education is that students will be able to apply knowledge and skills beyond the context in which they are originally learned and hence transfer their learning. Existing research studies indicate, however, that successful transfer is exceedingly rare. In this project, transfer will be examined within an existing series of undergraduate science courses intended to promote coherent understanding of energy in physics, chemistry, Earth science, and biology. Energy, a unifying concept important in most science disciplines, is central to scientific literacy and is an idea students should be able to apply to a variety of situations. The integrated curriculum presents energy coherently across disciplines, was designed on the basis of cognitive research, and has been extensively classroom tested at multiple institutions. The course sequence thus serves as a natural laboratory to investigate how much transfer is possible under highly favorable, yet still realizable, conditions. Unifying Science for Students will measure and describe transfer, as well as document the specific components of instruction that promote transfer. Special attention will be paid to understanding how to support transfer among students from traditionally underrepresented groups. Findings will contribute to the knowledge base of what works in supporting application of energy concepts across contexts, for all students.  This project may also help to establish the integrated course sequence as a national model for coherent, cross-disciplinary undergraduate science education. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The integrated curriculum spans four courses: The Flow of Matter and Energy in Physical Systems, Earth Systems, Life Systems, and Chemical Systems. Unifying Science for Students will bring together expertise in physics, chemistry, biology, geology, and cognitive science at two institutions to add to the research base on transfer, using this course series. It will do so by: (1) evaluating the extent to which students successfully transfer understanding of energy in a coherent, constructivist-based sequence of science courses; (2) documenting the productive and problematic reasoning approaches that arise when students transfer ideas about energy to new contexts; (3) identifying instructional cues that facilitate transfer; and (4) investigating the impact of explicit instruction in metacognition on the understanding, retention, and transfer of energy concepts across disciplines.  Quantitative and qualitative methods will be employed to address these goals. A longitudinal study will generate quantitative measures of the transfer of energy concepts from the original learning context, physics, to a target domain, chemistry. Interviews, classroom observations, and analysis of written work will be used to describe what transfer "looks like" by developing a taxonomy of discipline-specific transfer attempts. Finally, a quasi-experimental study will investigate the impact of metacognitive writing assignments on transfer. The general and discipline-specific knowledge generated through this project will be situated to inform curriculum design so that transfer can become a more realizable goal in higher education. The Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship program is providing co-funding for this project in recognition of its alignment with the broader teacher preparation goals of the Noyce effort.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This was a collaborative project between Whatcom Community College (WCC, grant 1612055) and Western Washington University (WWU, grant #1612251) to study student transfer of concepts of energy and energy conservation across science disciplines at the introductory college level.  The students began their exposure to energy concepts in a conceptual physics course, then continued with conceptual biology, geology, and chemistry courses.  We studied quantitatively and qualitatively students’ ability to transfer concepts about energy across these disciplines.  We also developed an intervention for the physics course intended to help students engage in transfer.   Goal 1: Measurement of Transfer. We have successfully developed, tested and validated two assessments focusing on the concepts of energy that can be used in a variety of ways by instructors, departments and divisions to gather data about student transfer of the basic concepts of energy. These assessments, the Conceptual Physics Test (CPT) and Transfer Test (TrT), are multiple choice tests that work together to assess first a students’ baseline understanding of energy and ability to apply energy concepts in a physics context (CPT), and then their ability to apply those same concepts in a chemistry context (TrT). These assessments can be used to foreshadow students’ ability to apply concepts across disciplines at the end of a first course in physics, and/or used across courses for the purpose of program evaluation.  Along with the assessments, the project team also developed a transfer index that is a combination of scores from the two instruments. This index uses the CPT score to normalize for physics understanding and highlights students’ ability to reason about energy in a new context.  Goal 2: Description of Transfer. We have created and piloted interview protocols in the contexts of geology, biology, and chemistry that elicit student thinking about energy forms, transfers, transformations, and energy conservation in these different disciplinary contexts.  These protocols, used alongside an energy resource coding framework that was developed to analyze them, have revealed important elements of student reasoning about energy across disciplinary contexts. One finding from this part of the project was that students seemed to be framing the energy conservation principle in one of two distinct ways. In an "energy frame" approach, students accounted for energy by focusing on a given initial quantity of energy, and describing where the energy goes as interactions occur. In a "systems frame" approach, students accounted for energy by defining an object or system and relating energy inputs, outputs, and changes for that system.  Other findings include more spontaneous activation of an energy framework to explain scenarios in which temperature changes, compared to scenarios in which motion changes (in these latter scenarios force arguments were more spontaneously used by students), as well as different definitions and uses of energy forms in the disciplines.  Goal 3:  Promoting Transfer   We created an intervention to be administered in a conceptual physics class that is intended to help students reason about energy interdisciplinarily and transfer energy concepts between disciplines. These interventions include readings, videos, discussions, and written reflections.  As part of this intervention we also developed a collection of three writing prompts to help instructors examine students’ ideas about energy in different disciplines.
