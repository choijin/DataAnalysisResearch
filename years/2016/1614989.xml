<AbstractNarration>High performance plastics are made of expensive ingredients and in large quantities. Plastics companies, such as tire rubber and polymer compounders, have struggled to find a filler that provides the desired improved properties without great expense or prohibitive technological barriers. If an inexpensive, compatible filler could be found, high performance commodity plastics could have better properties and a lower, more consistent cost that is less dependent on volatile petroleum prices. Traditional fillers are dropped in "top down" and mixed requiring lots of energy, heat, or chemical aids. This project investigates the commercial opportunity for a filler that is assembled "bottom up" from within the mixture. The filler is based on previous research on engineered low-cost agricultural proteins. If the filler is commercially viable, high performance plastics will achieve improved properties and be produced at lower cost allowing a traditionally petroleum dependent industry to save money and become more sustainable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is to communicate and cooperate with the polymers market to determine the area of greatest need for this filler. The technology has been shown in lab scale as a proof-of-principle, and further development would benefit from guidance toward promising application areas. The project scope will be to first meet with tire rubber companies and large plastics compounders that currently use fillers. These global companies use complex recipes and through cooperation will provide direction for a technology demonstration. This project will experimentally articulate the commercialization potential of this technology. By receiving direct feedback from future business partners, a viable business model and value proposition can be articulated. A demand-driven course for commercial success will be planned by considering feedback on technology licensure, in-house development and manufacturing, or contract manufacturing.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit. As a result of prior NSF funding (CMMI-0856262, EEC-1156645, and I/UCRC CenTiRe), it was discovered that well organized nanometer-sized protein aggregates could be self-assembled with controllable mechanical properties.  Mixing these proteins into rubber resulted in unusual property gains but only some protein morphologies were accessible for kinetic reasons.  Nearly 200 industrial plastics and rubber scientists, engineers, managers, and sales/marketing people working on incorporating biobased materials into current products and increasing plastics performance were interviewed to learn about the potential opportunities of materials like those proposed here.  This allowed for the discovery of a focused biobased and high performance product for plastics and rubber.  Business planning was performed and some prototypes built.  Broader Impacts. Protein Q, Inc., a startup company founded and owned by the PI, is now focused on commercializing nanometer-sized protein amyloids mixed into rubber.  The uses are in rubber products for energy and other high value industries where there is less of an impediment to commercialization and use.  As a result of I-Corps, Protein Q has found appropriate technology partners to continue to develop the material for the benefit of industrial customers.  After the completion of this I-Corps project, Protein Q will seek seed stage funding through SBIR and venture capital to commercialize a compoundable protein amyloid/rubber material.
