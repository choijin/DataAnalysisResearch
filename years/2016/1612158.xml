<AbstractNarration>Postdoctoral Fellow: Kelly Swarts&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: 1612158&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology for FY 2016, Research Using Biological Collections. The fellowship supports a research and training plan for the Fellow to take transformative approaches to grand challenges in biology that employ biological collections in highly innovative ways.  The title of the research plan for this fellowship to Kelly Swarts is "Direct estimation of maize population dynamics and targets of selection from near domestication to the present from archaeological samples in Mexico." The host institution for this fellowship is the Max Planck Institute for Developmental Biology, and the co-sponsoring scientists are Drs. Hern√°n Burbano and Johannes Krause.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project focuses on domestication and adaptation of maize (corn) to better understand the basis for modern maize diversity. Maize is a globally important commodity crop plant, found everywhere from arid deserts to lowland tropics to northern Europe. Non-agricultural peoples in central Mexico first identified the biological potential in teosinte (Zea mays ssp. parviglumis) nearly 10,000 years ago and began the selection process of transforming a wild grass into a dependent crop plant. This process continues to the present, as people carried maize first across the Americas and then the world. Each of these peoples has imposed their values and priorities onto maize, persistently selecting favorable and adapted varieties, and ultimately generating the remarkable biological and morphological diversity found globally in maize. The Fellow?s research addresses the arc of domestication and adaptation, integrating ancient genomics, maize genetics, and archaeology, to better understand the basis for modern maize diversity through maize evolution near the center of origin in Mexico. The Fellow is combining publicly available databases of modern maize with DNA derived from archaeological maize macroremains recovered from sites near the putative center of maize origin (dating from nearly 6,000 years ago to the present), to answer the following questions: 1) How strong was the domestication bottleneck and what were the effective population sizes of early maize?; 2) Can we refine the geographical region of domestication using archaeological populations?; 3) Which phenotypic traits and functional classes of the genome were targeted for selection and how did these change over time?; and 4) Can we differentiate the effects of the changing environment, culture, and heritable genetic variance in ancient maize phenotypes?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Fellow is being trained to be proficient in the methods of extraction and analysis of ancient DNA, and to integrate these data with population and quantitative genetic analyses. Addressing maize evolution as a culturally-situated process is of societal importance because understanding the genetic impacts of past decisions can help us predict the genetic impacts of human actions going forward, for this globally important crop.</AbstractNarration>
