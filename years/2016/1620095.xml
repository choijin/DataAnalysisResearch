<AbstractNarration>NONTECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Division of Materials Research, together with the Division of Mathematical Sciences, the Division of Chemical, Bioengineering, Environmental, and Transport Systems, and the Office for Multidisciplinary Activities contribute funds to this award that provides support for the International Liquid Crystal Conference, which will be held at Kent State University from July 31st to August 5th 2016. This is a highly interdisciplinary meeting that brings together a diverse group of leading researchers, including scientists and engineers from academia and industry, whose work covers the range from basic science to device manufacturing. In this instance of the conference, applied mathematics is included as a session topic for the first time. The general aim of the conference will be to facilitate the exchange of ideas about current and interesting problems related to liquid crystals, to discuss recent findings and developments in the field, to determine future research directions, and to enable future collaborations among the participants. NSF support will enable the participation of 12 early-career scientists and 21 students, who might not otherwise be able to attend. Students and postdoctoral researchers will also benefit from mentorship activities during the conference.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Division of Materials Research, together with the Division of Mathematical Sciences, the Division of Chemical, Bioengineering, Environmental, and Transport Systems, and the Office for Multidisciplinary Activities contribute funds to this award that provides support for the International Liquid Crystal Conference, which will be held at Kent State University from July 31st to August 5th 2016.

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The International Liquid Crystal Conference (ILCC) takes place every two years, attractingnearly 1000 participants. It brings together the international liquid crystal community, researchersfrom many disciplines, with work ranging from basic science to device manufacturing, fromall corners of the world.  Participating in ILCC is vital to researchers in the field at all stages of their careersin order to learn about exciting new developments, to have the opportunity to discuss theirresults and those of their peers, to network, to become inspired and to identify new researchdirections and to establish new collaborations. The resulting enhancement of research productivitywill not only contribute to individual career success and personal satisfaction, but willalso lead to the discovery of new effects and new applications, and through these benefitsociety as a whole.  This project provided support for researchers who would otherwise be unable to attend. These are faculty members - often early stagefaculty - with modest grant support, researchers not yet fully active in this area, post-doctoralfellows and graduate students whose advisors cannot sponsor their participation, and interestedundergraduates without support.   The project also aimed - and succeeded - in attracting mathematicians, who were not well represented at previous ILCCs, and in the liquid crysal community in general in the past.   Support was provided to over 100 particiants who would not have been able to participate otherwise. 56 research papers from ILCC2016 participants have been published in the journal Molecular Crystals and Liquid Crystals.    Participating in ILCC is vital to researchers in the field at all stages of their careersin order to learn about exciting new developments, to have the opportunity to discuss theirresults and those of their peers, to network, to become inspired and to identify new researchdirections and to establish new collaborations. WIth the help of this project, ILCC2016 provided these advantages to participants. The resulting enhancement of research productivitywill not only contribute to individual career success and personal satisfaction, but willalso lead to the discovery of new effects and new applications, and through these benefitsociety as a whole.
