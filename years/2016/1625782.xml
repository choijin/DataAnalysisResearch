<AbstractNarration>Scientists and engineers interested in ocean and environmental fluid mechanics are involved in an array of fundamental research with interests ranging from the deep ocean to shallow streams. The dynamics of these flows are generally complex, as they involve fluid, geological, chemical, and biological processes occurring in a wide range of temporal and spatial scales. These flows may have either fixed or dynamic boundary conditions (i.e., seabeds) and may contained fixed engineered structures (e.g., hydrokinetic devices). While many fluid flow problems are well suited to small-scale laboratory studies, significant scaling concerns arise with complex unsteady multi-phase flows interacting with fixed or dynamic boundaries and structures. A unique feature of the concentration of the regional faculty, post-docs and graduate students working on these complex flows is the synergy that results from researchers with different backgrounds addressing a variety of problems with the commonalities provided by fluid physics. Individually, research efforts will evaluate fundamental hypotheses necessary for advancing the respective fields. Collectively, the synergies realized through transdisciplinary interactions between contributing scientists have an extremely high potential to transform understanding of the complex fluid flows that are ubiquitous in engineering and nature.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With a goal towards significantly advancing the simulation of flow physics and biogeochemical processes involved in aquatic marine and riverine environments, this effort will support the acquisition of an Environmental Flows Water Tunnel (EFWT) and instrumentation required for resolving the flow and sediment fields. The EFWT will accommodate both oscillatory and steady flow for the simulation of horizontal wave velocities, tidal flows, or steady currents with both high- and low-velocity magnitudes. The EFWT will operate as a rigid-lid (non-free surface) tunnel or as a flume/channel with a reduced-depth free surface while allowing for either rigid bottom boundaries or movable sediment beds with or without aquatic vegetation. It will also allow for the evaluation of engineered systems, high frequency acoustic characterization of the seafloor, and scale model marine hydrokinetic energy conversion devices or small arrays. The EFWT will provide the instrumentation necessary for addressing fundamental questions involving ocean and environmental fluid mechanics and will serve as a valuable local, regional, and national resource for academic, governmental, and industrial partners. The EFWT will allow for scientific advancement in a range of geophysical and engineered topics that require the resolution of fluid-sediment-structure interactions in riverine and ocean environments. Observations will be used to contribute to open-source community modeling efforts (e.g., benchmark data sets), develop a novel understanding of processes that impact ecosystem health, improve undersea technology, evaluate ocean renewable energy devices, and provide a vehicle for public outreach and education. The EFWT will be used for hands-on laboratory and demonstration purposes both within University of New Hampshire through courses in earth sciences, civil engineering, mechanical engineering and ocean engineering (with its new undergraduate major program) and also, through a multitude of continuous outreach efforts.</AbstractNarration>
