<AbstractNarration>Proposal 1623251&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title: Workshop on Scenario for Brain-Inspired Cognitive Assistants&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PI: Jonathan Candelaria&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Institution:  Semiconductor Research Corporation&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Date &amp; Location:  San Jose CA, May 12-13th.&lt;br/&gt;Workshop Goal: Explore research opportunities towards a goal of creating cognitive intelligent assistance to improve human productivity and overall quality of life. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Non-Technical:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Today we are at the cusp of a new era of computing. In the first era, machines were designed and built to greatly accelerate the performance of basic arithmetic calculations compared to human "computers" In the second era, these machines, by then called "computers" themselves, were programmed to solve highly complex problem sets, as well as enable global communication networks. We are now beginning to explore the use of machines to expand upon and augment human cognitive capabilities. We envision "machine intelligence" acting as an interface between humans and their environments, providing insight and guidance for problems that cannot be handled by the unaided mind or by computers alone. How to optimize this collaborative interaction between humans and these "intelligent" machines is an open research question. In order to create the foundation for future intelligent systems that can most effectively and efficiently assist individuals, businesses and society at large, it is essential that this research question be addressed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop is designed to discuss and study progress toward developing "intelligent" machines. It can serve as "helpful assistants" to improve human productivity and overall quality of life. The workshop on "Brain-Inspired Cognitive Assistance"&lt;br/&gt;is proposed for San Jose CA, May 12-13th.  The goal of this workshop is to formulate scenarios for developing novel architectures for intelligent, energy efficient, brain-inspired perception, computing, decision and management in the future 10-15 years. Various concepts show promise, including cellular automaton assembly, static and dynamic neural networking, deep machine learning, etc. as well as a wide variety of social robotics principles, genetic software, bio-inspired convergence of interaction principles, predictive cognition, natural language and complex pattern recognition algorithms and methodologies.</AbstractNarration>

To take this man-machine interaction to another level a group of experts from multiple disciplines participated in an NSF sponsored workshop with a vision of the creation of an intelligent assistant that could reason hencefoth known as intelligent cognitive assistant (ICA).  There were five primary outcomes of the workshop:  Enhance, not replace human capabilities Adapt with flexibility to dynamic real-world environments Cultivate trush among humans and machines Facilitate "natural" interactions Incorporate multi-disciplinary perspectives   Both from an adoption but also a practical standpoint, the participants believed providing complementary assistance to enhance the human capability or experience should be the target of the research.

Therefore, it is the recommendation of the participants that a public-private partnership between government, industry and academia be formed to drive the fundamental research agenda.  In addition to the research agenda, the participants identified three application driver examples:  Enhancement of education and training Facilitating and enhancing workplace-related activities Elder care and Aging-in-place assistance   The ICA device should provide assistance in lifelong learning beginning with early childhood development through adult workforce retraining including global audiences from under-resourced to well-resourced communities.  In the workplace scenario, the ICA could faciitate many to many communications, coordinate multi-modal communication and be a resource in providing information to enhance the capabilities of these workplace teams.

Im summary, the ICA workshop was successful in defining key elements of a research agenda, identifying application drivers and defining a public-private partnership approacyh to address the challenges.
