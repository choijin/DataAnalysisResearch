<AbstractNarration>1604633 - Kulatilaka&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;State-of-the-art, nonintrusive optical and laser-based diagnostic methods can unveil tremendous opportunities for scientists and engineers designing next generation engines, power plants, propulsion systems, chemical and plasma processing facilities, among many others.  The overarching goal of this research project is to develop novel species measurement technique to characterize fundamental physical and chemical processes in harsh environments such as those present in modern gas turbine combustor and IC engines.  The new techniques developed here have the potential to uncover quantitative, spatially and temporally resolved key intermediate species measurements in reacting flow systems by using the latest developments in the ultrashort pulse laser technology.  In addition to primary research outcomes, graduate and undergraduate students including minorities and underrepresented groups are trained in unique, next-generation laser fundamentals and applications.  Students work in multidisciplinary research environments and often interact with outside research teams, preparing them for successful future careers in optics and energy related technologies.  Research findings will be incorporated into ongoing curriculum and course development work as well as our outreach activities for K-12 STEM groups, further enhancing the broader impacts of this effort.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The technical objective of this project is to develop an ultrafast-laser-based optical diagnostic technique capable of measuring chemical species-with initial focus on highly reactive atomic species-in harsh environments without taking in to account complex quenching processes that limit the precision and accuracy of such measurements.  Space and time varying concentrations of quenching partners are virtually impossible to quantify in such turbulent flow fields.  Furthermore, temperature- and pressure-dependent species-specific quenching cross section data needed for corrections are rather limited and virtually impossible to obtain in many practical situations.  In recent years, significant advances have been made in femtosecond-laser-based diagnostic tools for high-repetition-rate imaging of atomic and molecular species in flames and plasmas.  However, molecular quenching effects have still prevailed in these diagnostics.  In the present work, innovative new nonlinear optical techniques are investigated to elevate such diagnostics to the next level by measuring important atomic and molecular species without the need of quenching corrections.  The new diagnostics will be evaluated in high-pressure conditions as well and complex reacting turbulent flow conditions.  Subsequently, they will be used to generate critical data sets for chemical kinetics model validation in a selected set of turbulent flames and to characterize a new type of 'wall-less' reactor designed for chemical kinetics studies.</AbstractNarration>

Real-time, nonintrusive diagnostic methods for physical and chemical parameters during reactions and energy release processes are of critical importance to better understand the fundamental combustion process of traditional as well as new fuel derivatives.

Hence, the primary objective of this NSF-funded research project is to develop cutting-edge optical diagnostic and imaging techniques based on recent advances in the ultrashort pulse laser technology, in particular high-energy amplified femtosecond (fs) laser sources, for critical yet hard-to-measure chemical species imaging in harsh reacting flow environments.</p> <p>The fs-duration laser pulses (note, 1 fs = 10<sup>-15</sup> sec, or a millionth of a billionth of a second) have many advantages compared to conventionally used nanosecond (ns) or picosecond (ps)-duration lasers for chemical species imaging. High-peak-power but low-average-power fs pulses are ideal for nonlinear spectroscopic schemes involving multi-photon excitation processes. They are also less intrusive, making the measurement free of most competing interferences, thereby increasing the precision, accuracy, dimensionality, and the measurement bandwidth (i.e., kHz-rate imaging in dynamic conditions). In particular, during this project, we have made major advances in two-dimensional imaging of carbon monoxide (CO) in sooting flames, atomic hydrogen (H) detection during ignition, extinction and soot formation processes, as well as mixture fraction imaging using inert gas tracers such as krypton (Kr)?all using ~100 fs high-energy laser pulses.

In contrast, a novel approach was also investigated for detecting H using fs three-photon LIF scheme. Another unique approach was presented for imaging flame structures using hydroxyl radical (OH) fs LIF. Also explored was the incorporation of broadband fs pulses for simultaneous two-species imaging (i.e., H/OH, CO/OH) in flames. A fs pump-probe method was successfully applied to better understand the collisional process and energy transfer dynamics of H and Kr atoms, thereby deriving coherent detection strategies at time scales faster than typical atomic/molecular collision times.
