<AbstractNarration>The stratosphere, an atmospheric layer about 8-10 km above the surface, can influence winter weather over the Northern Hemisphere via its interactions with the troposphere beneath.  These interactions can take several weeks to develop and mature, and may provide information about changes to weather patterns two to six weeks in advance, particularly during the fall and winter.  An important starting point for some of these interactions is a change in the tropospheric winds over Northern Eurasia that occurs over a relatively short period, generally less than two weeks.  This change in winds is associated with the "vertical pulses of wave activity flux", which can influence the polar stratosphere and, eventually, surface weather.  This research aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of these short-term "pulse events" and their hemispheric influence by examining the spatial structure and temporal evolution of the events and investigating their role in the initiation of slower troposphere-stratosphere interactions that end up resulting in changes to weather over regions remote from the pulses, including over parts of North America, Europe, and Asia. This improved understanding will also provide an evaluation of the potential for considering these pulse events in the prediction of some aspects of weather variability up to several weeks in advance.  The events will be studied using observational data for examining their structure and investigating their underlying physical mechanisms, and also using the output of weather forecast models to assess how realistically models are able to reproduce these events and their influence.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This investigation will provide a better understanding of how the troposphere and stratosphere interact and of one of the causes of variations in winter weather.  The project will also educate and train graduate students and include public outreach and education through development of a teaching portal, student presentation of tutorials through social media, and provision of an experimental forecast.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The polar vortex is an area of low pressure that sits over the North Pole in winter in the stratosphere.  When the polar vortex is strong the Arctic is cold and the mid-latitudes are mild but when the polar vortex is weak or disrupted the Arctic is warm and the mid-latitudes are cold.  Traditionally in meteorology, the behavior of the polar vortex is thought to be just binary.  However, we did an in-depth study of the behavior of the polar vortex and we found that the behavior of the polar vortex is more complex with up to seven different states.  We found for the largest disruptions of the polar vortex or for the weakest state of the polar vortex the lagest temperature response at the surface is focused across northern Eurasia with widespread cooling.  In a different type of polar vortex disruption where the polar vortex remains intact but is stretched, the immediate temperature response at the surface is focused in central and eastern North America again with widespread cooling.  Since polar vortex behavior can lead our weather up to two weeks in advance, identification of the different types of polar vortex and their impacts on the weather can be used to improve long-term weather predictions with a lead time of multiple weeks.  Cohen first authored the most authoritative review paper to date (over thirty co-authors) on the topic of the influence of amplified Arctic warming on mid-latitude winter weather.  In the review paper, we discuss the causes of amplified Arctic warming and the dynamical linkages between a warm Arctic and an increase in severe winter weather across the mid-latitudes, often associated with a weak or disrupted polar vortex.  We also showed that there is a significant difference between how models represent the linkage between a warm Arctic and mid-latitude weather and what is diagnosed from the observations.  In a final study we analyze the relationship between the polar vortex and the cold North American winter of 2013/14.  That winter the media (through on air meteorologists) first introduced the polar vortex to the public, however the connection to the polar vortex in winter 2013/14 was considered controversial at the time.  In this study we show that behavior of the polar vortex was intimately related to the North American cold.  However, it was not related through the more well-known polar vortex disruptions or weak polar vortex state but rather stretching of the polar vortex.  Cohen has been writing the publicly available Arctic Oscillation/Polar Vortex blog every week during the winter and every other week during the summer.  The audience for the blog continues to grow and is especially influential in the winter and is often cited in the media.  One video was created to explain how Arctic change may be influencing the polar vortex and winter weather across the mid-latitudes in winter.  The video has been posted to the blog and has received tens of thousands of views on various social media platforms. A second introductory video on the polar vortex has been created by a University of Oklahoma student funded by the proposal and was recently posted.
