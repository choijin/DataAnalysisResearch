<AbstractNarration>Dr. Leah Minc, of Oregon State University, and an international team of collaborators will explore the origins of market-place exchange and the specific political and social conditions fostering market systems in ancient economies. Although markets are a fundamental part of modern economy, scholars question whether similar commercial exchange systems developed in ancient societies and debate which factors stimulated their emergence and growth in non-western economic traditions.  From the perspective of modern microeconomic theory, some researchers have argued that commercial exchange and a complex division of labor evolved naturally in complex societies as an efficient solution to provisioning large populations with essential goods, once political stability ensured freedom of movement and rule of law. Other scholars, in contrast, dispute the applicability of the modern mind-set (including assumptions of economic rationality, competition, and profit motive) to non-western or pre-industrial societies.  For example, some historians question whether in highly stratified societies, where control over the means of production (land and labor) was firmly held by the ruling class, production and exchange built on profit incentives could reasonably develop among the peasantry, or whether in these cases alternative forms of exchange (such as extended family networks) might provide a means for acquiring needed commodities.  Archaeology is well poised to evaluate the universality of micro-economic assumptions, by examining the evidence for market exchange in the distant past, as well as the political and social context for its development and the possible persistence of alternative forms of exchange that supplied communities with necessary materials.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This collaborative project will examine a pristine case of market system development by using nuclear science and geochemical techniques to trace exchanges of basic, utilitarian goods.  The project will focus on the Valley of Oaxaca, Mexico, home to one of the best documented early state societies in the New World, and will explore how key political events affected regional economic interaction and integration through time.  Drawing on excavated collections of domestic pottery from communities throughout the valley, the research team will use robust methods of trace-element analysis (instrumental neutron activation analysis) to establish where ceramic vessels were manufactured, map their movement from producer to consumer, and assess the spatial scale, organization, and intensity of intra-valley exchange across key periods of state emergence and consolidation (from ca. 700 BC through 550 AD).  The observed distribution patterns will provide a sound foundation from which to re-assess specific models of market system evolution, as well as a means for future studies to address how these economic changes affected households' production, consumption, and exchange decisions.  Further, the intersection of archaeology and nuclear science will create opportunities for STEM education and professional training for students in the social sciences; at the same time, due to its "human appeal," archaeometric research can build support for nuclear science, engaging public interest and justifying infrastructure and lab equipment upgrades.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Archaeologists study trade and exchange in order to gain insights into the dynamics of ancient economies. We want to know what types of goods were traded, how far these goods traveled, and the trading partners involved.  Was exchange conducted only at a local level, or were certain goods obtained over longer distances?  And how was the intensity, spatial scale, and organization of exchange affected by cycles of political consolidation and fragmentation?   In this project, we examined the organization of trade and exchange in the Valley of Oaxaca, Mexico, across a span of more than 1400 years, from the Middle Formative to the Late Classic (ca. 700 BC to 750 AD).  Our primary goals were to trace the development of exchange networks within the valley over time and to examine how these were affected by the rise and subsequent decline of the ancient Zapotec state.  Prior analyses of this area have concluded that the formation of the Zapotec polity, initiated with the founding of its capital at Monte Alb&aacute;n in ca. 500 BC, unified the valley’s deeply divided regions in a territorial state.  Although scholars disagree on the exact timing of this process, they do agree that the valley-wide political integration stimulated increased economic interaction, leading to economies of scale and the emergence of a regional market system to facilitate the movement of basic goods between the valley's core and subregions.  The stability and primacy of Monte Alb&aacute;n throughout the nearly 1000 years of its political dominance suggested considerable stability in the economy as well, until the decline and abandonment of Monte Alb&aacute;n in ca. 750-800 AD and the inevitable rupture and segmentation of the valley’s exchange networks.   Our efforts to confirm these commercial developments in the valley focus on the exchange of pottery, for several reasons.  Ceramic vessels were widely available in ancient Zapotec society where they represented a range of low-value, utilitarian to elaborate, "costly" goods, and they have preserved well in the archaeological record.  Equally important, we can determine the geographic origin of ceramics based on the chemistry of their pastes.  Clays in different regions will differ in their chemical composition, based on the rocks and minerals from which they weathered.  This distinctive chemical signature is transferred to the pottery, allowing archaeologists to determine the provenance or geographic origin of the vessel in question.   In order to trace market exchange of ceramics, we first collected clay samples from throughout the Valley of Oaxaca to document regional variation in clay composition. The results of this clay survey allow us to match ceramics to specific areas on the landscape and to establish ceramic provenance over a relatively fine spatial scale.  We then selected ceramics - both household debris and production debris - from previously excavated sites throughout the valley; samples of more than 3200 ceramic vessels were exported to our lab for trace-element analysis as part of this project, bringing our total sample for the Valley of Oaxaca to nearly 5000 samples.  Based on the exchanges documented by these vessels, our results highlight several key new findings that challenge long-standing interpretations of the past.  These include: (1) the prior existence (i.e., before the founding of Monte Alb&aacute;n) of strong exchange network connections in the central valley that crossed assumed pre-state political divisions; (2) the decline rather than the expansion of these exchange networks in the early stages of state political consolidation; (3) the late emergence of a centralized market system, albeit limited to the central valley surrounding Monte Alb&aacute;n, some 400 years following the capital’s foundation; and (4) a slow but marked loss of integration and a shift toward the increasing economic autonomy of Monte Alb&aacute;n's subject centers over the last 500 years of the state’s existence.      In sum, this study offers the first regional perspective on the organization of commercial development in the Valley of Oaxaca using robust methods of chemical analysis of exchanged goods. The conclusions reported here suggest that many of our prior interpretations regarding market system development and its articulation with the political processes of Zapotec state formation and decline now require significant rethinking and revision. Beyond these specific findings, the clay and ceramic chemistry database amassed by this project lays a solid foundation for continued analyses of ceramic exchange in this key area of archaeological research, and provides an engaging demonstration of how STEM fields can expand our knowledge of the past.
