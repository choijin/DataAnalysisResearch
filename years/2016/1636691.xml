<AbstractNarration>Brain-computer interface research explores avenues of controlling devices directly from brain signals.  Thus, BCI technology is a powerful control option for neuro-prosthetic limbs, as well as a potential communication option for people with severe motor disabilities or disorders such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), brainstem stroke, cerebral palsy, and spinal cord injury, who may have little or even no muscle control and therefore no means of communication with the external world.  The International Brain-Computer Interface (IBCI) meeting is the flagship conference for the field, the sixth of which will be held May 30-June 3, 2016, in Asilomar, California.  Effective BCI research requires interdisciplinary interactions involving neuroscience, psychology, engineering, mathematics, computer science, and clinical rehabilitation, and the IBCI meeting serves as a critical catalyst for technology dissemination, new collaborations, and educational opportunities for students.  The primary source of funding for the meeting is the National Institutes of Health (NIH).  This NSF funding will enable another 20 students, including undergraduate and graduate students and postdoctoral fellows, to attend and participate in the conference. Five of these twenty will be minority students who will receive full scholarships, while half of the remaining fifteen scholarships will be given to students who are women.  All of the NSF funding will be used for student travel, registration, and student-only event costs.  Student participation in the five previous IBCI meetings has been very fruitful; a large number of those students have now graduated and are prominent researchers in the BCI field.  The Brain-Computer Interface Journal has agreed to publish the conference proceedings as a series of peer reviewed papers in a special issue, which will further disseminate the results of the meeting. The organizers are actively recruiting student attendees from traditionally underrepresented groups.  More information about the conference may be found online at http://bcisociety.org/meetings/bci-meeting-2016-welcome/.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Because of the growth in the field of BCI research, 300 or more participants are expected to attend this meeting, including investigators from at least 100 BCI research groups. All attendees commit to the entire meeting, from the opening reception and dinner on the evening of Monday, May 30 through the final summary discussion at breakfast the morning of Friday, June 3.  A main objective of the conference is to give students a significant educational and professional experience in the BCI field, and to provide opportunities for them to gain depth in their specific interest areas. The conference will begin with a specialized student colloquium on the afternoon before the full conference starts, which will provide lectures from prominent experts in the BCI field. This will give the students a solid foundation for understanding the rest of the conference.  There will also be a student poster session and prizes for the best student research projects, as well as giving students access to research leaders for informal question-and-answer sessions at the end of each day. The students will participate fully in the main conference as well.  Exposure to prominent researchers in the BCI field will allow students to receive invaluable feedback on their work, and to make connections that may result in new research directions; it will also provide students with access to potential mentors, committee members, and experts to review their future work.  A full and detailed schedule of planned conference sessions and events, along with any updates, can be found on the conference website.  With all participants housed on site and all meals for all attendees taken together on site, there will be ample opportunity for informal discussions. This creates a unique opportunity for students and trainees to mingle with and learn from established researchers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This NSF grant made it possible for twenty graduate and undergraduate student researchers to attend the flagship conference in their field, the International Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) Meeting.  The conference was held in Asilomar, CA from May 30 to June 3, 2016.  124 students applied for the funding and twenty students were chosen on the basis of merit, seniority in their programs, and whether they had an accepted abstract for a paper or poster.  Preference was given to students who had never attended a previous BCI conference.  The NSF supported diversity in the student awards; five larger awards were given to minority students, and nine were awarded to female students.  The awards included travel, registration, lodging and meals for the duration of the conference.   The NSF funding also supported a special half-day student colloquium, designed to introduce new researchers to the BCI field.  A total of 47 students attended the colloquium, including the NSF award recipients.  The NSF funding covered the cost of the meeting room and audio/visual support.  The NSF funding also supported a "best research poster" award of $1000 divided among four prize categories.   The colloquium featured  three of the most prominent researchers in the BCI field: Dr. Lee Miller (Northwestern), Dr, Chuck Anderson (Colorado State), and Dr. Donatella Mattia (Fondazione Santa Lucia).  Topics included physiology of brain signals, classifier techniques for brain signal processing, and an overview of how brain signals can control applications for rehabilitation and assistive technology.  The student award recipients also attended the main conference, which included opening keynotes from noted researcher Dr. Eb Fetz, and BCI field founders Dr. Emanuel Donchin and Dr. Jon Wolpaw. The conference continued with a a "State of BCI Symposium", a series of talks intended to provide a snapshot of the state of the art in BCIs.  It also included a virtual forum of BCI users, including (remotely) people with locked-in syndrome who use BCIs to communicate, navigate, and control their environments.  Selected papers describing groundbreaking research were presented in the plenary session.  The conference then broke up into workshops on a variety of topics, from implanted sensors to therapeutic BCIs.  The Asilomar location provides all meals, which presents opportunities for further networking and meeting colleagues.  During meals, special tables are earmarked for "Women in BCI", allowing female students to have breakfast with senior female researchers to develop mentors.  The conference also organizes "Lunch with Leaders", allowing students to sign up to sit with the most prominent and senior researchers in the field.     The days ended with poster sessions, where students and senior researchers could present their work and get valuable feedback from the BCI community.   On the last day of the conference, a collaboration session promoted connections between research groups to aid in growing the field.    The BCI conference organizers are grateful to the NSF for supporting students who might otherwise not be able to attend the conference.  NSF support has been significantly  instrumental in growing and developing the BCI field, allowing our newest researchers to become experts in the field and to make connections that will serve them throughout their careers.
