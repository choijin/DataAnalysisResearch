<AbstractNarration>This award provides support for students to participate in the Fifteenth Summer School on Exotic Beam (EBSS) Physics at the National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory, July 17 - 24, 2016.  The school is designed for graduate students, senior undergraduate students who are actively involved in research and postdocs (within 2 years of their degree). The school will consist of morning lectures and hands-on activities in the afternoons. Students will also have an opportunity to present their research. The aim of the summer school is to educate the next generation of scientists that will drive the research at the Facility for Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB) when it comes online and other existing rare isotope facilities. In years to come, substantial progress in low-energy nuclear physics will have a broad impact on society, ranging from our understanding of the origin of the elements to the enhancement of national security.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Previous sessions of these summer schools have had broad participation of under-represented minorities, with slightly more than 40% of the participants of the Fourteenth EBSS being female.  The organizers of the Fifteenth EBSS will continue the use of accepted best practices to increase diversity and have an inclusive summer school.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Project Outcomes Report: Fifteenth Exotic Beam Summer School     The study of unstable nuclei that have unusual ratios of protons to neutrons is one of the frontiers of nuclear science. The investigation of such exotic nuclei lying far from stability is crucial for understanding the synthesis of nuclei in stellar environment as well as the nature of the nuclear forces that bind atomic nuclei together. The science progress is driven by the development of exotic beams produced in present and next-generation rare-isotope facilities including Facility for Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB) which is currently under construction on the campus of Michigan State University.  Nuclear Physics is a very broad and diverse subject, influencing our knowledge on subjects as diverse as halo nuclei at drip lines, many-body quantum theory, the super heavy elements, and the inner structure of neutron stars. There are also a number of applications based on nuclear science and technologies, such as medical diagnostics, material science, and homeland security. The Exotic Beam Summer School 2016 (EBSS2016), which was the fifteenth installment of EBSS series, was held during July 17-24, 2016 to educate and train a next-generation of scientists that drive science with rare-isotope beams at existing and future facilities.
