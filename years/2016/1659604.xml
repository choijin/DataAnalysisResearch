<AbstractNarration>This REU Site award to the Marine Biological Laboratory (MBL) located in Woods Hole, MA will support the training of 10 students for 10 weeks during the summers of 2017-2019. The Biological Discovery in Woods Hole REU program will focus on the molecular and cellular processes that give rise to, and regulate, complex physiological systems that mediate organismal behavior. The program's goal is to recruit highly motivated students, especially from underrepresented groups and/or schools with limited research opportunities, and immerse them in research programs under the guidance of MBL scientists. Applicants apply electronically through the program's website, with admissions' committee review and notification in early spring.  Each student will be fully integrated into their mentor's laboratory and research program. Augmenting the research experience will be field trips and seminars to prepare students for a career in the biological sciences. Students will also attend lectures on ethics and responsible conduct in research. The common assessment tool SALG URSSA will be used for student and program evaluation.  The program will culminate in an undergraduate research symposium and poster presentation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is anticipated that a total of 10 students per summer, primarily from schools with limited research opportunities, will be trained in the program.  The goal is to recruit a cohort as diverse as the research environment, with previous students selected from over 50 different institutions with cohorts consisting of 71% women, 60% of groups underrepresented in science and 70% from schools with limited research opportunities.   Students will be encouraged to publish their results in peer reviewed journals and to attend scientific meetings.  Program alumni have reported high success in graduate school admission.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A common web-based assessment tool used by all REU Site programs funded by the Division of Biological Infrastructure will be used to determine the effectiveness of the training program. Students will be tracked after the program to determine their career paths. Students will be asked to respond to an automatic email sent via the NSF reporting system. More information about the program is available by visiting http://www.mbl.edu/education/other-educational/reu/, or by contacting the PI (Dr. Allen F. Mensinger at amensing@d.umn.edu).</AbstractNarration>
