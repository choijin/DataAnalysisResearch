<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is the potential to impact water scarcity in arid and semi-arid geographies within the US and beyond.  The proposed photobiological water treatment process  utilizes the natural power of photosynthetic microorganisms (diatoms) and sunlight without the use of hazardous chemicals or non-renewable energy to remove contaminants such as silica, calcium, iron, manganese, phosphorus and nitrogen from the concentrated waste streams (brines) from advanced water reclamation and brackish groundwater desalination facilities.  Additional clean, (re)usable water can be obtained from the treated brine quite cost-effectively, while reducing the volume of brine by &gt;50% and producing algal biomass as a marketable by-product.  This technology will reduce the environmental impact and also potentially improve the efficiency of water treatment.  This Phase I project will have broader impacts on the advancement of science and technology related to environmental microbiology, water reuse and water resource management.  The experimental data to be generated in this project could reveal many characteristics and fundamental chemistry and biology of brackish water diatoms that have not been studied in detail, as compared with those found in the freshwater and marine environment.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The technical objectives in this Phase I research project are to investigate the feasibility of a diatom-based photobiological process for scalant and nutrient removal to recover more fresh water from reverse osmosis concentrate;  to characterize the byproducts of this process including organic matter and algal biomass;  and to investigate the scale-up challenges.  The challenges and opportunities include: (1) the optimization of the biomass growth and constituent removal, including diatom strain screening, (2) impacts of toxic elements, chlorine residuals, salinity, pH, temperature, light sources, intensity, and duration, (3) formation and characterization of byproducts, (4) removal of synthetic organic compounds, such as pharmaceuticals and personal care products, (5) photobiological reactor configuration and hydraulics, and (6) possible uses and economic values of algal biomass.  Among them, the major challenges are the possible soluble organic byproduct formation and the relatively modest silica uptake rate.  Bench- and pilot-scale experiments will be conducted to optimize the photobiological process to enable a full-scale application with a reasonable footprint.  Careful diatom strain/species selection and more detailed chemical and biochemical analyses will also facilitate further process optimization and understanding of the fate of byproducts, their impacts on subsequent desalination, and possible control strategies.</AbstractNarration>

Due to the higher concentrations of dissolved chemical constituents, including inorganic and organic compounds, these non-conventional water resources often require high-pressure membrane processes such as reverse osmosis (RO) to reduce the concentration of dissolved constituents and/or salinity.&nbsp; The RO process recovers near-distilled water quality, highly purified water by filtering out the impurities.&nbsp; However, the impurities are concentrated in a so-called concentrate or brine stream that represent a smaller fraction of water treated by the process. &nbsp;The recovery rate of purified water is governed by the quality of the source water and generally falls between 75% and 85%.&nbsp; Although a higher purified water recovery is desired, the concentrations of certain inorganic constituents such as calcium and silica exceed their solubility limit and start precipitating on the RO membrane surface and cause scaling and fouling at high recovery rates, which ironically reduces the purified water recovery.</p> <p>In order to improve the RO recovery and reduce the concentrate volume, a unique aqueous silica removal process using naturally occurring diatoms for water reuse and brackish water desalination has been developed by our research group.&nbsp;
