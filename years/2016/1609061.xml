<AbstractNarration>Nontechnical description: This project is focused on the effect of hydrogenation on the microwave absorption properties of titanium dioxide nanoparticles. These nanoparticles have the potential to advance the field of microwave absorption, leading to a number of practical applications in areas such as telecommunication, spacecraft communication, wireless communication, radar detection, satellite navigation, etc. The research team aims to understand the underlying mechanisms of how hydrogenation affects the microwave absorption of inorganic nanoparticles with various phase compositions and surface morphologies. The principal investigator provides training opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students and popularizes his research efforts and results via various outreach activities, reaching to the local community and underrepresented groups. He develops online courses focused on electronic and photonic properties of these materials, which are available to the public. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical description: This project tackles newly observed phenomena by the PI's group of significantly increased microwave absorption in hydrogenated titanium dioxide nanoparticles that cannot be explained with traditional mechanisms. The project goal is to reveal the underlying mechanisms and to elucidate the effects of hydrogenation by comprehensive approach, studying structural, chemical, optical, electronic, dielectric and microwave absorption properties by employing various characterization methods such as X-ray diffraction, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, Raman spectroscopy, ultraviolet-visible absorption spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, (valence band) X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and a transmission line technique with a network analyzer. The project integrates the research activities with educational opportunities for graduate, undergraduate and high-school students.</AbstractNarration>
