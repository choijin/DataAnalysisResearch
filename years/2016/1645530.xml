<AbstractNarration>In November 2015, fossil bones were discovered weathering out of exposures created by a sand mining operation about 30 km southwest of Gainesville, Florida. Paleontologists of the Florida Museum of Natural History quickly determined that the site was potentially very significant, and began quarrying operations. The site is located on private property and the landowner will allow access until Spring 2017 and has agreed to donate all specimens to the FLMNH permanent research collections. However there is a finite time to excavate fossils, as the pit will soon be filled in and the land then used for horse stable waste recycling and pasture for cattle. Thus there is a great urgency to recover as many fossils as possible through careful excavation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 5-million-year old site has so far produced fossils of about 50 vertebrate taxa. A very broad range of body size is represented, with bones of animals the size of small mice and salamanders found in the same strata as those of rhinos and elephants. Portions of the site are richly fossiliferous and some areas routinely produce articulated skeletons. This is the first vertebrate locality of this age in the southeastern coastal plain with complete skeletons, and also the only one with a diverse fauna of small vertebrates. Undergraduate students, high school teachers, and citizen scientists will be trained and involved in this excavation. Ultimately specimens will be displayed at the Florida Museum of Natural History.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>We excavated fossils for 131 days between October 5, 2017 and May 13, 2018 at the Montbrook Site in Levy County, Florida. A total of 441 different people dug at the site during this interval, working for a collective 7,912 hours. Of those, 337 were public volunteers, who contributed a total of 5,061 hours to the project at the site. The excavations resulted in the recovery of an estimated 15,000 identifiable vertebrate fossils. Major discoveries include the first lower jaw of the giant otter <em>Enhydritherium</em> with well-preserved, slightly worn teeth, a partial skeleton with skull and mandible of a young juvenile of the gomphothere proboscidean <em>Rhynchotherium</em>, the first two young adult mandibles of <em>Rhynchotherium</em> from the site (one with associated partial skull), and two partial skeletons with mandibles of the rhinoceros <em>Teleoceras</em>, one a ca. 6-month-old juvenile, the other a young adult female associated with bones of a newborn or fetus. Many additional fossils, including skulls and jaws, of the turtles <em>Trachemys</em>, <em>Apalone</em>, and <em>Macrochelys</em>, and of <em>Alligator</em> were recovered. About 7 tons of sediment from the site was collected and that is expected to produce thousands more small-sized fossils of once it is processed. A class of 11 University of Florida undergraduates dug multiple times at the site and the<a title="student blogs" href="https://www.floridamuseum.ufl.edu/montbrook/blog/"> students blogged about their experiences</a>. A class of 15 students from St. Olaf College in Minnesota and their instructor dug at the site for three days in January as part of a paleontology field trip to Florida. We continued to provide real, hands-on field experience for high school students considering vertebrate paleontology as a career (e.g., <a title="Lauren Miles field experience" href="https://www.floridamuseum.ufl.edu/montbrook/blog/field-experience-lauren-miles/">https://www.floridamuseum.ufl.edu/montbrook/blog/field-experience-lauren-miles/</a> ). Fourteen K-12 teachers participated in a two-day workshop that included digging at the Montbrook Site and discussions sessions on how to apply what they learned to teaching science and evolution to their students. A new public exhibit on the fossils from the Montbrook Site was designed and implemented in collaboration with the Florida Museum&rsquo;s Department of Exhibits and Public Programs.
