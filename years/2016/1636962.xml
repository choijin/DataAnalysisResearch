<AbstractNarration>Poor use of data in the public sector, in general, have been linked to lack of resources and the lack of political will necessary for more efficient and effective use of data. This is troubling, given the potential of big data to increase the transparency of government decision making to all those impacted by policy implementation. Criminal Justice is one field shifting its practices in an attempt to make its decision making process more transparent to community residents, particularly with the use of community oriented policing (COP).  Recent headlines demonstrate the urgent need for police departments to build and maintain trust with their communities through greater transparency and effectiveness.  Data, when used to augment police services in a transparent fashion, has been shown to lead to heightened levels of community trust and reduce negative interactions between police officers and community members. This planning grant project seeks to identify the challenges and opportunities of utilizing big data in the criminal justice system, specifically in COP through the identification and creation of key stakeholder teams, or nodes, and a systematic participatory process with three workshops designed to elicit information, data needs, and challenges and opportunities for the viability of big data and community policing in the Western US. At the completion of the project, the team and nodes will have identified a list of concrete and systemic opportunities for utilizing big data for policing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The use of big data in the criminal justice system has the potential to address this problem by augmenting COP practices through increased efficiency in resource allocation.  The intellectual merit gained from this planning grant will further link big data and criminal justice by identifying systematic obstacles from diverse sectors to adopting big data strategies.  Technological innovations such as big data are often misunderstood or misapplied by policy makers, and the general public. Because of its participatory nature, this planning grant has the opportunity to more broadly impact society by engaging and informing a diverse audience around the conversation of big data. The project team also hopes to reach underrepresented groups associated with the science of big data and policy decision-making.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The  objective of this planning project was primarily stakeholder engagement and collecting user needs and community concerns and understanding the challenges presented by Bog Data. We sought to incorporate this understanding into a conceptual framework for data driven policing that would maximize value to police while building trust with the population. In alignment with the NSF West Big Data Innovation&#8239;Hub (WBDIH)&#8239;Metro ?Data Science? theme, this project addressed the challenge&#8239;of&#8239;transparent and effective policing through the&#8239;application&#8239;of big data (BD) policing methods.  The planning grant outlined three direct goals:  Goal 1: To create social networks between key stakeholders in the western United States connected to each other through the WBDIH and:  Goal 2: To identify systemic challenges faced by stakeholders in the criminal justice system in adopting big data solutions.  Goal 3: To identify the need for a big data policing spoke and build the necessary capacity for a full spokes grant.     These goals were met through the design and implementation of three regional workshops (Boise, ID, Phoenix, AZ, and Boulder, CO). At each workshop, the planning grant team engaged with and learned from stakeholders across a wide range of interest and responsibilities. In summary, we found that stakeholders tended to organize their perspectives around a distinction between technical problems and social problems.
