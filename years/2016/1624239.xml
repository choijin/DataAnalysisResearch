<AbstractNarration>Monetary unions are created to foster political, social, and economic integration among a group of member states by facilitating the free movement of people, goods, services, and capital.  The research supported by this award asks, What happens when one of the monetary union's member nations faces economic crisis and its citizens respond in part by establishing monetary systems of their own? Are they just demonstrating human resiliency and adaptability? Or are they also challenging the very idea of having a formal shared market and associated currency that do not correspond to the nation with which people identify? There is now a global movement towards greater economic integration, so these are important questions for all of us.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;City University of New York doctoral student, Helen Panagiotopoulos, with the supervision of Dr. Ida Susser, will address these questions through 15 months of ethnographic research in Greece. Greece is an appropriate site for the research because in 2009, faced with debts it could not pay, the Greek government instituted austerity measures as a condition of obtaining outside financial assistance. The austerity measures were followed by economic depression, large increases in unemployment, and a widepsread shortage of money. In this context, people established a variety of currency alternatives to acquire the goods and services they needed to survive, without euros, the currency of their monetary union, the Eurozone. These alternative currencies include Local Exchange Trading Schemes, such as barter, time banking, and mutual credit clearing, and crypto currencies such as Bitcoin and Free Coin. The researcher will carry out research in three sites, each of which is associated with a different alternative currency system. She will collect data through extended case analysis, interviews, participant observation, archival research, text analysis and analysis of online databases. Findings from this research will improve social scientific theory of the relationship between currencies, national sovereignty, and citizen allegiance. They will also be of interest to policy makers who need to understand how currencies shape social and political life and how people understand money and value.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Since the 2008 government debt crisis, Greeks have relied on the circulation of informal currencies&mdash;trading goods and services without euros. These solidarity economies reclaim community resources for local people in protest of the inequalities precipitated by the devaluation of currency in the drachma-euro conversion, the "financial blockage" imposed by capital controls, and by Greece?s rising government debt and structural reforms. People use local exchange trading schemes to survive when coinage is scarce.  The proliferation of these experiments in the context of Europe?s single currency confirms that money is not always the monolithic formation or cohesive instrument it is sometimes imagined to be. The present project inquired into the nature of money, taking existing struggles over the form of monetary value in Greece as a point of departure. My dissertation addresses how the circulation of multiple currencies not recognized by the state shapes social and political life and understandings of money and value and how Greeks use local currencies to redefine the boundaries of nation in the context of a single European currency. I show this through the case study of alternative currency "LAU." The dissertation is divided in three sections: 1) how the use of local monies enables people to gain access to basic resources; 2) the different meanings Greeks attribute to money and monetary value and ways the circulation of diverse of conceptions of value influences social relations; and 3) how informal currencies redefine the nation by reviving "traditional" Greek agricultural and exchange practices, through the solidarity framework, and by the inclusion of migrants in the schemes.   Informal currencies in Greece are characterized by a diversity of conceptions of value. Time-labor currencies abandon societal valuations of labor by using the person-hour as the unit of exchange. Mutual credit schemes rely on "multiparty clearing." Allowing what one member owes to another to be cleared against what a third party owes enables debits to be paid off indirectly. Each scheme varies in size and scope. While some support local autonomy, others seek to delocalize solidarity. Operating alongside currency experiments, agricultural networks extend subsistence resources from rural Greece to cities. Claiming that money devalues the product, member-producers prefer to distribute produce to persons through local rather than monetized exchange schemes.  These networks use the solidarity framework. Yet the inclusion of migrants whose precariousness is shaped by their inability to secure jobs and social services, and the shortage of resources otherwise provided by kin, creates unique definitions of who are "Greeks," foreigners, and to whom solidarity is extended. The diverse membership, consisting of Syriza supporters and members of the neo-Nazi group Golden Dawn, intensifies the social divisions that exist.  This dissertation contributes to the anthropology of money. It builds on human economies in the context of "crisis," structural adjustment, and lack of liquidity. As local people seek to create relationships that foster justice and equality, the setting in which these experiments arise produces unique social configurations. Struggling to access limited resources people create new forms of stratification based on gender, ethnicity, and politics. The scope of informal currencies in Greece also draws on spheres of exchange. It addresses the interrelatedness of formal and informal markets and the vast range of cultural meanings surrounding exchange. Analyzing informal networks across regions and political regimes, this project reveals the ambiguous structure of European states, which have given up monetary sovereignty but maintain a "national" debt. The relationship among local governance and European "unity," and the euro and informal currencies uncovers the correlation between money and nation-building&mdash;the cross-national communities forged through exchange&mdash;and the consequences of creating currency during crisis at the local and European level.
