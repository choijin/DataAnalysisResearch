<AbstractNarration>San Francisco State University (SF State) will undertake an ADVANCE Institutional Transformation-Catalyst (IT-Catalyst) project to examine the role and effects of faculty service on the professional outcomes of women faculty at SF State.  Preliminary data from SF State STEM departments reveal a high service burden for women faculty.  The project will further the understanding of the meaning, perceptions, and distribution of service at SF State among faculty.  Importantly, the project will develop strategies to assist faculty in balancing teaching, research, and service to successfully obtain tenure and promotion.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposal aims to identify the possible negative consequences of a heavy service load on the productivity and academic advancement of women STEM faculty.  SF State will also investigate whether sex/gender, race/ethnicity, and sexuality (lesbian, gay, bisexual, heterosexual, queer, and several identities) influence the service load of faculty at SF State.  SF State is a large urban university serving a highly diverse student population.  The results and the methodologies developed in this project will be of broad interest to institutions of higher education particularly other large public universities&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ADVANCE program is focused on developing systemic approaches to increase the participation, retention, and advancement of women in academic STEM careers.  The IT-Catalyst track funds projects to conduct institutional self-assessments as well as implement strategies that have been shown to be effective to address gendered issues for STEM faculty.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit: Women faculty in the science fields, particularly Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM), face many unique challenges to retention, promotion, and overall academic career success. While female students are increasingly choosing to develop careers in the STEM fields, there remains inadequate representation of women faculty, especially women of color faculty, in these fields.  Women faculty in STEM departments continue to take 1 to 3.5 years longer than men to be promoted from the rank of associate to full professor.  A major contributing factor is the service load that many women and women of color faculty experience in academia. There is an expectation that these marginalized scholars will share their cultural perspectives and thus, meet the diversity requirements for many university and professional committees. Moreover, these individuals are commonly sought after for advice and mentorship by a student population that continues to diversify at a much higher pace than the faculty. Unfortunately, despite the investment of time by women and women of color faculty, these efforts are met with little to no reward and recognition in the tenure and promotion process.  This study aimed to investigate role of service on career advancement of women and women of color faculty at a large public comprehensive Minority Serving Institution (MSI).  Given the greater focus on teaching in comparison to R-1 institutions, as well as significant diversity of the student population, we sought to understand whether engagement in service activities would lead to similar barriers in academic advancement for women/women of color faculty as has been observed at many R-1 institutions. Our three-year study examined tenured/tenure-track STEM faculty perceptions and experiences with institutional service and whether they aligned or diverged among gendered and racial groups. We examined these perceptions among three constituent groups: College Deans, STEM faculty, and the University Tenure and Promotion Committee (UTPC) members. Our findings were based on in-depth interviews with college deans and UTPC members, as well as focus groups with STEM tenure-line women faculty.  We also collected and analyzed the results from a STEM faculty survey about their perceptions of their workload, the role of service in tenure-line STEM faculty careers, and the value of these activities. Our findings documented three institutional and service-related barriers to career advancement: 1) inequitable distribution of service with no reward; 2) devaluing of service by the university; and 3) lack of clarity and consistency about the role of service in the retention, tenure and promotion (RTP) processes. Moreover, embedded in these barriers were experiences of gendered and racist stereotypes and inequities that intersect with the identified barriers. Our study led to the following recommendations: 1) facilitate the revision of departmental Hiring, Retention, Tenure, and Promotion (HRTP) criteria to clarify the role of service in HRTP, and improve the process of the evaluation of service; 2) recognize and highlight the value of service activities; 3) identify and mitigate the consequences of hidden service and cultural taxation for women and women of color faculty; and 4) increase the diversity of TT faculty.     Broader Impacts: This study has identified the barriers to success for the advancement of women/women of color STEM faculty at a large public comprehensive Minority Serving Institution.  It expands the research undertaken at R-1 institutions demonstrating that service often becomes a barrier to career success and progression for women and women of color faculty by documenting that this issue also occurs for women and women of color faculty in regional public comprehensive MSIs.  Since the particular institution where the study occurred is one of universities in a state public system, the findings are particularly relevant for the other institutions within that system, as well as other regional public comprehensive MSIs in other state systems.  In addition to presentations to the relevant administrators and faculty within the institution, these findings have been presented at three national conferences.   The results have also been published (Domingo, C. R., Gerber, N. C., Harris, D., Mamo, L., Pasion, S. G., Rebanal, R. D., &amp; Rosser, S. V. (2020), J of Diversity in Higher Education; https://doi.org/10.1037/dhe0000292), disseminated in public outreach venues, including the project website (https://itcatalyst.sfsu.edu), as well as through broadly shared research summary briefs (https://itcatalyst.sfsu.edu/sites/default/files/Brief_optimized.pdf).
