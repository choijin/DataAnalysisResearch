<AbstractNarration>The eastern North American continental margin was established during the Jurassic Period (about 145 to 200 million years ago) during the opening of the Atlantic Ocean and is thought to have remained tectonically stable since that time. However, recent evidence suggests tectonically driven uplift and erosion events occurred between 100 and 130 and between 15 and 2 million years ago, long after the rift episode. Similar events have been recognized on the margins of other continents bordering the Atlantic. The objective of this project is to determine the timing and spatial distribution of these events in eastern North America with the goal of establishing the relationship with events on other continents and, ultimately, provide constraints on possible tectonic mechanisms to explain synchronous events. The project will advance desired societal outcomes by the development of a grade 9-12 earth science module in collaboration with local schools with class visits and visits to Middlebury and intensive involvement of undergraduate students in research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project aims to understand rejuvenation of the Eastern North American margin, which remains virtually unknown compared to relatively well-documented rejuvenation events on the coasts of Africa, South America, Europe, and the north Atlantic. Preliminary data (increased sediment flux to the Baltimore Canyon Trough;   thermochronology in the White Mountains, New Hampshire) suggest that at least three rejuvenation events occurred along the Eastern North American margin: Early Cretaceous (130-110 Ma), Late Cretaceous (85-65 Ma), and the Mio-Pliocene (15-0 Ma). Results from  other Atlantic margins highlight two periods, the Late Cretaceous and Mio-Pliocene, in which rejuvenation may have occurred synchronously across multiple circum-Atlantic margins. This coincident timing raises the question of whether a common forcing mechanism can rejuvenate multiple passive margins at the same time? Two end-member hypotheses include: (1) lateral stresses transmitted long distances through the lithosphere, or (2) dynamic mantle stresses beneath passive margins (e.g. dynamic topography). On the large scale, a complete picture of which margins were synchronously rejuvenated and how they are geometrically related may be used to infer Atlantic-scale forcing mechanisms. On the local scale, delineating the spatiotemporal pattern of rejuvenation of the Eastern North American margin may reveal stress orientations or local fault mechanics, thus constraining the underlying forcing mechanism. This project uses both of these approaches to clarify the pattern of post-rift exhumation in the central Eastern North American margin (New England, New York, and New Jersey). The research team will determine time-resolved exhumation histories by using apatite and zircon U-Th/He and apatite fission track thermochronology in bedrock drill cores and sediment provenance using trace element composition of heavy minerals and U-Pb dating of zircon and rutile and provenance of sediments in offshore drill cores from the Baltimore Canyon Trough. These two approaches are complementary; thermochronology provides the timing and magnitude of exhumation at a point, whereas detrital provenance integrates a broad range of possible source regions and can detect exhumation events too small to reset thermochronometers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The driving question behind our work is to understand why the eastern US still has topographic relief and what combination of geologic forces are responsible for shaping these so-called ‘passive margins’ over time.  Simple models suggest that after the opening of the Atlantic Ocean about 200 million years ago, any mountains in the eastern US should have slowly eroded and decayed down to a flat landscape.  Instead we see a landscape with a variety of mountain ranges such as the Whites, the Greens, the Adirondacks, Catskills, and similar ranges southward through the Appalachian chain.   Our study employed two main approaches to answer this question.  First a technique called thermochronology is used to determine when rocks in a specific area have cooled and by how much.  Cooling is generally interpreted to record periods of time when Earth’s crust is tectonically uplifted and eroded, causing more deeply buried rocks to move closer to the surface and cool.  Our results show that the northeastern US experienced one moderate episode of uplift and cooling from about 130 to 110 million years ago that affected a broad region from Montreal to southern Connecticut to coastal Maine.   A second episode of uplift and cooling occurred from roughly 90 to 70 million years ago and involved higher magnitudes of uplift over a more restricted region from the Adirondacks across to the White Mountains of New Hampshire.  The first episode is most likely driven by major changes in the deep lithosphere, either removal of a cold and dense ‘root’ of the lithosphere or impingement of a buoyant mantle material rising upward from Earth’s deep interior.  The cause of the second episode is less clear and is discussed below.  The second main approach used in this study is dating the timing of activity along fault zone and fractures within Earth’s crust to understand when the crust deformed and what stresses were causing that deformation.  To this end we undertook U-Pb dating of the mineral calcite with numerous faults and fractures across New England.  This is a new technique using laser-ablation mass spectrometry, which yields very specific information.  Our results showed that recent tectonism in Champlain Valley of Vermont occurred in three main stages.  First, a set of vertical fractures formed from about 115 to 96 Ma, recording uplift and erosion in the presence of high fluid pressure, probably due to volcanism in the area.  Second, the region experienced period of east-west oriented extensional faulting from about 88 to 75 Ma in which the region was stretched and mountain ranges such as the Adirondacks may have experienced relative upward motions.  This was followed by a long period of tectonic quiescence before a second period of east-west oriented extensional faulting began roughly 10-15 million years ago.  This most recent period records a previously undocumented episode of recent tectonism that is probably associated with development of mountainous relief in the northeastern US.   Although our results reveal important new information about the pattern of recent tectonic uplift in space and time, they also raise many new questions.  In particular, the cause of east-west extensional faulting is of great interest.  One idea is that this is a reaction to changes occurring in the deep mantle or lithosphere directly below New England.  Another idea is they are a response changes eastern US.  Our current thinking is that both processes are likely important.  It seems likely that mantle and lithospheric processes drove the first period of uplift from ~130-110 Ma, which may have ‘primed’ the lithosphere to collapse by east-west extension during the second period from about 88 to 75 Ma.  The most recent period of east-west extension is perhaps the most exciting because it most likely responsible for the topographic relief we enjoy today.  This event may be driven by loss of cold dense lithosphere beneath New England, or perhaps by a change in the rate of seafloor spreading.  Further investigation of this recent event will be an exciting line of future research.          Last Modified: 12/03/2020       Submitted by: William H Amidon]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
