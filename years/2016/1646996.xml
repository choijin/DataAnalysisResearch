<AbstractNarration>Recent decades have seen increasing attention to and progress in research in undergraduate mathematics education (RUME). Relative to K-12 mathematics education research, which is more than a century old as a field, RUME is a young area, beginning to become visible only a few decades ago. During these decades, the need to understand the learning and teaching of undergraduate mathematics, and the related need to develop scholars to conduct the research, has become more pressing. In this project, investigators from the University of Oklahoma and the University of Northern Colorado will catalyze a network of RUME scholars through a conference that emphasizes the generation and strengthening of new collaborations and the central participation of novices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The next generation of experts and leaders in RUME will come from the current generation of graduate students, early-career RUME faculty, and mathematicians seeking to gain experience and expertise in this field. The conference will specifically, and with active intention, engage these participants to strengthen their expertise and build collaborations. Themes will include research in student learning, research in pre/business/STEM calculus, research in problem-solving/proving, research in equity in mathematics education, and research in statistics education and quantitative literacy. The conference will produce a list of priority open research questions in RUME as well as a network of expert and novice researchers collaborating to advance the field.</AbstractNarration>

The main goal of the conference was to both introduce novice individuals to experts in the field of Research in Undergraduate Mathematics Education (RUME) and to generate, as a group, open research questions. There were 210 responders for the conference, and 93 people attended, ranging from undergraduate student to full professor. The conference had five thematic plenary talks and a sixth session on experiences and difficulties in grant-writing. The five themes were research in: students? learning, pre/business/regular calculus, problem solving, equity, and statistics education. After the plenaries, each speaker ran a breakout session with the end goal of generating research questions in each theme, and the conference ended with the participants presenting their research questions to the whole group.

These open questions included:   What is the effect of perceived social roles of both students and instructors in inquiry-based learning (IBL) classrooms on learning outcomes?  What is the nature of the professional knowledge base that informs effective instruction in pre/business/regular calculus at the undergraduate level? How do problem-solving norms develop in a classroom community? To what extent does teachers? language use in undergraduate mathematics classrooms constrain or afford students? learning opportunities? How is Quantitative Literacy instantiated at diverse institutions?   After the conference, 72 participants took the post-conference survey. 65% (44 participants out of 68) stated that they had sufficient or great gain in knowledge on different research areas in RUME due to the conference. Several participants, in focus groups, mentioned the welcoming environment, while others added that networking, and discussion of themes, were takeaways for them.
