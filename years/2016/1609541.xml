<AbstractNarration>Non-Technical Abstract&lt;br/&gt;Organic molecules can crystallize in a variety of solid state forms, each of which exhibits different physical properties.  While only one form can be the most stable under any given set of environmental conditions, transformations between hydrated (H) and anhydrous (A) forms are frequently observed as a consequence of changes in environmental conditions (e.g. temperature, relative humidity, etc). In this project supported by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry Program of the Division of Materials Research, the solid state transformations between hydrated and anhydrous forms of nucleic acid crystals are investigated.  The structural, thermal, and mechanical properties of these crystalline materials are analyzed using a battery of complementary experimental techniques available on site and through collaborations with researchers at United States National Laboratories. Through this work, the specific effects of crystal defects and surface structures on the material properties of H and A phases are explored.  Insight gained through these fundamental studies has direct impact on several industries that rely on organic molecular crystals such as pharmaceuticals, foods, agrochemicals and energetics.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Abstract&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this research is to systematically prepare and characterize the physical properties of purine and pyrimidine hydrated phases with well-defined defect/dopant concentrations, and to characterize their structural, thermal and mechanical properties. A broad range of experimental methods will be applied including diffraction, microscopy, spectroscopy, thermal analysis, moisture sorption and nanoindentation. This work will advance our understanding of solid state dehydration and deliquescence processes in general, and specifically the role defects play in the transformations between hydrate and anhydrous phases. This collaborative research provides valuable interdisciplinary training opportunities for graduate, undergraduate and high school students.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Organic molecules can crystallize in a variety of solid state forms, each of which exhibits different physical properties.  The research conducted under this award focused on elucidating the physical properties of molecular hydrates (including their structures, thermal and mechanical stabilities), the dehydration processes they undergo that lead to water-free anhydrous forms, and the effect of dopants on these properties and processes.  Crystalline forms of purines and pyrimidines, biologically important molecules that are components of DNA and many pharmaceuticals, were the focus of most studies.  While much experimental work was performed on site, a number of specialized experiments took advantage of unique instrument capabilities at national laboratories, including synchrotron X-ray and neutron scattering.  Experimental studies on specific systems were also complemented by larger data mining efforts on hydrates and solvates. Insight gained through these collective works has a direct impact on industries ranging across pharmaceuticals, foods, agrochemicals and energetics.    Studies on the nanomechanical properties of uric acid in its anhydrous and hydrated forms showed that the former had a higher modulus than the latter.  Anhydrous crystals with included dye dopants present in low concentrations were found to have a profound effect on their mechanical response.  This behavior was consistent with theory, but had never been explicitly demonstrated in molecular solids.  Time-resolved synchrotron powder-X-ray diffraction studies on thymine and cytosine hydrates were used to track both subtle and major structural changes that occur during their solid state dehydration.  Through these studies, new types of cooperative molecular motions were revealed.  The trajectory of these dehydration reactions were also shown to be strongly effected by the inclusion of various types of dopants.  The results have helped to clarify our understanding of how dopants with particular structures and/or concentrations can be used to rationally tailor solid state properties.  Complementary studies using data mining methods and the most recognized crystallographic database in the world, helped to both statistically assess and challenge some of the long-held assumptions regarding what we know about hydrates.  Several undergraduate and graduate students contributed to different aspects of this work. Students who completed their PhD degrees are now employed in related industries, while those who completed their BS degrees are pursuing advanced degrees.  This work also produced several publications and conference presentations.       Last Modified: 12/02/2020       Submitted by: Jennifer A Swift]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
