<AbstractNarration>The inaugural Youth Bioinformatics Symposium willbe held in the greater Washington, D.C. in June 2016. This novel workshop run by the International Society for Computational Biology (ISCB), is focused on introducing secondary school (8-11th grade) students to computational biology and bioinformatics. Questionnaire will be distributed to gauge the level of interest in bioinformatics and database searches before and after the symposium, and the experiences of the organizers will be summarized in an SOP that will be provided to the future organizers and volunteers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The symposium will be opened by keynote speaker, former president of ISCB. There will be three workshops: on biomedical data mining, on protein 3-D modeling, and a mini-science fair activity. Sequence database searches using the BLAST suite of programs are now part of AP Biology curriculum, and students will get a hands-on introduction into the field.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In a recent National Science Board publication (NSB-10-33) entitled "Preparing the Next Generation of STEM Innovators: Identifying and Developing our Nation?s Human Capital," a key recommendation is to "improve the access to and availability of effective K-12 formal and informal education programs and interventions to meet the needs of future STEM innovators."  Collaborating with the International Society of Computational Biology, this grant supported the 2016 Youth Bioinformatics Symposium to inspire secondary school students to explore STEM educational and career opportunities through exposure to a well-designed bioinformatics training program. The symposium attracted nearly 100 high school students (grades 6 &ndash; 12) in the Washington DC area.  The day opened with a keynote address by the NIH Associate Director for Data Science, Phillip Bourne, who led the students through his journey in science and inspired them to continue to learn and seek the unanswerable.  Following the keynote, students had the opportunity to engage in three-hands on workshops that explored basic computational biology tools and skill sets - 1) Biomedical Data Mining, 2) Protein Modeling and 3) Sequence Analysis. Each workshop was designed to advance a basic understanding of biology using computational techniques.  Workshop materials and handouts were made available to the student and are electronically archived at www.iscb.org.  The day concluded with a Science Challenge which focused on emerging threats, with the winning entry being a mosquito catcher to reduce the change of Zika virus.  Ten professors from four universities assisted in the instruction for the program.  Students were asked to take a survey at the conclusion of the event.  The responses indicated that the event was well received and students were able to take what they learned and apply it to classroom instruction.  It was also encouraged to continue a similar high school training in the future.       Last Modified: 10/04/2017       Submitted by: Kamaljeet Sanghera]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
