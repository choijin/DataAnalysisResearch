<AbstractNarration>1622770&lt;br/&gt;Mihelcic&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wastewater is considered a valuable resource that can provide sources of water, energy, and nutrients. However, innovators in the water sectors commonly cite a lack of access to test facilities as an impediment to the development of innovative technologies that can help address water infrastructure challenges. Recent workshop reports, including the Energy-Positive Water Resource Recovery Workshop and the Intensification in Resource Recovery Workshop recommended that government, academia, nongovernmental organizations, technology vendors, and municipal treatment facilities collaborate to form a national network of test bed facilities to advance the pace of innovation in this area. Achieving the vision of an impactful National Water Resource Recovery Facility Test Bed Network will support efforts to translate innovative technologies to practice that promote sustainability and resource recovery from wastewater.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop will help advance the creation of an impactful national test bed network that promotes the translation of innovative technologies for resource recovery from wastewater into a national research space that engages academic, industrial, and municipal partners. A national test bed network is expected to attract creative ideas and talents by engaging a wide range of partners for the progression of basic research into new innovations. The test bed network will also foster innovation among faculty and students, promote regional coordination and linkages, and develop technology-based networks of researchers. A test bed network should also serve as an "engine of innovation" and help to extend the Nation's historical reputation for ingenuity. To successfully encourage innovation, a test bed network should make a meaningful difference in shortening the timeline of moving products into the marketplace. It should also  reduce costs of product development. This workshop's primary objective is to define key metrics that new technologies evaluated at the national test bed network should measure and report. A second workshop objective is to determine whether or not a central reporting system to share data on innovative technologies in a national test bed network is necessary and achievable. If so, the participants will set the preliminary design conditions for such a reporting system. The workshop will consist of approximately 50 professionals that can include researchers from universities, utility research programs, and national laboratories. In addition, it will also host technology providers, entrepreneurs, and water sector venture capitalists, members of WERF's LIFT program, NSF's SBIR program, and other utility managers interested in fostering innovation, engineering consultants, and federal officials from EPA, DOE, NSF, USDA, and other interested agencies. It is expected that a national test bed network devoted to recovering valuable resources from wastewater will lead to environmental, economic, and social benefits from enhanced innovation capacity. Four supported positions are set aside for early career scientists (senior doctoral students and post-doctoral research associates) and the program committee has plans to achieve appropriate representation of under-represented groups.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Although water infrastructure is critical for protecting human health and the environment, continuous investment in water and wastewater infrastructure is lagging worldwide. For example, recent surveys estimate that $322-$600 billion is needed over the next 20 years in the United States alone for projects and activities to address water quality or related public health problems.  In addition, wastewater is increasingly seen as a valuable resource that can provide fit-for-purpose water, energy, nutrients, and carbon emission savings. A large number of government and nongovernmental organizations recognize the social economic, and environmental value of resources embedded in wastewater. Upgrading today's aging wastewater treatment infrastructure to a new generation of water resource recovery facilities will require the development and deployment of innovative technologies and processes.  The water resource recovery facility of the future is one that is energy efficient, recovers value-added resources, and uses smart sensors, software, and advanced devices to achieve desirable outcomes.  These facilities are expected to reduce stress on energy systems, decrease air and water pollution, build resiliency, and drive local economic activity.  Unfortunately, the wastewater sector has historically been risk adverse and slow to adopt new technologies. A major reason for this is because management of wastewater under the existing regulatory framework has a narrow (but very important) focus on treating waste to reduce risks to human health and the environment.  Overcoming this barrier to innovation and other challenges is thus key to achieve the water resource recovery facility of the future.   It had been proposed in many reports and by many stakeholders that technology adoption could be accelerated by a national network that connects appropriate physical testing facilities (bench, pilot, and commercial scale demonstrations) with other activities of a successful innovation network, to researchers, investors, technology providers, utilities, regulators, educators, and other stakeholders in the water resource recovery sector to accelerate the adoption of innovative technologies and processes. A successful network of innovation would thus reduce the risks inherent to innovation by effectively supporting the development of new technologies and spreading that risk between different stakeholders.  Accordingly, this workshop discussed key issues that drive or inhibit innovation in the water sector but most importantly focused on determining what the key metrics should be for evaluating new resource recovery technologies in a national testbed network.
