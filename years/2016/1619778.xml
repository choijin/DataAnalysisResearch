<AbstractNarration>Physical systems are modeled at different scales and to different approximations with different equations. The Schrodinger equation at the quantum level models the molecular and atomic scale.  Newton's laws in classical mechanics model the macroscopic scale.  The Boltzmann equation applies at the statistical level, where systems of many particles are studied, and the Navier-Stokes equation and others model distributed systems such as fluids in the continuum regime. A central question in applied mathematics and physics is to understand the relationships between the different models, and many tools (both analytical and numerical) have been developed for this task through the years. However, most of them idealize the systems under study and cannot tackle practical problems that have emerged in the study of complicated systems in chemistry, physics, and engineering. This project focuses on two longstanding challenges concerning these connections: the characterization of quantum information in the classical regime when chemical reactions are present, and the coupling between the statistical and the fluid description. The project aims to develop improved methods for the modeling of multiscale systems. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Despite their fundamental importance in physics and engineering, effective mathematical analysis and computational techniques for multiscale problems in kinetic theory have remained rather elusive. The multiple scales inherent in many physical systems have posed notorious computational challenges.  This project concerns development of multiscale numerical methods in kinetic theory, including numerical capture of the hydrodynamic limit of Boltzmann-type equations and the semi-classical limit of the Schrodinger equation. Both have long been regarded as fundamental problems in kinetic theory. More specifically, the project focuses on capturing the non-adiabatic transition in the classical regime derived from quantum mechanics, and boundary layer effects that connect the fluid description with the statistical mechanical description. Both problems emerge in transition regimes, the multi-physics phenomena can be captured by none of currently available mathematical treatments, and the computation is far from being efficient. The project aims to develop and analyze efficient computational tools for these problems, focusing on treatment of boundary layers and interfaces and design of asymptotic-preserving schemes.  Besides leading to improved understanding of physical systems of these types, it is expected that the new tools under development could inspire treatments of similar problems emerging in other areas, for example, hyperbolic type problems with random media.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  The PI and the group had a few productive years while being supported partially by the grant. Kinetic theory originates from non-equilibrium statistical physics, and its model equation is the Boltzmann equation. It has been the center in PDE (partial differential equation) analysis and numerical analysis for decades, partially due to its strong applications in engineering problems, and partially due to its complex mathematical structure that requires delicate study. When the project was proposed, two scientific perspectives were placed at the center: 1. the boundary layer analysis; 2. efficient numerical treatment. The PI at a later time extended her research into inverse kinetic theory, and bridged the associated numerical studies with numerical homogenization in the framework of random sampling, a class of techniques largely used in data science. The two new directions that have barely been studied in literature, but both could potentially bring strong impact to the area. Supported by the project, the PI and the group has produced 20+ publications, mostly published in highly reputable journals such as SIAM series, or Springer journals (such as Journal of Statistical Physics and Journal of Scientific Computing). Four students have been trained, with two women PhD students. Two would have obtained PhD by the end of summer, 2020.
