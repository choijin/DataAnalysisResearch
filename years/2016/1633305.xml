<AbstractNarration>Minority business entrepreneurship, specifically in the areas of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) provides multiple opportunities for innovation, job creation, high earning potential, and for increasing the diversity of the U.S. workforce to reflect current population demographics. The purpose of this dissertation research is to understand the factors of STEM programs that influence STEM-educated African American graduates to pursue high tech entrepreneurship. Currently, there is evidence that while the U. S. has experienced growth in the number of African American entrepreneurs, this growth has not occurred in STEM fields, which are highly linked to high tech firms. Knowledge about African American STEM entrepreneurship is limited, as current data sets captures minimal information on the background or education of entrepreneurs. This research aims to fill that gap by analyzing administrative and survey data collected from STEM program alliances (collaborations between multiple colleges/universities) across the country. A greater understanding of which factors in education influence African Americans to pursue entrepreneurship can provide empirical data to guide policies and programs that encourage and support African Americans in STEM, allow for the modification or re-evaluation of existing programs, and promote the linking of entrepreneurial activities with STEM-support programs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research identifies what educational experiences predict African American entrepreneurship in STEM fields by reviewing existing STEM-support programs. The review of these programs and their components such as social networking, mentoring, role models, and financial support, allows identification of  bridging factors which encourage entrepreneurship, as well as to what degree knowledge about entrepreneurship is provided. The results of a quantitative analysis of survey data from undergraduate and graduate STEM-support programs as well as business owner characteristics aims to reveal the relationship between these factors and entrepreneurship in STEM fields.  These results can be used to determine which factors are more likely to cultivate entrepreneurship among African Americans.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The purpose of this dissertation research is to contribute knowledge on the relationship between STEM programming and one STEM sub-workforce group, high tech entrepreneurs. The research is important because a number of policies and initiatives focus on developing the STEM workforce, yet disparities exist among minority groups. African Americans represent approximately 6% of the STEM workforce, while White Americans make up approximately 77%, quite a disparity (Chubin et al., 2005). Although there is an increase in the number of firms started by African Americans, disparities still exist when specifically comparing high tech firms.   Three phases of research were conducted to answer the research questions. The three phases of this study utilized a variety of data sources to answer the research questions. The first phase of research utilized the Kauffman Firm Survey (KFS) to understand the connection between STEM education and high tech entrepreneurship, this phase provided data from African American entrepreneurs regarding their fields of study and employment in high-tech fields. The second phase of research analyzed data from STEM program administrators to determine the patterns and trends in STEM programming, particularly as it relates to human, social and financial capitals.  The second phase also analyzed the relationship between different programmatic elements (role models, social networking, mentoring and financial support)  and high technology entrepreneurial participation among program participants, including alumni of one LSAMP program. The third phase of the research consulted three experts, which provided data to supplement the trends found in phase 2. Different methods of analysis were used to answer the research question to determine the factors associated with educational programs and the characteristics of African American entrepreneurs that are present to promote entrepreneurship in STEM fields.    The analysis suggests that most STEM programs include mentoring, role models, social networking, and financial support.  This suggests that STEM programs are providing key supports to facilitate the development of the human capital necessary to be prepared for the STEM workforce - a STEM education. The analysis also suggested that high tech entrepreneurship is positively associated with a STEM education. However, the analysis also suggests that the majority of STEM programs, despite having the flexibility to do so, do not promote entrepreneurship. This study brings to light the need for a longitudinal analysis to track not only the graduation rates of underrepresented minorities who complete STEM degrees but also their post-graduation employment. This information can better help programs to determine if they have met their broad program goals of increasing the diversity of the STEM workforce.          The human capital component of advanced education and degree completion was found to have an association with African American entrepreneurs, specifically the link between STEM education and high tech entrepreneurship.  The knowledge gained provides empirical data to inform policymakers as well as program creators to continue to support current programs as well as add programs with goals of degree completion among underrepresented minorities in STEM, but to also add an emphasis on employment goals, which can be implemented through curriculum additions and employment preparation.     As a result of this research supportive data has been presented that can be used to support key policy and programs which can promote equal or improved access for aspiring African American high technology entrepreneurs. The findings can guide policies and programs that encourage and support entrepreneurship among African Americans in the areas of STEM. This dissertation also highlights current programs and initiatives that promote entrepreneurship, thus encouraging researchers to look into the structure and outcomes of these programs and their effects on high tech STEM entrepreneurship.
