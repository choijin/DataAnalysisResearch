<AbstractNarration>This project investigates the fundamental trade-offs surrounding locality in error correcting codes.  In error correcting codes, "locality" refers to several ways of quantifying how easily a small amount of information can be recovered from encoded data.   Notions of locality have been around almost as long as coding theory itself, and today the study of locality in error correcting codes is fundamental to applications ranging from the very theoretical (complexity theory) to the very practical (distributed storage schemes).  This research improves our basic scientific understanding of locality, and in doing so it makes progress on these applications.  Beyond its scientific impact, this project has broader educational impact, through the development of course materials and by providing opportunities for graduate and undergraduate research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The approach of this research is to bridge a gap between two different bodies of literature.  In Theoretical Computer Science, Locally Decodable and Locally Correctable Codes have been studied for over 15 years, and have been linked to many fundamental problems in complexity theory and cryptography. In the past five years, the study of locality has also taken off in distributed storage, in the form of Locally Recoverable Codes and related notions.  These two lines of research operate in different parameter regimes and are motivated by different applications. The current research ties the two together by studying intermediate parameter regimes, and explores the fundamental mathematical trade-offs surrounding locality.  By extending our understanding of locality in coding theory, this research can make progress on important problems in coding, complexity theory, cryptography, and distributed storage; it also develops a theory which could find many more applications going forward.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project investigated the fundamental trade-offs surrounding locality in error correcting codes. In error correcting codes, "locality" refers to several ways of quantifying how easily a small amount of information can be recovered from encoded data. Notions of locality have been around almost as long as coding theory itself, and today the study of locality in error correcting codes is fundamental to applications ranging from the very theoretical (complexity theory) to the very practical (distributed storage schemes). This research focused on our basic understanding of locality. Beyond its scientific impact, this project had broader educational impact, through the development of course materials and by providing opportunities for graduate and undergraduate research.  The approach of this research was to study the fundamentals of locality by bridging different bodies of research on locality.  In Theoretical Computer Science and Cryptography, locality has been studied in the form of Locally Decodable and Locally Correctable Codes (LDCs and LCCs) for over 15 years, and have been linked to many fundamental problems in complexity theory and cryptography. In the past five years, the study of locality has also taken off in distributed storage, in the form of Locally Recoverable Codes (LRCs) and related notions. These lines of research operate in different parameter regimes and are motivated by different applications.  This project deepened the connections between these different lines of work, and in doing so both improved our understanding of locality in coding theory, and also made progress on applications of locality in coding theory, complexity theory, cryptography, distributed storage and distributed computation.  One direction of this research was to study the "disjoint repair group property" (DRGP) in coding theory.  Loosely, a code exhibits the t-DRGP if any symbol of a message can be recovered in t disjoint ways from the encoded data.  When t is small, this is useful in distributed storage because it can provide locality and availability for data -- that is, many users can simultaneously access data efficiently.  When t is large, it turns out that this notion is useful in theoretical computer science and has been studied in the context of LCCs.  Results of this project include extensive study of the t-DRGP in intermediate parameter regimes, connecting the two bodies of work described above.  In three published papers, we explored the extent to which this property is necessary for applications, and we established upper and lower bounds on the best trade-offs between the parameter t and the redundancy of the code.  A second direction of this research was to study high-rate LCCs.  Such codes again bridge parameter regimes between a "traditional" TCS parameter regime (where the redundancy is high and the locality is low) and a parameter regime that might be more useful in practice, where the rate is high.  Results of this project include two papers published in the IEEE Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science (FOCS), in which we gave improved constructions of high rate locally decodable, list-decodable and list-recoverable codes.  We used these constructions to obtain near-linear time (global) list-decoding algorithms, addressing a long-standing open problem in algorithmic coding theory.  It turns out that ideas from high-rate LCCs are useful in constructing examples of codes with the t-DRGP, linking this direction with the previous one.  In a third direction, we studied locality in several application areas, including distributed storage, distributed computing, and cryptography, and published several papers across these areas.    In addition to scientific results and published papers, as part of this project the PI developed an interdisciplinary class on coding theory, which has now run three times and attracts a mix of students across EE, CS and Math.  This project also provided support for graduate student training and both graduate and undergraduate research.       Last Modified: 07/01/2019       Submitted by: Mary K Wootters]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
