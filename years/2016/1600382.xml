<AbstractNarration>This award supports participation in the third Lake Michigan Workshop on Combinatorics and Graph Theory, held at Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indiana, on March 5-6, 2016. The workshop series focuses on combinatorics and graph theory, which are two very active areas of research in modern mathematics. The geographical location of the workshop is intended as a focal point for the large number of researchers and students in the Midwest and provides opportunities to strengthen research collaborations on a variety of graph theoretical and combinatorial problems. The workshop, which will be advertised to universities throughout the Midwest, will train students and beginning researchers in important classical and emerging techniques of combinatorics and graph theory. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop features two sets of three tutorial lectures, focusing on classical techniques and results in combinatorics that are not always presented in typical graduate sequences, and on emerging techniques on which the speakers are particularly qualified to expound. Tutorial lectures by Professor Edray Goins from Purdue University concern "q-series, Partitions, Generating Functions," "Modular Forms," and "Applications."  Tutorial lectures by Professor Margaret Readdy from the University of Kentucky concern "Quantum Combinatorics," "Coalgebraic Combinatorics," and "Whitney Stratifications and Combinatorics." In addition, the workshop features short talks by students and early-career faculty members.

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The 3rd Lake Michigan Workshop on Combinatorics and Graph Theory was held at the Department of Mathematics and the Department of Statistics at Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indiana, on the weekend of March 5 and 6, 2016.  The conference structure was built around a pair of sets of three tutorial lectures, and contributed shorter lectures by early-career researchers and students.  The geographical area of the conference serves an active group of researchers in combinatorics and graph theory.  The conference aids in fostering collaborations and connections between researchers as well as for training of students in this area of research.  Specifically, the conference is designed to provide a "venue for graduate students to learn about emerging techniques in discrete mathematics."  The tutorial speakers in 2016 were Margaret Readdy (University of Kentucky) and Edray Goins (Purdue University); they each gave a series of three tutorial lectures.  Edray Goins also coordinated a problem session for the students.  In additional, 2 other faculty members, Sam Wagstaff (Purdue) and Alejandra Alvarado (Eastern Illinois), gave shorter lectures.  Four student talks were also given: by Yue Cai; Likith Govindaiah and Peter Park; Alex Happ; and Dustin Hedmark.  The topics discussed included Quantum Combinatorics, Coalgebraic Combinatorics, Whitney Stratifications, q-Series, Modular Forms, Algebraic Factoring, Cryptography, Parking Functions, Discrete Morse Theory, and Homology of Filters in the Partition Lattice.  The participants also viewed and discussed the film Navajo Math Circles by George Paul Csicsery.  A web page for the conference is available at http://www.stat.purdue.edu/lmwcgt16/.
