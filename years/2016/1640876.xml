<AbstractNarration>Modern CPUs are composed of billions of nanotransistors. To make these nanotransistors usable, it is essential that their performance characteristics vary minimally. However, ensuring that billions of transistors have little variation in their critical device characteristics is a huge challenge. At the scale of modern nanotransistors, even atomistic variations of the structure geometry can have a severe influence on overall device performance.  This project will use the Blue Waters leadership computing system to derive new models to enable efficient reliability predictions of modern nanodevices at crucial milestones in their design.  This will enable scientific and engineering based exploration of the end-of-the-roadmap device options, allowing our nation to remain the leader in semiconductor technologies.  The project will use NEMO5, a software co-developed with the semiconductor industry, to propose concrete, next generation nanotransistors. Furthermore, many students will be involved in the project, contributing to the education of our nation's future generation workforce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The state-of-the art nanodevices have characteristic lengths in the order of tens or one hundred of atoms. In these dimensions, unavoidable geometry fluctuations, even if they are of the order of one or a few atoms, can significantly impact performance. Thus, the design of modern devices has to consider the sensitivity of the nanostructure to fluctuations, as well as other important parameters that are known from earlier device generations. Phonons, i.e. vibrations of atoms, around their lattice sites have a severe impact on the device performance at this scale as well. Since only a few atoms are involved in the device transport, the interaction of electrons with phonons is based on a full quantum transport method that covers small-size coherent effects such as tunneling and confinement as well as incoherent scattering on device imperfections. Although quantum transport methods that handle this are well known, their solution is notoriously numerically expensive.  This project has two focal points: 1) uncertainty prediction  of next-generation transistor performance due to state-of-the-art physics models including scattering and 2) accurate compact model development of semiconductor-metal interconnect resistance.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The semiconductor industry is one of the sectors that has grown most quickly in the last twenty years. According to Fortune 500, semiconductor companies reported nearly $336 billion USD dollars of revenue in 2016 alone. The improvements in the density of integrated circuits and device performance have been achieved through a long journey of device downscaling and increase in chip size. That downscaling has pushed the critical lengthscale of the logic switches, the transistors to the few-nanometer lengthscale. At that dimension, particles like electrons are no longer localized, but blurred by quantum mechanical effects such as confinement, tunneling and interferences with other wave-like particles. On that scale, fabrication variabilities have immense impact on the behavior of wave-like electrons and have to be included on the same footing as atomic vibrations, surface or interface roughness and many other atomic-scale effects. Given how counter intuitive the quantum nature of nanotransistors is, intense numerical simulations of the transistor performance is unavoidable to progress the push further transistor development.   This project supported the development of the multipurpose nanodevice simualtion tool NEMO5 to 1) include all required coherent and incoherent nanoscale physics, to 2) solve for the quantum transport equations most efficiently on the high performance computing scale and 3) answer a set of open questions in the realm of nanotransistor development:  For instance, the tremendous push of the industry to aggressively scale devices has increased parasitic effects generated by an increase in the resistivity of the wire metallization which negatively affects the chip performance. Therefore, a careful design of interconnects is essential to reduce these parasitic effects. This work presented the first study where a fully atomistic basis has been used to describe realistic copper interconnects as used in the industry to identify the resistivity effects at room temperature. Such a large calculation would not be possible without the supercomputer resources provided by BlueWaters.  This project proposed a series of ultra-high-current triple &ndash;heterojunction tunneling field-effect transistor designs that avoid usage of Sb and Al based semiconductors to ease processing and permit dielectric interfaces with a low trap density. Such traps in the isolating dielectric materials notoriously plague the energy efficiency of nanotransistors, since they support sequential tunneling and maintain a leakage current.
