<AbstractNarration>1649919 &lt;br/&gt;Limerick, Patricia N. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After a very brisk boom over the past decade, oversupply of petroleum has led to a steep drop in prices. This "bust" has interrupted the rapid expansion of well drilling in conjunction with hydraulic fracturing, and a trend of shutting down and capping, closing, and even abandoning wells has accelerated. A wide range of stakeholders are often improvising procedures to manage this new phase constrained by declining financial resources. The premise of this workshop is that the history of the American West holds, in a multiplicity of abandoned mines, a century and a half's worth of directly relevant case studies. A workshop for coming to grips with the history and material impact of Western mining, and applying that understanding to the current circumstances of Western oil and gas production, presents an opportunity to bring scientists, engineers, historians, and policy scholars into an innovative, dynamic, and consequential conversation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop will place knowledge of subsurface activities in their broader context as practices embedded in intended and unintended historical legacies and provide a novel framework for anticipating and mitigating environmental, economic, and social impacts of contemporary oil and gas development. The central premise is that a historic-scientific approach will produce a life-cycle perspective on resource extraction and suggest practices to minimize the negative long-term consequences of intensive oil and gas production. An integrated review of past, current, and emerging sensing technology will identify data gaps and promote better monitoring and management of risk from subsurface resource extraction. Workshop participants will be selected to bridge scientific and lay/local knowledge of the impact of human activities in the subsurface. The costs and benefits of subsurface enterprises will be identified, along with their distribution at scales of neighborhood, town, city, suburb, county, state, reservation, region, nation, and planet. The workshop will draw on the expertise of the Center of the American West, in casting scholars in the humanities and social sciences as participants alongside scientists and engineers in managing the impacts of energy, water, and mining activities, rather than bringing them in as translators after the scientists have done their work. The workshop will foster public discussion of management of the subsurface by bringing together heretofore disparate voices of scientists, engineers, humanists, and local residents representing diverse communities. A published document, possibly a journal special issue, will present subsurface management strategies generated in the workshop based on review of scientific findings about the impacts of oil and gas development placed in a context of political, economic, social, and cultural relations, identified through using knowledge of historic mining. Workshop outcomes also will provide a framework for regulators and stakeholders interested in producing new policy and regulations, and create opportunities for partnerships between industry and academic researchers. Ideas for interdisciplinary approaches for teaching classes about the subsurface will be developed, including recruitment and training of researchers and other experts as guest speakers, curriculum guides, and class materials representing science, technology, and the humanities. New educational  developments begun at the University of Colorado Boulder will provide a grounded example that can be made available to other universities and colleges.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In order to take a fresh approach to the development and regulation of oil and gas, we convened a wide-ranging group of participants including engineers, scientists, tribal members, regulators, social scientists focusing on policy, and academic historians of mining.

Partnerships between industry, academic researchers, and community stakeholders to enhance the exchange of research, data, and educational collaborations.  An opportunity to guide student contributors and participants in historical and interdisciplinary thinking and encourage them to see themselves as important stewards of the future.   The exploration of interdisciplinary approaches for teaching classes about the subsurface, including a list of professors and other experts available as guest speakers, particularly to ensure that science and technology classes have strong humanities context for understanding the issues of the subsurface, and humanities and social science classes have equally important access to reliable technical knowledge. The cultivation of a community of responsive and connected thinkers on topics of subsurface science and policy. Enable the initial workshop community to grow beyond the workshop cohort by identifying opportunities for additional learning, deliverables, and collaborations with other stakeholders. The production of a special issue of a journal (most likely Environmental Science and Technology or Society and Natural Resources) inspired by the workshop, with a concluding article laying out prospects and possibilities for future research.      These are all meant to help convey the following findings:  The      institutionalization of thorough and standardized regulation can run the      risk of edging into a rigidity and inflexibility that discourage the      creation of new solutions.   It is      essential to cultivate and practice the commitment to think in terms of      the "life-cycle" of development&mdash;with especially close attention to the      meanings, operations, monitoring, and evaluation of post-production      closure. The literally down-to-earth potential of a robust relationship      and dialogue between historians and natural scientists and engineers      proved to be even more promising than we expected.   In both      mining and oil-and-gas development, dividing the "legacy" era from the era      of environmental regulation launched in the 1960s and 1970s is a customary      habit of thought. And yet the drawing a clear line between those two eras      is no easy matter; representatives of industry are certain that the      distinction between these two eras is unmistakable and fundamental, while      community advocates and environmentalists are inclined to see a less      complete transition.   However      sharp the line between those two eras, the legacy of mining and the legacy      of oil-and-gas development are unmistakable features in the Western      American landscape. These features come to a focus on two distinct aspects      of water management: dealing with the acid mine drainage of abandoned      mines, and dealing with the wastewater (a combination of formation water      and fracturing fluid) produced by oil-and-gas development, and often      handled with injection into the subsurface. The water-related legacies of      subsurface development put a premium on research into hydrology,      geochemistry, and seismicity.   In      cutting-edge work on communications with policymakers and engaged      citizens, scientists and engineers have been exhorted to adopt and      mobilize the powers of narrative and story. By situating the      interventions in the subsurface in a broader context of time, the      relationship with historians gives narrative and story in a necessary and      holistic tie with science communication.   The      most fraught area of scientific study&mdash;the calculation of public health      impacts from oil and gas development&mdash;seems to have no exact counterpart in      the appraisal of the impacts of mining. (While acid mine drainage can      devastate the life forms of aquatic ecosystems, negative human health      impacts may be a matter of distrust and suspicion, but are far from      established.) Moreover, the psychologists working in risk assessment play      an essential part in assessing and navigating the terrain of subjectivity      in these matters.

Paradoxically,      convening to deliberate on the often-contentious issues of resource      development in the subsurface provided a prime occasion to negotiate a      lasting truce in the twenty-first century?s battles between STEM and the      humanities. The perspectives of historians offer essential guidance      and orientation to scientists and engineers who have a great deal of      knowledge to contribute to citizens and their elected and appointed      officials, and who will gain significantly in effectiveness from a      partnership with historians.
