<AbstractNarration>Autonomous and semi-autonomous vehicles and systems have become indispensable both for civil (fire-fighting, nuclear waste handling, law-enforcement, deep ocean exploration and drilling, weather forecasting, transportation) and military (guided missiles, spacecraft, unmanned drones) applications. Automation, when coupled with information technology, will continue to permeate our society at ever increasing levels. Autonomous systems, which, thus far, have been a crucial component in homeland security applications (e.g., border patrol, persistent monitoring, etc), are now seen as a key factor of empowering people in their daily lives across work, leisure, and domestic tasks. The next generation of autonomous systems will operate and interact with humans in the household or the office. The recent investment of information technology companies such as Amazon and Google in robotics technology is likely to accelerate the adoption of these new technologies by the general public. The safe and reliable operation of all these autonomous systems hinges crucially on their ability to reason and navigate about their environment.  The theory and methodologies developed in this research will make it possible to run highly sophisticated algorithms inside the "brain" of these autonomous systems to enable optimal decision-making, thus increasing their reliability, predictability, performance and fail-safe operation. Self-driving vehicles, anthropomorphic robots, aerial drones, manufacturing automation systems, and precision surgical instruments among others, will all benefit from the results of this research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research tackles a fundamental problem in the area of motion planning and trajectory generation for robotic and intelligent autonomous systems. A serious bottleneck in solving such problems under limited resource constraints (e.g., computer memory, time) is their high dimensionality that precludes the na√Øve use of discretizing the (continuous) state space. In this research it is proposed to develop new incremental, optimal sampling-based motion planning algorithms with improved convergence rates over existing methods, so as to enable close-to-real-time trajectory generation for autonomous vehicles operating in an uncertain and dynamically changing environment. To achieve this objective, this research will build on recent results and ideas from Rapidly-exploring Random Graphs (RRG), along with relaxation methods borrowed from the areas of Asynchronous Dynamic Programming (ADP) and Machine Learning (ML). Specifically, recent advances from machine learning can be used to address the three main issues hindering the broader applicability of probabilistic sampling based motion planners to a wider variety of problems: collision checking, efficient sampling, and local steering. One main tenet of the proposed research is the exploitation of the inherent parallelism of the proposed algorithms, which -- coupled with the recent advances in multi-core computer architectures and GPUs -- will enable real-time computations.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Autonomous and semi-autonomous vehicles and systems have become indispensable both for civil (firefighting, nuclear waste handling, law-enforcement, deep ocean exploration and drilling, weather forecasting, transportation) and military (guided missiles, spacecraft, unmanned drones) applications. Autonomous systems, which, so far, have been a crucial component in homeland security applications (e.g., border patrol, persistent monitoring, etc), are now seen as a key factor of empowering people in their daily lives across work, leisure, and for performing mundane domestic tasks. Despite the recent advances, fast replanning for autonomous systems in a dynamically changing environment remains elusive. Recent promising algorithms generate random discrete abstractions of the search space, and hence can solve many challenging problems in high dimensions, but suffer from slow convergence rates. The main goal of this research project is to develop intelligent algorithms to accelerate the convergence of such sampling-based motion planning methods (SBMPs). To achieve this objective, ideas and techniques from machine learning are used to address three of the computational bottlenecks that plague current SBMPs: intelligent adaptive sampling, need to avoid expensive collision checking when generating local trajectories, and the solving fast these locally optimal trajectories &ndash; the so-called &ldquo;local steering&rdquo; problem.&nbsp;</p> <p>Several algorithms have been proposed as part of this effort. First, the DRRT (Deformable RRT) algorithm is proposed that utilizes optimization of sample location in the framework of RRT algorithms to improve convergence. In the process, a new experiment (the Hypercube Diagonal Experiment) has been introduced to investigate the convergence rates of sampling-based path-planning algorithms in terms of the dimensionality of the search space. Second, new adaptive sampling strategies for randomized path-planning algorithms using reinforcement learning ideas were developed. The use of reinforcement learning allows the algorithm to learn the relevant region and generate high quality samples in this region. Third, an efficient exploration strategy of the search space to expedite convergence of SBMPs has been proposed. The algorithm first concentrates on quickly finding a good initial solution and then focuses the search on regions that can potentially improve the current best solution. Finally, using ideas from reachability analysis, informative regions of the search space are identified and used to focus the search for time-optimal kinodynamic planning, that is, planning subject to kinematic constraints.</p> <p>All these algorithms have an immediate impact on the development of the next generation of intelligent autonomous robotic systems. The market for autonomous and robotic vehicles and systems has witnessed an enormous growth during the past decade and is continuing to increase steadily, owing to the proven potential of unmanned/autonomous and robotic systems in law enforcement, military and humanitarian missions. The robotics industry in the US is witnessing a renaissance, as robotics is viewed as an economic enabler impacting many facets of the economy, ranging from manufacturing, to healthcare, to service robots, and space and defense. The worldwide market for both industrial and service robots is forecast by UNECE and IFR to be in excess of $66B by 2025. The economic impact from the expected ubiquitous presence of autonomous robots in other aspects of our society (household, medical services, etc) will be even greater. The results developed in this research can make the algorithms running inside the &ldquo;brains&rdquo; of these intelligent systems faster, and more reliable.The educational activities of this research include the involvement of graduate and undergraduate students in research. In addition to the graduate students directly involved with the research activities, a team of 10+ undergraduate students from four different departments (AE, ME, ECE, CS) have worked on building an autonomous ground robot as part of a VIP (vertically integrated project) team (www.vip.gatech.edu/teams/active-safety-autonomous-and-semi-autonomous-vehicles).The VIP program is an undergraduate education program by which undergraduate students joining VIP teams earn academic credit for their participation in design/discovery efforts that assist faculty and graduate students with research issues in their areas of expertise (for more details, see www.vip.gatech.edu). The teams are multidisciplinary (drawing students from all disciplines on campus); vertically-integrated (maintaining a mix of sophomore through PhD students each semester); and long-term (each undergraduate student may participate in a project for up to three years and each graduate student may participate for the duration of their graduate career).</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 02/06/2021<br>      Modified by: Panagiotis&nbsp;Tsiotras</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1617630/1617630_10432669_1612653083052_fig5--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1617630/1617630_10432669_1612653083052_fig5--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Intelligent sampling on general cost-maps."><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1617630/1617630_10432669_1612653083052_fig5--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Intelligent sampling on general cost-maps."></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Planning on a terrain cost-map (left) and potential cost-map (right) with the proposed sampling strategy.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Sagar Joshi and Panagiotis Tsiotras</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Panagiotis&nbsp;Tsiotras</div> <div class="imageTitle">Intelligent sampling on general cost-maps.</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1617630/1617630_10432669_1612652812151_fig2--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1617630/1617630_10432669_1612652812151_fig2--rgov-800width.jpg" title="DRRT on robotic arm"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1617630/1617630_10432669_1612652812151_fig2--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="DRRT on robotic arm"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">DRRT algorithm controlling a 6DOF robotic arm.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Florian Hauer and Panagiotis Tsiotras</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Panagiotis&nbsp;Tsiotras</div> <div class="imageTitle">DRRT on robotic arm</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1617630/1617630_10432669_1612652896804_fig3--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1617630/1617630_10432669_1612652896804_fig3--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Non-parametric informed sampling"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1617630/1617630_10432669_1612652896804_fig3--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Non-parametric informed sampling"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Schematic of the non-parametrically informed sampling, showing kernel vertices (black) generating new samples in the L2-informed set after an initial solution is found.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Sagar Joshi and Panagiotis Tsiotras</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Panagiotis&nbsp;Tsiotras</div> <div class="imageTitle">Non-parametric informed sampling</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1617630/1617630_10432669_1612652961337_fig4--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1617630/1617630_10432669_1612652961337_fig4--rgov-800width.jpg" title="DRRT in cluttered environment"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1617630/1617630_10432669_1612652961337_fig4--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="DRRT in cluttered environment"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Example of paths generated by DRRT in a cluttered environment.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Haidar Jamal and Panagiotis Tsiotras</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Panagiotis&nbsp;Tsiotras</div> <div class="imageTitle">DRRT in cluttered environment</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1617630/1617630_10432669_1612652679805_fig1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1617630/1617630_10432669_1612652679805_fig1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="DRRT performance"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1617630/1617630_10432669_1612652679805_fig1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="DRRT performance"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Iterations to converge within 3% of the optimal cost for the hypercube diagonal experiment as a function of the dimension of the problem.
