<AbstractNarration>The Huron to Erie Alliance for Research and Training (HEART) Field Stations are unique in their access to both natural and built water resources in the urban environment, including natural ecosystems and water infrastructure that supports over 4 million people in Southeast Michigan. Located at Belle Isle, Lake St. Clair Metropark, and the Detroit Water and Sewerage Department Water Works Park (WWP) drinking water treatment plant, the HEART field stations provide access to state-of-the-art research laboratory facilities and unique native and restored Great Lakes coastal ecosystems and green/blue infrastructure, as well as major shipping networks, world-class tourism and fisheries resources and an international border crossing. The frontiers of knowledge on the sustainability of water infrastructure and the maintenance of water quality for human and ecological welfare will be advanced through new studies using the proposed equipment and facility improvements. These studies will directly impact metropolitan Detroit and the Great Lakes region and will also serve the national purpose by providing innovative education and training on a broad variety of urban water resources topics at all levels of study (K-12, community college, undergraduate, graduate and post-doc). The research and education approaches used by HEART are designed to secure a technologically-advanced future workforce knowledgeable and experienced in urban watershed issues and study methods, and instilled with values about the stewardship of urban freshwater resources. The proposed equipment will enhance HEART's ability to positively impact the economic competitiveness of the shipping and fisheries industries, as well as the sustainability and affordability of drinking water systems. Established partnerships with urban public schools and community institutions will enable improvements in the research, education and training at the HEART field stations to provide greater access to advanced Science-Technology-Engineering-Math (STEM) resources and skills for underrepresented minorities. The field stations are places where researchers from diverse institutions and academic disciplines interact, and each facility provides a venue for tours and conferences that connect collaborators nationally and internationally around urban water science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The addition of the proposed equipment at HEART will advance knowledge of fisheries and restoration science through environmental DNA detection using PCR-based techniques, developing new methods for assessing the effectiveness of habitat restoration and the risk of invasive species transport via ship ballast water. Equipment to support advancement of automated methods for rapid molecular aquatic ecology analysis will bring this promising new field closer to marketability and broad application for the public good. Experimental manipulation of the 5,000 square foot replica drinking water treatment system at WWP and evaluation of physiological organism responses will provide new insights on treatment process effectiveness for contaminants of emerging concern. The equipment will support hands-on student water science, aquatic molecular and microbial analysis, identification of invasive species, fisheries experiments, drinking water treatment technology investigations and water quality studies in the critical Great Lakes waterway from Lake Huron to Lake Erie. Communications technology will expand the capacity of the HEART Field Stations to collect and integrate data and enable scientists to engage and empower the public in creating a sustainable urban environment based on sound science.

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The HEART field stations operated by Wayne State University engage and empower the public in creating a sustainable urban environment based on sound science.  This project positively impacts research and training relating to urban watersheds, water infrastructure and water quality, with benefits for the human and ecological welfare of the Detroit metropolitan community, the Great Lakes, and nationally.  The HEART Field Stations include Lake St. Clair Metropark (LSCMP), the laboratory at the Belle Isle Aquarium (Belle Isle) on the Detroit River and the Great Lakes Water Authority (GLWA) Water Works Park Drinking Water Treatment Plant (WWP), formerly owned by the City of Detroit Water and Sewerage Department.  The equipment and facility improvements at the field stations achieved the following objectives: (1) expand research and training in key focal areas, (2) support strategic partnerships with collaborators, and (3) enhance connections between academia, government and industry.  The research and training focal areas include:  aquatic organism interactions, environmental processes, aquatic molecular science, and the technology and sustainability of water infrastructure.  The impacts of the improvements include the following:  -       Increased reliability and speed of the enumeration and identification of E. Coli and other pathogenic bacteria at public beaches.  The development and testing of faster methods for monitoring microbial levels to improve mechanisms for protecting public health have been important impacts of the project.  -       Increased ability to evaluate emerging contaminants (CECs) in surface water and in drinking water treatment systems at very low concentrations.  Important new areas of study were initiated in biofilm formation and bacterial proliferation relating to nano-sized microplastics.  By evaluating contaminant fate through the public drinking water treatment system, potential impacts on human health are being better understood.  -       Increased ability to analyze toxicology impacts of CECs on key organisms such as developing fish embryos and aquatic keystone species such as Daphnia, particularly during early developmental stages requiring high-powered microscopy.  The results of this research have impacts on the development of sustainable Great Lakes fisheries and implications for human health.  -       For the first time, high-throughput genetic sequencing and DNA analysis of the gut contents of aquatic mites collected from nature is providing insights into the role of invasive species of oligochaetes and the role of prey biodiversity including adult chironomids in water mite diet, which factors into Great Lakes food web and fisheries sustainability.  -       Improved human resource development in field science, having an impact on the general public, school teachers and their students in 5th grade and above, undergraduate and graduate students, post-doctoral students, academic faculty, and employees of government, industry and civil society organizations.  -       Increased community engagement with and support of the new innovative research, including the renewal and expansion of formal agreements with project partners, and consistent engagement of community advisory board representatives of local, state and federal government, civil society (non-profit) organizations.     Broader impacts of the improvements include:  Economic Competitiveness - Our research on invasive species has effects on tourism (such as round goby displacement of walleye and sport fisheries), and on the regulatory requirements and costs to the shipping industry (ballast water evaluation technology), and our water contaminant research has implications for fisheries sustainability (impact of harmful algal blooms on juvenile walleye; impact of contaminants of emerging concern or CECs on embryonic fish development; and aquatic organism diet studies).  The work at LSCMP and Belle Isle to develop rapid assessment methods for nearshore microbial detection has direct economic benefits through fewer beach closures and better reliability of rapid test results.  In addition, drinking water health, access and affordability are all outcomes of the research being performed at the WWP field station, having effects on the overall economic desirability of the built environment and infrastructure in the region.   Public Scientific Literacy and STEM Education - The HEART field stations contribute to science-technology-engineering-math (STEM) education for the public&mdash;particularly adults and tourists who seek out the facility for general reasons but then also get exposed to scientific information and insights into water quality&mdash;and educators who participate in training events there.  STEM Workforce Development &ndash; Because of nationwide concern about declining student interest in drinking water treatment infrastructure&mdash;and the resulting lack of young plant operators entering the workforce&mdash;WWP provides important training for university students to innovate new sustainable technologies and get interested in and develop their beliefs in the importance of urban infrastructure design and maintenance.  For example, the funded epifluorescence microscope is now helping us to train students in new innovative scientific methods with broad applicability to many disciplines. Due to the diverse student population of Wayne State University and the City of Detroit, training conducted at the field stations also will have a positive effect on the diversity of STEM workforce development.
