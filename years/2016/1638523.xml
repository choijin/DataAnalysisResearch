<AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit:  Recent national documents and studies of post-secondary education call attention to the importance of developing a scientifically literate citizenry and the current shortcomings in our efforts to address this need.  Research in physics education has focused most closely on the knowledge students develop within courses, and to a more limited extent, whether students transfer knowledge from one course to the next.  The extent to which students' physics learning influences their experience outside of school is dramatically under-researched. Such moments - experiences in which students actively use science concepts to see and experience their everyday world in meaningful, new ways - has been termed by educational psychologist Pugh to be 'transformative experiences.' &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is to develop assessment tools to identify in what ways physics courses engender transformative experiences (TE), and, through the iterative development of these assessment tools, examine the nature of transformative experiences and the classroom practices that foster them. Such work lays the groundwork for further transforming undergraduate education in the sciences by: (1) connecting physics education research with the body of research on transformative experience, providing a language for what has previously been an under-developed goal of physics instruction and an under-researched aspect of physics education; (2) developing assessment tools to allow instructors and researchers to quickly examine the prevalence of transformative experiences in physics classrooms; (3) investigating the nature of transformative experience, by providing case studies of students' experiences; and (4) examining courses rich in transformative experiences to understand the instructional practices that foster TE.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The project is: (1) providing the physics education research community with a means of evaluating and fostering transformative experiences in undergraduate physics through the development and dissemination of a survey; (2) establishing collaborations between researchers in physics education and educational psychology from three separate campuses, building stronger links between discipline-based physics education research (which typically situates itself in the undergraduate classroom), and the broader education research community (where research primarily centers on K-12 classrooms); (3) addressing the needs of pre-service teachers, who are the primary student population of the courses being studied and the student-researchers employed on the project; and (4) serving a population traditionally underrepresented in the sciences - elementary education majors, 90% of whom are women.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The overall goals of physics instruction are not gains on concept inventories or improved scores on surveys of epistemological beliefs.  While these measures provide evidence of science learning, they are proxies for the broader goal of developing scientifically literate citizens and scientists who draw on their physics knowledge outside of classroom settings.  Nonetheless, existing measures fail to identify whether or not students &mdash; even those, for example, with high gains in conceptual understanding or scientific orientations towards epistemology &mdash; use their knowledge, skills and beliefs about physics outside of the physics classroom.  These moments - experiences in which students actively use science concepts to see and experience their everyday world in meaningful, new ways &ndash; have been termed by educational psychologist Pugh to be "transformative experiences." Drawing on Pugh?s work, this project has created a survey for use in undergraduate physics courses, and studied courses in which students report high incidents of "transformative experiences" (TE), where ideas from class are transferred to and add value to students? lives outside of class. While prior research has noted that student characteristics (e.g. their interest in science and a mastery orientation towards education) influence TE, we also note that instruction is also deeply tied to the promotion of  transformative experiences.  In particular, we have found that transformative experiences are fostered in classrooms that are intercontextual: where out-of-class contexts are invoked by students in scientifically consequential ways as they develop and vet ideas. Furthermore, this intercontextuality in class is supported by disruptions to traditional instructional practices that confer power on students &mdash; a responsiveness to student ideas, replacing traditional lab equipment with materials that are more "everyday," and a lack of textbook or lab manual. The absence of these typical resources and structures require students to employ ideas and objects from out of the classroom as they develop their own investigations and ideas in physics. As part of this analysis, we have considered a range of contexts and how those may be positioned intercontextually in classes. Among these contexts are the way in which ideas from other domains of knowledge are introduced in class (a student who works nights as a bartender justifies a three-primary model of color by comparing it to mixing drinks); how out-of-class identities are invoked (e.g., a veteran discusses the nature of sound: "[when a blast goes off,] if there's grass you can see the grass move all the way up until right in front of you, and [then] if it's strong enough &hellip; it kind of pushes you back."); and the ways in which non-classroom materials are repurposed as lab equipment ("near sighted vision needs glasses with thicker glass on the sides&hellip;"). In these cases, ideas developed in physics class are tightly linked to identities, objects and domains outside of class, thus promoting transfer to these other contexts. Moving forward, we are interested in how to develop curricula and materials that promote such intercontextuality. Where students, as they develop sophisticated understanding of scientific ideas, do so in ways that link those ideas to out-of-class contexts.
