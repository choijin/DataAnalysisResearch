<AbstractNarration>Non-Technical Abstract&lt;br/&gt;Materials at the focus of modern physics research often feature competition among several ways electrons can organize. This is both a blessing and a curse, opening rich possibilities but also hindering basic understanding of these materials. What if one could build an experimental system which displays the key features believed to drive behavior of a material of interest, while discarding other effects which might obscure the fundamental mechanism?&lt;br/&gt;Modern technology such as transistors and lasers depends on the fact that adding even a small amount of impurities to a material can drastically alter its properties. Another example of such sensitivity is the Kondo effect: a few parts per million of magnetic impurities added to a metal drastically change its low-temperature electrical behavior. Such an impurity creates a "cloud" of electrons around it, which shields the magnetic moment of the impurity. This project aims to nanofabricate a device to measure the spatial extent of this cloud, and to study the competition between impurity-cloud and impurity-impurity interactions when two such impurities are brought together. This will shed light on a class of materials known as heavy fermion metals, in which exactly this competition is suspected to be key, by realizing the competition in a simplified and highly-controllable system.&lt;br/&gt;In addition to the research component, both the principal investigator and the students have a track record and plans for active involvement in outreach regarding nanoscience, including short programs for middle school teachers, and involving high school and college students in research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Abstract&lt;br/&gt;This project aims to determine the spatial extent of the Kondo screening cloud and study the Kondo-RKKY competition using a carefully-engineered model system based on gate-defined quantum dots in a GaAs/AlGaAs heterostructure. While the Kondo effect has been seen and studied in many different systems, a clear measurement of its spatial extent is still lacking. In the proposed device, the competition between the inter-impurity interaction and the impurity-bath interaction, suspected to be key to the behavior of several heavy-fermion compounds, is gate-tunable. Realizing the effect in a much more controllable nanostructure may elucidate the rich behavior occurring in those materials, including a quantum phase transition which could play a key role.&lt;br/&gt;As a complement to precision transport studies, a scanning gate experiment, where a metallic tip is scanned over the surface of a nanopatterned bilayer heterostructure, can perturb the Kondo cloud at a controlled location, providing a direct mapping of the spatial extent of a quantum many-body state.</AbstractNarration>
