<AbstractNarration>Shoreline Community College will upgrade its Clean Energy Technology curriculum and add long-term project-based learning experiences that develop higher levels of software and engineering skills. By developing a curriculum that addresses industry-identified needs and contains job-specific experiences, the revitalized program will help students develop a skillset that prepares them for high-skill technology jobs in the field of clean energy. Currently, there is no national title for a clean energy technologist. However, Shoreline's industry advisory board has identified a need for such a position and this project will develop skill standards that align with industry needs. The ultimate results of this project will be expediting Shoreline graduates' placement into energy management jobs, and contributing new materials to the ATE community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project's goals are: 1) to identify and define skill standards for a Clean Energy Technologist curriculum using Job Task Analysis, Job Market Survey, focus groups, gap analysis, and Developing a Curriculum (DACUM); 2) to develop authentic field experiences that simulate authentic job-related activities through project-based laboratory experiences; and 3) to increase regional awareness and interest in clean energy technology by engaging with high school STEM teachers. Project evaluation will provide an outside, independent perspective on the effectiveness of the project. Project activities, measurements, instruments, and outcomes will be shared with other departments and schools through presentations and professional development activities, and through the ATE community.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  The Clean Tech ATE: Advancing Technician Training in Clean Energy Technology Project at Shoreline Community College received an award from the National Science Foundation: Advanced Technological Education (DUE 1665227) in July 2017, with the grant ending June 30, 2021. The Clean Energy Technology (CET) program prepares graduates with the theoretical and practical knowledge necessary for careers in firms that manage, design, build, market or operate clean energy technologies in the built environment. The program focuses on clean energy technologies and practices that can achieve (or approach) "Net Zero Energy" in buildings.   Shoreline Community College upgraded its Clean Energy Technology program curriculum and added long-term project-based learning experiences that developed higher levels of software and engineering skills. By developing a curriculum that addressed industry-identified needs and contained job-specific experiences, the revitalized program helped students develop a skillset that prepared them for high-skill technology jobs in the field of clean energy. The ultimate results of this project expedited Shoreline graduates' placement into energy management jobs and contributed new materials to the Advanced Technological Education community.  The curriculum this project developed is relevant on a national level:  Stringent building codes now require a Net Zero Energy design, high performance building systems, and the inclusivity of solar photovoltaic systems and design; efficiency must be a factor in both retrofitting old buildings and designing new buildings.  In terms of impact, the short-term impact of this project is that graduates from Shoreline’s Clean Energy Technology program will have more competitive credentials, and thus will be able to obtain and maintain employment.  The longer-term impact of this project is its potential to further the nation’s efforts to reduce carbon emissions by building or retrofitting more efficient buildings.  Courses developed include:  Buildings in Context (NRG 104): Students develop and articulate a personal sustainable design philosophy that informs their contribution to an integrated design process which creates buildings that are sustainable solutions in their social, cultural, public policy, ecological and aesthetic contexts  Large Building Assessment: Energy Technologies Measurements (NRG 162): Survey of large building assemblies, systems and energy efficiency technologies that affect building energy performance.  Large Building Energy: Methods and Measurements (NRG163): Methods and measurements used for large building energy audits and assessments.  Virtual Design for Energy Technologies (NRG 181): Course provides foundational technical skills in the use of Building Information Modeling (BIM) for high performing/renewable energy systems in the built environment. Topics include whole building energy systems modeling for design, analysis, and detailing. The course focuses on Autodesk Revit MEP.  The curriculum developed over the last four years proved beneficial in placing students in the clean energy technology industry. The overall programming is much more robust than four years ago, and students are placed quite quickly into good paying jobs with solar installers, engineering companies, and design/build firms. The courses developed were easily updated to a fully online delivery during Covid-19 restrictions and students reacted positively to these changes.  Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Impacts:  One of the goals of this project was to increase career awareness among underrepresented student populations and enhance the high school to higher education pipeline. Shoreline Community College hosted three summer Solar Institutes for high school teachers. 40 local high school teachers participated to learn about photovoltaic design and created lessons to bring back to their classrooms. Over 5000 students were impacted via these workshops.  To inculcate Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion principles as part of the CET program, three new staff were hired as associate faculty for a total of six faculty. Five of the faculty are women and the male instructor is a person of color, providing a normalizing influence to concerns that energy technicians need be one gender or Caucasian. Female enrollment has increased by 30%.                                           Last Modified: 08/14/2021       Submitted by: Louise Petruzzella]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
