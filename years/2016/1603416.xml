<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  This project aimed to understand how natural pattern-forming processes can be harnessed to form self-organized and self-regulated functional structures, at various length scales.  In particular it focused on quenching or triggering heterogeneities which progressively excite a pattern-forming instability which then grows and saturates the medium, establishing a regular, spatially periodic pattern.  Examples of such mechanisms can be found in ion-milling, chemical deposition and evaporation, and eutectic alloy solidification, and could be useful in the fabrication of novel devices, such as nanometer-scale diffraction gratings, thin-film solar cells, and micro-fluidic medical instruments. Technical understanding of these quenching mechanisms could also aid in the understanding of patterning processes in nature, such as early stage mammalian embryo gastrulation and digit patterning, plant phyllotaxis, and in the formation periodic Rayleigh-Benard convection cells.  Using rigorous tools from dynamical systems, partial differential equations, and functional analysis, formal asymptotic and modulational approximations, and numerical continuation, this project sought to more deeply understand known physical phenomena and predict novel structures by studying existence, stability, bifurcation, and dynamics of such pattern forming fronts in physically relevant models, in multiple spatial dimensions.  The main outcomes and results of this project are as follows: i) This project gave nearly complete description of stripe selection and formation in the wake of a directional quenching mechanism, in two spatial dimensions (i.e. in the plane), for the Swift-Hohenberg equation, a prototypical model for pattern formation. Researchers in many areas should be able to use this characterization, or extensions of it to other physical models, as a ?cookbook? to predict and create patterned structures or materials. Furthermore the approach, and theoretical techniques used in this work could aid in the study of patterns with different quenching geometries and moving boundary conditions  in growing domains and manifolds.  Experimentalists will also be able to use instability criteria derived in this work to identify when various orientations of stripes become unstable, and hence difficult to observe or manufacture. Furthermore, this classification led to the prediction and characterization of many interesting dynamic phenomena, such as the formation of time-periodic phase/anti-phase kinks in striped patterns, heteroclinic snaking, and the secondary invasion of cross-roll and wrinkling instabilities.  Such dynamical behaviors were also studied with formal Cahn-Hilliard and Newell-Whitehead-Segel modulational approximations. ii) This project gave rigorous existence proofs, as well as wavenumber predictions, for striped-forming fronts in the Swift-Hohenberg equation with a  directional quenching heterogeneity.  In this model, the spatial dynamics formulation is inherently infinite-dimensional, and hence dynamical systems methods become difficult to apply.  To study one-dimensional striped fronts, a multi-scale center-manifold approach was generalized to deal with non-autonomous terms which arise from the quenching heterogeneity.  To study two-dimensional patterns (i.e. slanted stripes), a novel functional analytic approach was developed.  This separated the far-field dynamics from those at the quenching interface in order to recover Fredholm properties, while a pre-conditioning Fourier multiplier was used to regularize the singular limit of long transverse wavelength, where stripes are nearly parallel to the quenching interface.  iii) This project also developed a partial differential equation model of the signaling dynamics in stem-cell colonies used as experimental models of early stage gastrulation in human embryos. The results of the modeling study, which compared well with experiments, suggest that early stage differentiation of various germ layers is caused by a cascade of traveling signal waves, and not by a diffusion induced Turing-like instability. iv) This project also used tools from dynamical systems theory to study long-time asymptotics of stably-stratified, rotating, geophysical flows. In particular, self-similar scaling variables, and a new extended vorticity formulation were developed to show the persistence and local stability of the Oseen vortex for certain classes of initial data.  Current work:  This project also led to current work on spectral stability of quenched pattern-forming fronts in one and two dimensions. This work uses a matrix Ricatti Evans function to unfold point spectra near a branch point of marginally unstable absolute spectra.  Finally, this project has led to further development of modulational approximations to study transverse dynamics at the pattern-forming interface. Broader Impacts: The fellow attempted to reach outside the research mathematics community by seeking out interdisciplinary collaborations in areas such as physics, chemistry, and biology. The fellow also mentored two undergraduate research projects, and gave several general introductory talks at primarily undergraduate institutions. Furthermore, this project sought to aid in the development of young researchers by deliberately recruiting them to speak in both conference minisymposia and departmental seminars organized by the fellow.  The fellow also sought to disseminate research at both the national and international level, giving talks and visiting math, physics, and chemistry departments across the country, and in Europe.
