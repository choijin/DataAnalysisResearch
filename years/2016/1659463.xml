<AbstractNarration>The Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) program at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI) located in Woods Hole, MA will receive renewed funding for two years. The award supports ten undergraduate students per year in the ten to twelve-week Summer Student Fellow (SSF) Program. Students are selected following a national search and are matched with mentors from the large number of scientists at WHOI who focus on a wide variety of research topics. They receive a stipend, housing and travel to and from their home to WHOI.  Students complete a research project, participate in a seminar series, professional development workshops and field trips, and complete a final research paper and a poster. Many Fellows have an opportunity to present their work at a scientific conference after the program. Tracking of summer Fellows since 2011 shows about 80% of SSF alumni are in science graduate programs or working in a scientific/technical field, and therefore, the WHOI REU program provides an important contribution towards training of the nation's scientific and technical workforce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;REU Fellows at WHOI have the opportunity to work on a wide variety of scientific research topics. Each Fellow will receive one-on-one mentoring from a researcher who works in one of WHOI's five academic departments and one Center, or at the U.S Geological Survey. The WHOI Departments are Applied Ocean Physics and Engineering, Biology, Geology and Geophysics, Marine Chemistry and Geochemistry, and Physical Oceanography. The WHOI Marine Policy Center has research opportunities focused on maritime law, environmental quality, and marine resources.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI) Summer Student Fellowship (SSF) program is one of the NSF Research Experience for Undergraduate (REU) sites supported by the Division of Ocean Sciences of the National Science Foundation (NSF).  Funds provided by this two-year project supported undergraduate students participating in WHOI's Summer Student Fellowship program: twelve Fellows in 2017 and ten Fellows in 2018.  Major goals of the WHOI SSF Program are to expose undergraduates to state-of-the-art research in ocean science and engineering and increase the participation of minorities underrepresented in ocean sciences. Students attend the 10-12 week program following their junior year. A combination of personal contacts with undergraduate faculty and former Fellows, material distributed at the WHOI booth at AGU, Ocean Sciences and other meetings, and pages on the NSF, WHOI, Institute for Broadening Participation, and SACNAS web sites are used to recruit students. Admission is competitive, with ~13% to 14% percent of the applicants receiving awards. Each Fellow is matched with an adviser(s) from one of the academic departments at WHOI, or from the U.S. Geological Survey. Each is encouraged to discuss potential projects with these potential advisors before deciding whether to accept the Fellowship offer.  Projects are carried out in a range of disciplines (Biological, Chemical, or Physical Oceanography; Marine Geology and Geophysics; Ocean Engineering).  Fellows work with their adviser to complete a work plan within their first few weeks of arriving at WHOI.  During the summer, each SSF makes two presentations: a five-minute mid-summer oral progress report, and a final oral or poster presentation on their research. A written final project report is required. Professional development activities include a special lecture series, a one-day field experience on the a small research vessel, a half-day Responsible Conduct of Research workshop, training by the WHOI graphics department on how to prepare a scientific poster, and discussions about graduate school with a panel of postdocs and graduate students.  The program has been successful in entraining highly qualified STEM students into ocean science and engineering, and efforts are frequently made to improve the program.  Information from an external evaluator is supplemented by input from individual exit interviews and an anonymous Exit Survey and used to modify subsequent year programming.  Common threads in both the early evaluation and the exit surveys in 2017 and 2018 were the very positive interactions that the summer student fellows had with one another, and how a newly constructed dormitory facilitates interaction.   A major addition to the program in 2018 was the addition of a mandatory mentoring workshop for all Summer Student Fellow (SSF) advisers that covered best practices and included small group discussions of possible issues that can arise.  Feedback to the workshops was overwhelmingly positive, with all mentors attending, and many thanking us for arranging the workshop, and suggesting that similar workshops be offered for graduate student advisers.  The intellectual merit of this REU Site is the high quality of research conducted by the students in a wide range of disciplines and sub-disciplines.  WHOI is one of the largest independent oceanographic institutions and research fleet operators in the world.  Summer Student Fellows (SSFs) use state of the art analytical instruments, sampling devices and modeling programs for their research projects in a wide range of disciplines.  Broader impacts of the WHOI SSF Program include engaging students in laboratory and field research to stimulate and sustain interest in science, introducing the fields of ocean science and ocean engineering to STEM students, and increasing diversity within ocean sciences.  Eighteen of the twenty-two students presented their research at national meetings; at least four are working on co-authored papers (in preparation), and two have submitted co-authored papers to peer-reviewed journals.  Of the twelve 2017 NSF-funded fellows, six are pursuing Ph.D. degrees (including four from groups underrepresented in the ocean sciences, three of whom are NSF graduate fellows), four are working as research technicians, and one is pursuing a masters while on a Fulbright. Of the ten 2018 NSF-funded fellows, one (from a group underrepresented in the ocean sciences) will be entering a Ph.D. program in the fall, another is pursuing a masters in mechanical engineering, one is entering the Peace Corps, one is working as an engineer at WHOI and one is working as a research technician at MIT. These outcomes are consistent with tracking of WHOI NSF-funded SSFs between 2011 and 2016 that showed ~80% are in science graduate programs or working in a scientific/technical field, and point to the continued success of the program in entraining STEM students into careers in the ocean and geosciences and/or engineering, and in working towards increasing diversity in these fields.
