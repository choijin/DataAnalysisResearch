<AbstractNarration>This Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) site will create a ten-week summer research experience for a diverse pool of non-traditional students to work with faculty advisors from Portland State University's Center for Climate and Aerosol Research. Students will be shown the linkages between components of the atmospheric system that are important in studies of climate, aerosols and air quality. Students will have access to state-of-the-art instrumentation for conducting field, laboratory and modeling research in the atmospheric sciences. They will explore the need for high quality data that can be obtained from measurements and which leads to reliable climate and air quality model predications. This REU site will make extensive use of an online Learning Management System (LMS) and e-Portfolios to foster collaboration before, during and after the ten-week summer session. Within this dynamic research environment students will conduct meaningful research projects that address important topics in the atmospheric sciences related to air quality and environmental change. Robust evaluation of this program will contribute to the development of improved REU models for mentoring rural and Native American students from community colleges and small four-year colleges.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project's specific goals are to (1) recruit a diverse set of ten undergraduates annually, targeting rural and Native American students; (2) increase participants' knowledge of atmospheric and laboratory science; (3) enhance students' academic and professional-technical development; (4) increase motivation and self-efficacy to continue in STEM education and careers; (5) build supportive networks and student identification with science; and (6) increase STEM retention. This REU experience was intentionally designed by a multidisciplinary project team to familiarize students with the culture of science and to develop skills transferable to STEM and varied careers, including technical writing, research ethics, numerical and statistical analysis, hardware development, and effective communication to professional and general audiences. The atmospheric system is dynamic and complex. The study of the atmospheric system requires researchers to develop state-of-the-art tools for observation and modeling; these activities ensure the continued advancement of knowledge about the processes that force and regulate the atmosphere's synoptic and planetary circulation, air quality, weather and climate. It is therefore of the utmost importance to sustain the pool of human resources required for excellence in synoptic and global atmospheric dynamics, air quality and climate research.</AbstractNarration>
