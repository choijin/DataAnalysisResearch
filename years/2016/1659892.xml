<AbstractNarration>Chapman University has been granted funds to run a Research Experience for Undergraduates Site in The Schmid College of Science and Technology. Twelve students selected exclusively from community colleges (and focusing on under-represented minorities, women, and low-income students) will have the opportunity to engage in research projects related to environmental and ecological issues from the molecular to global scale. The program will provide an under-served student population with hands-on, interdisciplinary research experiences and enhance the recruitment/retention of under-represented students into STEM fields. Chapman University will partner with five local community colleges that serve ethnically diverse communities and lack scientific research facilities. Faculty mentors include biologists, chemists, and geoscientists with active undergraduate research labs. In addition to their work in these labs, students will participate in group activities including pre-experience training workshops, seminars by research faculty and environmental organization representatives, group meetings/presentations within their research groups, professional development workshops, a research poster presentation session, and a post-experience evaluation assessment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Southern California is an urbanized area featuring a wide range of environmental and ecological challenges. Addressing these complex issues requires an interdisciplinary and educated workforce of scientists. Through participation in cutting-edge research with faculty mentors working at the forefronts of their disciplines, students will engage in novel scientific studies on topics including the transformation pathways of pollutants, environmental impacts on intertidal organisms, effects of climate change on extreme weather-related events, and carbon sequestration in wetlands. These interactions will provide valuable interdisciplinary research experience to a typically under-served student population and drive the principal investigators' scholarly research forward.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship in Environmental and Ecological Sciences (SURFEES) at Chapman University, a 4-year comprehensive master's university, provided students from local community colleges with the opportunity to engage in summer research projects related to earth and environmental issues from the molecular to global scale with Chapman University faculty.  A total of 12 participants were accepted to participate in the program during summer 2017 from five local community colleges (over 100 applications were received).  Student applications were screened utilizing a project-made rubric and the PI and Co-PI made preliminary selections which were presented to the mentors prior to final placements.  Pre-summer trainings were conducted for mentors and pre-summer workshops were held for participants. Pre-experience evaluation data was collected from participants and faculty mentors during these events. Professional development was provided to all participants on a weekly basis throughout the summer and included, for example, sessions on writing a resume, giving public presentations, and finding scholarship/fellowship opportunities.  The research experience concluded with a formal poster presentation which was attended by mentors, Chapman University faculty and administrators, participants? families, and representatives from the community colleges.     Post-experience evaluation data, including focus group interviews were conducted.  Annual findings and feedback were used for program improvement and aggregated findings have been presented at national conferences.   The objectives of the Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship in Environmental and Ecological Sciences (SURFEES) program, and the way(s) in which they were achieved, were to:  a) Provide transformative research experiences for students from 2-year institutions:  Participants were recruited from five local community colleges including, Citrus College (Glendora, CA), Irvine Valley College (Irvine, CA), Santiago Canyon College (Orange, CA), Santa Ana College (Santa Ana, CA), and Saddleback College (Mission Viejo, CA).  Three of the four colleges are designated Hispanic-Serving Institutions.  All participants were engaged in the full range of activities outlined in the proposal including a rigorous research experience, professional development and networking, and workshops on transfer to four-year institutions.   Data from the SURE III Survey (Lopatto), administered post-REU experience, indicate that participants made considerable gains across the 21 items measured by the survey.  SURFEES participants? gains were considerably more robust as compared to the total population.  b) Increase the participation of under-represented students: The project set a target of serving a cohort of 10 students annually with 50% of the cohort underrepresented minorities, 50% women, and 50% low-income.  REU Supplement Awards made it possible to include 12 students in the Year 2 and Year 3 cohorts.              Target    2017   (n=12)      Female    50%    42%      Under-represented minority    50%    75%      Low-income    50%    100%         c) Develop scientifically-literate, experienced participants:  The 8-week REU experience included regular reading of the relevant literature, lab and field work, presentations, and mentoring from faculty and graduate students, all opportunities that built participants? literacy and experience.  Moreover, students lived on campus in university apartments and had considerable time to interact with mentors and with each other, discussing projects and other science topics.  d) Increase student awareness of environmental and ecological issues  The REU was designed to ensure participants? awareness and understanding of earth and environmental issues was increased.  In part this was accomplished through:  Reading literature relevant to their project; Lab and field work; Workshops; Presentations by faculty and practitioners; Interaction with both their community college peers and Chapman University students working across a range of labs during the REU period.
