<AbstractNarration>This award supports research at the interface of algebraic geometry, arithmetic geometry, and number theory originating in the theory of Diophantine equations. The main objects of study are algebraic varieties, defined by systems of polynomial equations in several variables. Such systems of equations occur throughout mathematics, science, and engineering. The idea of associating discrete or linear invariants to algebraic varieties has been intensively and successfully used in algebraic geometry to understand the properties of algebraic varieties and to classify them. This project aims to employ modern techniques that make use of the geometric properties of the variety to more fully investigate these invariants, which may lead to decisive progress towards the solution of several long-standing problems.  One of the main objectives is to understand to what extent an algebraic variety could be parametrized by independent parameters. In this direction, even the case of cubics -- varieties defined by a single equation of degree 3 in four or more variables -- is far from being completely understood. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project addresses four questions. The first is about birational properties of algebraic varieties. The investigator plans to apply specialization techniques, based on properties of Chow group of zero-cycles, to quadric fibrations over rational surfaces. The second problem concerns Chow groups of cycles on algebraic varieties and the cycle class maps to the cohomology groups: integral aspects of the Hodge and Tate conjectures. These questions can be approached by computing unramified cohomology groups. The project will investigate these and related geometric properties, such as spaces of rational curves on varieties and R-equivalence. The third problem concerns Galois-theoretic invariants and local-global principles over function fields of curves. The cases of particular importance are threefolds over finite fields or abelian varieties. The last problem focuses on properties of classifying spaces of algebraic groups over algebraically closed fields.</AbstractNarration>

This result solved a problem that had been open since 1970th. Methods used by the PI and coauthors have attracted a lot of attention from other researchers, the results were presented at several seminars and conferences on national and international levels.
