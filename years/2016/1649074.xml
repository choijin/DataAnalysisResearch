<AbstractNarration>This workshop will explore key challenges and opportunities for the development of an open data ecosystem for neuroscience. It will bring together experts from academic, government, and other organizations, and is organized around three themes: &lt;br/&gt; 1. Incentives to Share, and What We Could Accomplish &lt;br/&gt; 2. Discoverability to Discovery &lt;br/&gt; 3. Sustainability: How to Fundamentally Change Science&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop is scheduled for July 25-26, 2016, in Washington, D.C.  A resulting roadmap will facilitate alignment and coevolution of new and existing data sharing efforts, and powerful new modes of interdisciplinary discovery.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Generous co-funding is provided by the Divisions of Advanced Cyberinfrastructure (CISE/ACI), Behavioral and Cognitive Sciences (SBE/BCS), and Emerging Frontiers (BIO/EF).</AbstractNarration>

We hope to make this workshop a regular occurrence to forward to goal of creating and ODEN     The most significant results of the meeting were that the experts gathered all thought that developing an international ODEN was possible and had tremendous potential benefits.  A number of participants have embarked on solving some of the technical and logistical issues that were identified (see 2 articles above).  There was also tremendous interest by the participating foundations in furthering this agenda.       1. We have initiated and energized an active working group interested in founding and maintaining an ODEN.  2. We have begun a catalog of complementary efforts that can be leveraged to push this development forward  3.

The overall goal is to dramatically improve the efficiency, accuracy, reproducibility and pace of scientific discovery.  We believe that by changing incentives, improving data discoverability and putting sustainable systems in place, that this could invigorate scientific collaboration world wide and accelerate it.     Results have been published and disseminated to participants at the conference.  The white paper draft has just been sent to the executive board for the workshop, who will review it quickly.  We hope to then disseminate it to conference participants and interested parties in academia, government and the private sector.
