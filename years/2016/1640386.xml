<AbstractNarration>Transitioning later stage cybersecurity research into operational capabilities remains a national priority. Both the 2011 and 2016 Federal Cybersecurity Research and Development Strategic Plans, collaboratively authored by agencies which participate in the NITRD (Networking and Information Technology R&amp;D) program, explicitly identify Transition to Practice (TTP) as a goal set by the Federal agencies that fund Cybersecurity research, including NSF. The 2016 Plan states that agencies should: "Assess barriers and identify incentives that could accelerate the transition of evidence-validated effective and efficient cybersecurity research results into adopted technologies, especially for emerging technologies and threats." This project considers the unique challenges in the transition of large-scale data or analytic results that are embodied as data feeds, distilled threat intelligence, or online portal services. With the growing attention by U.S. agencies in sponsoring cross-disciplinary research from the Data Science and cybersecurity research communities, the study is both timely and important.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Novel security applications can be derived through the use of many newly emerging massively scalable machine learning technologies. Organized cyber-adversaries regularly mount sophisticated large-scale attacks and malware-driven campaigns that target large Universities, research organizations, industries, nations, and even the Internet itself. The dire need for deep reasoning cyber-threat-relevant applications now coincides with the growing availability of massive Internet datasets and the data mining solutions to capitalize on this data. This proposal explores the issues involved in transitioning the results of such large-scale data analytics into practical use.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project was initiated to examine the unique issues that arise from transitioning research-derived large-scale datasets into practical use within the U.S. government and by industry.  Specifically, we have studied various issues that include cost-effectively managing large-scale evolving datasets, providing easy-to-use access for non-technical users, enabling programmatic access to the datasets, and supporting confidentiality for using the datasets. To drive this project, our efforts focused on studying methods to provide data schemas, programmatic interfaces, and online services, to create operational transition experiments using a newly created large-scale research repository of darkweb data extracted from Tor Onion sites.  In the past several years, our researchers have engaged in a U.S. government-sponsored project to develop a method for extracting content from public web services hosted as Tor onion services (an infrastructure that enables anonymous web content publishing, often referred to as the darkweb).  To date, our team has produced one of the largest research repositories of darkweb data, consisting of approximately 200 million text-only page extractions from more than 84K onion sites visited over a 5-year period.  This dataset was found to be of high interest to a wide range of U.S. government organizations, law enforcement, and groups within DoD.  Co-sponsorship by DHS and NSF, this project enabled us to derive an understanding of how this research repository could be migrated into post-research usage scenarios.  Our research project primarily focused on the design of a Web-portal based search and dissemination service.  This web service approach offered a scalable and efficient solution that enabled the project researchers to engage in numerous collaborative experiments and investigation with operational partners within the U.S. government.  For experiments with partners that required a high degree of confidentiality, such as those related to ongoing law enforcement investigations, we also developed an appliance prototype for a self-contained web portal that can be hosted within the user's organization. Because the details of the search queries are stored locally on the appliance, this approach preserves search confidentiality at the expense of increased equipment costs and additional technical expertise for setting up and maintaining the servers.  The web portal was quite successful, and has registered more than 200 users from 50+ U.S. government organizations. The list includes various US agencies such as DHS, SEC, IRS, FBI, Federal National Labs, U.S.  Navy, DOJ, ATAC, ATF, US Air Force, US State Dept., US HHS, GAO, and DNI.  Our team also engaged with state- and county-level law enforcement agencies during this study.   Finally, the web portal has been used by non-profit organizations and other anti-malware researchers.       Last Modified: 01/28/2020       Submitted by: Phillip A Porras]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
