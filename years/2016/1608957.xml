<AbstractNarration>In this project funded by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program in the Division of Chemistry, Professors Sarah Tolbert, Benjamin Schwartz, and Yves Rubin of the Department of Chemistry at the University of California, Los Angeles are developing complex molecules that will convert light into separated electrical charges that can drive useful chemical reactions.  In natural systems, such as photosynthesis, the absorption of light energy can be translated efficiently into separated electrical charges.  These charges can then be used to conduct a range of important chemical reactions, and the overall process is called photochemistry.  Using modern synthetic chemistry, Professors Tolbert, Schwartz and Rubin are creating molecules that absorb light efficiently and then separate the electrical charges via a series of cascades across the molecules.  Then, they are examining ways to use those separated charges to do useful chemistry.  In the process, they are training a group of graduate students in interdisciplinary science. Those students are further working to share their knowledge of photochemistry and photochemical technologies with a broad range of middle and high school students in the greater Los Angeles area. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Professors Tolbert, Schwartz and Rubin are studying ways to create and exploit artificial electron transfer cascades using strongly absorbing pi-conjugated polymers and molecules. The principal challenges in producing artificial electron transfer cascades are first to create well-defined donor/acceptor pairs and second to place additional acceptors with progressively lower LUMOs at precise positions so that their energy gradient leads to spatial separation of the initially created charge pair.  The cascades are being constructed starting with amphiphilic, water-soluble pi-conjugated polymers that assemble into networks of electrically-interconnected micelles. The conjugated polyelectrolytes are then assembled with charged C60 derivatives or other pi-conjugated acceptors.  The structure of the assembly and the energetics of both the polymer donor and the pi-conjugated electron acceptor are being tuned.  The electron transfer cascades are being characterized using ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy, and the structures are being correlated with the observed photochemical properties.  Optimized assemblies are being adapted for use as photosensitizers in reduction reactions.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[      The goal of this research effort was to use conducting plastics, also called conjugated polymers, to create synthetic systems that mimic some of the positive aspects of biological photosynthesis.  In plants, light shines on the photosynthetic reaction complex and the energy is used to strip an electron off one molecule and pass it on to a neighboring molecule.  The electron is then passed from molecule to molecule and eventually used for chemical energy.  This efficient process relies on precise placement of the organic molecules in the photosynthetic complex to both free an electron using light, and to allow for efficient motion of electrons within the complex.  The intellectual merit of work from this NSF project focused on recreating two separate aspects of this system. In the first place, new materials were designed and synthesized that could spontaneous assemble in water into complexes that allow an electron to be removed from one molecule and transferred to another after exposure to light. This involved first creating ‘soap-like’ versions of conducting plastics that could dissolve in water and then spontaneously assemble into nanometer-sized filaments of well aligned conducting plastic chains.  These filaments served to absorb the light, and during this project, new plastics were synthesized that effectively absorbed much of the light from the sun.  To use sunlight to create a free electron, ‘soap-like’ small molecules were also synthesize that could take the electron after absorption of light.  The results included developing an understanding of the structures of all of the molecules in the water, and determining what types of small molecules most easily collected electrons from the conducting plastics.       The second challenge is to efficiently move electrons along the conducting plastics.  To study this effect, chemical methods were used to add or subtract electrons from the plastics, and then to look at how easily the charges moved.  Because it is not possible to have a positive charge without a negative charge nearby, experiments were devised to examine the role of the balancing charge, called a counterion, in controlling electron conductivity.  It was shown that when the counterion was large, so that it could not get too close to the conducting electron, the conductivity of the plastic was dramatically improved.  The research thus provided a framework for how to make plastics that could efficiently conduct electricity.  Combining both halves of the project provides a blueprint for how to separate electrons from light absorbing conducting plastics and then efficiently move them through the material.  This combination with be the focus of future research.       The broader impacts of this NSF supported work focused on public science education.  The majority of faculty and students support were involved in an education programs, hosted by the California NanoSystems Institute (CNSI) at UCLA and directed by the principle investigator, which was aimed at bringing nanoscience concepts to students from across the greater LA area.  Through workshops for teachers, public outreach events, summer programs for high school students, and entrepreneurship competitions, LA area student got a chance to experience many of the exciting concepts described above, including patterning at the nanoscale, self-assembly of molecules, and nanoscale conductors.
