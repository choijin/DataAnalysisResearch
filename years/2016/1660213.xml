<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this SBIR Phase II project will be the enhanced ability to monitor NOx optically using a unique approach that is fundamentally different from voltage biased solid electrolyte diffusion technology deployed commercially today. NSF Phase I activities brought to light the shortcomings of existing sensor technology, including slow response time and up to 90% "garbage data" that OEMs and regulatory authorities have to work around. Phase II efforts include improvement of Phase I prototypes where near instantaneous NOx detection to ~200 ppm was observed. NOx are a major pollutant and precursor to acid rain, surface ozone and smog formation. Worldwide regulatory bodies are driving NOx regulations to increasingly stringent levels, thus presenting even greater challenges for real-world emissions. Addressing these regulations, industry must deploy after-treatment technologies including selective catalyst reduction systems and lean NOx traps. Both of these technologies will benefit from a less expensive, more robust, and faster responding NOx sensor. With continued success, the new NOx sensor has the potential to significantly reduce emissions levels through a more accurate and much faster detection than current NOx detection techniques thus allowing the internal combustion engine to directly employ detection feedback to enhance emission controls.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will continue the prototyping and characterization of an optical based Nitrogen Oxides (NOx) sensor technology not based on oxygen sensor derivatives found in the market today. We will further optimize the design and materials needed for a novel thermo-catalytic NOx sensing mechanism through continued experimentation and testing. Increasing the number and type of catalytic sensing elements and integrating them into existing OEM packaging will allow us to measure NOx as well as other gases including ammonia (NH3). Sensor calibration equations and response lookup-tables will help validate our new method for NOx detection with successful results creating the foundation of a new category of sensors based on this differential detection architecture. Current automotive NOx sensors do not meet response time, accuracy and price requirements as used in the industry where such parameters are critical. The Phase II will optimize the optical sensing mechanism, and planned designs of experiment will help refine this technology into a reliable and robust device. Besides NOx and NH3, our "inorganic taste buds" also derive carbon monoxide and unburned hydrocarbon concentration as a byproduct of the measurement process, thus providing additional utility for any combustion emissions control application.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ 1.1           High Level Overview  The NSF has sponsored the development of Multicore Photonics NOx/NH3 exhaust sensor since 2016. Our sensor leverages the combined thermal response of individually coated temperature sensing elements which have been applied with various catalytic materials.  Each individual sensor element is sensitive to various reactive gases present in an exhaust stream but each responds differently due to the uniqueness of its composition. It's the combined response of all the themocatalytic sensing elements to form a calibration map of reasonable fidelity that quantifies the concentrations of constituent components of interest in an unknown gas flow in a controlled environment, such as an internal combustion engine exhaust; furthermore there are additional features not available in current OEM NOx sensors relating to light-off time and response time.  1.2          Fundamental Operational Principles  The fundamental operational principle of the Multicore Photonics NOx/NH3 Sensor is the themocatalytic response which is present in any catalytic reaction. These catalytic reactions are capable of being both endothermic or exothermic relative to an uncoated reference sensing element.  The nature of this reaction depends on several factors such as catalyst selection, catalytic surface loading, surface area, catalyst temperature, or concentration of reaction promoters present in the gas stream.  As such, for an unsteady gas flow with changing concentrations of constituents, it is possible to measure the change in the reaction temperature to measure the change in concentrations within the gas stream.  This method utilizes catalysts or mixtures of catalysts which are sensitive to the constituent gases of interest (NOx, NH3, CO) which are present in an unknown flow composition and the individual response of these sensing elements is aggregated and used to generate a unique "fingerprint" which is able to disambiguate the concentrations of the constituent gases in the flow stream.  Individually the catalytic elements may respond to the multiple constituents in the gas stream however they are selected such that the combined response is unique for the expected constituents in an exhaust stream.  Thus, this technology is capable of being tailored to many applications with the assumptions that a) the catalytic element can be heated to allow the reactions to occur in the sensing environment, and b) the constituent gas of interest is reactive with the catalytic materials. The image below summarizes this process for an unknown inlet gas flow.     1.3          General Applications  This sensor technology can be easily applied to any unknown flow with reactive constituent components in the stream.  Thus far Multicore has identified the following gas components to which the sensor is sensitive, NOx (NO+NO2), NH3, CO, C2H6; however other catalysts or blends of catalysts could provide sensitivity to other constituent gases as well.  These gases are all present in diesel automotive exhaust with the exception of C2H6, however other unburned hydrocarbons of a similar structure are present and would likely present dectability as well.  The comparative simplicity to existing electrochemical sensors employed in the automotive industry to detect NOx/NH3in the exhaust environment gives this technology strength with regards to implementation costs in these environments.  It is worth noting that the configuration of this sensor can easily be changed to detect different constituent gases in other areas of the diesel exhaust stream or to apply the technology to other types of internal combustion engines (gasoline, LPG, LNG, etc.).  As the sensor always relies on an uncoated reference element the exhaust temperature at the location of the sensor will always be available in addition to the constituent gas component concentrations.     1.4          Algorithmic Overview  This sensor technology can be configured in different ways to detect different species of interest in a gas flow of unknown concentration.  For the best accuracy in detecting these constituent gases it is required that a representative dataset of the environment in which the sensor will be deployed is used to generate the "map" of themocatalytic inputs to their constituent gas concentration outputs.  This map will be unique by application type but should be similar for each sensor deployed in that application.  For example, a sensor map that is generated based on 8-cylinder diesel engines to detect NOx/NH3 should be capable of detecting NOx/NH3in all 8-cylinder diesel engines with a reasonable accuracy. If the engine is changed to a 4-cylinder it is possible that the developed map will need to be reconfigured to better capture the volume and concentration of NOx/NH3 which are seen during operation.  This map has been integrated onto low cost deployed microcontroller solutions with successful calculation speeds at 10 Hz with minimal impact on microcontroller resource overhead.  The calibrated models with their relatively simple algorithms are capable of being utilized with a developed sensor control unit or directly deployed onto the automobiles ECU where the calculations can be completed while simplifying the overall system architecture.     This technology has a bright future!       Last Modified: 04/30/2019       Submitted by: Christian Adams]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
