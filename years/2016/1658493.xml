<AbstractNarration>Cognitive Computational Neuroscience (CCN) is an annual scientific meeting for neuroscientists characterizing the neural computations that underlie complex behavior. The goal is to develop computationally defined models of brain information processing that explain rich measurements of brain activity and behavior. Such models will ultimately have to perform feats of intelligence such as perception, internal modelling and memory of the environment, decision-making, planning, action, and motor control under naturalistic conditions. Historically, different disciplines have met subsets of these goals. Cognitive science has developed computational models at the cognitive level to explain aspects of complex behavior. Computational neuroscience has developed neurobiologically plausible computational models to explain neuronal responses to sensory stimuli and certain low-dimensional decision, memory, and control processes. Cognitive neuroscience has mapped a broad range of cognitive processes onto brain regions. Artificial intelligence has developed models that perform feats of intelligence. The community must now put the pieces of the puzzle together, and CCN is unique in its focus on the intersection between these fields. CCN is envisioned not only as an engine for advancing research, but as a vehicle for making broader impacts on education and society. As evidenced by the recent trend of major corporate acquisitions of AI startups founded by neuroscientists, biological inspiration for electronics and software development is a growing trend with significant economic implications. In its early stages, the broader impact focus of CCN will be on increasing the visibility of women and scientists from underrepresented populations via speaking opportunities and travel awards.  In addition, representation on women on the female fractions on the steering and advisory committees exceed those typical in relevant fields, without compromise in qualifications. Conferences will include hands-on tutorials, and materials from these will propagate to various university curricula.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A central goal of neuroscience is to understand how vast populations of neurons give rise to complex behavior. Today, advances in various domains offer tangible possibilities to make fundamental conceptual breakthroughs. From an experimental point of view, neural recording technologies, such as high-resolution fMRI, dense recording arrays, magnetoencephalography (MEG), and calcium imaging, now provide opportunities to observe neural activity at unprecedented resolution and scale. At the same time, research in cognitive science has become increasingly sophisticated in identifying computational principles that may serve as the basis for human cognition, and machine learning and artificial intelligence have made great strides in building models to autonomously solve complex cognitive tasks. However, interactions among these distinct disciplines remain rare. This new conference may stimulate unifying frameworks that fully realize the cross-disciplinary potential of these individual advances. In more concrete terms, the goal of CCN is to create and foster a community that will develop models of brain information processing with several key features. These models should (1) be fully computationally defined and implemented in computer simulations; (2) be neurobiologically plausible; (3) explain measurements of brain activity (and continue to do so as spatiotemporal resolution and scale improve); (4) explain behavior for naturalistic stimuli and tasks; and (5) perform feats of intelligence such as recognition, internal modelling and representation of the environment, decision-making, planning, action, and motor control. Such models currently do not exist and are unlikely to emerge without greatly improved cross-disciplinary engagement.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Understanding how complex cognitive processes are carried out by the brain is a problem that is bigger than any one discipline.  Historically, distinct disciplines have attacked different aspects of the problem, often in isolation.  In particular, although computational neuroscience, cognitive science, and artificial intelligence have overlapping long-term objectives, opportunities for interaction among them are currently quite limited.  The goal of this project was to launch an annual conference series to bring together researchers from these fields to share results, methods, and theories pertaining to the neural computations that make complex intelligent behavior possible.  The first Conference on Cognitive Computational Neuroscience (CCN) was held in New York City, September 6-8, 2017.  Attended by over 600 scientists from around the world, the inaugural CCN conference began the hard work of establishing a common set of concepts, tools, and success benchmarks needed to unite the three disciplines behind their shared goal.  Research presented at CCN is freely available to public.  All abstracts and talks are archived at the CCN website (ccneuro.org/2017/).  CCN was also successful in its educational mission of training a new generation of interdisciplinary researchers in the domain of Cognitive Computational Neuroscience.  Thanks to the support of the NSF, twelve female and twelve male student scientists were able to attend and present their work at CCN.
