<AbstractNarration>One of the more challenging scientific questions for anthropologists and psychologists has been whether resources that human beings draw upon for their survival and resilience are situationally and culturally specific, or conform to universal patterns. One way to test this question is by asking whether there are temporal or spatial differences among a group of individuals with respect to their resilience to similar stressors.  This exploratory project examines whether the development of cultural (collectively produced) resources and practices for resilience vary geographically and across generations. Having a better scientific explanation for the variables that influence resilience will help scholars and policymakers understand whether these systems are sustainable or dangerously stressed.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Charles Price and Dr. Dorothy Holland of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill will explore elicit, record, and analyze the cultural resources that African-American men in the United States use to enable their resilience in managing the difficulties that emerge from socioeconomic inequality. Resources for resilience are defined as the cultural knowledge, strategies, identities, people, and institutional supports that Black men summon to negotiate what they see as challenges to their well-being.  The researchers will employ life narrative interviews, prompted group discussions, participant observation, ethnographic community-based tours, and personal document elicitation to document this knowledge and to determine where the men learned or developed these resources. The study will focus on comparative cohorts of young and older Black men from Hartford, Connecticut, and Greensboro, North Carolina. The research is collaborative, engaging study participants in the development of research questions, and is designed to answer social scientific questions about the importance of race and identity in African-American men's resilience and about the extent to which cultural resources are historically and spatially specific.  Ultimately, the research should advance our understanding of resilience and race in the United States. A social scientific purpose of immediate application is to determine whether Black men's individual and collective know-how for resilience can be identified and supported. In addition to broadening the participation of underrepresented groups in the sciences, the responds to emergent interests in durable inequalities and race in the United States, exemplified by My Brother's Keeper Task Force Report to the President (2014), and innumerable nonprofit initiatives. The research will aid researchers and stakeholders  in understanding the generational, spatial, and cultural nature of resilience in relation to Black men during current times. The research will produce knowledge useful to government agencies, scholars, and educational and clinical practitioners.</AbstractNarration>

We wanted to learn what Black men see as challenges and barriers to their well-being and prosperity, and to identify what knowledge, people and cultural resources they summon in negotiating challenges and barriers. We propose that cultural resources for resilience have historical and regional specificity.      We concentrated on two groups of young Black men of today who have grown up in the "neoliberal era" (26-34 years old) compared with two groups of older Black men from the "Civil Rights era" (62-74 years). One group of men live in the southeastern United States and the other in the northeastern United States (US). We wanted to determine whether younger and older Black men from one city in the southern US region (Greensboro, North Carolina) were learning and developing different resources for resilience than younger and older Black men from a city in the northern region (Hartford, Connecticut).   We were also interested in other differences between the groups of men.     Three research questions guided this exploratory project:  What      knowledge, practices, and identities are younger and older Black men      developing as personally meaningful in responding to challenges they      understand as accompanying being Black and male in the USA?   What      institutions, community sources, and relationships are younger and older      Black men in the southeastern and northeastern USA drawing upon and      contributing to as they construct bases for survival, resilience, and      agency?   Drawing      upon the findings of the study, what would be necessary for the cultural      resources identified by the research to be made available to Black men not      in the study?  I.e., how might the findings constitute material      for a community-based knowledge product useful to people beyond the      communities of the study participants?        We collected data in the form of 1) in-depth interviews, 2) prompted Group Discussions, 3) participant-designed Ethnographic Tours/Photographs of participant communities, 4) Personal Documents, and 5) Participant Observation.     In each site we worked with community-based organizations to recruit participants and conduct interviews.

Other preliminary findings include:   *Sources of adversity: incarceration; death of intimates; poor health; substance abuse; unemployment and underemployment; violence; schooling; low wealth; conviction record; emotionally upsetting experiences of interpersonal and structural racism   *Generational patterns: a disconnect between younger and older men; minimal interaction with White people    *Cultural resources for resilience: teachers; organized sports; community organizations; self-reinforcing beliefs that facilitate handling adversity; racially-encoded cultural memes; social networks, relatives in particular; inspiring narratives of how other people overcame adversity; participation in pro-Black organizations; belief in a God  *Experience of racial inequity and racial difference: racialized interpersonal encounters early in life; access to healthcare, physical and mental; discrimination; seemingly unfair treatment by law enforcement and social service providers; pursuit of education      The pilot data we created for this study will contribute to a better understanding of how men fashion racial and masculine identities through interaction of self-understandings, activities, relationships, institutions, place, and history.
