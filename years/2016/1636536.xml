<AbstractNarration>Youth Homelessness: Street Kids in the Urban South&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;LGBTQ youth are estimated to make up at least 40 percent of the youth homeless population in the United States, despite being only about 5-8 percent of the U.S. youth population. In conducting interviews and ethnographic field research, this study examines how LGBTQ become homeless, their specific needs, and their interactions with other people as being both LGBTQ and homeless. Through uncovering the day-to-day experiences and distinct issues affecting LGBTQ homeless youth, this project will examine how gender and sexuality within the contexts of poverty affect how young people become and experience homelessness. This research also adds a new spatial context - the urban South - to the literature on LGBTQ people more generally. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The "new homelessness" is a visible marker of the poverty and growing income inequality that has followed the neoliberal economic re-structuring of society. Little research examines how larger social forces that marginalize LGBTQ people may also contribute to the new homelessness, in particular, the new youth homelessness. This gap is especially critical because LGBTQ homeless youth disproportionately make up the youth homeless population in the United States. In conducting ethnographic fieldwork at a homeless youth drop-in center and at a LGBTQ youth homeless shelter, this study asks about the particular processes associated with youth homelessness, gender, and sexuality today. Compared to the Northeast, West coast, and Midwest where most studies on LGBTQ life take place, this study occurs in a Southern state where there are less favorable views of LGBTQ civil rights, and a lack of protections for LGBTQ people in the workplace, in housing, or in other accommodations. This lack of support for LGBTQ and low-income people provides an under-examined, social and economic climate in which to study youth homelessness, gender and sexuality in the urban South.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Around 2 million youth experience homelessness each year, and LGBTQ youth are estimated to make up at least 40 percent of the population of youth experiencing homelessness in the United States, despite being about 5-8 percent of the U.S. youth population. Based upon an 18-month, multi-site ethnographic study and 50 in-depth interviews, this project turns to LGBTQ youth experiencing homelessness to document the youth&rsquo;s views on life before experiencing homelessness as well as their current needs and challenges while navigating the streets and shelters. In this project, I foreground how gender non-conformity and its intersections with sexuality, race, and poverty are the tapestry weaving through many of the young people&rsquo;s stories and how they understand their experiences of homelessness. I show how the family and other institutions (i.e., schools, child welfare systems, religious communities, and the criminal legal system) discipline, punish, and criminalize the youth&rsquo;s gender non-conforming presentation and behaviors. The abuse and punishment within these institutions were often linked to the youth&rsquo;s perceived pathways into homelessness later in life. Once experiencing homelessness, the gender non-conforming LGBTQ youth often faced challenges on the streets because of their gender presentation and behaviors, but the LGBTQ youth felt protected and accepted for their gender non-conformity within a specific LGBTQ shelter. At the same time, sexuality was a resource on the streets, but sexuality was regulated in the shelter to the point that many youth at the shelter often got suspended for violating shelter rules. This gender and sexuality paradox kept the youth in this study cycling between the streets and the shelter, but not achieving and maintaining housing stability. Ultimately, this dissertation proffers a new understanding of homelessness and how gender and sexuality shape experiences of poverty and being a poor young LGBTQ person. I contend that as homelessness is about a cultural and moral status position in society, and hence, is about the devaluation of certain lives, then LGBTQ youth homelessness is about demeaning and demoralizing certain gender non-conforming poor LGBTQ youth, especially youth of color, as unworthy and unprotected by society.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 06/13/2017<br>      Modified by: Brandon&nbsp;A&nbsp;Robinson</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
