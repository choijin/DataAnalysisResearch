<AbstractNarration>Working memory is the ability to actively maintain, manipulate, and retrieve relevant information during everyday tasks. An individual's working memory functioning is strongly and positively related to important outcomes such as intelligence, reading comprehension, mathematic proficiency, and resistance to distraction. An important question is what specific cognitive processes can explain why working memory is so critical for these diverse aspects of behavior. A related question is whether increasing a person's working memory functioning via computerized memory exercises will lead to improvements not just in working memory but also in related outcomes, such as intelligence and reading comprehension. This research project will provide the foundation for new theoretical perspectives about working memory that have the potential to drastically alter the future of cognitive training research and commercialization. The information gained via this project comes at a critical juncture, as the public, K-12, and medical use of computerized cognitive training is increasing, along with recent estimates of billions of US dollars spent on such computerized training. The investigators will provide workshops and lectures to students, faculty, community members, and K-12 teachers and administrators, both in-person and via Internet-based materials. In addition, the project will provide a variety of hands-on research opportunities for graduate, undergraduate, and high school students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will investigate a novel approach to cognitive training, by first identifying specific working memory strengths and weaknesses in a large sample of young adults, and then developing specific cognitive training exercises that target an individual's working memory functioning. This approach differs from the typical one-size-fits-all method of cognitive training that does not consider the individual's particular cognitive profile. Before and after training, participants will complete various cognitive tests designed to assess whether the training leads to very specific improvements (i.e., outcomes similar to the training program) or broader improvements (i.e., intelligence, reading comprehension). The design of the project will provide the strongest and clearest evidence yet about the potential utility of working memory training to produce meaningful changes in working memory, intelligence, and reading comprehension.</AbstractNarration>

In Phase 1 of the project we examined variation in working memory capacity and the association between working memory capacity and higher-order cognition (fluid intelligence and reading comprehension).  This was accomplished via a large structural equation modeling study in which we had over 900 participants perform multiple measures of working memory capacity, primary memory, secondary memory, attention control, fluid intelligence, and reading comprehension along with strategy reports for the fluid intelligence measures.  The results from Phase 1 demonstrated the three proposed working-memory sub-components (capacity, attention control, and secondary memory) partially explained why working-memory capacity is related to fluid intelligence and reading comprehension.  These results additionally demonstrated the importance of examining variation in strategies in order to understand these associations.  Furthermore, the Phase 1 results demonstrated that there is substantial heterogeneity in the underlying mechanisms producing low working memory capacity in certain individuals.  That is, there are multiple ways for someone to be considered low in working memory capacity with some individuals primarily having deficits in secondary memory and others having deficits in attention control or primary memory.   Results from Phase 1 have been presented at multiple scientific conferences and are currently being written up for publication.   In Phase 2 of the project we examined working memory training interventions based on the different sub-components of working memory capacity. These interventions were compared against individuals receiving working memory training-as-usual and an active-control group.  Each participant had to complete 15 training sessions, and 2 additional pretest/posttest sessions.  Data collection for Phase 2 has been delayed due to our laboratories being shut down due to COVID-19.  Once in person data collection is safe, we plan on resuming data collection for Phase 2.  At the conclusion of Phase 2, the expectation is to have established the potential efficacy of an individualized working-memory training intervention to manipulate working memory, fluid intelligence, and reading comprehension functioning.
