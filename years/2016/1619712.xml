<AbstractNarration>The first international workshop on ctenophore biology will be held at the Whitney Laboratory for Marine Bioscience in St. Augustine, FL on March 14-15, 2016. This meeting will bring together researchers studying the biology of ctenophores.  Ctenophores, also known as comb jellies, are a group of animals found in nearly all marine environments (coastal and oceanic, deep sea as well as surface waters). Most species are planktonic and move by the beating of eight ciliary bands, which is the distinct morphological character uniting the group. Recent biogeographic and evolutionary findings, as well as published genomic resources and access to deep water have brought a great deal of attention to these animals, resulting in a revived research activity. The purpose of this international ctenophore workshop is to bring together the burgeoning community of ctenophore biologists, foster cross-disciplinary collaborations, discuss improvements and expansion of community resources, and share expertise relating to field, experimental, and culture techniques. Furthermore, the workshop has been designed to foster interactions between junior scientists (undergraduate and graduate students and postdoctoral researchers) and senior researchers to inspire the next generation of ctenophore biologists to identify and take on the big open questions that can only be answered by studying ctenophores. The recent influx of interest in these fascinating and important animals presents an opportunity to explore future directions and address some of the challenges for expansion of ctenophore research. This will be the first meeting completely dedicated to studying ctenophores, and the results will be published in an open-access journal to facilitate the broadest possible distribution of ideas generated during this workshop.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recent studies suggest that ctenophores are the sister group to all other animals and as such, are a critical group for understanding the biology of the last common ancestor of all animals. These findings have been corroborated by analyses of the complete nuclear genomes of two ctenophores. The availability of these data and the implications of the phylogenetic position (e.g., independent origin or loss of neural cell types within animals) have captured the attention of a wide audience, and research on these animals has grown. Although interest in ctenophores continues to grow, these animals remain relatively poorly studied and often misrepresented. Thus, it is important to identify ways to improve and expand community resources, as well as share expertise relating to culturing and experimental techniques. The workshop will bring together researchers from a variety of fields (e.g., taxonomy, ecology, neurobiology, evodevo, and behavior) to identify ways to improve resources, to foster collaborations, and to promote cross-disciplinary approaches to studying these unique creatures.</AbstractNarration>

There were 50 accepted abstracts, 26 oral presentations, and 24 posters. Sessions included: (1) Fossils/diversity/phylogeny, (2) Nerve and muscle cells, (3) Ecology/behavior/taxonomy, (4) Metagenomics/slime, (5) Genes/cells/development, (6) Evolutionary genomics, (7) Benthic ctenophores, and (8) a closing keynote, which included a perspective on the phylogenetic position of ctenophores as well as future calls to action for the ctenophore community. These calls to action included an appeal to stop shoehorning ctenophore biology into cnidarian and bilaterian biology, better communication on why ctenophores are interesting with an emphasis on how they differ from other animals, to meet again in the next few years, and to seek out the unique biology of ctenophores.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Two poster sessions were each opened with 2-minute lightning talks where each presenter gave an overview of their poster.

Two posters even included tanks with live benthic ctenophores!</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The future of ctenophorology is bright. A discussion during the last session of the meeting led to ideas on important topics for future research centering around the remarkable biology of these animals. Some examples of topics put forward were: bioluminescence, macrocilia (e.g., the &ldquo;teeth&rdquo; of <em>Beroe</em>), colloblasts, the statolith, unipolar cleavage, male/female pronuclear fusion, non-polarized neurites, a Hox-free primary body axis, and invasive biology. It will be important to establish a powerful experimental model ctenophore that can be used to address many of these topics. <em>M. leidyi</em> is the most obvious choice given the accessibility of these animals, as well as the availability of a high-quality genome and established experimental techniques. The implementation of these techniques in other ctenophores should also not be far off and will be important for addressing comparative questions. The establishment of new experimental techniques in ctenophores combined with the influx of new ctenophorologists will lead to a greater understanding of both the unique and shared characteristics of these fascinating animals. We look forward to witnessing first hand the growth of ctenophore biology and comparing the scope and magnitude of this inaugural meeting to future Ctenopaloozas.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 05/02/2017<br>      Modified by: Joseph&nbsp;F&nbsp;Ryan</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1619712/1619712_10407118_1493735182825_ctenopalooza_program_cover--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1619712/1619712_10407118_1493735182825_ctenopalooza_program_cover--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Ctenopalooza program cover"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1619712/1619712_10407118_1493735182825_ctenopalooza_program_cover--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Ctenopalooza program cover"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Ctenopalooza program cover</div> <div class="imageCredit">Joseph Ryan</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Creative Commons</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Joseph&nbsp;F&nbsp;Ryan</div> <div class="imageTitle">Ctenopalooza program cover</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1619712/1619712_10407118_1493734600494_breitbart--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1619712/1619712_10407118_1493734600494_breitbart--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Mya Breitbart Presentation"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1619712/1619712_10407118_1493734600494_breitbart--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Mya Breitbart Presentation"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Mya Breitbart Presentation</div> <div class="imageCredit">Scott Santagata</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Creative Commons</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Joseph&nbsp;F&nbsp;Ryan</div> <div class="imageTitle">Mya Breitbart Presentation</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1619712/1619712_10407118_1493735004541_poster--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1619712/1619712_10407118_1493735004541_poster--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Moorhead and Forston Poster"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1619712/1619712_10407118_1493735004541_poster--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Moorhead and Forston Poster"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Award winning poster from University of Miami undergraduates included live benthic ctenophores</div> <div class="imageCredit">Joseph Ryan</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Creative Commons</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Joseph&nbsp;F&nbsp;Ryan</div> <div class="imageTitle">Moorhead and Forston Poster</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1619712/1619712_10407118_1493735107208_Tour_of_Whitney_Facilities--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1619712/1619712_10407118_1493735107208_Tour_of_Whitney_Facilities--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Tour"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1619712/1619712_10407118_1493735107208_Tour_of_Whitney_Facilities--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Tour"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Tour of Whitney Lab by Ctenopalooza participants</div> <div class="imageCredit">Joseph Ryan</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Creative Commons</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Joseph&nbsp;F&nbsp;Ryan</div> <div class="imageTitle">Tour</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1619712/1619712_10407118_1493733019638_Ctenopalooza_groupshot_hires--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1619712/1619712_10407118_1493733019638_Ctenopalooza_groupshot_hires--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Attendees"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1619712/1619712_10407118_1493733019638_Ctenopalooza_groupshot_hires--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Attendees"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">75 researchers representing 12 countries</div> <div class="imageCredit">Scott Santagata</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Creative Commons</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Joseph&nbsp;F&nbsp;Ryan</div> <div class="imageTitle">Attendees</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
