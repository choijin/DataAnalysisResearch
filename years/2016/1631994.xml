<AbstractNarration>This research project will investigate whether working memory has an impact on the responses participants provide on survey questionnaires.  Working memory is a cognitive system that provides both the limited storage for relevant information and the temporary processing needed to perform ongoing mental tasks.  When individuals participate in a survey, for each question presented, the participant must remember the question and response options while formulating a response.  This research will extend the current understanding of the impact of working memory on participants' response selections in questions about attitudes.  The research will contribute new knowledge about the cognitive aspects of survey methodology.  The results may have implications for the design of questionnaires and could be of particular importance to large, nationally representative surveys like the Health and Retirement Study (HRS), where it is essential to measure cognitive functioning. As a Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement award, support is provided to enable a promising student to establish a strong, independent research career.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will collect new data through administering a survey to a random sample of Nebraska residents.  Three research questions will be addressed with this data:  1) Does working memory impact question order and response order effects?  The project will assess whether these effects are consistent across high and low working memory capacity groups for younger and older participants.  2) Is the impact of working memory on question-order effects and response-order effects consistent across two modes of survey administration, telephone and web?  To examine this question, the same set of questions will be administered in a telephone survey and web survey.  3) How do participants compare across two different sets of memory measures?  A subset of memory measures from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) will be included in the survey to compare with other questions designed to specifically measure working memory capacity.  The data will be analyzed using statistical methods such as chi-square tests and logistic regression.</AbstractNarration>

however, there is little empirical evidence linking working memory and survey context effects.&nbsp; This dissertation examines whether respondents&rsquo; working memory influences response order and question order effects through incorporating working memory measures into the survey questionnaire.&nbsp; The subjects were randomly assigned to complete the survey via telephone or web, and respondents completed a series of working memory measures and attitudinal questions.&nbsp; As expected, we did find a relationship between working memory capacity and age in both telephone (r = -.39, see Figure 1 scatterplot) and web (r = -.17, see Figure 2 scatterplot) modes, with poorer working memory capacity associated with increasing age.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was hypothesized that as working memory capacity improved there would be a decrease in the likelihood of respondents of all ages selecting the options associated with response order effects, that is, selecting the later response options in the telephone mode and the earlier response options in the web mode.&nbsp; Results support the hypothesis for younger adults who became less susceptible to response order effects as working memory improves by selecting earlier response options in the telephone mode (see Figure 3) and later response options in the web mode (see Figure 4), however, for older adults the results adversely indicate that improvement in working memory leads to respondents being more likely to select the early responses in web and late responses in telephone.&nbsp; The results are present for questions with a short list of two responses and for questions with a longer list of six responses.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where question order effects are concerned, it was hypothesized that respondents with higher working memory would be more likely to be influenced by the preceding question than those with low working memory.&nbsp; In general the results provide only modest support that working memory has a significant impact on question order effects.&nbsp; In only one of three pairs of questions analyzed did working memory have a significant effect indicating that respondents with higher working memory are more likely to exhibit contrast effects than respondents with lower working memory.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As another objective, this dissertation included a subset of the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) cognitive measures into the survey to assess whether they adequately reflect respondents&rsquo; working memory.&nbsp;
