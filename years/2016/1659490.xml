<AbstractNarration>This REU Site award to the University of Chicago, located in Chicago, IL, will support the training of 9 students for 10 weeks, during the summers of 2017-2020. The program focuses on cellular and molecular biology, that is, understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the organization, development and mechanics of all living organisms. The Department of Molecular Genetics and Cell Biology, which is hosting the program, has about 20 faculty members participating as mentors. The projects available in their laboratories are wide-ranging but all are focused on cutting edge research, using a variety of model organisms including viruses, bacteria, yeast, protozoa, fruit flies, plants, and nematode worms, and involving both biological manipulation and observation, and mathematical modeling. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is anticipated that a total of 36 students, all from schools with limited research opportunities, will be trained in the program. Students will engage in full-time lab research as well as participate in seminars and focused workshops on responsible conduct in research and scientific ethics, on how to prepare for advanced training in biological sciences, and on professional communication skills. REU students have access to the individual mentor's facilities as well as many core facilities such as advanced light microscopy, electron microscopy and tomography, next-generation DNA sequencing, and flow cytometry. Students are selected by an REU steering committee, on the basis of their academic record and perceived potential for outstanding research. The program is not appropriate for students who are planning to attend medical school.  Students will learn how research is conducted, and many will present the results of their work at scientific conferences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A common web-based assessment tool used by all REU Site programs funded by the Division of Biological Infrastructure will be used to determine the effectiveness of the training program. Students will be tracked after the program in order to determine their career paths. Students will be asked to respond to an automatic email sent via the NSF reporting system.

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ We provided intensive 10 week research internships for a total of 29 students.  Each of the students worked on a closely-mentored project in the Department of Molecular Genetics and Cell Biology, at the University of Chicago.  The students came largely from groups that are under-represented in the sciences, including students from economically-disadvantaged families and students who were the first in their families to pursue higher education.  In addition to their research projects, the students attended a wide range of workshops and lectures, and ot intensive coaching in how to present their own ideas and data in multiple formats.  Workshops included discussions of ethical issues in research, laboratory safety, and how to apply to graduate school, and also included journal clubs in which the students picked and presented papers from the recent literature. Lectures included weekly lectures by faculty, focusing on unresolved questions at the cutting edge of research.  The students also met weekly with one another, togetehr with several members of the REU steering committee, to present their own ongoing work.  At the end of the summer, the students each presented their work at a symposium to the entire department.  A large fraction of the program alumni went on to apply and be accepted to PhD programs in the biological sciences.
