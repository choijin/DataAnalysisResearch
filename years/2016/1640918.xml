<AbstractNarration>Energy-cured (EC) polymer coatings are used extensively to manufacture many product materials such as plastics, inks and adhesives in industries such as automotive, food packaging and printing. Curing is the transformation of monomers and oligomers to a solid, linked polymer network that can perform some desired function in a product or process. In order to form the functional polymer in the manufacturing process, energy is required in the form of UV light, visible light or Electron beam radiation. A large percentage of manufacturing costs are related to creating and using this energy so manufacturers continually search for ways to improve the energy efficiency of these polymerization processes in their operations. This I-Corps team proposes to provide a novel solution to photochemical polymerization. The targeted photopolymers are envisaged to have applications in the development of new high performance, highly aromatic coatings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The EC polymer commercial ecosystem is a large and dynamic space. There are key stakeholders that must be understood in order to identify viable applications for our technology. These include materials (polymer) developers/manufacturers, equipment makers (e.g. lamps and curing systems) and commercial end users (e.g. industrial printers). This team recently attended the UVLED Conference (Troy, NY), sponsored by Radtech, The Association for UV&amp;EB Technology, to find out where these companies fit in the value chain and learn about some of the technical challenges they face. Several of the participants identified energy efficiency, sustainability and environmental concerns as benefits they valued and expressed a willingness to talk at greater length in formal customer discovery interviews. During the I-Corps program, the team intends to speak to a significant number of relevant segment participants in order to understand what needs they have and whether they believe the benefits of the proposed technology could potentially provide tangible value in the form of specific solutions to technical challenges they face.  A significant driver to the investigation is a newly issued patent for the proposed technology since it could enable development of innovative products or solutions to potentially create competitive advantage in the marketplace through cost (e.g. energy) savings, sustainability, and environmental improvements.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The principal goal of this research was the translation of the novel chemical reactivity previously supported by the NSF into the market place.  While we have continued to characterize and refine that chemistry, this funding was awarded to explore the viability of introducing this technology into a competitive environment.  In that regard we have addressed and defined the following:  Societal Impacts.  The ever expanding role of microelectronics in 21st century life is highly dependent upon reduction of the unit cost of computing power.  That cost reduction in turn leads to market expansion and consequentially the enablement of unforeseen applications.  The resultant stimulus yields additional investments in the further advancement of microelectronics continuing the cycle.  The economic impact associated with reduction of device size is a central technology driver in microelectronics.  The technology development supported by this research effort can enable a further expansion of the global role of microelectronics broadly enhancing the quality of life while accelerating income growth independently from the levels of existing economic development.  Such profound effects may be unique to the impact of the microelectronic industry on modern life.  Value Proposition. The imperative to reduce the unit cost of microelectronic devices demands increased microelectronic device density.  Contemporary nanolithographic strategies are intrinsically limited by both wavelength and also the dramatic energy losses imposed by the requirement for the use of reflective masks.  Direct electron-beam lithography, that does not require masks, can overcome wavelength limitations but throughput is currently somewhat less than one percent that of optical lithography.  Dual wavelength lithography can overcome the limitations of device density and throughput but would be most effective with a single resist material that can be patterned by both ultraviolet and electron-beam treatment.  The new resist under development can function as a negative resist under ultraviolet irradiation and as a positive resist on electron-beam treatment.  As a positive resist it can provide line edge roughness required by 7 nm size features.  Enhanced electron-beam sensitivity can, by reduction of the incident beam energy, minimize the device damage inherent to electron-beam exposure.  Innovation.  A novel monomer based on 1,4-bis (chloro-&lambda;6-tetrafluorosulfanyl)arene has been found to be subject to ultraviolet radiation-induced step-growth polymerization with bis-(alkynyl)arenes.  The product polymer is susceptible to fragmentation on electron-beam irradiation as a consequence of the large electron-beam cross section of tetrafluorosulfanyl unit.  The orthogonal properties of the monomer and polymer depend exclusively on the frequency of the light employed enabling the use of a single resist material as a wavelength dependent negative and positive resist.  The polymerization reaction required for utility as a negative resist is promoted rapidly and efficiently at room temperature by ultraviolet light.  The reaction proceeds equally well in solution or as a simple mixture of the components absent solvent.  Chromatographic analyses show that the monomer is quantitatively transformed into a polymer.  Market Opportunity Validation.  For resist development, an appropriate lithographic process tool must be available for an innovative photoresist formulation to gain market acceptance.  A new sensitive resist material paired with a dual wavelength lithography tool may provide the opportunity for a technological leap.  For example, when used in conjunction with a Complementary Electron Beam Lithography tool, in as few as three lithographic steps, the resist could deliver cost reduction value to the foundry.   Customer Benefits.  A single nanolithographic resist tunable to different wavelength exposures can reduce processing time and hence costs.  Contemporary projection patterning requires the use of 40-60 lithography masks to produce as single processor.  The associated material costs are minuscule compared to the expense of the masks.  Typically 4-5 of those masks, each worth as much as $ 250,000, can be particularly challenging to prepare.  Maskless processing steps that employ a dual wavelength resist can enable significant savings in the $500 million to $1 billion served available market for advanced photoresists.  Outcomes.  The support awarded has led to the preparation of three additional grant applications; two applications to IIP as part of the AIR program for addition refinement of the technology under development both entitled "Novel Polymer Resists for Nanolithography" and one collaborative STTR application with a resist supplier, KemLab, entitled STTR Phase I:  Polymer Resists for Nanolithography in Microelectronics.
