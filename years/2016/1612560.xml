<AbstractNarration>The Louis Stokes Alliances for Minority Participation (LSAMP) program assists universities and colleges in diversifying the Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) workforce through the development of highly competitive students from groups historically underrepresented in STEM disciplines:  African-Americans, Alaska Natives, American Indians, Hispanic Americans, Native Hawaiians, and Native Pacific Islanders. The goal of the LSAMP Bridge to the Doctorate (BD) Activity is to increase the quantity and quality of STEM graduate students from underrepresented populations, with emphasis on Ph.D. matriculation and completion.  Academic and professional preparations are essential for building a diverse, dynamic, and innovative STEM workforce in the United States. The challenge of recruiting and retaining students from underrepresented racial/ethnic groups in STEM careers continues to confront the academic community. Oklahoma State University, lead institution of the Oklahoma LSAMP (OK-LSAMP),  is uniquely situated to overcome this challenge due to its centralized location within the state and the prominent presence of Native American tribal nations across Oklahoma, as well as the increase of the Hispanic population, not only in Oklahoma but nationwide. The OK-LSAMP Bridge to the Doctorate (BD) initiative will ensure that a new cadre of STEM professionals from diverse backgrounds is fully prepared for successful careers, in the nation's workforce, including the professoriate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OK-LSAMP-BD will implement: (i) enhanced recruitment strategies, including partnerships with HBCUs and Tribal Colleges, as well as the extensive use of available social media, newsletters, community and national outreach; (ii) mentoring and networking programs across STEM departments; and (iii) courses, workshops, and seminars supporting academic and professional development of the BD Fellows. In addition, a BD Advisory Board of diverse OSU faculty will be responsible for providing input on programmatic activities. Board members will have the opportunity to serve as mentors, presenters at monthly BD meetings, or discussants about common research related topics and key issues in graduate degree attainment.</AbstractNarration>

BD Fellows:  Performed research with world-renown faculty Engaged in conference and symposium presentations Presented research in regional, national, and      international conferences and symposiums Received national scholarships, including the NSF      Graduate Research Fellowship Participated in peer-mentoring to undergraduate LSAMP      scholars Published in peer-reviewed journals, with Fellows      listed as lead authors Earned an average GPA of over 3.0 Earned a STEM graduate degree   - Seven BD fellows successfully completed requirements for and received Master of Science degrees and one completed all requirements for and received a PhD.  Two fellows continue their academic pursuit to complete program and degree requirements and attain a Ph.D.  Six fellows have taken positions in industry or federal agencies following completion of M.S. degree requirements and are not, at this time, pursuing degrees.  One fellow continues to work toward completion of the Master of Science degree.  One fellow received the GRFP.  Two fellows transferred into Medical School to pursue a Doctor of Osteopathic medicine degree.  - Transitioned to funding packages post NSF LSAMP BD award period for all BD fellows continuing onward in their academic programs via fellowships such as NSF GRFP or departmental assistantships (teaching assistantships, research assistantships and/or graduate assistantships).  - Broad dissemination of project outcomes to the larger LSAMP and NSF communities via NSF annual report, ?The Link? OK-LSAMP newsletter, student publications, PhD dissertation, master?s thesis, OSU media outlets, social media, workshops and panel discussions at diversity conferences.
