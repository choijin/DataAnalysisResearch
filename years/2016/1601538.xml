<AbstractNarration>Understanding the ways in which plants modulate their vulnerability to herbivores is central to understanding patterns of biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. Many plants have physical defenses such as spines, thorns, or prickles that protect them against large mammalian herbivores (e.g., elephants, giraffes, deer, and elk); however, producing and maintaining these defenses is energetically costly. As a result, plants that produce more spines and thorns are less vulnerable to herbivory, but also have fewer resources to invest in growth and reproduction, two critical components of plant fitness. This tradeoff is particularly acute for plants in dry or infertile African savannas, where resources (e.g., water and nutrients) are scarce and the risk of being eaten by large herbivores is high. As a result, theory predicts the emergence of strategies that maximize the effectiveness of defenses while reducing their cost. Two such strategies are induced defenses (produced rapidly in response to damage by herbivores) and associational defenses (reduced incidence of herbivory derived from growing in close proximity to a well-defended neighbor). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is to evaluate the relative effectiveness of, and interactions between, these anti-herbivore strategies and to determine how positive associational interactions among plants of different species alter patterns of resource investment. Plants facing the same evolutionary pressures frequently converge on similar suites of defensive characteristics, known as defense syndromes. In African savannas, individuals of the same species can exhibit strongly contrasting defense syndromes depending on their proximity to well-defended neighbors. Plants growing beneath thorny tree canopies, for example, produce fewer spines and exhibit a diminished induced response to simulated herbivory relative to conspecifics growing in open habitat. The researchers hypothesize that this difference is maintained by a disparity in the environmental cues that govern defensive investment in plants and will test this hypothesis using transplant experiments of focal plant species conducted inside and outside of large-herbivore exclosures in the Mpala Research Centre, Kenya. The researchers will also perform surveys of multiple species to evaluate how common intraspecific variation in defense syndrome is across plant taxa. By investigating the biotic and/or abiotic forces that maintain discrete intraspecific defense syndromes, this research will elucidate the independent and interactive effects of different anti-herbivore strategies on plant fitness and help inform the management of rangelands and the conservation of native vegetation in African savannas.</AbstractNarration>

During his funding period, he spent two months at Mpala Research Centre in central Kenya collecting data and samples, and six months working in the vonHoldt lab at Princeton University learning molecular techniques and performing epigenetic analyses on plant samples. The focus of his project was two-fold. First, Coverdale sought to understand how widespread variation in defense investment is within species in a semi-arid African savanna. Second, he sought to understand whether molecular mechanisms underpin observed variation in defense investment in these species. Both questions, in combination with his previous dissertation research, address broader questions related to the evolution and ecology of plant-herbivore interactions in savannas, which cover 20% of the world's land surface area.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Coverdale's first aim was to determine how widespread variation in defense investment is within species at Mpala Research Centre. This core research question arose from earlier experimental work, in which he showed that living in close proximity to neighbors (in this case, well-defended <em>Acacia</em> trees) reduces defense investment in understory plants; relative to individuals of the same species growing in the open habitat between trees, individuals beneath tree canopies produced very few defensive spines and thorns. Prior to receiving the DDIG, Coverdale had noted this pattern in only three, closely-related species in the globally-distributed genus <em>Barleria</em>. During the course of the funding period, Coverdale (assisted by Princeton University undergraduate researchers and Kenyan field assistants) documented identical patterns in nearly every physically-defended plant species at his study site. In so doing, he demonstrated that the patterns he had previously observed were not specific to a certain plant family or genus; in fact, the same patterns were even documented in a recently invasive species.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Coverdale's second aim was to determine whether epigenetic processes, specifically DNA methylation, might explain the striking patterns of defense investment between habitats noted earlier. Using funding from the DDIG, Coverdale collected tissue samples from a single species at Mpala Research Centre and, under the supervision of Bridgett vonHoldt (Princeton University) and Rebecca Kartzinel (Brown University) learned how to perform reduced representation bisulfite sequencing. This technique, which has only recently been developed and has seldom been applied to non-model organisms, allowed him to determine whether a plant's habitat (<em>e.g.</em>, beneath a tree canopy vs. in the open habitat between tree canopies) affects patterns of DNA methylation. Coverdale identified several dozen differentially methylated sites and regions in the <em>Barleria trispinosa</em>&nbsp;genome, many of which fall within stress- and defense-related genes.
