<AbstractNarration>The genetic information in DNA, which is packaged in the form of chromatin, is protected from damage by multiple DNA repair pathways, and understanding how this critical task of DNA repair is performed is the long-term goal of this research. The project will examine real-time changes in chromatin in response to DNA damage in individual living cells with unprecedented spatial and temporal resolution, and thereby determine the significance of chromatin restructuring during DNA repair. In addition to advancing knowledge of DNA damage response and repair mechanisms, the project will develop and apply several innovative technologies that will likely be of great interest to other researchers. The PI and co-PI are committed to disseminating these techniques broadly in the research community. The multidisciplinary nature of this project will provide a unique and valuable training opportunity for graduate students and postdoctoral fellows as well as undergraduate and high school students. They are expected to learn fundamental and cutting-edge techniques relevant to studying DNA repair mechanisms in mammalian cells, including high-resolution imaging. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The chromatin response to DNA damage is highly dynamic and must be regulated to maintain the appropriate architectural organization that promotes high-fidelity DNA repair and preserves genomic integrity. How these chromatin structural dynamics are coordinated with DNA repair is not well understood. The PIs will develop multiplexing novel fluorescence correlation methods including pair correlation spectroscopy (pCF) and nanoimaging tracking techniques to analyze how DNA damage affects chromatin dynamics and how that in turn dictates DNA repair pathway choice. These phenomena will be investigated in response to relatively simple DNA breaks or complex DNA damage lesions induced in different cellular contexts. Aim 1 includes monitoring changes in chromatin access at the damage site, interrogating the relationship to DNA repair pathway choice, and determining responsible factors. Aim 2 involves high-resolution multiplexed analyses of chromatin dynamics at defined DNA double-strand break sites, and investigating the interplay between DNA repair and transcription. An overall goal is also to develop new methods that yield 4D and nanoscale views of chromatin dynamics in single mammalian cells when DNA is damaged, for a quantitative understanding of how the cellular machinery assesses the damage and decides how to repair its genome.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Our goal of the study has been to understand how cells respond to DNA damage.  Genetic information encoded in DNA is stored in the form of chromatin (DNA:protein complexes) in the genome whose integrity is continually threatened by metabolic products generated during normal cellular activities, by errors that arise during copying genetic information to transmit it to the next generation of cells, and by exposure to various genotoxic chemicals and rays. The resulting DNA lesions, if not faithfully repaired, can accumulate as mutations corroding the quality of the genome. To understand the cellular response to DNA damage, much effort has been made to identify factors important for repair of different types of DNA damage, and to understand the molecular mechanisms of repair. However, how different repair mechanisms are coordinated and how the presence of DNA damage signals the cell to coordinate different repair mechanisms and alters cellular functions are still not well understood.  To address these questions, the Yokomori laboratory in collaboration with the Digman laboratory utilized biosensors and cutting-edge fluorescence dynamics imaging in conjunction with optimizing laser microirradiation to precisely induce damage in the submicron region of the nucleus and investigated the high-resolution realtime changes of molecules in response to damage.  Through this project, valuable multi-disciplinary training opportunities were provided to trainees at all levels (high school, undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral, both in-person and as a group) who have learned to harness cutting-edge technologies and think critically of fundamental biology questions.     Our study led to significant findings in three areas: (1) molecular movement at the damage sites and in the whole nucleus, (2) chromatin changes in the nucleus, and (3) metabolic response in the whole cell.  Significantly, our study highlighted the significant role of a DNA damage-sensing enzyme poly(ADP-ribose)polymerease 1.  PARP1 has long been known as a major DNA damage sensor and to be involved in DNA repair in part by inducing phase separation at the damage sites by local poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation (PARylation).  Using high-resolution time course imaging analyses with well characterized different laser conditions, our study revealed that PARP1 gauges the complexity of DNA damage, and alters the chromatin environment at damaged lesions to trigger dynamic recruitment and blocking of different factors, fine-tuning the repair pathway choice.   We also obtained evidence that PARP1 signaling governs global chromatin alteration in the nucleus, which is being further investigated.  Finally, we discovered that PARP1 signaling (thought to be short-lived) triggers the long-term changes of cellular metabolism, shifting the metabolic reliance from glycolysis to oxidative phosphorylation, which is critical for damaged cell survival.  Thus, our project contributed significantly to delineate the complex effects of PARP1 activation that triggers responses at multiple levels (at damage sites, in the nucleus, and in the whole cell) to coordinate and collectively influence the genome maintenance and cell fate determination.
