<AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit: The University of Colorado at Boulder, in collaboration with the University of Texas at Austin, the University of Virginia, and the University of Washington are supporting an extension service project that is synergistically serving the disciplines most in need of help for improving women?s representation: computer science, computer engineering, electrical engineering, and mechanical engineering. At each of 30 institutions, interdepartmental teams of change agents from computer science, computer engineering, electrical engineering, and mechanical engineering departments are being established. In each institution, high-level administrative commitment is elicited. At each ?client? institution, the interdepartmental teams recruit cooperatively for ?net new women,? as opposed to raiding each other?s pool of potential majors. Each department is adopting research-based methods for retaining undergraduate women, such as improved faculty-student interaction, and will be held accountable for initiatives, evaluation, and reporting. Cooperative department teams are supported and guided by a cadre of highly trained and experienced consultants. These train their assigned interdisciplinary teams on proven practices and methods for recruiting and retaining women. In addition, experienced staff and external evaluators will support departments and consultants with tracking and evaluation tools, collect and review periodic progress reports, and recommend improvements. This extension service focuses on reforming departmental and faculty practices in sustainable ways for long-term improvement in their undergraduate gender balance. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The project will significantly raise the number of women of all races and ethnicities who receive bachelor?s degrees in the neediest fields: computer science, computer engineering, electrical engineering, and mechanical engineering. Explicitly including minority-serving institutions will help to meet national diversity goals in these areas. Use of data to identify minority women?s typical major choices will support local recruiting on each campus. The project will bring explicit, widespread attention to the exemplar institutions and document their approaches so that others may emulate their practices.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The overarching goal of the National Center for Women &amp; IT (NCWIT) Extension Services is to overcome underrepresentation of women in the disciplines with the worst record of improving women&rsquo;s representation at the undergraduate level: computer science (CS), computer engineering (CE), electrical engineering (EE), and mechanical engineering (ME). NCWIT Extension Services takes a systemic change approach to increasing women&rsquo;s participation. Changing the educational system experienced by all students is a sustainable approach to overcoming underrepresentation. We promote customized strategies that maximize return on investment, use the least time to see results, have the least impact on resources, and improve the experience for all students. To attract students to computing majors, we recommend that departments target students who can be in the major in the next year or two; inform students and their influencers; leverage existing programs; develop and share persuasive methods for their own and others&rsquo; use; and evaluate what works and what does not to attract women to the major. To retain students, we recommend department-wide efforts that focus on cultivating student-student and student-faculty interaction in classrooms and labs, resulting in greater sense of belonging and the development of professional identity with the field; and develop curriculum, assignments, and examples that are more relevant and meaningful to students.</p> <p>Project Outcomes to Date</p> <p>Systemic change takes time. For example, NCWIT served 32 clients between 2007-2011. In 2016, we observed that these clients awarded 21% of their BS to women, having gone from some of the worst performers nationally to 3% above the national average of 18%. In the five-year Expanding the Pool Project, we have seen positive short-term gains. We combined data using the NCWIT Tracking Tool, into which clients submit data on applications, acceptances, and new enrollments; total declared majors and retention; and graduations. We also use graduation data from the National Center for Education Statistics. We analyzed clients&rsquo; outcomes using a matched analysis of a baseline year immediately prior to consultation (either 2011 or 2013, depending on clients' starting year) and a post-consultation year immediately after (either 2014 or 2016). We found that more and a higher percentage of women students applied to majors, were accepted, actually enrolled, made up the body of declared majors, and graduated even in this short time frame</p> <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">More Women Applied to Client Departments&rsquo; Majors over Baseline</span>. Clients created a strategic recruiting plan in the first year and implemented this plan within one year of beginning. Figure 1 shows that clients successfully marketed their majors to increase applications of women.</p> <p>&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2.5 times more women applied compared to 2 times as many men.</p> <p>&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Women applicants grew from 15% to 18% in just two years.</p> <p>The increase in applicants is due only to improved marketing and outreach efforts, not due to any changes in policy as might be seen with increased acceptances.</p> <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Clients Accepted More Women and a Higher Percentage of Women over Baseline</span>. Facing a huge enrollment boom over the past five years, clients accepted many more students, both men and women, but accepted women at a higher rate than men, as shown in Figure 2.</p> <p>&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2.2 times more women who applied were accepted, compared to 1.6 times as many men between the baseline year and the outcome year.</p> <p>&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Acceptances of women grew from 16% to 20% in just two to three years.</p> <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">More Women Enrolled in Clients&rsquo; Majors</span>. Enrollment yield is the percent of students accepted who actually enroll in the major. The yield of both men and women increased in client departments, but women&rsquo;s yield increased at a higher rate than that of men, shown in Figure 3.</p> <p>&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2.2 times more women enrolled in the majors, while only 1.6 times as many men enrolled over baseline.</p> <p>&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Women made up 17% of newly-enrolled students, up by 4% in two to three years.</p> <p>&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Women also made up 18% of total declared majors after two years, up by 5% from before ES consultation</p> <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">A Lagging Indicator, Graduations Also Increased</span>. Although the time frame studied was too short to see students from first year through graduation, the percentage of women who graduated from the most recent cohorts increased from 2012 to 2016. Many of the clients we worked with during this time period were among the largest producers of bachelor&rsquo;s degrees in computing in the U.S. The larger the major, the smaller the percentage of women, typically. As shown in Figure 4,</p> <p>&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ES clients graduated 2.6 times as many women, but only 1.9 times as many men.</p> <p>&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The percent of women graduates in these departments grew from 13% to 18% over four years.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 11/28/2017<br>      Modified by: Lecia&nbsp;J&nbsp;Barker</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1659759/1659759_10203091_1511912611544_Figure1-Applications--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1659759/1659759_10203091_1511912611544_Figure1-Applications--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 1: Applications"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1659759/1659759_10203091_1511912611544_Figure1-Applications--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 1: Applications"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">More Women Applied to Computing Majors from Baseline to Post-Consultation (source: NCWIT Tracking Tool)</div> <div class="imageCredit">NCWIT</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Lecia&nbsp;J&nbsp;Barker</div> <div class="imageTitle">Figure 1: Applications</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1659759/1659759_10203091_1511913973007_Figure2-Acceptances1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1659759/1659759_10203091_1511913973007_Figure2-Acceptances1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 2: Acceptances"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1659759/1659759_10203091_1511913973007_Figure2-Acceptances1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 2: Acceptances"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Women?s Share of Acceptances Increased from Baseline (source: NCWIT Tracking Tool)</div> <div class="imageCredit">NCWIT</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Lecia&nbsp;J&nbsp;Barker</div> <div class="imageTitle">Figure 2: Acceptances</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1659759/1659759_10203091_1511914026490_Figure3-NewEnrollments--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1659759/1659759_10203091_1511914026490_Figure3-NewEnrollments--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 3: New Enrollments"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1659759/1659759_10203091_1511914026490_Figure3-NewEnrollments--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 3: New Enrollments"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Women?s Share of Newly-Enrolled Majors Increased</div> <div class="imageCredit">NCWIT</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Lecia&nbsp;J&nbsp;Barker</div> <div class="imageTitle">Figure 3: New Enrollments</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1659759/1659759_10203091_1511914088250_Figure4-Graduations--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1659759/1659759_10203091_1511914088250_Figure4-Graduations--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 4: Graduations"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1659759/1659759_10203091_1511914088250_Figure4-Graduations--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 4: Graduations"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Despite Short Time Frame and Enrollment Surge, Clients Increased Graduations of Women (source: National Center for Education Statistics)</div> <div class="imageCredit">NCWIT</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Lecia&nbsp;J&nbsp;Barker</div> <div class="imageTitle">Figure 4: Graduations</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
