<AbstractNarration>The fruit fly Drosophila prolongata exhibits a unique set of sensory organs on the front legs.  This study examines the genomics of their cells to learn how a group of genes is recruited to form a new specialized cell type.  Distinct types of tissues and cells are differentiated by which genes are expressed.  Cells produce their varied functions by turning the genes necessary for these roles on, while keeping other genes off.  Errors in the expression of genes is one cause of developmental disorders and other diseases, yet the mechanisms of expression control are still not well understood. Observing the patterns of the recruitment process will illustrate how a new cell type evolves, how gene expression is controlled in different types of cells and tissue, and why expression control breaks down. This research will expand the training of a graduate student, who also leads public outreach activities at his university and provides research experiences for high school students and undergraduates. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To study the gene recruitment process, the evolutionary history of genes expressed in the novel sensory organs of Drosophila prolongata will be inferred.  The mRNA from forelegs of this and several closely related species will be sequenced.  The gene sequences present in the mRNA reflect which genes are expressed.  These will be filtered based on similarity to sequences of known sensory genes; those present only in D. prolongata samples represent genes that have acquired new tissue specificity.  These genes will be compared to related genes in other fly species, including the well-studied D. melanogaster, to determine what characteristics make genes more malleable to expression shifts.  The evolutionary patterns reflect naturally occurring variation and suggest mechanisms of creating expression control, factors relevant to gene regulation in other organisms.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  One of the ways insects taste is with bristles on their legs and wings.  This project focused on the way newly evolved tasting bristles on the legs of a particular fly species (Drosophila prolongata) acquired the ability to perceive chemical signals.  To understand how this happened we sequenced the genomes of this species and its close relatives, and searched for copies of the genes known to respond to flavor chemicals in other flies.  The species with more tasting bristles also has more copies of these genes.  We think when the species gained more space for these genes to act there was a benefit to having more copies.  Different copies in different bristles can begin to specialize on different chemicals, giving the fly a better sense of taste.  We are still studying the way these new copies have changed to potentially respond to different chemicals.  A gene?s function can also change by changing its level and location of activity.  To measure how gene activity levels changed to give these bristles new abilities we extracted and sequenced the RNA (the "message" sent by the gene) from the legs.  We found many of the genes that hadn?t duplicated were instead active at higher levels in the legs with more tasting bristles.  This shows us there are many kinds of changes that take place when a new sensory organ is being created.    This kind of work is important for many reasons.  For one, insects cause large amounts of public health and economic damage.  When we try to control them with chemicals they can evolve resistance, sometimes through changes in their sensory system.  By studying how these systems evolve in nature we can predict the ways they may respond to avoid a new repellent or pesticide, and be ready to respond.  We are also interested in this question because the collection and modification of groups of genes to produce new functions has played out countless times during the history of life on earth, including in our own ancestors.  By studying how this happens in flies we can imagine how it happened in our own noses, fingers, voice boxes, or even in the newest parts of our brains.  And if we understand how our bodies were built we can better understand how they work, and how to fix them if something goes wrong.  Finally, these projects provide valuable training for the many people involved.  I have learned how to sequence and examine genomes, how to compare genes to one another, and how to measure the levels of gene activity in different body parts.  I will use these skills in the future studying other types of organ generation.  The primary assistant for the project used this research experience to pursue a career in veterinary medicine.  When she graduates she will work for the USDA, improving food safety and public health.    The support from the NSF has enabled this work, these discoveries, and the gaining of experiences and skills by the young scientists involved.  It is a critical part in maintaining the investigation of biological mysteries now and in the future.  Greater understanding of how and why plants and animals work the way they do improves our future health and agriculture, and gives us a more complete view of the world around us.  I am very grateful for the opportunities provided by this award, and look forward to a future of many more questions and discoveries.
