<AbstractNarration>An award is made to the Chicago Botanic Garden (CBG) to acquire a ploidy analyzer that will be utilized for conservation and horticultural research; for practical plant conservation activities; and for secondary, post-secondary, and graduate education and other collaborative projects. Variations in ploidy (the number of sets of chromosomes in a cell) play an important role in both plant and fungal evolution and diversity. Differences in plant ploidy also have significant practical applications, from the selection of appropriate plants for restoration projects to its impact on breeding and selection of agronomic and horticultural crops. The traditional method of analyzing ploidy via chromosome fixation, staining, and microscopic analysis is time consuming, inexact, and impractical for analyzing a large volume of samples. The ploidy analyzer will allow the rapid, inexpensive, and high-sample volume processing of plant and fungal DNA ploidy and nuclear genome size. This will broadly enhance CBG?s conservation and horticulture research, education programs, permanent plant collections activities, and other collaborations. CBG staff will disseminate their research results to professional, scientific, and public audiences through scientific and popular publications, presentations, on-site interpretation and displays, and through CBG?s website. The public will also benefit from enhanced restoration practices for natural areas, from improved ornamental plants for garden use, and from opportunities to serve as students, volunteers, and outside partners on the projects made possible by the ploidy analyzer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chicago Botanic Garden conservation studies encompass the biology of small, fragmented populations; the genetics of both rare and invasive plant species, as well as fungal populations; plant and fungal responses to climate change and to ecosystem management; and spatial and temporal patterns of molecular genetic diversity in populations. The ploidy analyzer will make possible such studies as delineation of seed transfer zones for restoration studies of species with varied ploidy levels, and assessing seed longevity in storage of species with varied ploidy, as the larger cell sizes of higher ploidy seed can impact the longevity of frozen seed. The ploidy analyzer will also impact CBG?s horticultural programs, such as affording the breeding program the ability to match the ploidy of the parents used in crosses, assess the ploidy of plants treated to increase their ploidy, and aid in developing sterile triploid forms of landscape plants to avoid potential invasions. The ploidy analyzer will also be made available to regional conservation researchers and restoration practitioners as well as to commercial and independent plant breeders that do not access to this equipment.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The number of complete sets of chromosomes in a cell, or ploidy, can vary among species, individuals, or cell types. In many sexually reproducing organisms,&nbsp;cells are commonly diploid (two complete sets of chromosomes, one from each parent) with haploid reproductive cells (for example, sperm and egg cells). However, it is possible and not uncommon for some species (or individuals of some species) to consist of cells that contain more than two complete sets of chromosomes, a condition known as polyploidy. Polyploidy can arise in multiple ways, including through the doubling of existing chromosome sets in a single species or through hybridization between different species. Previous research has shown that polyploidy is associated with major innovations in the evolution of plants, such as the origin of seeds and flowers. Less research has been focused on the relative importance of polyploidy in plant and fungal conservation and the restoration of plant and fungal communities and their ecosystems. However, differences in plant ploidy may have significant practical applications, from the selection of appropriate germplasm for restoration projects to its impact on breeding and selection of agronomic and horticultural crops. This award provided funds to acquire a Sysmex CyFlow&reg; Ploidy Analyzer for the Negaunee Institute for Plant Conservation Science and Action at the Chicago Botanic Garden (CBG). The goal of this project was to support ongoing restoration, conservation, and horticultural research at CBG, as well as for secondary, post-secondary, and graduate education and training in the use of the ploidy analyzer and the application of results. Several research projects were conducted as part of this project, with the ploidy analyzer used to relate ploidy to the management of an aggressive species in natural areas, assess ploidy variation in the reintroduction of rare plants, determine the relationship between ploidy and viability of banked seeds, assess ploidy variation in seed mixes for restoration, and many others. In particular, results supported by this project were instrumental in assessing the importance of ploidy variation in plant material used for restoring natural plant communities. Unlike other measure of genetic diversity, diversity of ploidy levels may be detrimental to restoration efforts because mixing plant populations that differ in their ploidy may result in lower fertility. Ongoing research at CBG is using the ploidy analyzer to extend this research to specific cases. For example, in collaboration with the Institute for Applied Ecology, the ploidy analyzer was used to identify polyploid populations of <em>Eriophyllum lanatum </em>(sunflower family), a species that is targeted for widespread restoration use throughout the Willamette Valley (Oregon). When establishing nursery beds to produce genetically diverse seeds, the inclusion of polyploid plants would be detrimental, and results supported by this project informed the mixing of <em>E. lanatum </em>populations for use in restoration. Other ongoing research includes the estimation of genome sizes and ploidy variation for other rare or threatened plant species, for use in plant breeding, or for determining the potential for hybridization with invasive species. This project trained over 10 students (undergraduate and graduate) students and postdoctoral researchers, along with several other PhD-level Conservation Scientists at CBG. Results supported by this project have led to several ongoing research projects that will train many more students and researchers in the future.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 12/30/2019<br>      Modified by: Norman&nbsp;Wickett</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
