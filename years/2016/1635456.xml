<AbstractNarration>Ultrasound imaging is an important technique utilized for medical diagnosis and damage detection in a variety of industrial applications. In most conventional ultrasound imaging systems, a pulse is emitted from an ultrasonic transducer, and transmitted or reflected ultrasound pulses are measured with a similar transducer. In this project, instead of using a conventional transducer, a laser-based system will be utilized to measure the ultrasound. This is a potentially transformative method that may have unique advantages relative to conventional methods, including reduction of measurement errors, and the ability to create full-field videos of traveling wavefronts. The project will address the fundamental challenges needed to enable laser-based ultrasonic measurements to be utilized for industrial applications and biomedical research. A strong outreach effort will use measured videos of acoustics fields to motivate secondary students to become interested in science and engineering. These videos will allow students to engage in topics such as how ultrasound imaging works, why shock waves produced by pile driving are of concern for marine life near construction sites, and how layering in the ocean is used for long-range communication by both the military and marine mammals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To detect ultrasonic waves optically, the measurement arm of a laser interferometer is directed at a stationary retroreflective surface. When an acoustic wave passes through the measurement laser beam, the wave?s density variations produce phase shifts that can be detected by the interferometer. This project anticipates a wide range of outcomes. Interferometric measurements of ultrasonic fields have often been performed using a commercial laser Doppler vibrometer. However, vibrometers are engineered to measure vibrating surfaces; they are not optimized for measuring acoustic fields. The project will investigate designs for implementing an Open Source Acoustic Interferometric Detector to enable other researchers to construct a system optimized for interferometric measurements of ultrasound fields. An important outcome will be a protocol to actively monitor and control ultrasonic standing wave formation. This will produce a doubling of the force applied by ultrasound radiation force excitation. Other outcomes will enable multiple measurements to be combined to obtain high-fidelity and depth-sensitive interferometric measurements at higher frequencies than have been obtained in previous studies. These single-point and full-field measurements will not be susceptible to some of the artifacts observed when ultrasound is measured with conventional transducers. Interferometric measurements of ultrasonic fields will be used to investigate the fluid/structure interactions that lead to Mach shock formation when a wave pulse passes through an object.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>In most conventional ultrasound imaging systems, a pulse is emitted from an ultrasonic transducer and reflected ultrasound pulses are detected with a similar transducer. In this project, an alternative method for detection was studied: using a laser-based system to optically measure ultrasound. A laser beam traveling through an ultrasound wave experiences a phase shift proportional to the time-varying density variations of the wave; these phase shifts are analyzed to produce optical measurements of ultrasound. In this project, most measurements used a commercial scanning laser Doppler vibrometer; measurements using this technique are referred to as "refracto-vibrometry." An overview of the refracto-vibrometry technique can be found in our video <a href="https://youtu.be/igQhJHPADZk">https://youtu.be/igQhJHPADZk</a>.</p> <p>The intellectual merit of this project was primarily focused on optimizing refracto-vibrometry (RV) methods, and to utilize RV for visualization and quantitative studies of ultrasonic fields. For example <a href="https://youtu.be/1obYcOuged0">https://youtu.be/1obYcOuged0</a> shows the transmission and reflection that occurs for ultrasound incident on a 5mm slit in an aluminum plate; as with most RV measurements, this is a 2d projection of the actual ultrasound field. By rotating the target and measuring at multiple angles (see Figure 1, and video <a href="https://youtu.be/lNj6Y9MgN1Y">https://youtu.be/lNj6Y9MgN1Y</a>) we used computed tomography (CT), similar to what is done in x-ray imaging, to combine multiple projections to make 3d visualizations of ultrasound distributions. Prior published studies of CT reconstruction using refracto-vibrometry were focused on static distributions. We developed a technique for time adjustment of tomographic calculations that has enabled 3d reconstructions of time-varying ultrasonic fields instead of just static distributions. As an example, the elliptical distribution of ultrasound emerging from this aluminum plate optically measured using refracto-vibrometry tomography (red lines in Figure 2), was in excellent agreement with conventional measurements using a needle hydrophone (blue lines in Figure 2). Another substantial research focus involved improving the signal-to-noise ratio for refracto-vibrometry. One potentially transformative method involved using artificial intelligence to denoise ultrasound signals. A Deep Learning Convolutional Neural Network was developed; it was trained using thousands of high-noise minimally averaged ultrasound signals and corresponding low-noise highly averaged signals. Figure 3(a) is an ultrasound signal before denoising, Figure 3(b) is the denoised signal after applying the Deep Learning model. The efficacy of this method can be seen in reduction in random noise, and the similarity to the reference signal in Figure 3(c). The playlist <a href="http://rebrand.ly/UltrasoundCNN">http://rebrand.ly/UltrasoundCNN</a> shows a propagating ultrasound waveform before denoising, the substantially cleaner waveform after the Deep Learning denoising, and a reference produced by averaging hundreds of ultrasound pulses. The other method explored for noise reduction is the use of a sweep-frequency ultrasound chirp. The playlist <a href="https://rebrand.ly/UltrasoundChirp%20">https://rebrand.ly/UltrasoundChirp</a> has a video that briefly explains how bats use sweep-frequency chirps for echolocation, followed by refracto-vibrometry videos of the ultrasound chirp before and after the dechirp operation, along with noisy and low-noise videos of ultrasound pulses.</p> <p>One of the broader impacts of this project was development of methods for producing videos of propagating ultrasonic fields, and dissemination of these results both for educational use and research applications. Videos of propagating ultrasound have been used in physics courses to allow students to visualize wave phenomena and perform quantitative calculations. For example, the video <a href="https://youtu.be/3BJ34KGvYyQ%20">https://youtu.be/3BJ34KGvYyQ</a> was used by students to visualize reflection and refraction, and was quantitatively analyzed using Snell's Law of Refraction. Similarly, students can visualize and analyze the Mach cone for waves traveling in an acrylic cylinder in the video <a href="https://youtu.be/gx7rHpSHPmw">https://youtu.be/gx7rHpSHPmw</a>. We collaborated with a research group studying ultrasound transmission and backscattering by bone for osteoporosis detection. The video <a href="https://youtu.be/UUqcUpRGYaw">https://youtu.be/UUqcUpRGYaw</a> compares the ultrasound wavefronts incident on a human calcaneus heel bone (bluish coloration) superimposed on a reference (red coloration) where the bone was removed from water tank. Because the speed of sound in bone is higher than the speed of sound in water, the emitted wave (blue) emerges before the reference wave (red). This allowed the collaborators to visualize the ultrasound/bone interaction while obtaining time differences and bone-mineral-density (BMD) measurements consistent with conventional techniques. We also produced 3d tomographic reconstructions to study these ultrasound/bone interactions (see <a href="https://youtu.be/pzaOrd4mqzQ">https://youtu.be/pzaOrd4mqzQ</a> for one slice of this reconstruction). Another broader impact was the direct involvement of eight undergraduate students in all aspects of the project. Two students did their senior honors physics thesis based on this project and are preparing first-author publications. After graduation, students involved have gone to graduate school in physics, biomedical engineering, and directly to STEM employment.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 12/28/2020<br>      Modified by: Thomas&nbsp;M&nbsp;Huber</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1635456/1635456_10448691_1609173653818_Vibrometer_With_Rotation_Stage_Annotated(Slot)--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1635456/1635456_10448691_1609173653818_Vibrometer_With_Rotation_Stage_Annotated(Slot)--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Setup used for Refracto-Vibrometry"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1635456/1635456_10448691_1609173653818_Vibrometer_With_Rotation_Stage_Annotated(Slot)--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Setup used for Refracto-Vibrometry"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Apparatus used for acquiring data sets for tomographic reconstruction.
