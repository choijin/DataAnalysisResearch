<AbstractNarration>This project will investigate the properties of certain latex nanoparticles to learn which work best for separating different compounds.  Specifically, the research uses nanoparticles with a cationic shell to separate analytes found in explosives residues. Subtle differences between different polymers lead to noticeable changes in the separation performance, so it is imperative to characterize these polymers as much as possible to understand why. A better understanding of the polymers will lead to a greater understanding of what properties influence performance of electrokinetic chromatography (EKC), a microscale analytical technique used in separation of neutral compounds found in explosive residues. The research will be conducted in collaboration with Dr. Emily Hilder, a leading expert in the field of separation science, at the Future Industries Institute at the University of South Australia.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Separations occur when compounds of interest interact differently with a material, and to get the best separations it is important to understand the material?s properties.  This project will investigate how the properties of polymeric latex nanoparticles affect their ability to separate neutral compounds when used as a pseudostationary phase in electrokinetic chromatography (EKC).  The research aims to advance three aims: 1) to investigate the latexes by capillary capillary electrophoresis in the critical condition, which makes one block in the diblock polymer ?chromatographically invisible?; 2) to investigate chain branching in the hydrophobic block by 13C NMR; and 3) to investigate the nanoparticle size and morphology by transmission electron microscopy. By better understanding the properties of different nanoparticles, they can be tailored to separate specific types of compounds, including environmental contaminants, pharmaceutical ingredients, or explosives residues. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award under the East Asia and Pacific Summer Institutes program supports summer research by a U.S. graduate student and is jointly funded by NSF and the Australian Academy of Science.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In my research I create polymer nanoparticles that have a positive charge and use them to separate mixtures into their individual components.  These nanoparticles are made up of polymer chains that have a hydrophilic block and a hydrophobic block.  Different nanoparticles separate these mixtures in different ways, so the goal of this EAPSI research project was to study the nanoparticles in more depth to determine why.  I brought 22 different samples of nanoparticles with me to the University of South Australia and focused my efforts on 10 of them that I had run a linear solvation energy relationships (LSER) analysis on.  LSER is a model of how different molecular interactions result in a separation and allows us to compare one nanoparticle to another.   At the University of South Australia we were able to get an image of the nanoparticles using an electron microscope, which gave us a better idea of their size and shape.  This was a difficult process because if the solution used to prepare the sample was too concentrated the nanoparticles would stick together, and sometimes the polymers would burn up in the electron beam.  We eventually found a working concentration and sample preparation procedure, and now our research group will know how to prepare samples for electron microscopy in the future.  I was able to measure the charge of the nanoparticles, and confirmed that they all are positively charged.  I met a researcher who specializes in a technique called diffusion NMR and we used it to determine the diameter of the nanoparticles, which ranged from 20 nm to 60 nm across.  We also found that each sample contains additional material that is smaller than the nanoparticles.  This could be smaller polymer chains that are not being incorporated into the larger nanoparticle structure.   I also learned a technique called non-aqueous capillary electrophoresis, which you can use to dissolve the nanoparticles to look at their individual polymer chains.  We found that methanol was the best solvent to dissolve the nanoparticles, and you could see not just diblock copolymer chains but also polymer chains that had only the hydrophobic block.  We then looked at this data and compared it to the results from the LSER analysis data and found a relationship between the size of a nanoparticle and its ability to separate hydrophobic compounds.   This project was beneficial for my research group because I was able to learn new techniques from experts, then go back and teach them to others at the University of Montana.  My colleague was able to follow the sample preparation procedure I optimized to obtain an electron microscope image for a different type of nanoparticle, and he is currently studying them using non-aqueous capillary electrophoresis.  The findings from this EAPSI project will allow us to choose the best nanoparticle to separate different types of mixtures quickly and efficiently.
