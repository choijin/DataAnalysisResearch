<AbstractNarration>The research funded by this award will investigate the consequences of recent global shifts in urbanizing processes. Population mobility, new communications technologies, and volatile property markets underpin changes in cities the world over. This research will look at how these forces come together, how they affect urban life, and how they create new kinds of infrastructures and claims to urban spaces. The overarching research goal is to better understand both causal and experiential dimensions of mobility and urban migration, and to relate these to global dynamics of urbanization and infrastructure development. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will be conducted by anthropologist Dr. Daniel Fisher of the University of California, Berkeley. Because the transformations to be studied are so broad and interconnected as to be unwieldy from a research perspective, the researcher has chosen to focus his investigations on multiple facets in a single site: Aboriginal urbanization in Darwin, capital of Australia's Northern Territory. He will collect data using an innovative mix of anthropological methods, including: intensive, long-term participant observation to understand the wide variety of lived spaces, experiences, and communities; archival research to track historical developments through administrative records, oral histories, cadastral maps, and photographic materials; collaborative media production to gain insight into everyday aspects of life through the media that are also constitutive of that life; and social and cadastral surveys. Findings from this project will contribute to the comparative study of contemporary urbanization broadly and more specifically to understanding its intercultural and infrastructural properties and their effects on marginalized populations. Funding this project also supports research opportunities for American undergraduate and graduate students. The researcher will produce online and museological exhibitions as well as scholarly publications of his results.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The major goal of this project was to better understand aspects of global urbanization, Indigenous urbanism, and urban ecological infrastracture through the particular and distinctive optic of Indigenous advocacy and intra-Indigenous relations in the city of Darwin, capital of Australia’s Northern Territory.  The research focused on the phenomenon of Indigenous urbanization, a term that encompasses the ways in which Indigenous people move to and through the cities of Northern Australia in increasing numbers, to the ways that cities play increasingly central and charged roles in Indigenous life, and to the growing roles of Indigenous institutions in city governance. While the past 15 years have seen have seen enormous changes to towns and cities in northern Australia, Darwin’s growth has been remarkable. Nonetheless, employment prospects remain sparse for Aboriginal people, governmental assistance comes freighted with surveillance and stigma, and waitlists for governmental housing in Darwin can now stretch to two years. These challenging circumstances have been accompanied by changes in the city's social service institutions and the social and material entailments of dramatic climate events including increasing heat, cyclone, and fire events.   The research brought together several lines of inquiry: First, how do Indigenous Australians negotiate these changing circumstances, and what kinds of institutions and political coalitions have emerged in their wake? Secondly, how have increases in Indigenous mobility and urban migration impacted intra-Indigenous relationships and related forms of sovereign claim and emplaced identity in Darwin? And how are such relationships implicated in the shape the city takes as an Aboriginal place? Together these questions provide coordinates for better understanding social, infrastructural, and ecological facets of urbanization more broadly, and inform the project's contribution to the study of urban Indigeneity, the dilemmas facing Indigenous organizations as they acquire greater political and governmental roles in a time of changing climate and accompanying political and ecological instability. In turn, these insights also contribute to anthropological scholarship on the politics of environmental infrastructure and the sociopolitical dimensions of global urbanization more broadly.  Over the course of the funded period of research the PI pursued ethnographic, participant observation research in northern Australia producing data on these phenomena. The PI spent time with social service programs run by Indigenous institutions, rode along with Indigenous night patrol officers engaged in social outreach and harm reduction amid Darwin’s multiple Indigenous communities, collected interview-based and archival materials, and produced photographic and audio-visual media across the bush spaces of Darwin. These materials offer data that will help to better understand Indigenous experiences of urban transformation, foreground the place of mobile media and environmental infrastructure in the negotiation of urban life, and the reconfiguration of Indigenous and other claims to urban space.   The PI is drafting a book length publication with an expected completion date of 2022 that will detail the findings of this work by outlining how Indigenous institutions in Darwin have taken a leadership role in social service provision and environmental management, and analyzing how such interventions negotiate the intertwined character of social, ecological, and infrastructural changes in the city. This will also allow insight into Indigenous experiences of urban life and will bring urban Australian materials to bear on key concerns of contemporary anthropological scholarship more broadly. The work also will bring the specifics of this experience to international conversations around urban ecology, environmental management, media infrastructure, and Indigenous rights, noting both the promises and pitfalls that confront Indigenous and other community organizations and their advocates as they take on more central roles in negotiating and mitigating converging phenomena of climate change and global urbanization.
