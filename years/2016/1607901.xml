<AbstractNarration>The project focuses on studying large time and scale behavior for a variety of probabilistic systems. Many of those were designed to model different natural processes such as bacterial growth, crystal melting, very cold gases at atomic levels, etc. An accurate analysis at large times or scales is typically very difficult, and the project concentrates on models with additional algebraic structure that originate in seemingly unrelated areas of mathematics. This structure helps to discover new phenomena that tend to be universal (i.e., present in a very wide range of systems). As a result, using sophisticated mathematical tools, the principal investigator seeks to find new universal laws that play the role of the famous and familiar bell curve law and that can often be observed through physical and numerical experiments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the emerging field of integrable probability is to identify and analyze exactly solvable probabilistic models. The models and results are often easy to describe, yet difficult to find, and they carry essential information about broad universality classes of stochastic processes. The project aims at developing a bridge between deep algebraic and representation theoretic structures on one end, and probabilistic systems on the other end, that would allow to utilize the former in order to discover and study the latter. The framework of Macdonald processes introduced and developed in the last five years has been quite successful on this path, and it continues to grow. Known applications include interacting particle systems, random growing interfaces in (1+1) and (2+1) dimensions, random matrices and log-gases, and directed polymers in random media. The framework is now poised to expand to include the theory of solvable lattice models of statistical mechanics, offering completely new perspective and new results in this well-established domain.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The PI had initiated the field of Integrable Probability as a broad platform for identifying and analyzing exactly solvable probabilistic models. Such models and results about them are often easy to describe, yet difficult to find, and they carry essential information about broad universality classes of stochastic processes.   One outcome of this grant is that the domain of Integrable Probability has been firmly established. The initial impetus of the so-called Macdonald processes and their applications has been extended to the framework of solvable lattice models - a venerable domain in Statistical Physics. This lead to substantial progress in understanding such models and to formulating new sets of problems and challenges, some of which have been successfully addressed.   The project has substantially strengthened the ties of Integrable Probability with several fields of mathematics (Probability, Combinatorics, Representation Theory, Integrable Systems) and physics (Equilibrium and Non-Equilibrium Statistical Physics, Quantum Many-Body Systems).   The PI has been advising a number of students and postdocs many of whom are now successfully pursuing independent research. New results are broadly disseminated via a steady flow of conferences, seminars, summer schools, and high profile lectures that are typically videotaped and posted online, and the PI has been taking an active part in both lecturing and organizing various events.
