<AbstractNarration>Today, recipe development and optimization for micro- and nanofabrication processes are typically based on time consuming and expensive experimental trial and error. Some processes may take up to a year to be created and fully optimized severely limiting technology development. Statistical software tools like JMP attempt to capitalize on classical design of experiment (DoE) techniques to mitigate this high cost of recipe creation and optimization, but they neglect information that might be gained from an understanding of process physics and often require large numbers of experiments for precise fits. Other process tools, including Synopsys and Coventor, lack many predictive capabilities. Shortening the development cycle offers a clear opportunity to save time and money and enables new nanoscale technologies. This I-Corps team has invented a methodology for using physics based models and integrated Bayesian statistics to dramatically speed up and reduce the cost for the empirical optimization of micro- and nanofabrication processes compared to classical DoE. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed technology "LabMate" employs an iterative feedback between a model constructed on a robust theoretical foundation and experiments. In addition, LabMate enables the knowledge and experience of the user to be incorporated quantitatively into the model to further decrease the time to optimization and making it well-suited for commercial application. Preliminary application of the proposed method to the development of dry etching recipes shows that the number of experiments can be reduced by a factor of two to three compared to the number of experiments required by DoE. This translates to hundreds of thousands of dollars in annual savings for etch recipe creation and optimization. Importantly, although the initial target market lies within the semiconductor space, the proposed  technology can easily translate to any physical process with a large number of unknown parameters and limited experimental data. This team is targeting recipe optimization for dry etching processes at companies including LAM, Intel, Tokyo Electron, Global Foundries, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, and Applied Materials. An initial market survey taught the team that the few simulation tools that exist today for etch recipe creation and optimization lack the flexibility and capacity of our invention. The team will employ a subscription based model with customer support to commercialize the proposed software.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Every year the semiconductor industry spends over $1.2B creating etch and deposition recipes by an costly and time consuming empirical approach.  This slows the development and deployment of new microelectronic devices and reduces semiconductor chip and equipment sales by hundreds of millions of dollars.  The software RODEo, or Recipe Optimization for Deposition and Etching, (previously called LabMate) enables process engineers to identify optimal etch and deposition recipes three times faster and at one-third the cost compared to current industrial practice.   The major outcomes of this project include:     Validation of the business opportunity for RODEo, resulting in a go  decision on commercialization.  Over 100 interviews with potential users and customers demonstrated that there is a need and willingness to pay for the RODEo software.   Formation of a company  called SandBox Semiconductor by the team to commercialize RODEo. Participation in three start-up competitions, including the presitigious Rice Business Plan Competition.  Over $55,000 has been raised to start SandBox Semiconductor. Establishment of partnerships with major semiconductor chip and tool makers. Submission of a patent on the RODEo methodology. Exploration of applying RODEo's methodology beyond the semiconductor industry, including drug formulation for the pharmaceutical industry and catalyst design for the petrochemical industry.   Beyond the vast economic impact of realization of this tool, RODEo will enable new technologies to enter the market which otherwise would have never seen the light of day due to prohibitive process development costs.
