<AbstractNarration>The Texas Algebraic Geometry Symposium (TAGS) will take place April 1-3, 2016 at the University of Texas at Austin. Algebraic geometry, historically rooted in the study of solutions to polynomial equations, remains in the twenty-first century a vibrant subject with both its own deep internal questions as well as far-reaching interactions with many other parts of science and mathematics. TAGS is a major annual event in the regional algebraic geometry community, bringing together experts in different aspects of the subject as well as graduate students and postdocs just entering it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TAGS 2016 will accomplish the following scientific aims.  First, it will provide graduate students, postdocs, and other junior researchers opportunities to learn about a wide range of topics in algebraic geometry from experts known for their effective communication skills. Second, it will provide a forum for young researchers to build relationships with, and present their work to, faculty and peers at other institutions in the region.  Finally, it will help build and maintain a cohesive regional community of researchers involved in different aspects of algebraic geometry. In addition to fulfilling these scientific goals, in 2016 TAGS will continue its demonstrated commitment to encouraging the participation of women, minorities, and members of underrepresented groups in mathematics. The website for the symposium is http://www.ma.utexas.edu/users/hwilliams/TAGS2016/.</AbstractNarration>
