<AbstractNarration>Nontechnical: This conference award by the Biomaterials program in the Division of Materials Research to University of Alabama at Birmingham is to organize a two-day symposium on "Soft Material Surface Modification to Control Cell/Surface Interactions" at the 2016 National Meeting and Exposition of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania from August 21 to 25, 2016. This conference aims to bring together leading scientists working in the interdisciplinary area of biomaterials synthesis, properties, and applications. The active participation of graduate students, postdoctoral students and assistant professors is expected. The invited speakers will include newly appointed assistant professors as well as established researchers in academia, and junior and senior scientists at national laboratories and industry. They are expected to show their case research, and emphasize new trends and future directions for surface modification approaches using soft materials to control cell/surfaces interactions. Additionally, this symposium is expected to offer important opportunities for junior faculty members, students and postdoctoral researchers, including a significant number of women, to network with senior researchers. The symposium will be open to all interested scientists/engineers, who are actively working on topics related to soft materials/cell interfaces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical: The organizers of this symposium have put together a meeting for the in-depth discussions of fundamentals of soft materials, surface modification including polymer nano- and microparticle/cell and planar surfaces/cell interactions, as well as a broad representation of applications and transformative research. This conference aims in interfacing multiple disciplines (physics, chemistry, biology and engineering) in developing an understanding of the fundamentals of polymer cell interactions, and developing applications based on these novel concepts and approaches. This symposium is expected to provide a forum for scientists and engineers involved in synthesis of biologically relevant polymers, biomaterials assembly to tailor cell/surface modification, and cell/tissue encapsulation, and to share the most recent advances made in this rapidly expanding field.</AbstractNarration>

Eugenia Kharlampieva (University of Alabama at Birmingham) and Amy Peterson (Worcester Polytechnic Institute).  Intellectual Merit. Materials surface modification to control cell/surface interactions is a crucial tool for the design and synthesis of 2D and 3D biomaterials over different length scales. This symposium served as a scientific forum for discussion of fundamentals of biomaterials/cell interfaces with major focus on soft materials. Among the main themes of the forum were emerging applications of biomaterials films, scaffolds, and particles, including tissue engineering, drug delivery, antibacterial protection of biomedical implants, and biosensing. The distinguishing features of the symposium were emphasis on increased participation of young faculty, postdoctoral associates and graduate students; in-depth discussions of fundamentals of soft materials surface modification including polymer nano- and microparticle/cell and planar surfaces/cell interactions, as well as a broad representation of applications and transformative research. The symposium was a successful platform for scientists and engineers involved in synthesis of biologically relevant polymers, biomaterials assembly to tailor cell/surface modification, and cell/tissue encapsulation to share and exchange the most recent advances made in this rapidly expanding field.  Broader Impact. The symposium brought together leading scientists working in the interdisciplinary area of biomaterials synthesis, properties, and applications. This symposium hosted two days of twenty-two oral presentations from eleven invited speakers that included five newly appointed assistant professors as well as five well-established researchers in academia and industry, and a postdoctoral scholar, who showcased their research and emphasized new trends and future directions for surface modification approaches using soft materials to control cell/surfaces interactions. A significant feature of the event was that the participation of women (50% of the participants), and graduate/postdoctoral researchers was strongly encouraged and turned to be successful as eight graduate students and three postdoctoral fellows had the opportunity to network with senior researchers and present the research results. The audience for this symposium included graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, junior and senior faculty, and scientists from industry. This symposium offered vital opportunities for junior faculty members, students and postdoctoral researchers, including a significant number of women to network and exchange their knowledge and experience.
