<AbstractNarration>In a one-lane traffic situation, one slow car may delay a whole platoon of cars behind. This situation is an example of randomly interacting systems in which particles (cars) have random amounts of time to move, and one particle's movement influences other particles in some distance. The spread of fire, the cavity of melting ice, and growth of bacterial colonies also have similar features. In this project, the principal investigator studies some of the underlying fundamental mathematical properties for a class of simplified models representing such random interactions. In particular, the principal investigator studies how the randomness of the particles movement impact the global characteristics of the system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The principal investigator will study the fluctuations of several random systems. They include spin glass, random matrices, and interacting particle systems. The overarching goal is to explore the scope and limitation of the universal distribution functions that arise from random matrix theory and related models and also uncover new universal distributions. Specifically, the principal investigator studies 2-spin spherical Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model of spin glass, totally asymmetric simple exclusion process on a ring, and the Airy process. the principal investigator uses the exactly solvable nature of these models extensively to obtain precise asymptotic results. Riemann-Hilbert problems and coordinate Bethe ansatz method are some of the tools used.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This project is concerned with the behavior of large systems with many randomly interacting components. Such systems model a wide range of phenomena in nature; melting of ice, spread of fire, traffic patterns, and so on. It was observed and proved that a certain class of systems with strong interactions exhibit universal behavior in the large system limit. Such universal behaviors are usually observed in the fluctuations from the average behavior. This project focused on three specific systems and studied detailed their fluctuations in great detail. The first is a spin glass model from statistical physics which has applications in computer science and machine learning. The model consists of random part and non-random part, and the focus was on the change of the system in the large size limit depending on the combination of these two parts. The second system considered is interacting particle systems which in a crude sense models the traffic flow in a single-lane road. The correlations between different times were not fully understood beforehand, and the project studied the temporal correlations in the large time limit when the space is assumed to be periodic. The third system is a particular random matrix model which has been studied in both mathematics and physics for several decades.
