<AbstractNarration>This award provides partial support to offset registration fees for students and post-docs to attend the 16th International Conference on Strangeness in Quark Matter (SQM2016) to be held on June 27-July 1, 2016 at Berkeley, California. The scientific program of the conference will focus on strangeness and heavy quark production in nuclear collisions; Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) phase structure; strangeness in astrophysics; and open questions and new development. Participation of students and post-docs at this meeting will provide them with opportunities for interaction across the scientific community.</AbstractNarration>
