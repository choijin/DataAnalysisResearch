<AbstractNarration>Conceptualizing and measuring innovation is surprisingly difficult. The international innovation community has been measuring innovation by developing national surveys based on the OECD's Oslo manual that rely on the simple categorical distinction.  This project goes beyond the categorical distinction by characterizing firms' top-selling innovations in a given market along the dimensions of economic, technical and uniqueness. These measures of innovation are validated by comparisons with other existing public and private data and by examining the firm, industry, and regional characteristics. Results from the project provide guidance for other innovation surveys to advance our understanding of the drivers of innovation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Approaching innovation as a multidimensional concept provides analysts the tools to calibrate the importance of a given innovation.  The analysis allows researchers and policymakers to assess whether the innovations in question are important in a sense that will be meaningful for the various communities interested in innovation. This project exploits data from the American Competitiveness Survey, a private innovation survey, and combines it with data from the NSF Business R&amp;D and Innovation Survey, the European Community Innovation Survey, and the Carnegie Mellon Survey, another private R&amp;D survey.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Policymakers, scholars and managers have a keen interest in tracking innovative activity. However, measuring innovation has proven difficult. In the US, R&amp;D and patents were long used as primary indicators. More recently, statistical agencies in the US, Europe and Asia have begun to track self-reported innovation (new or improved products and processes in the market). One challenge with existing innovation surveys is that it is not clear what respondents mean when they report that they have introduced a product or process that is new to the market.  Moreover, underlying this question of interpretation is the concern about whether reported innovations are "important."  This research addresses this question by conceptualizing various dimensions of innovativeness: technological significance, utility, distance, uniqueness, and replicability.  We then offer operationalizations of each of these, using data from a recent survey of US firms. Finally, we examine the dimensions of innovativeness empirically, highlighting that each is distinct, that industries vary in their emphasis on one or another dimension, and that the characteristics of innovation vary across industries, with some especially illustrative differences between manufacturing and software.  We offer several suggestions for improving innovation surveys, including focusing on a specific innovation, and improving questions to more precisely track different dimensions of both innovation and imitation.  The results provide important insights related to the policy, management and economics of innovation.       Last Modified: 12/21/2017       Submitted by: John P Walsh]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
