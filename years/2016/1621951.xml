<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will be to initiate development of an effective technology that will enable users in the field to perform laboratory-quality cyanotoxin testing to help protect drinking water, monitor commercial food resources, and provide critical data for ecosystems management. Harmful algal blooms (HABs) in United States and global freshwater and marine environments are increasing in frequency and duration and constitute a growing public health threat while also carrying substantial economic, ecologic, and food supply implications. The goal is to initially launch a system that delivers a panel of water toxin results in less than 15 minutes. Validation will be with customers in public health and regulatory agencies followed by placements with water resource managers of commercial drinking water systems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The technical objectives in this Phase I research project are designed to provide a user-friendly platform with a unique combination of attributes. A cost competitive system that delivers multiple immunoassay results from a single sample using a single, simple protocol, provides lab quality accuracy and reliability, and connected data management incorporating smart phone infrastructure and cloud-based systems. This Phase I project is designed to deliver three key technical objectives. (1) One-Step Assay - deliver a single-step, &lt; 15-minute duplex microcystin / cylindrospermopsin assay tuned to drinking water recommendations. (2) Sample Prep - establish preliminary component designs for the water sample-to-cartridge interface, including designs that enable intra-cellular and dissolved toxin methods. (3) Connectivity - develop the electronics and software infrastructure plan for distributed systems networking.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Project Outcomes Report for MBio Diagnostics, Inc Phase I SBIR: "Portable System for Detection of Harmful Algal Bloom Toxins in Freshwater and Marine Environments."  MBio?s novel product is a portable system for detecting a panel of cyanotoxins associated with harmful algal blooms that affect drinking water systems, recreational waters, and aquaculture.  The MBio product will address an unmet need for rapid, cost-effective, cyanotoxin testing that delivers a panel of laboratory quality results.  In Phase I, MBio developed a duplex assay for detecting microcystin and cylindrospermopsin.  The US Environmental Protection Agency recently released the Fourth Unregulated Contaminant Monitoring Rule, which specifically lists microcystin and cylindrospermopsin as reportable cyanotoxins requiring monitoring.  Globally, the World Health Organization has established guidelines for toxin levels in drinking water.   MBio achieved all of the Phase I major milestones which involved providing a proof-of-concept of the elements of a portable, accurate, easy-to-use test with appropriate sensitivity to these two toxins.  A major accomplishment of the Phase I program was delivery of the microcystin and cylindrospermopsin duplex assay in a one-step, 10-minute workflow with dried reagents onboard the cartridge.  This assay was tested in comparison to two reference enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, demonstrating agreement between the methods and validating the MBio assay for both microcystin and cylindrospermopsin.  Most of the testing was done with microcystin-LR, which is a common congener, but there are more than 100 known microcystin congeners.  To demonstrate activity against a variety of congeners, the assay was successfully tested with eight of the most common congeners.   A central challenge in cyanotoxins testing is the dynamic balance between intra-cellular and free toxins, so MBio also developed a proprietary, mechanical, field-portable cell lysis method that is compatible with the assay.  This allows users to either measure the free toxin in a sample or to lyse cells and measure the combination of free toxin and intra-cellular toxin.  The cell lysis method is simple, portable, effective, and easy to use.  The anticipated cost of disposable components for this method is &lt;$3 and the lysis time is 10 minutes, making this a cost-effective and rapid lysis method.  Cell lysis efficiencies were measured with cell cultures as being consistently greater than the gold-standard method of three freezing and thawing cycles with efficiencies of 84%-99% depending on the cell type.  Cell cultures for this work were grown at MBio and were also tested on the duplex assay.  To fully enable portable use, a software and electronics infrastructure plan for distributed systems networking was developed.  The tasks included designing a battery that is compatible with the instrument to power it for field use, and writing design input requirements for future software and electronics development.  The requirements specified an instrument with an integrated computer that can display results on an external tablet or smartphone.  In summary, all Phase I milestones were achieved or exceeded demonstrating a complete proof-of-concept for a multiplexed, rapid, cost-effective test for cyanotoxins testing with sufficient sensitivity to measure relevant concentrations of microcystin and cylindrospermopsin.
