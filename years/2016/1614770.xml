<AbstractNarration>This is an observational study of the magnetic fields of the smallest stars.  These stars have such low temperature and low mass that they are called ultracool dwarfs (UCDs).  UCDs are the most common type of star in the Galaxy and they have a surprising amount of magnetic activity that is not understood. This project will address several fundamental questions about UCDs, including how strong are their magnetic fields, how are they distributed around the star, and how do they change over time. Results from this project will also be helpful for studies of the magnetic fields of giant planets around other stars. Undergraduate and graduate students will be trained and mentored in research. They will participate in all stages of the work, including collecting, analyzing, and publishing data at many different wavelengths. The project will also integrate research experiences into undergraduate education and public lectures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will exploit a unique set of magnetic activity observations from radio wavelengths to X-rays. The group will measure magnetic field strengths, spectral energy distributions, and time monitoring using radio observations with the Jansky Very Large Array (JVLA) and ALMA telescopes. They will document and analyze UCD flares and variability with optical observations using the Pan-STARRS Medium-Deep survey. The role of rotation in convective dynamos will also be studied with X-ray observations that the team obtained from the Chandra telescope. This project will determine the fundamental properties of convective magnetic dynamos, and the resulting range of magnetic activity timescales and energetics. The observations will provide empirical inputs for analytical models and numerical simulations of convective magnetic dynamos. In addition, the study of flares and variability in a million UCD stars on timescales of minutes to years will impact the question of life and habitability in the compact habitable zones of M dwarfs, a popular target population for Earth-like exoplanet searches.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In this project we used multi-wavelength observations and data (radio, optical, X-rays) to study magnetic activity in low mass stars, brown dwarfs, and exoplanets.  We utililzed for the first time the PS1/MDS stacked images to find all stellar sources within the 70 deg^2 footprint of the survey.  We then used color-color diagrams (constructed from the grizy photometry) to select all mid- to late-M dwarfs in the survey (184,000 sources).  For these sources we constructed light curves to determine rotation periods, and determined rotation period values for 270 sources.  We derive a new set of polynomials relating M dwarf PS1 colors to fundamental stellar parameters and use them to estimate the masses, distances, effective temperatures, and bolometric luminosities of our sample. We present a catalog containing these values, our measured rotation periods, and cross-matches to other surveys. Our final sample spans periods of P~1-130 days in stars with estimated effective temperatures of ~2700-4000 K. Twenty-two of our sources have X-ray cross-matches, and they are found to be relatively X-ray bright as would be expected from selection effects. Our data set provides evidence that Kepler-based searches have not been sensitive to very slowly rotating stars (P &gt; 70 day), implying that the observed emergence of very slow rotators in studies of low-mass stars may be a systematic effect. We also see a lack of low-amplitude (&lt;2%) variability in objects with intermediate (10-40 day) rotation periods, which, considered in conjunction with other observational results, may be a signpost of a loss of magnetic complexity associated with a phase of rapid spin-down in intermediate-age M dwarfs. This work represents just a first step in exploring stellar variability in data from the PS1-MDS and, in the farther future, Large Synoptic Survey Telescope.  We further used K2 data for studies of flares and their ubiquity in late-M and L dwarfs, providing some of the best statistics to date on duty cycle, flare luminosity distribution, and relation to spectral type. We detected variable and highly polarized radio emission from a T6 dwarf, the lowest mass object with strong radio emission to date.  The observations refute a claimed periodicity of 17 minutes, and show rapid switching in the handedness of circular polarization.  This indicates that the object's magnetic dipole axis may be highly misaligned relative to its rotation axis.  We conducted the first search for radio emission from directly imaged giant exoplanets, placing the first constraints on magnetic activity in these sources, and placing them in the context of low mass stars and brown dwarfs.  The project involved postdoctoral fellows and undergraduate students and led to development of skills in radio and X-ray data analysis, work with large survey data, and familiarity with the science of low mass stars, brown dwarfs, and exoplanets.
