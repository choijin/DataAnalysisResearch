<AbstractNarration>This project will be carried out by a postdoctoral fellow trained in Environmental Engineering and mentored by an environmental sociologist. The PI will study the permitting process for the Pebble Partnership 2013-2015, and the resulting scientific, policy, legal, and ethical controversies raised by the project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results will provide useful knowledge for science and technology studies and regulatory science.</AbstractNarration>

We started with the early permitting debates to understand the contemporary politics of defining and constructing dominant resource materialities. We also examined alternative regimes of value and counter-discursive renewable material realities created in tandem for consideration by social, environmental, and community groups. This project built the theoretical framework of resource material imaginaries; it broadened the theoretical framework of STS and law with concepts in legal pluralism, and environmental justice to examine the legal contentions within the Pebble Mine Permitting; evaluated health impact assessment utilizing social theories of risk, a voluntary assessment conducted as part of Environmental Impact Statement; and compared public engagement and democratic practices within permitting between Pebble Mine in Bristol Bay and Donlin Mine in the Kuskwokwin Region in Alaska. We showed that civic epistemologies and ontologies embedded in different social, scientific and political practices help explain environmental actions and outcomes, that construction of resource materialities is characterized by the operationalization of disparate (but overlapping) material cultures and knowledge traditions.
