<AbstractNarration>The archaeological study of traditional Native American agricultural techniques is essential for the evaluation of long-term land use because it allows for the examination of environmental change at the time scales necessary to test for sustainability. The earliest farmers on the floodplains of the Sonoran Desert used careful planning, group cooperation, and experimentation in the massive reconfiguration of the natural environment for agricultural purposes. The diversity in size and complexity of these early farming communities requires examination of the specific factors that favored the significant investment in landscape modification in order to understand the development of these practices. The examination of local environmental conditions and their relationship to the timing of agricultural practices is key in understanding the regional development and demise of early earthen irrigation canals. This information will contribute to the growing body of knowledge of sustainable earthen irrigation systems, an agricultural technology commonly used in arid environments today. Results from this interdisciplinary research have international impacts in earth science, archaeology, and sustainable agriculture. This project supports student training in fieldwork, research, and specialized laboratory techniques for women and underrepresented groups and is a component of a twenty-year collaboration between the University of Arizona and Mexico's Instituto Nacional de Antropolog√≠a e Historia.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This dissertation research will investigate the earliest agricultural technology in the Southwest United States/Northwest Mexico region and evaluate local environmental impacts to determine when and why this technology was developed and subsequently abandoned. Dr. Vance Holliday and Rachel Cajigas from the University of Arizona will use high-precision dating techniques combined with environmental data to determine the timing of early agricultural practices and the relationship to floodplain conditions at the La Playa site in Sonora, Mexico. This site has important implications for the understanding of the development of agricultural techniques because it is the single largest Early Agricultural Period (2100 B.C.-A.D. 50) site in the greater Southwest. Modern erosion is actively destroying large portions of the archaeological site, highlighting the urgent need for study. This research will test the hypothesis that canal irrigation created a wetland environment, eventually leading to unstable depositional conditions. These unstable conditions may have contributed to social reorganization and abandonment of irrigation technology. Radiocarbon and Optically Stimulated Luminescence dating methods will be used to determine the timing of canal use and abandonment. These data will be compared with sedimentological and soils data to characterize floodplain conditions throughout the Early Agricultural period. The results from this study will advance the understanding of early agricultural techniques in arid environments and contribute to a comprehensive chronology of the archaeological site within the greater context of the origins of early agriculture in the Southwest U.S./Northwest Mexico.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ SUMMARY OF RESULTS  The purpose of this project was to investigate early irrigation technology at the La Playa site in Sonora, Mexico. This site has important implications for the understanding of the development of agricultural techniques, such as floodplain irrigation, because it is the single largest Early Agricultural Period (EAP) (2100 B.C.&ndash;A.D. 200) site. Modern erosion is actively destroying large portions of the archaeological site, highlighting the urgent need for study.  Dr. Vance Holliday and Rachel Cajigas from the University of Arizona used high-precision dating techniques combined with environmental data to determine the timing of early agricultural practices and the relationship to floodplain conditions at La Playa site to determine when and why this technology was developed and abandoned.  Results from this research indicate that there were at least two periods of canal use at La Playa (~A.D. 50&ndash;250 and~750&ndash;350 B.C.), corresponding to the end of the EAP. These dates also correspond to the earliest radiocarbon dates on corn at La Playa. Local environmental conditions at this time made floodplain irrigation a successful endeavor. Particle size data from sediment samples collected from canals and surrounding soils indicated that during the EAP, canal use coincided with low-energy floodplain deposition of silts. The presence of bioturbation and several species of aquatic snails indicate that this site was a well-vegetated wetland environment, making the floodplain suitable for farming.  Deep erosion of the floodplain at A.D. 350 coincided with a sharp drop in site usage. There is no evidence of canal use following this period of erosion, but the artifact assemblages suggest continuity in site occupation after this period.  INTELLECTUAL MERIT  This research on canal irrigation at La Playa increases the resolution of case studies on agricultural development in the understudied region of northern Mexico, helping to address a gap in the regional approach to documenting the development of irrigation technology. The La Playa archaeological site shows low-level food production occurring later than similar EAP sites to the north, such as Las Capas in the Tucson Basin. This is compelling evidence that the development of irrigation technology is more complex than simple northward diffusion models.       The evaluation of local environmental conditions and their relationship to the timing of agricultural practices is key in understanding the regional development and demise of early earthen irrigation canals. This information contributes to the growing body of knowledge of sustainable earthen irrigation systems, an agricultural technology commonly used in arid environments today.  BROADER IMPACTS  This research is an international, interdisciplinary collaboration of scientists with contributions from the local community. Archaeological excavations have provided short term employment in an economically understimulated area. Community participation in fieldwork encourages investment and interest in local heritage. This project also supported student training in fieldwork, research, and specialized laboratory techniques for women and underrepresented groups.
