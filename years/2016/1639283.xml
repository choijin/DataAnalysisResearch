<AbstractNarration>This workshop will bring together researchers from around the world to discuss recent progress in the study of granular materials.  Granular materials are ubiquitous in a range of industrial and natural systems, yet a quantitative understanding of many phenomena remains elusive and predictive capabilities remain limited. Advances in this field require the participation of multiple scientific and engineering disciplines, each of which has its own goals and techniques. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NSF funds will be used to support the registration and travel costs for junior and early career scientists and engineers at the 2016 Gordon Research Conference on Granular and Granular-Fluid Flows. Support will also be provided to allow participation of members of underrepresented groups. Such support will fill a crucial, national need to continue to train the future work force in the science of particle technology.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Operational Summary  The Gordon Research Conference (GRC) and Gordon Research Seminar (GRS) on Granular Matter were held at Stonehill College in Easton, Massachusetts, from July 23-29, 2016.   The meeting covered a variety of scientific topics and the content presented was highly rated by participants.    Conference Participants  The Conference was well-attended with 135 participants. Scientists from academia represented 96% of the participants while attendees from government accounted for 1% and those from industry totaled 3%. The meeting also attracted a strong mix of young investigators and senior scientists.  Students and post-docs accounted for 53% of all attendees. Approximately 24% of the participants at the 2016 meeting were women.    Seminar Participants  The Seminar was well-attended with 54 participants. Scientists from academia represented 98% of the participants while attendees from government accounted for 2%. Students and post docs combined accounted for 83% of all attendees. Approximately 22% of the participants at the 2016 seminar were women.     Conference Program - GRC  Granular materials, whether dry or in combination with a fluid, are ubiquitous in both nature and industry and show a rich variety of complex phenomena. As the physical underpinnings of these behaviors continue to be revealed and new phenomena discovered, there has been sustained and strong international research from multiple disciplines including chemical, civil and mechanical engineering, physics, applied mathematics, and earth and planetary sciences. In addition, there are intriguing links between granular materials and heterogeneous systems such as glasses, colloids, emulsions and foams.

The feedback collected from the meeting was extremely positive. Evaluations included numerous positive remarks regarding the interactive nature of the poster sessions, excellent talks, and ability to network.  Feedback collected from the GRS included many positive remarks on the poster sessions and the keynote speaker.    GRC would like to thank the National Science Foundation for its continued support of the meetings.  The contributions received from the National Science Foundation have been critical to the success of the conferences and are having a measurable impact in advancing the frontiers of science worldwide.
