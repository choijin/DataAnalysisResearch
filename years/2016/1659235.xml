<AbstractNarration>The Multiple Organization Regional OneOklahoma Friction Free Network (MORe-OFFN) expands the network capabilities of Northeastern State University (NSU), Southwestern Oklahoma State University (SWOSU), Southeastern Oklahoma State University (SOSU), and Rogers State University (RSU) by connecting them to the OneOklahoma Friction Free Network (OFFN) through community-based ScienceDMZ technologies allowing the researchers at each institution to connect reliably to supercomputers and increase computational capabilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OFFN provides connection to Oklahoma's research organizations, including MORe OFFN's leadership institution for this grant, University of Oklahoma. Previously, researchers at these institutions were hampered with the lack of throughput speed when dealing with large data sets.   With the creation of a parallel research network, scholars at each of the institutions have steady access to a network that allows for the transfer of large data sets and faster information sharing. In addition to expanding research capability at each of the partnering institutions, SOSU and SWOSU are developing and team-teaching a course on parallel programming offered online to their students.  With expanded research opportunities and the development of a new course, MORe-OFFN advances undergraduate science research and education along with providing more educational and research opportunities for underrepresented communities.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Multiple Organization Regional OneOklahoma Friction Free Network (MORe-OFFN) proposal was written in response to the Campus Cyberinfrastructure Grant, specifically the Network Design and Implementation for Small Institutions program area.  The proposal focuses on expanding the network capabilities of Northeastern State University (NSU), Southeastern Oklahoma State University (SE), Southwestern Oklahoma State University (SWOSU), and Rogers State University (RSU) which will allow for their involvement in the OneOklahoma Friction Free Network (OFFN), a science DMZ that will allow researchers to connect reliably to super computers and increase computational capabilities.  In an effort to develop these connections to the network, the following will occur in the project:  The MORe-OFFN collaboration began with a desire to expand the availability of OFFN to rural, regional, non-PhD granting universities in Oklahoma.  OFFN is an NSF-funded project that created a Science DMZ offering "friction free" data transfer unhampered by traditional restraints such as firewalls. Current OFFN's site deployments include the University of Oklahoma (OU), Oklahoma State University (OSU), Langston University (LU), the University of Tulsa (TU), University of Central Oklahoma (UCO) and the Oklahoma Innovation Institute (OII); all institutions are members of the OneOklahoma Cyberinfrastructure Initiative (OneOCII) which sponsors OFFN.  The MORe-OFFN project has expanded the OFFN network from its initial ring of members to include the four regional, primarily undergraduate institutions listed above.  These institutions now have the ability to participate in research utilizing high speed "friction free" networks connected to HPC within the State and beyond.
