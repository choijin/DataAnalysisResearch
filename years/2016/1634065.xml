<AbstractNarration>This research will examine the processes through which imperial colonists and indigenous groups negotiated their identities within ancient borderlands and colonies.  Archaeology is particularly well suited for addressing issues of colonialism because artifacts can often provide visibility to members of society who may not be easily recognized in historical documents, such as low-status or subjugated peoples.  While previous scholarship viewed colonialism in the context of indigenous groups adopting the culture of the colonizers, more recently they are viewed as unique contested locations where both colonizing and indigenous groups influence each other culturally through a complex exchange of ideas, traditions, and material culture.  This project fills an important research gap by focusing on multiple socioeconomic within empires and how complex social interactions between colonists and local groups were manifested in the past.  This research has particular relevance for the negotiation of cultural differences in regions today where dissimilar ethnic groups come into contact as a result of population movement due to conflict, politics, or economic opportunity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One form of archaeological material that provides an excellent medium for examining culture contact is cuisine.  The study of ancient food practices within colonial contexts will shed light on how imperial colonists and indigenous groups modified or reaffirmed their food preferences and identities within borderlands.  The research will be conducted in the central highlands of the Peru focusing on two sites from ancient Wari Empire and an indigenous site located near one of the Wari colonies.  The Wari Empire expanded to cover much of modern-day Peru and incorporated a number of ethnic groups into its administration, yet there are no written records to understand who these people were.  As a result, the carbonized plant data from these sites will be compared to determine the cuisine of Wari colonists and indigenous groups and examine the exchange of food preferences, production, and processing strategies between Wari colonists and indigenous peoples to identify how these different groups interacted and experienced colonization.  The food preferences of colonial and indigenous groups will be reconstructed and compared through correlations between architectural space, material culture, and ancient plant remains using plant remains to highlight the ways in which these groups shared their cuisine, which will allow for a more dynamic view of colonialism in the past.  This project will generate new methods for the study of ancient cuisine and culture contact and provide hands-on training and education opportunities for students.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project investigated ethnic interaction as a result of colonialism during the Middle Horizon (A.D. 600 ? 1000) period in ancient Peru through the lens of plant foods.  Carbonized and desiccated seeds were recovered from three provincial sites of the Wari Empire: Moquegua, Cusco, and Siguas Valleys.  As food is a central aspect of ethnic identity, it is likely that there were shared aspects of foodways between the Wari provincial sites.  Food processing, cooking, and discard activities were reconstructed to illustrate the general arrangements of food use at the provincial sites. Patterns of food use were taken to represent the provincial cuisine (food related practices, ideas, norms, values) of Wari colonists.  Environmental differences and interaction with local indigenous groups could explain differences in food choice and practices between the locales.              The residues of plant-based foodways provide an opportunity to interpret everyday cooking and the ways food intersected with Wari social, economic, and political structures.  Maize (corn), chili peppers, common bean, quinoa were found at all three provincial Wari sites, suggesting that they were a part of Wari provincial cuisine.  Further, maize was found to be have been widespread at the Wari sites and appears to have been a part of status-based differences among the residents. Indeed, within two of the Wari provincial sites maize was found to be an outlier within certain households suggesting that while everyone at the site had access to maize, the residents of certain (elite) homes had privileged access to either more maize or processed maize that made it easier for them to cook or use.                Perhaps the most interesting element of Wari cuisine that was present in all analyzed assemblages was the fruit of the molle tree (also known as the Peruvian or Californian Pepper Tree).  The molle tree produces small, spherical, red fruits that have a scent and flavor similar to black pepper.  This project recovered over a million molle fruits between the three provincial Wari sites, the majority of which showed evidence of being used to brew a pepper-flavored chicha (beer) called chicha de molle. Based on this evidence, I argue that chicha de molle is an important shared element of Wari provincial cuisine and was brewed at multiple Wari colonies due to the beverages status as an element of Wari cuisine.               The Wari colonial site in Moquegua was then compared to an adjacent local indigenous site to assess how food was a medium through which colonists and local indigenous people interacted.  The analysis of plant remains from a local indigenous culture in Moquegua, dating prior to and during Wari incursion, revealed that molle seeds were used by local communities only after the arrival Wari colonists in the valley.  Thus, the arrival of Wari created a new sphere of interaction whereby local indigenous peoples began to exchange knowledge, ideas, and customs with their new neighbors vis-?-vis cuisine. Wari colonists did not have the resources, power, or intent to create wide-sweeping changes in the lives of the locals. However, food was a way in which Wari and indigenous groups interacted.  This project found evidence that indigenous people adopted Wari chicha de molle brewing practices and incorporated them into their cuisine.  The local indigenous community did not adopt the practices of their Wari neighbors wholesale, but instead integrated the practice within existing social, economic, and political structures.  Molle was found to be the most widespread and densest seed recovered from Wari sites, being present in most contexts in high amounts.  However, the use of molle for chicha by the indigenous locals was restricted to a public platform mound likely used for feasting and other civic spectacles.  This departure from Wari brewing and consumption practices suggests that while locals incorporated an element of foreign cuisine into their foodways, they did so on their own terms.              This research speaks to ethnic interaction on the borderlands and frontiers.  Borderlands are a significant component of social politics in the present as well as the past. Episodes of cultural exchange through the movement of people to or through borderlands and frontiers can result in fusion cuisines where new combinations of flavors, ingredients, and methods for preparation are created, rejected, or repurposed.  Food is therefore not only a salient form of ethnic identity, simultaneously producing cultural boundaries, but also serves as a way in which dissimilar groups can fuse, mix, reject, or appropriate the culture of others. On borderlands these types of culinary encounters may lead to new and novel forms of cultural interaction that represent an essential method for characterizing the nature of ethnic interaction in the past and present.
