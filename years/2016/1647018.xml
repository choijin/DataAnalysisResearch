<AbstractNarration>The STEM+Computing (STEM+C) program seeks to advance applied research on the integration of computing and computational thinking in elementary, middle, and high school science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education, and advance and broaden participation in computing and computationally-intensive fields. Computational thinking has traditionally been defined in the context of the discipline of computer science; however, as the other STEM fields have become more computational, computational thinking has emerged as a fundamental skill essential for students across a wide range of other STEM disciplines, such as chemistry, biochemistry, biophysics, geoscience, molecular biology, genetics, genomics, ecology, evolution, anatomy, neuroscience, applied mathematics, statistics, and modeling, simulation, and visualization, as well as some non-STEM fields (criminal justice, music, film, and animation). Given the scarcity of research defining computational thinking in the other STEM disciplines, and the equal scarcity of research on how to integrate computational thinking in the early grades through high school, there is an urgent need to bring together education researchers, K-12 practitioners, and disciplinary scientists to collaborate on the development of an evidence-based framework for defining computational thinking from an interdisciplinary perspective. A four and half day workshop will be held at the Education Development Center in Waltham, Massachusetts for participants who are studying the integration of computing and computational thinking in STEM education, to collaborate on (1) defining the specific characteristics of computational thinking as it occurs within disciplinary learning across the elementary through high school grade bands, (2) determine the appropriate grade-specific assessments of computational thinking to measure student learning, and (3) make recommendations for integrating computational thinking in pre-service teacher education. The workshop will be evaluated by an external evaluator who will observe workshop activities, conduct interviews with workshop participants and project staff, and provide a final, summative analysis of the workshop's findings to assess whether project goals and objectives have been fully implemented. The workshop will contribute unique findings on the range of pedagogies and competencies needed to effectively teach and learn interdisciplinary computational thinking in K-12, and will advance future research on learning at the intersection of computing and the other STEM disciplines, a core objective of the STEM+Computing (STEM+C) program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This STEM+C workshop studying interdisciplinary computational thinking is an 18-month effort that will be guided by a planning committee comprised of the Principal Investigators and project staff from the Education Development Center. Workshop participants will include education researchers, K-12 practitioners, disciplinary scientists, and Principal Investigators from NSF's STEM+C, ITEST, and other programs, and national thought leaders in education and computing. Participants will meet in specific grade bands (K-2, 3-5, 6-8, and 9-12), in groups organized by subject matter, and in mixed groups, to analyze the assumptions and constructs that currently undergird computational thinking in the field and in their research, and seek to identify respective skills and competencies students will need in computational thinking for STEM fields, and appropriate teacher pedagogy supporting such skills development. The project team and participants will synthesize workshop discussions and findings, and collaborate on the development of an interdisciplinary theoretical framework that will (a) describe computational thinking from an interdisciplinary perspective to progress in grade bands across the STEM curriculum, (b) convey what it means for students to think computationally within and across the STEM fields, (c) articulate grade-band recommendations for assessing students' interdisciplinary computational thinking, and (d) make recommendations for integrating computational thinking in pre-service teacher education and teacher professional development, (e) identify areas for future research on interdisciplinary computational thinking, (f) produce a landscape study of existing computational thinking assessments with a gap analysis to determine alignment of existing assessments with the workshop's framework; and (f) create working groups for disseminating workshop findings via conference papers, peer reviewed journal articles, and presentations to national STEM-education and computing stakeholders, including policymakers in states implementing computer science standards in K-12. A summative evaluation will be conducted on the workshop and its results, including field-wide assessment and peer review of the framework. The workshop will advance core objectives of the STEM+C program to evolve evidence-based approaches to the integration of computing and computational thinking in K-12 teaching and learning; innovation of approaches to assessing grade-specific computational thinking; and new teacher pedagogy integrating computational thinking.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>In a series of two workshops (August and November 2017) Developing an Interdisciplinary Framework for Computational Thinking in STEM Education convened 50+ thought leaders in Computational Thinking (CT) to lay the groundwork for a new field of study representing the interdisciplinary perspective on CT &nbsp;emerging through STEM+C funded projects. Participants considered the theoretical foundations of their work and shared both their experiences and examples of classroom activities to reach a common understanding about the nature and characteristics of CT as it occurs within disciplinary learning. The workshops produced a Framework for Computational Thinking from a Disciplinary Perspective (See Linking K-12 CT Skills image attached and Malyn-Smith et al, 2018); and a set of examples that mapped CT activities to various grade span disciplines (see Examples image attached and Lee, I. &amp; Malyn-Smith, J., 2020). Workshop results/outcomes were broadly disseminated through conference presentations and published articles, culminating in a dedicated issue of the Journal of Science Education and Technology (Volume 29, Issue 1, February 2020) containing 12 articles written by researchers and practitioners describing the Framework and lessons learned in the exploration of CT within disciplines.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>This project impacts our nation?s efforts to broaden participation in STEM.

The five elements of CT integration that emerged from the workshops (Understanding complex systems, Innovating with computational representations, Designing solutions that leverage computational power/resources, Engaging in collective sensemaking around data, and Understanding potential consequences of actions) are areas where students participate in age-appropriate versions of the computational practices of CT-enabled STEM professionals and gain understandings that would be largely unavailable without computation.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>This shift raised new questions around the role of disciplinary teachers and the development of CT assessments.
