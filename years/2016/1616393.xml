<AbstractNarration>This award supports the participation of US based graduate students, early career researchers and workshop leaders at the 31st Summer Topology Conference on Topology and its Applications, which will be held August 2-5, 2016 at the University of Leicester. This conference series originated in New York City and specializes in advancing the development of topological methods and applications to a broad range of areas including computer science, analysis, and algebra. It maintains a tradition of an inclusive attitude towards developing new application areas.  Special focus this year is on algebraic topology as well as new mathematical notions of spectrum in connection with diffraction for point-patterns modelling distributions of matter. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the conference is to present the latest developments in several areas of topology and its methods, and to foster collaborations and bridges between them. The scope of the conference includes special sessions in Algebraic Topology, Continuum Theory and Dynamical Systems, Topology and Foundations, as well as sessions featuring applications to Computer Science and Analysis. The session in Algebraic Topology will feature newly developed categorical methods. The session on Continuum Theory and Dynamical Systems will highlight recent results in hyperbolic 3-manifolds and aperiodic flows on 3-manifolds. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference website is https://sites.google.com/site/summertopology/home</AbstractNarration>

The project also made possible the inclusion of Algebraic Topology which was a new innovation to this conference series. The highlights of this component included modern perspectives on homotopical operads and applications to representation theory and mathematical physics.  The Continuum Theory and Dynamical Systems talks of the conference were in honor of Kuperberg's work on the Seifert conjecture and brought it forward to recent work on more general manifolds. Topology and Foundation has long been the core of this conference series and it attracted 38 speakers and a dozen or more non-speaking participants. It featured talks ranging from new applications of modern set-theoretic forcing methods to topological methods in understanding subsets of the weak topology on Banach spaces.  The conference also featured two well-attended workshop series: one was on Framed Manifolds, Exotic spheres, and a solution to the Kervaire invariant one problem and the second was titled "Approximating approximate symmetry".   There were 163 participants with 46 from the  US.  Other countries include UK, Austria, Poland, Singapore, Australia, Israel, Spain, Croatia, India, Holland, Canada,  Ireland, Germany, Mexico, South Africa, Italy, New Zealand, Czech  Republic, Japan, France, Sweden,  and Turkey.
