<AbstractNarration>This project will improve the awareness and perception of careers that require science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) competencies. Advocacy is a critical component of career readiness, yet current advocates (parents, guardians, educators, or members of the community) are often not in the position to inform students of potential career options. Career and workforce readiness programs are resource constrained, don't meet the needs of differing learning styles, have inherent bias, and are largely focused on compliance over student competency building. Many underrepresented youths who would otherwise succeed in STEM are often deterred by a lack of role models. If youth understood the opportunities, they could pursue academic pathways to amass skills that better prepare them to enter the workforce. Furthermore, educators need professional learning experiences and access to insights about their students in order to improve STEM teaching and learning. Helping individuals select rewarding and suitable degrees, training, and careers will increase the likelihood of higher job retention. As more individuals are inspired to pursue and stay in STEM, taxpayers will benefit from increased innovation which in turn will provide tax dollars to invest in such things as healthcare, national security, education, or humanitarian assistance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will address technical challenges of amassing and distributing massive amounts of 3rd party STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math) resource data (both structured and unstructured), developing an information management system for educators and families, developing adaptive learning skill modules, advancing a second generation smart recommendation engine based on big data, machine learning and predictive modeling techniques, and performing database mining and creating data visualizations to derive meaningful workforce development insights. In addition, the project will involve controlled experiments and usability tests whereby a large amount of anonymized and aggregated student data and business/education entity feedback will be collected. The ultimate goals of the R&amp;D and experiments are to validate that the resulting application, predictive models, information management practices, advocacy networks, and data visualizations have the desired outcome of boosting immediate and near-term student outcomes regarding STEM career intentions and actions.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Broader Impacts:     Couragion fuels the talent pipeline by improving the awareness and perception of high priority career pathways, thus boosting the number and diversity of individuals who pursue STEM-related careers. With a nationwide call for improving the accessibility and quality of STEM education, Couragion advances classroom relevance, informs student choice and transitions, and increases student retention in STEM pathways. Couragion employs equity-driven interventions and culturally relevant factors to attract and recruit women and people of color.     In success, millions of students will be more informed about career options, have access to role models outside of their friends/family, and make better career selections that are in line with their values and interests. This ultimately leads to a happier and more productive workforce that will boost innovation in STEM and improve our nation's welfare.    Intellectual Merit:    Couragion provides STEM career literacy and workforce development solutions for educators, students and advocates. Couragion partners with industry to elevate high growth/high demand career pathways and 'near peer' role models who mirror a diverse demographic. Couragion collaborates with educators to support pathway exploration, career readiness, and work-based learning initiatives with educator professional learning initiatives and student-led classroom programs. Couragion employs an impact-first methodology to capture student voice and measure changes in student perceptions and outcomes over time. Couragion's machine learning and workforce analytics generate insights about how to cultivate a STEM talent pipeline.     SBIR R&amp;D:      Couragion developed a STEM career literacy and workforce development platform aligned to labor market needs and core academic and industry standards. The platform is built as a responsive web app. It includes Quests which expose students to STEM-related careers via videos of diverse role models, self-reflection quizzes, and 'best fit' matching to their values, interests, and desired work characteristics. The platform also provides curated, personalized content, related to students 'best fit' careers. In addition, it includes industry-based, real world Challenges in which students assume job roles and practice workplace tasks to build occupational and essential skills.    The platform is accompanied by an educator tool which 1. delivers data-based decision support tools with administrative and classroom-level data to improve teaching, and 2. provides education data mining and learning analytics to measure the effectiveness of the curriculum and recommend data-driven interventions, adaptations, and improvements to support student learning.     Outcomes Study 1:    Extensive research demonstrates that Couragion's R&amp;D boosts student outcomes regarding STEM-related career intentions and actions. In a May 2020 study, 7,346 K-12 students (63.7% students of color, 46.5% female) achieved these outcomes after exposure to career literacy via Quests: 91% agreed that Couragion provided them with access to new career info; 85% found one or more best fit careers; 46% were more confident in their ability to pursue a STEM career; 47% planned to sign up for a new STEM class or activity; 82% were motivated to do better in a STEM class; and student intention to pursue a STEM career increased by 6 to 19%.    Outcomes Study 2: In a February 2020 study, 796 K-12 participants (47% people of color, 40% female) were exposed to one of two interventions: A. Challenges only or B. Quest/Challenge pairs. Participants completed a total of 1,506 Challenges.  Participants who experienced intervention A achieved these outcomes: 74.0% of students agreed that they enjoyed learning the career skills (joy); 70.9% of students were motivated to do better in their STEM assignments after completing the challenge (motivation); and 78% of students agreed that learning these skills made them feel more confident about pursuing STEM careers (confidence); and from a skills perspective, participants achieved an average of 2.5 out of 5 stars on the Challenges.  Participants who experienced intervention B saw boosts across all outcomes: joy grew by 9%; motivation grew by 15%; confidence grew by 11%; and the average Challenge score increased by 16%. Interestingly, when a participant shared the same gender or diversity as the Quest role model, their Challenge scores increased another 6 to 8%. The study results demonstrate that the access to diverse role models, career literacy, and career skill-building provided by the Couragion R&amp;D results in improved joy, motivation, confidence, and academic performance for students in their pursuit of STEM pathways.    Commercialization:      Couragion targets K-12 entities and youth-serving organizations via direct sales, strategic partnerships, and educator professional learning programs. In 2019, Couragion doubled subscription revenue and was profitable for the third year in a row.     Additional examples of commercialization success include: secured investment from AT&amp;T via the Aspire Accelerator; awarded a Colorado Advanced Industries grant; won Colorado Technology Association 'Start-Up of the Year'; named a Common Sense Education "Top Picks for Connecting the Classroom and Real World"; published research with Oracle Academy; and partnered with mindspark Learning to establish STEMpath (Grad-Level Teaching Credentialed Program) focused on Computer Science and Engineering.
