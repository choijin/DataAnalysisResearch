<AbstractNarration>General Abstract&lt;br/&gt;This project studies the effectiveness of political strategies. In particular, it evaluates the notion that political strategies that invoke threat serve to increase political participation among the affected audience.  Previous work suggests that messages invoking fear lead to a increased attention to politics, thereby increasing the likelihood of participation. In this project, the PI argues that relying on strategies focusing only on fear or threat might actually lead to lower levels of participation by activating feelings of despair. This research investigates the possibility that messages which combine threats along with messages that encourage enthusiasm might be a more effective and encourage increased participation.   Given findings that indicate strong public support for policies that deny rights to others, especially in times of crisis, it is important to assess how specific message strategies can influence citizen participation, especially as the electorate becomes more diverse.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Abstract&lt;br/&gt;Conventional wisdom posits that political participation is often facilitated by messages of threats.  This research extends that work, arguing that appeals based primarily on crises may actually be counter-productive to political mobilization. Previous work finds that fear appeals were unsuccessful in the absence of an effective alternative to the threat. This research will study the corresponding effect on political mobilization by including alternative positive messages along with threat messages.  The PI argues that a message strategy combining threat and opportunity cues can lead to a greater sense of political efficacy among individuals. Focusing on immigration policy, the PI will assess the attitudinal effects of different messaging strategies by administering two survey experiments, and by analyzing Latino-only survey responses from the American National Election Study.  The PI expects that a message combining elements of threat and opportunity is a significant catalyst for increased political participation, especially among women.  This research provides indicates strong support for the proposition that more balanced political messages are at least as successful at motivating participation among an under-represented group in American politics.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>My study, entitled "Latinos Rising to the Challenge: Political Responses to Threat and Opportunity Messages," revisits the underlying theory suggests that the use of fear tactics shakes people out of their political apathy. However, I posit that the use of fear alone may lead people to feel overwhelmed with despair, and therefore, unable to feel equipped to take action. Strategies that couple this threat tactic with opportunity messages that encourage enthusiasm and hope can mobilize people to take action and are more effective in the long run than fear tactics alone. The coupled threat-and-opportunity message approach is especially important because individuals who are exposed to a policy that they wish to see passed may be more task-focused and less distracted by negative emotions stirred by the crisis message. By using this coupled threat and opportunity strategy, people are more likely to believe their contribution makes a difference. To illustrate this, I turn to immigration policy, a highly contested policy arena with several examples of policy threats and policy opportunities (Walker and Leitner 2011).&nbsp;&nbsp;Immigration has ranked among one of the top three issues of concern for the Latino electorate for the past decade (Latino Decisions, June 2013).&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, the most prominent explanation for peaks in heightened Latino political activity is that this group has felt &ldquo;under attack&rdquo; from these policies (Pantoja, Ramirez and Segura 2001; Barreto, Manzano, Ramirez and Rim 2009).&nbsp;&nbsp;The existing literature relies on aggregate measures of threatening contexts. &nbsp;Thus, without measuring individual level perceptions of one&rsquo;s political context, it is difficult to conclude that threat alone motivates one&rsquo;s political activism.&nbsp;For example, local legislative proposals aimed at providing opportunity signals by expanding immigrants&rsquo; rights (e.g. access to driver&rsquo;s licenses), may have engaged and motivated people to take action beyond an awareness of threatening anti-immigrant policies (e.g. &ldquo;show me your papers&rdquo; clause). &nbsp;My findings are based on Latino samples from 4 datasets, including 2 survey experiments to isolate the effects of coupled threat-and-opportunity appeals on electoral and non-electoral forms of political behavior and civic engagement among large U.S.-based Latino samples (<em>n=1,001</em>; <em>n=953</em>), and analyses from the American National Election Studies (2008, 2012). Study 1 relied on external immigration policy vignettes to trigger a sense of threat and opportunity, while Study 2 involved randomizing respondents to write about their personal feelings of fear and hope regarding immigration proposals. Study 1 revealed that a message combining elements of threat and opportunity is a significant catalyst of various forms of participation, including sending a postcard to elected officials. Across the two experiments, respondents exposed to coupled-threat-and-opportunity message (or fear-and-hope) were 5-7% more motivated to join a march, talk about politics, or volunteer for an organization relative to those exposed to a control or threat message, especially among Democrats (Study 2). The ANES analyses, which involved nationally representative Latino samples, also revealed that a combination of fear and hope in 2008 and 2012 spurred greater civic engagement among Democratic respondents. My work provides strong support for the proposition that more nuanced and balanced political appeals are at least as successful, and at times more effective, at motivating Latino political behavior as appeals that only rely on threat or fear tactics.&nbsp;</p> <p>If mobilizers continue to rely on a motivating strategy based predominantly on &ldquo;sounding the alarms&rdquo; (threat), the masses are more likely to encounter battle fatigue and overall anxiety. This is problematic for our democracy because without properly motivating the masses, we may fail to create a more engaged citizenry to hold elected officials more accountable. Additionally, political elites are crafting a political environment that only heightens the &ldquo;politics of fear,&rdquo; leaving society and the government more willing to enlarge its surveillance state and support policies that deny others&rsquo; rights in times of crisis (Robin 2006; Alberston and Gadarian 2015). A democracy is<em> </em>&ldquo;a competitive political system in which competing leaders and organizations define the alternatives of public policy in such a way that the public can participate in the decision-making process&rdquo; (Schattschneider 1960, 138).&nbsp; Therefore, rather than only analyzing the isolated effect of one policy cue, it is important to capture the competitive nature of being simultaneously exposed to threat and opportunity messages in our environments. A democracy that consists of more effective mobilizing strategies will provide more portions of our electorate with the means and motivation to participate more fully (Schattschneider 1960). My findings suggest that coupling an impending threat with more appealing policy alternatives could better mobilize some to rise, and not succumb, to the challenge in front of them. Thus, a coupled-threat-and-opportunity communication strategy may be part of the much-needed antidote towards reversing a disillusioned and anxious electorate, or at the very least one that helps elites avoid triggering battle fatigue among citizens who are clinging onto the promise of a representative, responsive and competitive democracy.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 06/18/2018<br>      Modified by: Vanessa&nbsp;Nichols</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
