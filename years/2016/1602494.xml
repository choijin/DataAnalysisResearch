<AbstractNarration>To ensure the safety of the world's food supply given the threats of rapid population growth and declining arable land and water resources, innovative strategies for breeding the next generation of high-yield potential and climate-resilient crops will have to be implemented. New research strategies should create novel crop traits that have not yet been achieved in order to substantially enhance yield potential under marginal environments. How can this enormous goal be attained? It is now fully appreciated that any further improvements in genetic potential for yield, stress tolerance and water and nutrient use efficiency will have to rely on the ability to create complex genomic configurations that lead to novel biochemical and physiological traits. This project represents the use of contemporary research tools to solve an old puzzle. It represents a closer look and more strategic examination of one of the most enigmatic and relatively unexploited concepts in plant genetics, the phenomenon of transgressive variation. Transgressive variation is observed when progeny derived from two divergent parents are superior (or inferior) to both parents. Using rice to test the concept, this project will determine which DNA segments or RNA molecules cause transgressive traits for salinity and low temperature stress tolerance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will test the hypothesis that transgressive stress tolerance phenotypes in biparental cross combinations of rice are the consequences of ideal shuffling and complementation effects between two divergent parental genomes leading to genetic network rewiring. New paradigms built upon the power of regulon restructuring, regulatory non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), and DNA methylation will be explored to understand the intricate mechanisms by which novel gene expression patterns mediate transgression from parental phenotypes. By integrated use of various next-generation DNA sequencing applications such as genome-Seq, mRNA-Seq, ncRNA-Seq, and bisulfite-Seq, this project will: 1) discover stress-regulated miRNAs/siRNAs that are transgressively expressed in intraspecific recombinants with novel salt tolerance phenotypes, and those that are transgressively expressed in interspecific recombinants with novel low temperature or other stress tolerance attributes; 2) establish meaningful correlations between mRNA and miRNA/siRNA transcriptome signatures among recombinants and their respective parents to evelop hypotheses on how global gene expression is altered in transgressive segregants; and 3) establish meaningful correlations between transcriptome signatures and genome methylation profiles between recombinants and their parents to develop hypotheses on how epigenomic changes alter gene regulation in transgressive segregants. The approach will address the possibilities that: a) stress tolerance phenotypic transgression is due to regulatory genes that acquired optimal function because of compatible regulatory clusters in their new genetic background, i.e., regulon restructuring; b) network reconfiguration in recombinants is due to coupling or uncoupling of trans-acting ncRNAs and their target regulatory genes or genomic loci from either parents; and c) genome shuffling alters the methylation profiles in recombinants leading to novel gene expression signatures. Outcomes will advance our understanding of the intricacies of genetic and epigenetic networks towards applications to stress tolerance breeding in rice and other major cereal crops. The genomics datasets to be generated will be made available to the broader scientific community through public data repositories including the Sequence Read Archive of NCBI and DDBJ. The rice genetic stocks to be characterized will be made available to other researchers through the USDA rice genetic stock maintenance and distribution center.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Transgressive segregants are progenies of two genetically diverse parents with better or worse traits than both parents. The precise molecular mechanisms behind such phenomenon are not well understood to fully exploit its true potential in rice breeding, especially in developing stress-tolerant cultivars. &nbsp;We investigated the molecular mechanisms behind the superior salinity and dehydration tolerance among recombinant inbred progenies of cultivars IR29 and Pokkali. We hypothesized that genetic and epigenetic regulatory mechanisms contribute to the process biochemical network reconfiguration in transgressive recombinants. &nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Intellectual Merit:</strong> We established the gradient of stress tolerance variation across the IR29 x Pokkali recombinant inbred population by integrating data from a matrix of physiological and whole-plant level parameters under salinity (EC=12dScm<sup>-1</sup>)<sup> </sup>and dehydration (10% PEG). We have identified a transgressive salinity tolerant progeny (FL510) superior to the tolerant parent Pokkali and its other tolerant sibling FL478 with the <em>SalTol</em> QTL from Pokkali (Fig. 1). We also identified transgressive progenies with &lsquo;stay green&rsquo; phenotype under PEG-induced dehydration (FL530, FL416) although neither parents exhibited such phenotype. Transgressive traits for salinity and dehydration segregated independently, indicating that distinct genetic and biochemical mechanisms are involved. Transcriptomic comparisons across the phenotypic range were performed at the level of protein-coding mRNAs and non-coding regulatory miRNAs. We also examined the genome and methylome sequence variation across the phenotypic range. The trends revealed from all comparisons and correlations to phenotypic variation uncovered the following:</p> <p>1) Superior traits were due to &lsquo;biochemical compensation effects&rsquo; when compatible, complementary, and non-antagonistic properties from each parent are combined together in a transgressive progeny. It was evident from the transcriptome signatures that both parents have unique contributions to optimal properties of the transgressive progeny. Neither parents may be considered truly genetically inferior to the other although Pokkali is more salt-tolerant due to <em>SalTol</em> QTL. IR29 contains positive attributes that are essential for optimal tolerance mechanisms in combination with other attributes from Pokkali. We also uncovered the phenomenon of &lsquo;physiological drag&rsquo; that creates antagonistic interactions in recombinants. Even Pokkali contains negative physiological and developmental attributes that dilute the effects of other genes with positive roles in stress tolerance. Uncoupling these genetic drags from positive attributes, and coupling the positive attributes of Pokkali with additional novel enhancing attributes from IR29 creates an optimum combination of physiological and developmental properties that are neither of the parents. <em>SalTol</em> QTL from Pokkali requires complementation from IR29 genome for its full effects.</p> <p>2) Network rewiring by miRNAs is critical to &lsquo;biochemical compensation effects&rsquo;. We uncovered miRNA-target reverse coexpressing pairs and parent-to-offspring transmission signatures (Fig. 2) that support the biochemical and developmental reprogramming in transgressive progenies: a) signatures that were uniquely transmitted by Pokkali to positive transgressive progenies; b) signatures that were uniquely transmitted by IR29 to positive transgressive progenies; c) novel signatures derived from either parents and complement each other in positive transgressive progenies (synergism), or negate/dilute the effects of each other in negative transgressive progenies (antagonism); and d) novel signatures in positive transgressive progenies that were from neither parents and likely acquired through sequence changes and/or altered DNA methylation. Biochemical and developmental pathway reprogramming in transgressive progenies occur through the impacts of miRNAs on critical target transcription factors that belong to NAC, ARF, SPL/Squamosa-binding-like, and NF-y families. Expression and transmission signatures for miRNA-target pairs were outcomes of coupling-uncoupling through segregation or changes in DNA methylation.</p> <p>3) Parallel analysis of genome and methylome sequences across the phenotypic gradient that includes IR29 and Pokkali, a progeny most similar to Pokkali for salinity tolerance (FL478), positive transgressive for salinity (FL510) or dehydration (FL530, FL416), and negative transgressives (FL499, FL454) revealed that recombination configured the novel genomic composition of recombinant inbred lines. This was supported by whole-genome sequence variation across progenies and parents (Fig. 3).&nbsp; Recombination also correlated with genome methylation patterns among transgressive progenies, explaining the gain or loss of expression of certain transcription factors and/or miRNAs that are involved in biochemical and developmental reprogramming.</p> <p><strong>Broader Impacts</strong>. We have established a new look into the molecular basis of transgressive segregation in rice with far reaching impacts to crop breeding. The true potential of a genetic donor is hidden beyond its phenotype. Transgressive segregants are rare products of parental genome shuffling that lead to biochemical and developmental reprogramming, facilitated by genetic and epigenetic mechanisms involving noncoding RNAs and DNA methylation. These findings should inspire a paradigm shift in plant breeding that segregating populations from diverse parents are sources of novel phenotypic attributes even though neither parents exhibit such attributes.
