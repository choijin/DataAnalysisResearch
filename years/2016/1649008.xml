<AbstractNarration>This is the second phase of the TraceLab project, which was initially funded under an NSF Major Research Instrumentation grant.   The goal of this project is to deliver an instrument that facilitates reproducibility of Software Engineering experiments, fosters comparative evaluation, and provides an environment in which components can be easily shared across research groups.  The challenge of experimental reproducibility extends across almost every science and engineering discipline. Recently, a widely reported study conducted by the biotech firm "Amgen" revealed that of 53 previously published landmark papers, only six were reproducible. Recent studies have unearthed similar problems across a diverse set of Software Engineering domains, including, but not limited to, software traceability, feature location, and compiler optimization.  Reproducibility is often undermined by lack of publicly available datasets, obsolete and unavailable tools, insufficient details about the experiment, and undocumented decisions about the way various metrics are computed.  TraceLab provides a plug-and-play experimental environment, as well as libraries of shareable components and seminal experiments.  As such, it is designed to address these problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TraceLab introduces a radically different way of approaching empirical software engineering research and paves the way for greater community collaboration, more rigorous evaluation of results, and an easier entry-way for new researchers.  It is expected to lay the foundation for future advances in the field of empirical software engineering, accelerate and shape future research directions, support industrial pilot studies, and significantly reduce the cost and effort that oftentimes discourages new researchers from entering the field.  In addition, the project will provide opportunities to a diverse group of undergraduate and graduate students, and will be used for educational purposes across various software engineering courses.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Systems traceability is a crucial aspect in any safety-critical or mission-critical system.  Examples of such systems include medical devices, railway signals, autonomous cars, and financial systems.  Traceability empowers project stakeholders to ensure that hazards have been fully mitigated and rigorously tested in a deployed system.  Effective traceability means that the general public can have confidence that software intensive systems will function correctly, for example, by ensuring that a medical infusion pump delivers correct doses of medicine or that a signaling system safely controls train movement.   While conceptually simple, the task of establishing and maintaining trace links is arduous and error prone.  As a result, trace links in industrial projects tend to be incomplete and inaccurate, and to become outdated over time.   To address this problem, researchers are exploring diverse solutions for automating the creation and evolution of trace links.  Solutions include the use of information retrieval, machine learning, and deep learning techniques based on natural language processing, structural code analysis, and techniques that mine process information from software repositories.  The TraceLab project supports this research by delivering a platform for designing and executing traceability experiments. Researchers can use the platform to build components in diverse programming languages and to design experiments in a plug and play environment.  Furthermore, the platform enables researchers to share infrastructure, facilitating benchmarking efforts and accelerating research in this area.  The TraceLab platform, and its datasets, have been used by hundreds of researchers to explore novel traceability solutions across diverse domains.  TraceLab has been deployed across multiple platforms, including high-performance ones, making it practical for use in large industrial projects.   TraceLab has therefore empowered research and has contributed to significant advances in the accuracy of traceability solutions today.  In addition to its direct benefits, the TraceLab project has contributed to building an informed workforce, by providing research and training  opportunities to graduate and undergraduate students in domains such healthcare, railway systems, defense, and unmanned aerial vehicles.
