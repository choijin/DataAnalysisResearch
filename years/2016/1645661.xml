<AbstractNarration>One of the challenges toward achieving the vision of smart cities is improving the state of the underground infrastructure. For example, large US cities have thousands of miles of aging water mains, resulting in hundreds of breaks every year, and a large percentage of water consumption that is unaccounted for. The goal of this project is to develop models and methods to generate, analyze, and share data on underground infrastructure systems, such as water, gas, electricity , and sewer networks. The interdisciplinary team of investigators from the University of Illinois at Chicago, Brown University, and Northwestern University will leverage partnerships with the cities of Chicago and Evanston, Illinois, to make the approach and findings relevant to their stakeholders. Research results will be incorporated in courses at the three institutions. Outreach efforts include events for K-12 students to develop awareness about underground infrastructure from a data and computational perspective. The results of the project will ultimately help municipalities maintain and renovate civil infrastructure in a more effective manner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cities are cyber-physical systems on a grand scale, and developing a precise knowledge of their infrastructure is critical to building a foundation for the future smart city. This proposal takes an information centric approach based on the complex interaction among thematic data layers to developing, visualizing, querying, analyzing, and providing access to a comprehensive representation of the urban underground infrastructure starting from incomplete and imprecise data. Specifically, the project has the following main technical components: (1) Generation of accurate GIS-based representations of underground infrastructure systems from paper maps, CAD drawings, and other legacy data sources; (2) Visualization of multi-layer networks combining schematic overview diagrams with detailed geometric representations; (3) Query processing algorithms for integrating spatial, temporal, and network data about underground infrastructure systems; (4) Data analytics spanning heterogeneous geospatial data sources and incorporating uncertainty and constraints; (5) Selective access to stakeholders on a need-to-know basis and facilitating data sharing; and (6) Evaluation in collaboration with the cities of Chicago and Evanston.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ As the underground infrastructure systems of cities age, maintenance and repair become an increasing concern. The project has investigated a smart data management framework for underground infrastructure systems that addresses the dimensions of map construction, data integration, data analytics, security, and visualization.   The project is part of an NSF-funded collaborative effort by investigators working at Brown University, Iowa State University, Northwestern University, and University of Illinois at Chicago.  Selected project results are summarized below:  Taking into account sensitive and proprietary data that may be associated with underground infrastructure, we have conducted a security analysis of the vulnerability of geospatial databases that support searches on encrypted data. In particular we have addressed k-nearest neighbor queries on a database with two-dimensional geospatial attributes (e.g., find the k closest points of interest to a given map location) assuming that the database is encrypted according to the searchable encryption framework. We have developed an attack that is able to reconstruct with high accuracy the geospatial attributes of all the database records, given a sufficiently large sample of encrypted responses.  We have conducted experiments on real-world datasets that demonstrate the effectiveness of the attack in practical settings.  Motivated by the need to control access to information about underground utilities networks, have investigated the problem of privacy-preserving queries on networks in the searchable encryption model. We have developed an efficient encryption scheme for networks that supports a broad class of queries about reachability and shortest paths between nodes. We have analyzed the security of this scheme and experimentally evaluated its practical applicability.  We have contributed the development of GUIDES, a new data conversion and management framework for urban underground infrastructure systems that enables city administrators, workers, and contractors along with the general public and other users to query digitized and integrated data to make smarter decisions. Within the GUIDES framework, we have focused on the design of algorithms that identify and correct errors and infer missing elements in AutoCAD drawings for urban infrastructure systems by means of context aware preprocessing and data integration techniques across data layers.   The project provided professional training opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students.          Last Modified: 01/05/2020       Submitted by: Roberto Tamassia]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
