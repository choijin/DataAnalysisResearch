<AbstractNarration>Citizen science-based approaches to monitoring environmental quality are increasingly being deployed. This study seeks to understand what characteristics of citizen science volunteers will predict their effective and long-term participation in this type of study. Growing interest in the potential benefits of citizen science has been accompanied by an increasing focus on technological tools to ensure high quality participation and data validity. In the case of water quality monitoring, the health and quality of the environment being monitored could have very real implications for its use by the volunteers themselves. Better knowledge of the motivations of volunteers, commitments, or abilities could lead to simpler, more reliable strategies (including study design or participant recruitment and training) for ensuring data validity than a technological approach might. Through an exploratory study of participants in a coastal water quality monitoring program, this project will test the hypothesis that citizen science participants, who are more vested in the resource they volunteer to monitor, will generate more reliable, valid data for use in scientific research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study's mixed method design draws upon and integrates diverse theoretical literatures on local ecological knowledge, place attachment, and citizen science-based environmental monitoring. In so doing, the proposed work addresses a fundamental gap in knowledge about the effectiveness of the participation of citizen scientists and the quality of their data collected by citizen science is influenced by the citizen scientists' relationship to the environmental resource they volunteer to study.  The present study will use citizen volunteers to map the spatial extent of freshwater plumes from two watershed outlets along the central coast of California: San Pedro Creek and San Lorenzo River. Both watershed outlets, discharge adjacent to popular beaches and surf spots. In the Mediterranean climate of California, urban and stormwater runoff represents one of the most important sources of pollution to the coastal ocean. Unlike many other citizen science activities that recruit volunteers to complete research tasks online, coastal water quality monitoring citizen science programs provide for the circumstance in which volunteers may be personally vested in the findings of the research?that is, through their physical use of  the place or resource or through their health and wellbeing. . This proposed research seeks to fill this data and knowledge gap by testing the hypothesis that participants who are more vested in the resource they volunteer to monitor will contribute more reliable, valid data to citizen science projects. As environmental quality monitoring efforts increasingly rely on citizen science to collect data, these insights will inform study design and volunteer recruitment and training, as well as suggest approaches for public engagement with and education in science generally. It is anticipated that findings from this study will lead to actionable recommendations for improving the design and deployment of other citizen science-based research projects in the future.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Among the biggest threats to coastal water quality are freshwater discharges. It is difficult to predict the spatial extent of freshwater plumes at marine beaches because flow in the surf zone is complex. As an alternative to deploying expensive instruments or developing sophisticated computer models of surf zone flow, this study utilized a participatory science approach to make many simple measurements along the shoreline to estimate freshwater flow patterns. The goals of this study were to&nbsp; work with volunteers to estimate safe swimming distances at beaches that receive polluted discharges, and test whether informational feedback to volunteers increased retention.</p> <p>A full-scale pilot study was run in 2017 to test volunteer sampling instruments and protocols and learn about volunteer motivations for participating. Fifty-four volunteers participated by performing weekly shoreline sampling for up to thirteen weeks and completing pre- and post-project questionnaires. Based on these pilot data, sampling protocols, volunteer training, and volunteer questionnaires were amended for the final study, conducted in 2019. In 2019, 46 volunteers participated over 12 weeks by collecting 1,452 salinity measurements at beaches near the mouths of two central California freshwater discharges and completing participation surveys.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Findings on both the physical and social sciences sides of this study hold intellectual merit-oriented. On the physical science side, salinity measurements yielded 145 distinct estimates of safe swimming distances (D<sub>90</sub>), spanning a range of environmental conditions during rainy and dry periods at two popular beaches. These are the first data showing that volunteer sampling campaigns can collect scientifically robust data to estimate flow patterns in the surf zone. Median D<sub>90</sub>s were 150 and 100 m at San Pedro Creek south and north, and 490 and 330 m at San Lorenzo River west and east, respectively. At both San Pedro Creek and San Lorenzo River, D<sub>90</sub> increased when adjacent freshwater discharge rates increased. At San Pedro Creek, D<sub>90 </sub>decreased when tide level increased, possibly due to the shape and slope of creek mouth.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>On the social science side, this was the first study to experimentally test strategies for promoting volunteer retention in a participatory environmental science study. Volunteer retention is critical for the success of participatory science studies. This study tested whether supplying volunteers with project data throughout the project, rather than waiting for a report following the project, increased their retention in the study. Results indicated that on average the odds of volunteers conducting sampling decreased by 4% (95% CI: 1%, 7%) with each successive week. The randomized intervention providing repeated data feedback via email to volunteers did not affect their retention in the study. This is an important finding for two reasons. First, volunteers who viewed more data reports were more likely to conduct sampling more often. However, the experimental design of this study revealed that this correlation was not attributable to data reports causing elevated participation. No other participatory environmental science studies have been able to infer causal relationships between volunteer or study characteristics and participation. Second, while previous studies reported that volunteers are motivated by increased project feedback, this study found that communicating this feedback via email did not translate into increased levels of sampling. Perhaps feedback that is communicated in person, or at field sites where sampling occurs, would better serve to alter volunteer behavior.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>This study also produced broader impacts in terms of both scientific findings and public education. First, providing a scientific basis for safe swimming distances is important for effective beach management. San Mateo County, where San Pedro Creek is located, currently encourages beachgoers to remain at least 300 ft (90 m) from a flowing creek or storm drain when making water contact. This distance corresponds to the 30<sup>th</sup> percentile of D<sub>90</sub>s measured at San Pedro Creek in this study. To be more health protective, San Mateo County could consider increasing the recommended swimming distance to 130 m (420 ft) or 180 m (580 ft), which would be sufficiently far to result in 90 percent dilution of San Pedro Creek water in approximately half or three quarters, respectively, of days in winter and spring. This information was communicated to San Mateo County Health Department officials.&nbsp;</p> <p>Second, numerous non-professional scientists were engaged in scientific processes for understanding coastal water quality. One hundred volunteers were trained and equipped with sampling supplies to perform coastal water quality monitoring. These volunteers reported conversations about the study with numerous other beachgoers they encountered in the process, increasing this project?s reach. Volunteers in both 2017 and 2019 campaigns learned about project results by attending online or in-person results presentations, which included overviews of coastal processes that are important for water quality and flow patterns. Results were also presented to state and local stakeholders at the 2019 California Water Data Science Symposium and a 2019 CA Safe&nbsp;to&nbsp;Swim&nbsp;Network&nbsp;meeting, hosted by CA Water Resources Control Board.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 04/07/2020<br>      Modified by: Alexandria&nbsp;Boehm</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1644300/1644300_10447137_1586292950718_TOCmultiplepeople--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1644300/1644300_10447137_1586292950718_TOCmultiplepeople--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Citizen science to determine water quality"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1644300/1644300_10447137_1586292950718_TOCmultiplepeople--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Citizen science to determine water quality"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Citizens using refractometers, and the data they collected.
