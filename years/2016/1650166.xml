<AbstractNarration>Rifting is the process by which continents get stretched and ultimately break apart, potentially leading to the formation of a new ocean basin. Active rifting is currently underway throughout large extents of North America, for example within the Basin and Range Province, along the Rio Grande River in New Mexico, and in the Gulf of California. Rifting areas often focus natural resources (e.g., hydrocarbons, metals, geothermal heat) and can be associated with significant seismic hazards. Understanding the processes that shape rift architecture and landscapes is therefore essential on both a fundamental and societal level. This project specifically investigates the sensitivity of two key rifting processes: fault growth and magmatic activity to topographic stresses, which are forces in Earth's crust due to the build-up of topographic relief. Such stresses are known to affect continental deformation where tectonic plates collide (e.g., Taiwan, the Himalayas), but little is known regarding their influence on continental rifting. These stresses are strongly modulated by the erosive action or rivers and glaciers, and the weight of sediments accumulating in basins and lowlands. This study will combine numerical models and field observations to assess how such active surface processes influence fault development and the spatial extent of volcanic activity during rifting. It will support an early-career scientist as well as a minority graduate student. The products of this study will be widely distributed as part of scientific outreach initiatives, and provide material for educators and wilderness conservation areas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Numerous field and theoretical studies have addressed the feedbacks between surface processes and strain localization in convergent margins at the scale of entire orogens (100?1000 km). However, very little work has been done in extensional settings, where magmatic processes are an integral part of plate boundary evolution, and sizeable topography grows at the scale of individual normal fault-bounded ranges (10?100 km). The goal of this study is to couple existing rifting models with a realistic parameterization of landscape evolution in order to uncover feedbacks between topography growth and tectono-magmatic deformation at depth. Specifically, the project will first document the full range of mass redistribution efficiency in rifts worldwide using a landscape evolution model that allows direct comparison with observables, e.g., the total relief of normal fault footwalls, the morphology of their major catchment basins, and the sedimentary infill of the hanging wall block. We will then implement these calibrated landscape models as an upper boundary condition in a long-term tectonic model where faults can form spontaneously and magmatic intrusions respond to the ambient stress field. A large suite of numerical simulations will enable tests of the following hypotheses: (1) Denudation of the footwall and deposition on the hanging wall are essential in allowing half-grabens to accommodate offsets commensurate with the thickness of the faulted upper crust; (2) Horst formation is promoted by inefficient surface processes, which preserve relief and favor the build up of topographic stresses near the fault; and (3) Efficient redistribution of surficial masses focuses magmatic activity to the rift axis. Model outputs will be systematically compared with field observations of fault growth and volcanic emplacement to identify the contribution of surface processes to the tectono-magmatic evolution of continental rifts.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Deformation of the Earth's crust primarily occurs at the boundaries between tectonic plates. There, slip on major faults bends and breaks crustal blocks to form mountains and basins, and magma sometimes ascends within the crust, feeding volcanoes. These processes create topography, which is continually reworked by surface processes: winds, glaciers and rivers erode relief, and the resulting sediments fill the adjacent basins. About two decades ago, numerical modeling studies started to hint at the possibility that effective leveling of topography could profoundly affect the way the crust deforms, by favoring slip on a few very long-lived faults (as opposed to forming multiple short-lived faults).

The goal of this project was to investigate feedbacks between surface processes and deformation at continental rifts, where two plates move away from one another and magmatism is widespread. We developed numerical models of continental rifting where a fault creates topography that can be partially leveled by rivers, or filled with sediments. We calibrated our models of fluvial incision on real rift landscapes to make sure we were not exaggerating or underestimating the erosive power of rivers, i.e., that our models were representative of present-day Earth conditions. We found that increasing the erosive power of rivers, within realistic bounds, led to a significant increase in the lifespan of individual fault, that is: the amount of time the dominant fault in the rift will stay active before a new fault breaks. By considering the energetic cost of relief development and fault slip, we developed a simple theory to explain this effect. We also modeled the intrusion of magmatic fissures within the crust, which is sensitive to local stresses, including stresses induced by relief.
