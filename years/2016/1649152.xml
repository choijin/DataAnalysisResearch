<AbstractNarration>Computational models of preferences are important for recommendation and decision-support systems, with applications including long-term planners, smart homes, and health-care monitors.  Because there is a trade-off between the expressivity of preference representations and the ease of reasoning with them, most personalized preference-based systems rely on either statistical models of similar individuals, or very simple models of one individual?s preferences.  We propose to work with conditional preference models, which can represent more complex preferences.   Our work will be to develop better algorithms for reasoning about preferences over complex outcomes or scenarios, given such models, and also to extend the model to be able to reason about repeated choices over time.    In addition, the PI will use preference modeling software in her outreach to schools, colleges, and the general public to show ways that computers can model and reason about preferences.  The PI has a record of supporting a diverse group of students, including students from the LGBTQA community, students with learning disabilities, women, and people of color. Thus, the broader impacts include outreach and a software package, which will be publicly available, for outreach about AI and preference handling, contributions to the infrastructure of preference reasoning research, and support of diversity in computer science.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The first part of our proposal is to work algorithms for deciding, given a conditional preference network (CP-net) and two outcomes, which outcome is more preferred.  We will organize a competition, perhaps based on the ICAPS International Planning Competitions, for these algorithms.  Secondly, we will explore two models of temporal preferences:  Temporal Conditional Choice Networks (TCC-nets) and hidden Markov models (HMMs).  We will develop an iPhone app, CommuteRoute, to collect individuals? choices over time of routes between home and work.  This data, stored as feature vectors, will (in future work) allow us to test algorithms for learning and reasoning with TCC-nets, and comparing those algorithms to extant HMM algorithms.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The primary focus of this project was a particular mathematical formalism for representing conditional preferences over multi-featured objects, called CP-nets, or conditional preference networks. CP-nets allow a user to specify that their preference over one feature (say, color) depends on the values of other features (say, make and model).   We continued work on whether human preferences, as expressed in laboratory experiments, were consistent with CP-net representations, and also looked at generating example CP-nets so that any of a given set of CP-nets (for instance, all CP-net preferences over 13 binary (two option) features, where no feature preference depends on more than two other features) is equally likely.  The CP-net generator allows researchers to test their hypotheses about CP-nets and CP-net algorithms by randomly sampling from classes of CP-nets, and testing the hypothesis or algorithm.   Because human preferences do not appear to consistent over repeated choices, we investigated a probabilistic variant of CP-nets called PCP-nets.  One can interpret a PCP-net as modeling an inconstant preference, or a set of preferences that are aggregated each time a choice must be made.   Our interest in preferences led us to investigate a formal model of how voters determine their preferences over candidates, and what candidates choose to reveal, in order to appeal to particular audiences.  What we found is that this formal model leads to easy calculations for the politicians --- given some very strong assumptions about their audience --- but intractible calculations for voters.  It is unclear whether this indicates errors in the model, or explains that voters use heuristic methods to calculate whether candidates align with their preferences.  Finally, we looked at ways of tweaking multi-winner election schemes to increase the likelihood of electing diverse groups of winners, while still respecting the preferences of the voters.
