<AbstractNarration>The National Science Foundation uses the Early-concept Grants for Exploratory Research (EAGER) funding mechanism to support exploratory work in its early stages on untested, but potentially transformative, research ideas or approaches. This EAGER project was awarded as a result of the invitation in the Dear Colleague Letter NSF 16-080 to proposers from Historically Black Colleges and Universities to submit proposals that would strengthen research capacity of faculty at the institution. The project at Hampton University aims to explore ternary metal halides for multi-functional applications, in particular for nuclear radiation detection and infrared solid-state gain media. If this project succeeds, it will result in the development of novel materials with improved functionalities for various applications and lead to significant industry impact. This project is co-funded by the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The development of wide-gap compound semiconductor crystals based on ternary metal halides is proposed for applications in nuclear radiation detection and infrared (IR) photonics. In this EAGER project, exploratory research will be performed on the material preparation and bulk crystal growth of metal halides. The proposed semiconductors will also be grown with rare earth dopants for applications in IR solid-state gain media. The work includes: the synthesis of candidate materials; purification studies and bulk crystal growth experiments; rare earth doping of purified crystals; and material characterization and modeling for applications in nuclear radiation detection and long-wavelength IR gain media. The exploratory and untested aspect of the proposed EAGER project lies in trying to combine the unique material properties of metal lead halides for two important applications with different physical mechanisms. Detailed studies on the role of defects and impurities on the optical and electrical properties of these materials will be performed as a function of temperature and elemental composition. Material purification and control of defect/impurity levels within the grown bulk crystals will be critical for deriving structure-property relations impacting possible device performance.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectural Merit:  The research performed in this project has provided new insight and knowledge in the materials development and characterization of  ternary metal halide semiconductors with composition CsPbX3, TlPbX3, and TlPb2X5 (X=Cl,Br) for potential applications in nuclear radiation detection and infrared lasers. Several purification steps were performed on halide precursors including directional freezing, zone-melting, and chlorination/bromination. Following synthesis, vertical and horizontal Bridgman technique were employed for single crystal growth of ternary metal halides. Rare earth (Pr3+,Dy3+) doped crystals were prepared using purified rare earth halides and evaluated as infrared laser gain media.  The development of wide-gap semiconductors for room-temperature nuclear radiation detection continues to be of great current interest. In this project TlPb2Br5 has been identified as a potential new radiation detection material with high energy resolution. Furthermore, the prepared Pr3+ and Dy3+ doped TlPb2Br5 crystals have shown promising  IR optical properties, with efficient mid-IR emission (3-5 ?m) at room temperature.  In addition, it was observed that the rare earth doped materials of CsPbX3 and TlPbX3 composition were of significantly lower quality and were moisture sensitive.   Broader Impact:  The research performed in this project has the potential to impact several technological developments related to new nuclear radiation sensors and IR solid-state fluorescence materials. The dual functionality of the investigated class of materials (undoped and rare earth doped wide-gap halide semiconductors) can be of critical importance for technological applications including gamma-ray detection, mid-IR solid-state lasers, all solid-state  optical refrigeration, and IR fluorescence taggants. The investigated undoped  TlPb2Br5 crystal has shown promising results for application as a new radiation detector material with high energy resolution. Compared to TlBr,  TlPb2Br5 exhibited a higher mechanical strength with  very low moisture sensitivity. Rare earth doped TlPb2Br5   crystals are a promising for mid-IR laser development with importance for laser-remote sensing applications, environmental monitoring, bio-chemical sensing, and defense related countermeasure techniques. Besides it impact on research, this project has offered research and education opportunites for several students from underrepresented minority groups. In addition, researchers and studens working on this project have also participated in several K-12 STEM outreach activities.
