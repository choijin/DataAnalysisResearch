<AbstractNarration>The mean temperature of the earth is determined by the balance of incoming and outgoing radiant energy at the top of the atmosphere, and the outgoing energy generally increases and decreases with mean temperature.  The temperature dependence of outgoing energy stabilizes earth's climate, as an increase in temperature produces an increase in outgoing energy which cools the planet, and a decrease in temperature has the opposite effect.  The restoring effect of temperature on outgoing energy can be quantified by a climate feedback parameter which summarizes the net effect of a variety of mechanisms which together determine the global effect.  For internally generated climate variability such as El Nino, which produces a temporary increase in global temperature, the feedback parameter determines how quickly the temperature will return to its long-term climatological value.  For externally forced climate change, such as the warming produced by an increase in carbon dioxide (CO2), the feedback parameter determines the amount of warming that will ultimately occur as a result of the radiative effect of the CO2 increase.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is commonly assumed that the same feedback parameter applies very generally to global temperature changes produced by internal climate variability (like the temperature increase during El Nino events) and permanent climate change forced by increases in carbon dioxide (CO2) and other external factors.  But preliminary work by the PI and others suggests a systematic difference between parameter values calculated from internal variability and forced change simulations in climate models, possibly due to differences in the spatial patterns of temperature anomalies associated with internal variability and forced change, and the fact that different feedback mechanisms are prominent in different regions.  A difference in feedback strength between forced response and internal variability would complicate efforts to estimate the feedback parameter from observations, as the necessary observations include satellite measurements of the incoming and outgoing top-of-atmosphere radiative fluxes that are only available for a 15-year period.  Changes in radiative fluxes over such a short period are dominated by internal variability, thus the feedback parameter value derived from them would only be representative of internal variability and should not be used to assess the sensitivity of climate to CO2 increases.  A further issue identified by the PI is that the feedback parameter may have strong decade-to-decade variability, at least in long model simulations of climate under present-day conditions.  Such variability, likely also related to the spatial patterns of temperature anomalies and their consequences for specific feedback mechanisms (for instance the albedo feedback associated with ice and snow which generally occur at higher latitudes), would also have to be taken into account when attempting to estimate climate sensitivity from observations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project considers possible differences in feedback parameter between internal variability and forced change, as well as the possibility of decadal variability in the feedback parameter, using a combination of observations and model simulations.  Much of the work focuses on an alternative feedback parameter based on the mean temperature at a mid-tropospheric level (500mb), as parameter values calculated at this level show greater agreement between observations and simulations than their counterparts based on surface temperature. This agreement motivates further examination of the processes contributing to differences in feedback parameter in model simulations, which have the advantage of very long periods of record and outputs which include detailed breakdowns of hard-to-observe quantities such as the longwave and shortwave radiative effects of clouds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The work has broader impacts due to the desirability of constraints on how much warming can result from increases in atmospheric CO2 and other greenhouse gases, particularly given the large uncertainty in estimates from model simulations. The project also supports two graduate students, thereby providing for the future workforce in this research area.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Climate sensitivity is one of the most important numbers in climate science. It quantifies how much the planet will warm in response to the emission of a fixed amount of greenhouse gas. Thus, this quantity sits as the foundation of future predictions of global warming.  Scientist have been trying to estimate this quantity for decades, including from paleoclimate data (e.g., the warming/cooling associated with ice ages), the warming of the last 150 years, and from computer models of our climate system.  Such efforts have generated a wide range of possible values.  One of the big challenges that this proposal was designed to address was to understand why different ways of estimating climate sensitivity yielded such different values.    In our first two papers, we looked at a climate model that had been run many times, leading to runs with different versions of weather variability in them [Dessler et al., ACP, 2018; Adams and Dessler, GRL, 2019].  We found that normal weather variability (where it's hot in one place and cold in another) could have an immense impact on the inferred climate sensitivity.  This helped explain why estimates based on the last 150 years of warming were disagreeing with other estimates.  In another paper [Dessler, J. Climate, 2020], we did a more thorough examination of the ways that climate variability and climate change (warming everywhere) could lead to errors in inferring climate sensitivity.  These calculations all require adoption of a framework for describing the Earth's energy balance.  The source of energy for the Earth is the Sun, and it is balanced by energy the Earth radiates back to space.  We want to have a simple way to describe how much energy the Earth radiates, and it is traditionally assumed that this is proportional to global average surface temperature. We investigated an alternative energy balance framework where we set energy radiated back to space as being proportional to atmospheric temperature [Dessler et al., ACP 2018; Dessler and Forster, ACP, 2018].  In many cases, this works far better than the traditional approach.  We used this alternative framework to produce our own estimate of climate sensitivity [Dessler and Forster, JGR, 2018], which agrees well with the newly emerging consensus estimates.  We also used this alternative framework to evaluate the ability of computer simulations of the climate to reproduce estimates of the feedbacks that amplify direct warming from carbon dioxide [Chao and Dessler, submitted to J. Climate, 2021].  We show that this alternative framework allows for more robust comparisons.  Finally, we have looked at the impact of climate variability on our estimates of future warming [Zhou et al., Nature Climate Change, 2021].  We find that, if we held our present atmospheric composition constant, there is enough carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases to push warming beyond the Paris Agreement target of 2&deg;C.
