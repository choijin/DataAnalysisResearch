<AbstractNarration>A workshop will be held at Whiteface Mountain Observatory to bring together a small group of scientists to design a coordinated measurement strategy to improve the fundamental understanding of cloud-chemistry processes and improve multi-phase chemistry representation in regional and global-scale models. The measurement strategy will include coordinated field, laboratory and modeling studies that address key scientific questions on clouds and chemistry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The expected results of the workshop are: (1) a state-of-the-art protocol for cloud water sampling and paired measurements of key aerosols and trace gases, (2) a plan for a coordinated field, modeling, and laboratory investigation to improve the knowledge of cloud chemistry in the context of the cloud's physical and optical properties, (3) a strategic model development plan to improve representation of cloud chemistry, and (4) preliminary and publicly available chemically characterized cloud samples. The workshop agenda pairs senior and junior scientists at all stages to provide opportunity for younger investigators while ensuring a high likelihood of success by involving senior scientists with proven track records.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    Approximately 40 researchers attended the Whiteface Mountain Cloud Chemistry Workshop on 16-17 September 2016 at the Marble Mountain Lodge near Wilmington, New York to design a coordinated investigation of the effect of clouds on tropospheric composition.      The workshop reviewed past mountaintop cloud chemistry studies, including Whiteface Mountain activities, the Great Dun Fell experiments in northern England, and the Mt. Schm&uuml;cke experiments in Germany, to learn about successful operations and needed improvements with mountaintop cloud chemistry studies. With the idea that a future field campaign would be held at the Whiteface Mountain Observatory, results from regional and 0-dimensional box model studies were discussed to learn what might be expected in terms of atmospheric composition and cloud chemistry effects on that composition. The workshop highlighted the importance of the following science objectives for future field campaigns.     Quantify the impacts of clear-sky sampling bias in chemical characterization of the troposphere. Identify key oxidants driving aqueous phase chemistry, through radiometric and chemical analysis, especially for organic compounds. Quantify how aerosol characteristics and gas-phase composition change as a result of cloud processing. Identify chemical tracers for cloud processing. Quantify entrainment and transport of chemical constituents into the free troposphere. Determine the importance of aqueous-phase biological processes on aqueous chemistry.      With these objectives in mind, workshop participants discussed the capabilities at Whiteface Mountain for conducting a cloud chemistry experiment and how such an experiment would be designed.  Whiteface Mountain Summit Observatory routinely collects and analyzes cloud water samples during summertime, while the Marble Mountain Lodge site hosts National Atmospheric Deposition Program (NADP) and Clean Air Status and Trends Network (CASTNet) monitors. Based on hourly data, the summit of Whiteface Mountain experiences cloud 20-60% of the time during June to September, making Whiteface Mountain an excellent location to investigate aqueous chemistry in warm, low-level clouds.      We desgined and created a website with more information about the Whiteface workshop, previous research findings and what future work might hold:   https://www2.acom.ucar.edu/cloud-chemistry            Last Modified: 05/02/2017       Submitted by: Ann Marie G Carlton]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
