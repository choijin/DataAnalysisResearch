<AbstractNarration>By comparing differences in the population genetic structure of parasites that disperse in different ways, this study will determine how increases and decreases in dispersal influence that structure. Understanding how and why populations are structured is a major goal of evolutionary biologists because the resulting population genetic structure affects rates of local adaptation, speciation and extinction. This study will examine the population genetic structure of lice that live on the feathers of pigeons. Natural populations are typically subdivided, or genetically structured, because geographic or ecological factors influence the chance that two individuals will mate. One major factor that influences population genetic structure is dispersal, the movement of individuals from one place to another. When individuals disperse to new populations, they mate with individuals in the new population reducing population genetic structure. We know little about how dispersal affects the magnitude of this structure. Host-parasite systems offer highly tractable systems with which to study how different modes of dispersal influence population genetic structure. This study will do so by examining population genetic structure of different parasite species that are located on the same host individuals. In addition, this study will produce an inquiry-based activity aimed at middle-school students, "Hitchhikers guide to the city: Lessons from lice," and will contribute to the training of graduate and undergraduate students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this study, researchers will use a pigeon-louse, host-parasite system to investigate how population genetic structure differs between two species of parasitic feather lice (Order: Phthiraptera) that differ in their ability to disperse. The study will investigate the role of vertical dispersal and horizontal dispersal in structuring the populations of wing lice and body lice that occur on Rock Pigeons (Columba livia).  Although these lice are ecologically very similar, wing lice can disperse phoretically using flies, whereas body lice do not. Despite the pervasiveness of phoresy, the affect that this dispersal mechanism has on the population structure of these organisms is unknown. Researchers will use a nested sampling design to collect lice from different host individuals, in different flocks, in different regions of the world. They will sample in regions where flies are present, and where flies are not present and phoresis cannot occur. They will use microsatellite data to determine the relative role of vertical and horizontal-phoretic dispersal in structuring louse populations.</AbstractNarration>

Understanding how genetic variation is structured and the factors that govern this process is a major goal of evolutionary biologists because the degree to which populations are structured affects rates of local adaptation, speciation and extinction.  This project examined how one life history trait influenced gene flow and genetic differentiation in populations. Specifically, this study compared related species of parasitic feather lice that are ecologically very similar, but explicitly differ in dispersal behavior. Wing lice (Columbicola columbae) frequently engage in phoresis or "hitchhike" on the pigeon lousefly (Pseudolynchia canariensis), while body lice (Campanulotes compar) do not.  This study shows that even rare dispersal events of wing lice on flies leaves a substantial genetic fingerprint.  In this case, the presence of flies increased the genetic diversity of phoretic wing lice.  In regions where flies are absent, the genetic diversity of wing lice decreases and is much more similar to that of body lice (which are never phoretic).  This study suggests that interactions between different species in other community can have lasting genetic effects on organisms involved. For many species, genome wide genetic diversity is correlated with life history, and this diversity can affect an organism's development, fitness, and ability to deal with diverse and changing environments.  More broadly, these results underscore the importance of conserving intact ecosystems, since even small changes to biodiversity of these systems can influence the genetic diversity of the remaining members.  Broader impacts resulting from this project include educational activities and interaction with a local 8th grade science class, and presentations at scientific meetings.  This funding also supported a female graduate student, which is an under-represented group in STEM fields.                Last Modified: 07/11/2018       Submitted by: Sarah E Bush]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
