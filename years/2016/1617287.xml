<AbstractNarration>The University of Wisconsin-Madison proposes to organize a workshop for NSF REU Site Principal Investigators (PIs) from all disciplines. This award is supported by Directorates for Biological Sciences (BIO), Computer and Information Science and Engineering (CISE), Education and Human Resources (EHR), Engineering (ENG), Geosciences (GEO), Mathematics and Physical Sciences (MPS), and Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences (SBE).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the 2016 Pan-REU PI workshop is to leverage best practices from all disciplines and promote collaboration. The meeting will involve approximately 80 PIs from across the REU community representing the full diversity in terms of discipline, type of institution, and demographics. These PIs will be nominated by the NSF program officers responsible for REU programs in each directorate. A smaller group of PI leaders reflecting the diversity of the REU program will form a Steering Committee to develop the meeting agenda. One predetermined agenda item is to discuss an online student assessment survey, which has been developed specifically for NSF REU programs. This survey will provide significant cost savings and allow analysis of student training outcomes within a program and across programs. The Pan-REU PI workshop is structured to provide both large group settings for dissemination of key information, such as the online student assessment survey, and to facilitate sharing of best practices and promote collaboration in small group and networking sessions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop will allow all disciplines to provide input in the design and use of the student assessment tool, which would be available to any PI of an REU Site program. The tool, when properly implemented, will result in significant savings to the programs. In addition, the aggregate data resulting from the collective use of the tool can be very useful for evaluation researchers. The workshop materials and findings will be reported to NSF and made available to the entire REU community.  More information is available by contacting the PI, Dr. Janet Branchaw at branchaw@wisc.edu.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ A workshop for principal investigators of Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site programs funded by the National Science Foundation was held on April 28-30, 2016 at the Holiday Inn Rosslyn in Arlington, Virginia. The workshop theme was "Leveraging Excellence Through Collaboration Across REU Programs."

Additional key recommendations are to include the PAN REU community in development of tools for participant tracking to satisfy the America Competes Act, and to take greater advantage of existing reporting data for documenting REU outcomes.  Recommendations / Action Plans  1. Strengthen the Pan REU Community  Officially create and support a Pan REU Leadership Council Increase frequency of Pan REU workshop meetings Maintain a Pan REU website with shared resources (e.g., assessment tools, PI professional development opportunities, alumni stories, etc.) Establish sub-committees for specific interest groups (e.g., minority serving institutions, community colleges) with ex-officio membership on the Pan Leadership Council Establish partnerships with other undergraduate research organizations (e.g. CUR)  2. Evaluation of REU Programs and Tracking of REU Participants  The Pan REU community should be given the opportunity to educate and inform the process by which NSF fulfills the participant tracking requirements for the America Competes Act. The REU community needs support to determine how to define and evaluate REU outcomes and impact. The REU community should contribute to defining REU community goals and performance metrics The existing data submitted to NSF in annual reports should be mined, utilized and made available in aggregate for evaluation purposes An NSF ID number for REU applicants or participants should be created for tracking purposes   3. Access to and Quality of REU Opportunities  Promote the demand for and access to REU opportunities across a broad population of students Expand the student conference travel award program. Offer professional development opportunities to REU program directors and research mentors to promote high quality programming and effective mentor-student relationships.   4. REU Program Solicitation Revisions  Solicit input from the REU community when revising the REU program solicitation Continue support of a broad diversity of specific program goals and approaches; avoid narrow or rigid criteria for success, unless there are clearly documented evidence-based practices. Articulate the definition of broadening participation   5. Advance Congressional Awareness and Support of the REU Program  Individual REU sites should inform members of congress and their staff about the REU program Develop and disseminate best practices for sharing with Congressional members and staffers. Develop a 1-page student highlights template that program directors can use when communicating with congress.                                                  i.
