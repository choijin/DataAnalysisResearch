<AbstractNarration>An award is made to Saint Francis University's School of Sciences to acquire a Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) system to measure gene expression and assess gene copy number.  This shared instrument will support faculty and faculty-student collaborations among multidisciplinary fields including cell biology, environmental engineering, biochemistry, psychology, ecology, and developmental biology.   Its overall impact is expected to be broad in environmental assessment and reclamation because of the numerous anticipated research projects that will make use of this instrument.  Hands-on training with this well-established molecular tool will also enhance undergraduate biochemistry and molecular biology courses.  Finally, the instrument will be widely utilized in high school summer outreach programs to further educate and excite young minds.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Due to the different disciplines involved, there will be a wide variety of projects supported by this award.  An environmental engineering project focuses on determining better ways to alleviate abandoned mine drainage, a common pollutant in Pennsylvania?s watersheds.  Two ecology-based projects, one seeking to create a better understanding of how diatoms are classified while the other will concentrate on understanding which proteins may be responsible for enhanced survival of dragonflies in cold temperatures. An animal development project will look at several genes to determine if they play a role in insect eye size.  Three projects that will use mouse models or cell cultures have applications towards human injury and diseases.  For example, a study applying stress to mice will provide insight into the molecular mechanisms underpinning susceptibility and resilience to chronic stress. A project exploring the signaling pathway of deer velvet antler extract, a substance commonly used by injured athletes, may lead to wider applications of the extract to treat injuries and organ regeneration.  A study highlighting the transcription complex of mitochondrial genes will provide insight into how mitochondria initiate gene expression. This research is physiologically relevant to human diseases that have been linked to mitochondrial dysfunction.  In addition to the research benefits, these projects will enhance student learning within the School of Sciences and result in undergraduate presentations at local and national conferences, as well as student-authored publications.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ There were three major goals for "MRI: Acquisition of a Real-Time PCR System for Undergraduate Research and Education including Science Outreach": further research efforts conducted by faculty, enhance undergraduate research and training, and expose high school students to molecular biology techniques.  Over the course of the three year grant, over 140 high school students from rural Pennsylvania and surrounding states attended Saint Francis University's STEM summer academies.  High school juniors and seniors received hands-on experience with the real-time PCR system.  Students were tasked with isolating DNA from their own saliva, amplification of the Alu gene on chromosome 16, followed by gel electrophoresis to visualize the PCR product. An additional 300 undergraduate and graduate students seeking to futher their understanding of genetic counseling, biology of cancer, vertebrate physiology, and of molecular techniques via pcr and real-time pcr experiments.  Research projects utilizing the system were conducted by undergraduates and several high school students. One group sought to understand thermoregulation of dragonflies by determining heat shock protein 70 gene copy number differences in early and late fall dragonflies.  Another group examined the effects of repeated stress on behavior and corticotropin-releasing hormone receptor gene expression in mice.  In the final project, students compare the frequency of the multidrug resistant gene mutation in herding and non-herding dogs of central Pennsylvania.  Overall, 450 high school and undergraduate students were exposed to and received training on the real-time PCR system in efforts to expand and enhance their scientific knowledge.
