<AbstractNarration>1604272&lt;br/&gt;Boreyko, Jonathan B.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ice formation can heavily compromise the mechanical integrity and energy efficiency of systems such as aircraft, marine structures, power grids, wind turbines, and HVAC systems. The economic cost of ice formation amounts to billions of dollars every year. Active methods of removing ice include spraying chemicals or using electric heating, but such techniques are environmentally and energetically costly. Surfaces that could, by themselves, suppress the growth of ice for many hours or even days would therefore be highly advantageous, but to date, no such surface exists. This proposal seeks to develop smart surfaces that suppress the growth of ice without any mechanical or electrical intervention, leaving the majority of the surface dry even under chilled and humid conditions. The proposed surface will have miniscule structures that will guide the deposition of water in such a way as to reduce ice formation. System optimization will be obtained by modeling the thermodynamics and fluid dynamics of vapor transfer in vapor-liquid-ice multiphase systems, which could also shed fundamental insight on the behavior of mixed-phase clouds. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this proposal is to gain a fundamental understanding of the localized pressure gradients and resulting source-sink interactions between ice, water, and water vapor and to exploit this knowledge to passively suppress the in-plane growth of frost.  Using a combination of experimental, theoretical, and computational techniques, the following research tasks are proposed: (1) Characterizing Inter-Droplet Frost Growth: In-plane and out-of-plane inter-droplet ice bridging between a frozen droplet and supercooled liquid droplet will be characterized using a custom-built humidity chamber and hydrophobic surfaces bonded to Peltier stages.  The resulting data will be correlated with an evolving-boundary computational model.  (2) Creating a Dry Zone around Ice: When a water droplet is frozen before surrounding condensate has a chance to grow appreciably, a stable dry zone forms between the ice droplet and the condensation.  An isolated droplet will be frozen just above the dew point and then the humidity will be raised to observe and model the resulting dry zone.  (3) Suppression of In-Plane Frost Growth: With the knowledge gained from the previous two tasks, a controlled array of microscopic stripes of ice will be formed on a chemically and/or physically patterned surface, such that the dry zone about each stripe of ice will overlap to keep the vast majority of the surface dry from condensate and frost. A fuller understanding of inter-droplet evaporation and ice bridging in mixed-phase water systems will clarify the thermodynamics and fluid dynamics of frost growth on surfaces and give experimental insight to the Wegener-Bergeron-Findeisen process of glaciation in mixed-phase clouds.  Furthermore, the proposed research will map out the critical phase space where the vapor gradients result in ice bridging versus dry zones.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ We are all familiar with the silica gel packets that are included in our packages and medicine bottles.  Silica gel is hygroscopic, which means that it preferentially collects moisture from the air to keep the surrounding material dry.  But did you know that ice is also hygroscopic?  In this NSF sponsored research, we revealed how the hygroscopic properties of ice govern the growth of frost and can even be exploited to promote anti-frosting surface technology.  Our three primary outcomes can be summarized as follows: (1) Characterized incipient frost formation on surfaces, (2) Revealed when dry zones can form about hygroscopic ice, and (3) Developed a passive anti-frosting surface technology.  We will now explain each of these outcomes in more detail.     (1) Using top-down microscopy, a cold stage, and a humidity chamber, we captured how frost first forms on a surface under a wide variety of conditions.  We developed a comprehensive model that explains a process we term "inter-droplet ice bridging" that is responsible for the initial layer of frost.  The mechanism for ice bridging is the hygroscopic nature of ice, which causes a frozen dew droplet to harvest water molecules from a neighboring liquid dew droplet.  This collected water forms as an ice bridge, which grows toward the liquid droplet to eventually touch it and freeze it.  Now this newly frozen droplet grows an ice bridge toward the next liquid droplet, and so on, until the entire population of dew droplets has frozen into frost.   (2) When the nearest liquid droplets are sufficiently far away from the ice, the liquid completely evaporates before the ice bridges can connect.  We call this a "dry zone."  Validated by exhaustive experimentation, we developed a model that predicts when dry zones versus ice bridges occur, and also predicts the size of a dry zone for any weather condition.     (3) By using either chemical or physical patterns, we templated a series of microscopic ice stripes on chilled surfaces.  This array of fine ice stripes created overlapping dry zones, where no frost was able to form on the intermediate surface areas.  We showed that this concept can be exploited to keep at least 90% of a surface frost-free even under extremely chilled and humid conditions.  This concept was demonstrated for both planar surfaces and cylindrical cables.    The growth of frost on various infrastructure and vehicles results in billions of dollars in economic losses every year in the US alone.  Therefore, our development of a passive anti-frosting surface technology, where the vast majority of the surface stays dry, has a very broad practical impact.  Especially when considering that active methods of frost removal, such as using antifreeze or salts, are both expensive and environmentally harmful.  The impact of our work was broadly disseminated by media outlets such as Scientific American and R&amp;D Magazine.  We also made a local impact to our community by hosting summer camps for middle school and high school students, where we attached magnifying lenses to their smart phones to show them inter-droplet frost growth at work.    In terms of intellectual merit, surprisingly, the phenomenon of inter-droplet ice bridging was almost completely ignored in the past despite its primary importance in frost growth.  Our models that capture when frost can, and cannot, grow on a surface are therefore an important breakthrough with regards to having a fundamental understanding of frost and the importance of inter-droplet interactions.
