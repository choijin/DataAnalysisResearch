<AbstractNarration>String theory, in the search for the ultimate laws of nature, places mathematical objects known as algebraic curves at the center of the modern framework of fundamental physics, generating new mathematical questions and pointing to plausible answers with an amazing pace and persistence. Questions to be investigated in this project lie at the crossroads of two major pathways in mathematics of the past two centuries. One of them is the in-depth pursuit of the intricate properties of algebraic curves, in the form inherited from works of Gauss, Abel, Jacobi, Riemann, Klein, and Poincare. The other is the broad conceptual landscape of mathematical physics, dictated by the progress of classical, statistical, and quantum mechanics, and often associated with the names of Hamilton, Maxwell, Gibbs, Poincare, Hilbert, Einstein, and Weyl. Some of the questions under study are motivated by mathematical questions arising out of string theory; in turn, the research is expected to provide feedback to string theorists inspiring previously unanticipated directions of research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The specific aim of this project is to develop a new chapter of the Gromov-Witten theory, that is, the theory of topological invariants of phase spaces of Hamiltonian systems, where the characters of permutation groups, acting by renumbering of marked points on the Cech cohomology of coherent sheaves over moduli spaces of stable maps of holomorphic curves to a target Kahler phase space, are studied and computed. The ongoing and forthcoming research of such permutation-equivariant K-theoretic Gromov-Witten invariants is to include: (a) constructing these invariants and exploring their general properties; (b) developing the symplectic loop-space quantization formalism for representing the invariants by generating functions; (c) establishing the appropriate Quantum Riemann-Roch Theorems to provide the complete adelic characterization of permutation-equivariant K-theoretic Gromov-Witten invariants in terms of cohomological Gromov-Witten invariants; (d) developing the fixed-point-localization techniques for computing permutation-equivariant Gromov-Witten invariants; (e) applying the techniques in order to obtain K-theoretic analogues of the mirror formulas (i.e., to identify toric q-hypergeometric functions with certain genus-0 permutation equivariant Gromov-Witten invariants of toric manifolds); (f) introducing and studying the K-theoretic mirrors (i.e., complex oscillatory representations of such q-hypergeometric functions, and the corresponding D_q-modules); (g) elucidating the role of the groups of q-difference operators acting by hidden symmetries in the permutation-equivariant quantum K-theory, and exploiting these symmetries to reconstruct all the genus-0 invariants of toric manifolds from the respective q-hypergeometric functions; (h) expressing twisted permutation-equivariant K-theoretic Gromov-Witten invariants in terms of the untwisted ones by combining the boson-fermion correspondence with the adelic characterization in higher genus; and (i) exploring the relationships between quantum K-theory of the point target space and the q-analogues of the KdV-hierarchy of integrable systems, anticipated by analogy with the Witten-Kontsevich theorem for cohomological Gromov-Witten invariants of the point.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The key outcome of this project is the "All-Genera Quantum Hirzebruch &ndash;Riemann &ndash; Roch formula". The very name of the formula speaks of heritage, and its ancestry is what is elucidated below.  In his famous 1854 lecture at G&uml;ottingen, Bernhard Riemann presented the main goal of geometry as the problem of classification of what we now call "Riemannian metrics". One of his results establishes that constant curvature Riemannian metrics on a genus g surface (where g=0 for spheres, g=1 for donuts, g=2 for pretzels, etc.) are classified by 3g-3 complex parameters&mdash; moduli. This fact, together with the "Riemann&ndash;Roch formula", proved by his student Gustav Roch in 1863, and intertwining certain integer characteristics in geometry and topology of Riemann surfaces, are among the deepest results of the 19th century algebraic geometry.  A century later, in 1954, in a spectacular culmination of a very eventful decade in the development of algebraic geometry and topology, Friedrich Hirzebruch obtained a generalization of the Riemann-Roch formula from Riemann surfaces to algebraic varieties of any dimension by connecting their recently invented algebraic-geometrical and topological characteristics.  While the general idea of Riemannian metric famously inspired (circa 1915) Albert Einstein's classical theory of gravity, the theory of Riemann surfaces found its way into physics only six decades later: with the emergence of string theory, seeking to reconcile gravity with quanta. There a propagating curve ("string") sweeps a Riemann surface.  The main outcome of the present project is yet another level of generalization of the Riemann&ndash;Roch formula, which establishes a Hirzebruch-like connection between geometric and topological characteristics, this time &mdash; for the moduli space of strings propagating inside a given algebraic variety.  The epithet "quantum" in the formula’s name has dual significance underscoring its conceptual integrity. In one sense &mdash; concerned with the formulation of the question &mdash; it is reminiscent of Richard Feynman’s fundamental insight that a quantum object (here a quantum string) can, with a certain probability, follow any trajectory at all (hence the moduli space parameterizing all such trajectories). Yet in the other &mdash; concerned with the form of the answer &mdash; the (actually complicated) formula, expressing the requisite algebraic-geometrical characteristics in terms of the topological ones, has a distinctive structure, meaningful in the context of quantum mechanics. Namely, the "global" algebraic answer is assembled from "local" topological data in a way how a multi-part quantum-mechanical system is built from its entangled constituents. (Or, somewhat metaphorically but friendlier: how a very large integer is reconstructed from its remainders modulo relatively small primes according to the ancient "Chinese remainder theorem".)
