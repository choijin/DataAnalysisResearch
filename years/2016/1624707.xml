<AbstractNarration>Tropical manakins are an extraordinary group of birds with numerous physiological and anatomical adaptations that underlie their magnificent social systems and courtship routines. Whereas previous study of these birds has been performed on wild populations, aviaries built at the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute (STRI) in Gamboa Panama will be used to maintain birds in captivity under semi-natural (surrounded by forest) conditions.  Some birds housed in these aviaries will be used for breeding purposes to enable collection and study of manakin embryos and hatchlings.  Other birds will be used for long-term study of the development of behavior, for hormonal or behavioral manipulations, for physiological measures using miniaturized telemetry, for hybridization studies and for tissue collection from birds of known lineage and behavioral and physiological condition. Importantly, the study of manakins is now in an excellent position to progress rapidly as a very high quality genomic sequence is now available for the golden-collared manakin (Manacus vitellinus) of Panama, and genomes have recently been completed for two other genera. These resources create excellent potential for using genetic resources to understand how these behavioral, physiological and morphological phenotypes develop.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recently, a cohort of manakin biologists was awarded a NSF Research Coordination Network (RCN) grant to stimulate genome-enabled, multidisciplinary study of this bird group.  The research objectives of this group, as well as that of many other avian biologists, will be able to progress more rapidly by the study of birds in these semi-natural captive conditions. In addition, the presence of STRI scientists as well as the large number of visiting scientists that visit STRI in Gamboa will encourage collaboration and the creation of new scientific endeavors with application to other vertebrates and even humans.  Moreover, video coverage of the birds in the aviaries will be made available to the public for teaching purposes. For more information please visit http://www.stri.si.edu/.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Biological investigation is more and more multidisciplinary, whereby scientists with diverse backgrounds often focus their attention on novel organisms to understand basic biological concepts and mechanisms.  Such is the case for studies of a fascinating group of birds, the manakins or Pipridae of the new World tropics.  These birds exhibit a diverse array of social systems that often involve males performing complex physical and acoustically novel courtship displays.  Biologists interested in evolutionary mechanisms, ecological adaptations, anatomical and physiological specializations and novel genomic structures are working to tackle significant questions regarding manakin biology.  For the most part, manakins live in tropical rainforests which make them difficult for some of in depth studies required by biologists.  To assist with the study of these birds, we were granted funds by NSF to construct three large outdoor aviaries on property owned and managed by the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute (STRI), the foremost center for studies of tropical biology in the world.  Three aviaries were built on the edge of rainforest near the town of Gamboa in central Panama.  These aviaries were designed to hold a number of individual birds for long-term breeding of animals, for long-term studies of behavioral development and for other work that would be impossible to do on wild birds of the forest.  Pilot studies on one species, the golden-collared manakin of Panama (Manacus vitellinus) showed that birds could readily adapt to aviaries of this size, to establish breeding courts and assemblages and to perform their full range of natural behaviors.   These new aviaries were constructed to withstand the extreme rainforest environment with its vast amounts of rain, but also to ensure the birds were kept safely free of predators including snakes, small wild cats and small forest hawks.  The aviaries were also constructed with electric connectivity for sophisticated video monitoring and plumbing for watering during the dry season.  The aviaries are also within ~75 meters of a newly constructed STRI laboratory facility so that work on manakins can readily proceed into laboratory research without needing to transport birds or tissues over long distances. The aviaries are currently being planted with native flora that is naturally utilized by manakins.  Beginning with the next dry season (January to April), golden-collared manakins will be collected and the aviaries populated with this species.  These aviaries represent a very valuable resource for STRI.  The rainforest has an extraordinary diversity of birds that are ripe for investigation and these aviaries will provide opportunities for new study, even of non-manakin species as needed.  A committee of avian biologists has been assembled who will review proposals for the use of the aviaries and will grant access to the facility based on the merit and expected success of the proposed project.  Our own lab groups already have ideas that include breeding and hand-rearing of birds to investigate the genetic basis of developmental events that produce adult specialized muscles and neural circuits, as well as skeletal anatomical specializations.  Such information will provide insight into normal development and help identify genes and control of gene expression that underlies neuromuscular and skeletal adaptation in animals.  In summary, NSF funding of these aviaries for investigation into tropical bird biology stands to expand opportunities for investigation into novel areas of avian biology and to attract new and diverse scientists in the study of novel animal behavior and its genomic, physiological and evolutionary underpinnings.  Because such work often involves students and post-doctoral fellows, there is an excellent opportunity for training of a new generation of biologists using multidisciplinary approaches and unique avian models from the tropical rainforest.
