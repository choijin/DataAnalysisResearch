<AbstractNarration>This is a collaborative project that will comparatively evaluate the experiences of expatriated Indian industrial information-technology and bio-technology engineers, those who stay in the US and those that migrate back to India. The researchers will acquire pertinent primary data by conducting in-depth interviews with 60 returned Indian engineers and scientists, and then compare that with the experiences of 60 Indian engineers and scientists currently employed in the US industrial sector; they will also interview some Indian entrepreneurs who have returned to India to start their own companies. The results of this research will be disseminated through publications in journals, and by presenting at conferences. They will serve to deepen the bonds between the US and India as they build upon their national resources and expertise toward furthering joint research. They will be integrated into graduate and undergraduate courses on human resource management, workforce diversity, and industrial policy. In addition, the researchers will employ students from under-represented groups. Their institution is one of only two universities in the nation that is both a Minority Serving Institution and a Carnegie Very High Research Activity university; it has a large Hispanic student and Native American student population.     &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project has two distinct aims: To understand why industrial engineers and scientists return to their home country, and to develop theoretical understanding of changes in the social construction of nationality with transnational migration. They will meet these aims using qualitative methods, as indicated above, and their results will serve to complement existing models of return migration, which overwhelmingly focus on the economic impacts. The researchers claim that it is important to include social, professional, and political experiences that help shape these decisions. The findings of this study will potentially inform research on human capital, science and technology development, transnational migration, and immigration patterns and policies. With national borders becoming invisible in the world of science and technology, the researchers expect to show that the process of return migration among engineers and scientists is anything but a zero sum game. This study complements an earlier NSF supported study by this collaborative team of foreign-born academic engineers and scientists who returned to India after working and living in the US.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p class="Default">There is agreement among scholars, government officials and industrial leaders that women and minorities are under-represented in the US science and engineering (S&amp;E) workforce. Attracting workers to S&amp;E is seen as a matter of national economic security and the key to establishing scientific lead. For the US to maintain its global competitiveness and leadership in S&amp;E, it is critical to maintain a highly skilled, innovative and diverse workforce. Despite numerous broadening participation initiatives to increase women and minorities representation in S&amp;E, foreign-born engineers and scientists have facilitated the growth in the S&amp;E workforce. The rising number of foreign-born men and women in the S&amp;E workforce indicates the US increasing reliance on them for its rapidly growing S&amp;E needs. Though it was rare for foreign-born engineers and scientists in the US to cut their links with their home countries completely, very few from developing countries returned in the past. Increasingly today, foreign-born engineers and scientists are returning to their home country after acquiring education and/or training in the US, which have become highly desired assets in many developing countries. It has led some to use the term ?reverse brain drain? to explain this process. Since the scientific enterprise of the US is heavily dependent on the foreign workforce, losing scientific talent in the form of reverse migration can impede the scientific health of the country. The study sheds light on an understudied, but an important area of reverse migration among industrial engineers and scientists.

In the area of international migration, our study shows the limitations of various push-pull theories to explain why scientists and engineers from developing countries migrate to developed countries. Migration is not a one-way movement of people from developing to developed countries. Findings show that the reasons for return migration are not the inability to earn wages as expected or lack of assimilation in the host country. Our study indicates that the decision to return was due to better opportunities for building their careers namely becoming entrepreneurs, which was not possible for them in the U.S. Others moved back to avoid hassle with U.S. immigration. This study, therefore, does not support return migration as a failed experience. At first glance, international migration of stayers appears to be one-way migration and return migration of leavers as two-ways migration. This suggests the physical movement of people from one country to another. However, stayers and leavers remain connected to India and the U.S., respectively.
