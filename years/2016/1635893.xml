<AbstractNarration>The formation of calcium carbonate (CaCO3) in seawater is a fundamental pathway in the marine carbon cycle. Calcium carbonate formation may occur through biological production (calcification by organisms building shells or skeletal material) or through non-biological (abiotic, or chemical) processes. Although most surface seawater in both open and coastal waters is supersaturated in calcium carbonate, several factors inhibit the abiotic production of calcium carbonate. Therefore the current paradigm is that most calcium carbonate formation in seawater is biological. However, laboratory experiments have demonstrated that addition of solid-phase particles to supersaturated seawater promotes nuclei-induced CaCO3 precipitation (NICP) by providing "seeds" for precipitation. NICP has been demonstrated in the Little Bahama Banks during events of re-suspension of CaCO3-rich sediments. Until very recently, essentially no evidence has shown that NICP occurs in typical marine systems where suspended particles have relatively low CaCO3 content. A recent study by the Israeli partners in this project provides evidence that NICP may play a significant role in the carbon budget in the Red Sea, as a result of an influx of particulate material caused by flash floods and potentially airborne dusts. Such a finding suggests that NICP may be an important CaCO3 formation pathway that has been mostly ignored in the ocean carbon cycle. The goal of this project is to conduct the first comprehensive, in-depth study to evaluate the significance of NICP in the oceans.  The project is an international collaboration between U.S. and Israeli scientists, jointly funded by NSF and the U.S.-Israel Binational Science Foundation. A postdoctoral researcher whose Ph.D. work forms the foundation for this study will be supported through this project. An Israeli masters-level student and one U.S. minority undergraduate intern will be advised and trained in this project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will use an integrated approach to assess different mechanisms that may result in NICP, including riverine sediment input, land-derived particle influx via flash floods, bottom sediment resuspension, and atmospheric dust input. Field investigations will be done in a suite of coastal environments: the northern Red Sea, the Mississippi and Sabine River plumes and Galveston Bay in the northern Gulf of Mexico, each of which receive significant quantities of non-carbonate rich sediments. The investigators will also conduct controlled laboratory experiments to verify and extend field observations. If NICP is shown to be significant, this finding could promote a reexamination of important parts of the carbon cycle and the response of the ocean carbon system to ongoing perturbations.</AbstractNarration>
