<AbstractNarration>This research will form a theory of robotic cutting and manipulation of soft and irregularly shaped objects. Applications of the results are leading to more skillful dexterous robots geared for a range of industrial applications, improving safety risks, and increasing reliability and consistency. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The technical goal of this project is to understand in depth about manipulation of delicate, flexible, and slippery items, handling of tools with skills, coordination among robotic arms and hands, and motion planning and control based on multi-modality sensing and deformable modeling. The project consists of two phases. The first phase develops strategies for basic maneuvers of cutting devices, tackling issues that include vision-guided hand placements, large deformable modeling in real time, pickup and stabilization, and dexterous grasping and re-grasping. The second phase investigates coordination of two robotic arm-hand pairs to carry out cutting, and synthesizes trajectories and controls to implement different cutting skills. Technical issues to address in this phase include material viscoelasticity, contact detection, cut planning and execution on the fly, arm and hand trajectory planning, and fusion of visual and force data.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Home robots are a lasting public obsession.  They carry a high promise for relieving people from daily chores and offer a bright future with low-cost health care for the growing elderly population. Automation of kitchen skills stands out as a major technical challenge at the core of which lie slicing and chopping of raw foods.  Existing robotic cooking systems, meanwhile, are often specially designed, targeted at processed foods, and incapable of handling natural foods unless prepared by humans in advance.  The goal of this project is to understand in depth about manipulation of delicate and flexible objects such as natural foods, handling tools such as kitchen knives, and demonstration of knife skills such as slicing and pressing via robot control and planning.  For the purpose of knife control we have modeled forces due to fracture and friction experienced by a kitchen knife during the cutting of an object, as well as deformations experienced by the latter.  For a robotic hand to pick up the knife, we have designed a dexterous maneuver that first pivots the knife and then carries out finger gaits on its handle until a firm grip is achieved.   With a robotic arm capable of force sensing we have developed a scheme to cut through an object with speed in a sequence of three moves: pressing, touching, and slicing.  Each move is guided by a separate control strategy over the knife's position and/or its exerted force, with smooth transitions between adjacent moves.  Experiments conducted over multiple types of fruits and vegetables have exhibited natural cutting actions like would be performed by a human hand.
