<AbstractNarration>The selection of mates and subsequent production of offspring are key components of the evolutionary process, but what behaviors do animals employ to access mates? In this dissertation project, the co-PI will investigate the aggressive and affiliative strategies that young male chimpanzees use to mate with females and how these strategies change during development. Results of this research will clarify our understanding of the development of coercive behaviors in male chimpanzees and may provide a perspective on the evolutionary context of this behavior. In addition, this research will contribute to the conservation of endangered chimpanzees and other wildlife through educational outreach efforts at the research site. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Male animals frequently compete for mates. As they do so, relatively large, strong, experienced, and old males are typically favored in competition and consequently sire offspring. Prior research conducted at Ngogo in the Kibale National Park, Uganda, however, indicates that young adult and adolescent male chimpanzees, who are socially and physically immature, father many offspring. Adolescent males father infants born to adolescent females, while young adult males sire the infants of adult females. In this project, the co-PI will collect behavioral and morphological data on an large cohort of adolescent and young adult male chimpanzees at Ngogo, to investigate the strategies young male chimpanzees employ to mate with females and how these strategies change during development. Specifically, she will examine whether young male chimpanzees use aggression to coerce females to mate with them and whether sex differences in body size affect their ability to do so. In addition, she will determine whether young males improve their evolutionary fitness by affiliating with adult females during infancy and juvenility when males are still dependent on their mothers or later during adolescence by forging strong social bonds with adolescent female peers.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>In most mammal species, mothers are the primary caregivers of offspring. Offspring care requires so much time and energy that at any given moment, few females are able to mate and conceive, causing a shortage of mates that presents the greatest challenge to male reproduction. To reproduce, males must fight others to obtain matings. Males who win such contests are typically the biggest, strongest, and most-experienced individuals. However, relatively small, weak, and young males still manage to reproduce using &ldquo;alternative&rdquo; strategies that allow them to avoid direct combat with other males. In our closest living relatives, chimpanzees, multiple males and multiple females live together in large groups with up to 200 members. Males and females mate promiscuously, but males do not sire equal numbers of offspring. High-ranking males father the most offspring, and males achieve high status by challenging others in physical contests. Long before male chimpanzees are contenders in the dominance hierarchy, however, they can father offspring. Males become capable of reproducing at the start of adolescence (~9 y) when they are still physically and socially immature. At the end of adolescence (~16 y), males reach adult size, but they may be 20 before they integrate themselves into the male hierarchy. Despite these disadvantages, adolescent (9-15 y) and young adult (16-20 y) males father more than one-quarter of all offspring of known paternity in the Ngogo chimpanzee group that we study. In our research, we are investigating the alternative strategies young males use to mate females, and how these strategies change as males grow older. To do so, we studied the social behavior of 20 adolescent males and 10 young adult males over two years. We outline our findings below.</p> <p>Each of our male subjects has at least one female with whom he affiliates in multiple ways, including maintaining close spatial proximity, grooming, comforting (e.g. embracing, holding hands), sharing food, and for younger males, playing. Male affiliative behavior extends to the offspring of females. Males spend more time grooming, comforting, and playing with infants and juveniles if they share a close relationship with their mother. Males also show aggression to the same females with whom they affiliate, shaking branches to intimidate them, charging and chasing them, and occasionally hitting, kicking, and biting them. Affiliation with and aggression to specific females affects male mating success. Males frequently mate their close female social partners and females to whom they direct aggression.</p> <p>Affiliative behavior has the largest effect on mating success for young adolescent males. When males are still young and small, they also behave aggressively to females, but females ignore them or retaliate with aggression. By the time males are 15, females rarely retaliate and regularly give pant grunts, calls of subordination, to them. Once males dominate females, female-directed aggression begins to function as sexual coercion. Consequently, the impact of aggression on mating success increases as males grow older, but even then aggression has the largest impact on mating success when it occurs between pairs who affiliate.</p> <p>Taken together, results of our research increase our understanding of male chimpanzee reproductive strategies. These findings also have important implications for understanding male-female social relationships in our own species. Male chimpanzees form bonds with female chimpanzees. Bonded pairs mate and have offspring together. Males also groom, comfort, and play with the offspring of females to whom they are bonded; these same offspring are likely to have been fathered by these males. Male chimpanzees also dominate females and occasionally use coercion to control their sexual behavior. For humans, too, bonds between males and females can involve affiliation, co-parenting, and sometimes coercive violence.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 08/09/2019<br>      Modified by: John&nbsp;C&nbsp;Mitani</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Image         </div> <div class="galControls onePhoto" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation onePhoto" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1613392/1613392_10441587_1565210278619_boskokhut--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1613392/1613392_10441587_1565210278619_boskokhut--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Bosko and Khutulun"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1613392/1613392_10441587_1565210278619_boskokhut--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Bosko and Khutulun"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Bosko (right), an adolescent male chimpanzee grooms Khutulun (left), an adolescent female chimpanzee, with whom he shares a strong affiliative bond.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Jeremy Clift</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">John&nbsp;C&nbsp;Mitani</div> <div class="imageTitle">Bosko and Khutulun</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
