<AbstractNarration>Cornell University will host a summer REU (Research Experiences for Undergraduates) program in astronomy and planetary science. Each summer, eight students will spend ten weeks at Cornell engaged in research in Space Sciences.  The program will strive to recruit diverse cohorts including students from underrepresented groups, students from colleges and universities with limited local research infrastructure, and students with unusual academic careers. Students will work within a small research group involved in groundbreaking science, attend a series of lectures and workshops, and participate in other activities that will introduce them to broader scientific topics as well as the nature of professional careers in astronomy and the processes by which major facilities and missions are designed, constructed, and deployed.  The research and professional development programs will help students to understand the nature and ethics of scientific research and the skills and process necessary to become a professional scientist. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Students will participate in on-going astronomy programs at Cornell including the Carl Sagan Institute, the North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves (NANOGrav) program, the Simulation of eXtreme Spacetimes (SXS) collaboration, the CCAT-prime submillimeter telescope project, and the Spacecraft Planetary Imaging Facility. Cornell planetary scientists are actively engaged in the Cassini, Juno, Europa Clipper, Mars Science Laboratory and Mars Exploration Rover missions.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The REU Site: Research Experience for Undergraduates in Astrophysics and Planetary Science at Cornell University is a ten week residential summer research program for undergraduate students who have shown potential for scientific research at their home institutions and for whom immersion in a program at a major research university would provide great benefit. It seeks to widen the pipeline of future scientists and STEM professionals and increase access to careers in the astronomical field by recruiting undergraduates from diverse backgrounds and exposing them to broad areas of current research, fostering their appreciation of the research enterprise and their possible place within it, and helping them identify and develop key career skills.  Our program combines Cornell’s strengths in broad areas of the astronomy and planetary science research frontier with our experience and commitment to involve undergraduates in all aspects of research. We provide students independent research opportunities under the mentorship of our faculty and their teams, make the program accessible to students across the country from groups underrepresented in STEM, and recruit the students best suited to take advantage of it. Our program emphasizes:  the intimate and intensive interactions which take place within small research groups; the intellectual advantages of a broad and diverse research environment; the mentoring experience of our faculty; and the cohort building possible in a summer experience at a major research university in a rural setting.   The program activities are designed to:  help students explore broad areas of astrophysics and planetary sciences beyond the projects in which they are directly engaged via a lecture series covering a wide swath of topics and in-depth workshops providing a synthesis of research frontiers;  help them develop skills (scientific, statistical, coding, scientific presentations) that are of critical importance to their individual professional development and for the national competitiveness of the US; educate them in the nature, methodology and ethics of scientific research facilities; help them understand the role of teamwork in STEM; and help them understand their professional career options.   The program offers students from institutions with fewer research resources in our field than available at Cornell access to such resources and the opportunity to learn not only from our research teams but also by exposing them to a diverse cohort of other undergraduates.  Of the 25 students funded, under 20% (4) came from universities with the highest research activity in Astronomy; 8 came from predominantly bachelor’s degree granting colleges; 6 came from universities with high or moderate research activity in Astronomy; 4 came from institutions offering predominantly master’s degrees; and 3 from colleges offering predominantly associates degrees. Fifteen (60%) were female and 10 (40%) male. Six (24%) identified as Latinos, 2 (8%) African American, 2 (8%) American Indian and 1 (4%) Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander. One (4%) was a non-traditional student.  Of the 25, 15 are in graduate school or should start this fall, 2 are applying this fall, 5 are still in college, 1 is working in industry and continuing to collaborate with his REU mentor. We have lost track of 1. In addition to the NSF-funded students, the program has incorporated an additional 24 undergraduates funded by a No Cost Extension of our previous grant, research grants or private endowments whose participation enriched the experience of the REU students and multiplied the effects of the grant we received. The program has also contributed to the professional development of 5 graduate students,  and 5 senior research associates who actively participated in the students’ research or the program.  One of the key insights and experiences we strive to provide our students is that science is the product of collaboration&mdash;that novel ideas stem not from lone geniuses but from groups of individuals that simultaneously support and challenge each other’s learning. Cohort formation in our program takes place at all times and in different settings, formal and informal, including very importantly in the cooperative living units where students are housed.  In collaboration with 15 co-authors at Cornell and other institutions part of their research teams, 20 students and the program coordinator presented posters at a professional conference (American Astronomical Society, American Geological Union, or Division of Planetary Sciences).
