<AbstractNarration>A highly skilled technician workforce with expertise in anti-counterfeit processes and measures will ensure that products distributed locally and globally are more secure, reduce the risk associated with counterfeit products, and maintain the competitiveness of manufacturers. This project at Central Piedmont Community College (CPCC) is designed to meet the increasing need for product and packaging security by developing a new certificate embedded in an associate degree program focused on Functional Printing with an emphasis on the emerging role of anti-counterfeit printing and packaging technology. CPCC is one of the three colleges in North Carolina that offers an Associate of Applied Science degree in Graphic Arts and Imaging Technology, and the only institution in the Charlotte region, which serves as an operations base for over 200 printing, manufacturing and distribution enterprises that employ 12,000 individuals. The project will  support the needs of both regional and national employers, as the project will share results from the project that can inform how companies implement security processes and measures that address brand protection and the integrity of their products. Implementation of the project will result in a talent-rich pipeline of technicians who will implement security and protection changes within manufacturing and distribution facilities, know how to modify security features demanded by manufacturers, and understand the baseline processes for anti-counterfeit printing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By researching the evolving and emerging field of functional printing, CPCC faculty will establish a multidisciplinary certificate program in anti-counterfeit printing and packaging technology to address the need for technicians who understand security printing and brand protection measures. By engaging university-based research entities and other external partners, the college will design a transformational curriculum that is unique to two-year colleges. Through the project activities of research, curriculum development and faculty professional development, the educators involved in this project will gain additional expertise and be able to introduce technology innovations and trends to inform the development of the program. Recognizing the potential for a broad range of career pathways, the project team will bring greater understanding to this emerging technology through articulation agreements with area universities. The project will also be guided by an Advisory Committee comprised of local, regional, and national members who will ensure that the technical education meets the needs of employers and industry. Project activities will include course development and adaptation leading to a new technician certificate program offered at the two-year college as well as continuing education for incumbent workers, faculty professional development, and cultivation of business and industry partnerships. A formative and summative evaluation process will be employed to continuously enhance the project activities and provide opportunities for researching and evaluating the success of the project and deliverables, as well as the sharing of best practices. Results will be disseminated with the NSF community, as well as employer and business partners, and research entities focused on anti-counterfeiting processes and technologies. In addition, partnerships with entities focused on similar themes will promote continued collaboration and expansion of the body of knowledge to better serve business and industry as well as educational institutions.</AbstractNarration>
