<AbstractNarration>The Historically Black Colleges and Universities-Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP) Research Initiation Awards (RIAs) provide support to STEM junior faculty at HBCUs who are starting to build a research program, as well as for mid-career faculty who may have returned to the faculty ranks after holding an administrative post or who needs to redirect and rebuild a research program. Faculty members may pursue research at their home institution, at an NSF-funded Center, at a research intensive institution or at a national laboratory. The RIA projects are expected to help further the faculty member's research capability and effectiveness, to improve research and teaching at his or her home institution, and to involve undergraduate students in research experiences. With support from the National Science Foundation, Morgan State University will conduct research in information retrieval using search strategies based on techniques from image processing as well as natural language processing.  This would enable public access to both visual information and take away messages from journal articles.  This project will provide valuable research experience and mentorship for several minority undergraduate students at Morgan State University.  In addition, the project will help Morgan State University build its research capacity and enhance the educational and research experiences of their undergraduate students. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Within the larger goal of expanding queries for information retrieval, the project will 1) use a crowdsourcing based approach to perform large scale manual annotation of visual regions of interest (ROIs) by pairing automatically detected ROIs to concepts occurring in a brief caption, 2) use a feature learning approach to extract discriminative features from ROIs and automatically map the ROIs to concepts in an existing textual ontology, such as RadLex, 3) aided by a visual ontology, consider the semantic relations between the visual words when assessing the distance between images described with the bag-of-visual-words feature representation scheme, 4) in addition to cross modal search by mapping image regions to concepts in ontology, perform multimodal search by fusing weighted text and image features generated by a multi-response linear regression (MLR)-based meta-learner in a classification-driven task-specific manner, and 5) evaluate the retrieval techniques using benchmark and realistic datasets by participating in the yearly ImageCLEF retrieval evaluation campaign.  The labeled set of biomedical images with annotated regions of interest will be made available to the research community.</AbstractNarration>

The project was also accomplished by creating a training set of image region of interests (visual concepts)  by developing an annotation tool by leveraging on Amazon MTurk, exploiting concept correlations  in similarity matching and query expansion    and performing evaluation in benchmark datasets of more than 300K medical images.   This project has enabled  to build the department’s initial research capacity through the establishment of  an "Image Processing and Machine Learning lab"  with four workstations  with faster processing power to support  image processing and machine learning  related scientific research in medical imaging  and other related application domains. In this lab, eight  students were mentored in image processing and ML research as undergraduate research assistant (URA) which contributed  around fifteen (15) poster  presentations in several conferences and symposiums, such as Emerging Researchers National (ERN) Conference in STEM, Annual Biomedical Research Conference for Minority Students (ABRCMS), National Technical Association (NTA) conference, and annual Undergraduate and Graduate Research Symposium at MSU.

This capacity building  spurred  new collaborations and educational activities for undergraduate research, teaching, training, and sharing of data with a larger community of researchers.   For example, three students from the PI’s lab participated  (2019)  as Guest Researchers  on projects related to information retrieval (IR) and machine learning  based on collaborative partnership between National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)  and MSU   under the  Professional Research Experience Program (PREP).  The project also contributed to the open source community through a GitHub page.  The search techniques   developed in this project might  offer building blocks for the advanced information services and increase the productivity of students, scholars, professionals, and the libraries that serve them. The impact of this project is  substantial as many applications such as digital libraries, image search engines, and medical decision support systems require effective and efficient image annotation and retrieval.
