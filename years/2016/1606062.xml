<AbstractNarration>1606062 PI: Graves&lt;br/&gt;Title: INFEWS N/P/H2O: Fundamentals of N2/O2 plasma and heterogeneous catalysis&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project aims to advance air plasma technology in order to substantially reduce human perturbation to the global nitrogen cycle. The focus will be on establishing the scientific foundation necessary to efficiently couple non-equilibrium nitrogen/oxygen plasmas with heterogeneous catalysts in order to efficiently form nitric oxide (NO).  If efficient air plasmas can create nitric oxide (NO), this can be readily transformed to nitogen oxide (NO2) and then to nitric acid (HNO3) by water absorption. Nitric acid could be used to trap otherwise fugitive ammonia (NH3), created when bacteria degrade organic waste. The ammonia is trapped at low pH as ammonium nitrate (NH4NO3), thus greatly increasing the nitrogen value of the organic fertilizer and avoiding the damaging environmental effects of the ammonia emission. The technology would be especially promising because the plasma can be powered by electricity that could be generated in a distributed, renewable fashion at the location of the waste generation, such as the farm. Rather than compete with conventional Haber-Bosch NH3 manufacturing technology, this technology seeks to reduce the need for synthetic fertilizers made in centralized plants far from their use. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Non-equilibrium plasmas can act as a homogeneous catalyst by lowering the activation energy of nitrogen dissociation. This process can be substantially improved by the addition of heterogeneous catalysts, but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. The proposed project will employ radical beam - surface studies under high vacuum and modulated beam mass spectrometry to study radical-surface catalytic interactions for a range of metal and metal oxide materials and surface temperatures. The data from these studies will be used to develop parameterized site balance models that can provide insights into near-atmospheric pressure studies of non-equilibrium nitrogen/oxygen plasmas in the presence of catalytic surfaces. The successful implementation of plasmas for this application could help motivate studies of other plasma electro-catalytic technologies. In addition to training graduate students, the PI plans to recruit undergraduate students from programs that engage women and minorities. An outreach program to middle school students involving plasma demonstration devices is also proposed.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The purpose of this project was to help establish the scientific foundations of a novel plasma-catalysis technique to greatly increase worldwide nutrient utilization efficiency of reactive nitrogen for fertilizer. Air plasmas have been proposed for this purpose through production of NOx from air which can be readily converted to nitric acid. However, a major challenge remains in reducing the energy cost of NOx production in air plasmas to make the technology economically competitive.  Two key parameters controlling NOx production efficiency in air plasma are average electric field and average gas temperature. Using these parameters we define the dimensionless parameter &chi;, the normalized product of E and T. This quantity appears to effectively correlate specific energy cost of NOx production for the discharges we studied as well as results from the literature. Based on our results we conclude that reducing &chi; could be a guiding principle in designing sources for energy-efficient NOx production. Reducing the plasma gas temperature by cooling or using short duration, high current pulses or by extending the discharge length could lead to a lower &chi;. This could in turn result in higher NOx production energy efficient. The &chi; factor appears to serve as a simple, effective means of correlating NOx production energy efficiency across a broad range of discharges. It appears that &chi; captures some intrinsic, but still poorly understood, physical and/or chemical mechanisms governing NOx production.  The addition of catalyst powder (activated Al2O3) improved energy efficiency significantly in the presence of the ‘warm’ plasma (DC glow discharge in flowing air, PA and air plasma jet) at atmospheric pressure, most notably when the catalyst surface temperature was raised. For the DC glow discharge, this occurred only when gas flowrates were below about 5 l min&minus;1. Furthermore, the catalyst bed needed to be located several mm beneath the plasma zone in order to be effective. Presumably, active precursors created in the plasma zone were quenched or lost unless the catalytically active surface is within a few mm of the active plasma zone. Even when active, the catalyst had no significant effect on product selectivity.In the presence of catalyst, some plasma-generated and relatively short-lived intermediate species (possibly vibrationally and/or electronically excited N2, as well as O or N atoms) are likely important as precursors. The importance of gas flow and catalyst location both suggest that transport of chemical species and energy are likely key factors controlling the specific energy cost of NOx production using plasma at atmospheric pressure.
