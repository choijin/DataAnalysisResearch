<AbstractNarration>This project studies the power of quantum computers.  The main goal is to determine which problems have efficient quantum algorithms and&lt;br/&gt;which ones remain hard in the presence of quantum computers.  This is a fundamental question in computer science.  One objective is to find new applications for quantum computers.  A second objective is to understand which cryptosystems are secure against quantum computers. These systems must be based on problems that cannot be solved efficiently by quantum computers.  The PI and his graduate students are considering these types of problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project considers new approaches for the dihedral hidden subgroup problem.  A quantum algorithm for this problem, if found, would break some candidates for quantum-secure cryptosystems.  If more evidence is found that the problem is difficult to solve, then it increases the confidence in the security of the proposed systems. Another type of potential speedup is for optimization problems.  The work addresses whether certain settings for the approximate adiabatic algorithm exist for which the quantum algorithm achieves a better&lt;br/&gt;approximate solution than the best classical algorithm.  The last problem deals with understanding Hamiltonian complexity.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ A fundamental question in computer science asks when an efficient algorithm exists to transform one computational problem into a different problem.  Such an algorithm is called a reduction.  Reductions allow information about the computational complexity of one problem to be transferred to another problem.  The NP-complete problems form a large class with reductions between the problems, but where no efficient classical algorithm is believed to exist to solve any of them.  Due to the reductions between the problems in this class, if any one problem has an efficient algorithm then they all do.  It is open whether or not the security of cryptography can be based on the difficultly of this class, that is, whether or not a reduction exists from an NP-complete problem to a cryptographic primitive such as inverting a one-way functions.  There is evidence that this is not possible when classical algorithms are used.  Instead, cryptography is based on single isolated problems with no known efficient algorithm.  We examined what happens if quantum reductions are used to do these transformations.  We showed that basing cryptography on NP-complete problems using such quantum algorithms implies that the complexity class containment coNP is in QIP(2), providing a step toward understanding whether quantum reductions are more powerful than classical reductions in the context of cryptography.   The Local Hamiltonian problem is the prototypical quantum analog of an NP-complete problem and a constraint satisfaction problem.  One way to handle the lack of efficient algorithms for NP-complete problems is to use approximation algorithms.  While the exact answer is not known to be efficiently computable, approximation algorithms seek to find an answer of the problem with some guarantee about how close it is to an optimal one.  We examined whether or not classical approximation algorithms can be used to find solutions of the Local Hamiltonian problem.  The solution of the Local Hamiltonian problem uses a quantum state, which means that it has the new feature of entanglement.  Since entangled quantum states do not in general have concise classical representations, an additional issue is that this limits how well classical algorithms can perform.  We found the first classical approximation algorithm that does better than picking a random quantum state for the case where interactions act on two particles at a time. A third problem we examined was a recently proposed method for the general problem of solving systems of polynomial equations with a quantum algorithm, specifically by using the Macaulay matrix and the HHL algorithm in a certain way.  Even though it is unlikely that this problem has an efficient quantum algorithm because it is so general, it was still unknown if it is efficient in any cases, or why it is not efficient in any cases.  We showed a general condition for systems of equations where the proposed quantum algorithm is inefficient, and we point to a remaining possibility where a new type of efficient quantum algorithm might still exist.   Two Ph.D. students graduated during the grant.  Quantum computing and cryptography were topics of outreach at a middle school and a science camp for middle school girls from rural areas.
