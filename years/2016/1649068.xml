<AbstractNarration>General Abstract&lt;br/&gt;In this project, the PI proposes to collect and analyze data related to jihadist networks.  Using the procedures developed to collect information about Al-Qaeda-inspired networks, this project seeks to expand the scope of the existing project to include ISIL-related networks. In particular, the project seeks to expand upon the existing data collection procedures to include social media and blog posts.  The information gathered from this project holds the potential to identify US citizens targeted for recruitment by Jihadist groups.  The broader impacts of this work are strong.  The data are of potential value to those working in the academic and policy making areas.  The PI is well equipped to complete the project, and will employ a team comprised of graduate and undergraduate students to assist in the data collection.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Abstract&lt;br/&gt;This project will result in the maintenance and expansion of the existing Western Jihadism Data Base (WJDB).  This data set consists of a combination of individual-level qualitative and quantitative data on people with ties to extremist groups such as ISIL and Al-Qeada.  The unique and potentially valuable extension of this project is the plan to incorporate digital data gleaned from more public sources such as social media and blog posting. The end result will be additional entries into and timely of the WJDB.  The project is particularly strong with respect to its broader impacts. It has potential to be valuable for policymakers and practitioners who seek to prevent attacks.  The PI is highly qualified to complete the project having done significant work on the existing databases.  The research team will also be comprised of students, both graduate and undergraduate, giving the project a strong pedagogical component.</AbstractNarration>

Data were encoded and added to an extant online data collection, known as the Western Jihadism Project (WJP). All data derive from public records and are manually coded.
