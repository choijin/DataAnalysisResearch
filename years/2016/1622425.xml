<AbstractNarration>Changes in one component of an ecological system can sometimes cause major, relatively rapid, and seemingly permanent changes in the system as a whole.  This project offers a rare opportunity to study the reversibility of such dramatic ecological changes in a rigorous way.  The project will use a long-term experiment in the Chihuahuan Desert in which selective exclusions of rodents that are major seed eaters has produced sharp changes in the abundances of plant and animal species and in levels of soil nutrients. These exclusions will be reversed, and the effects on plants, animals, and soils measured over five years.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this project include the training of two graduate students and broad outreach to the public through construction of a website for the communication of scientific research.  In addition, better understanding of how specific factors can cause major shifts in ecological systems will help land managers and policy makers avoid unintended consequences of natural resource management.</AbstractNarration>

With widespread shifts in many ecosystems, it is critically important that we understand what processes drive rapid ecosystem shifts and what circumstances may impede our ability to reverse them. Unfortunately, regime shifts are notoriously difficult to study. Dramatic changes in ecosystems are difficult to predict and the lack of warning makes it difficult to have rigorous studies in place before,during, and after an event occurs. Quantifying rapid, often non-linear change in messy ecological data can also impede our ability to detect rapid changes and pinpoint exactly when they occur - an important aspect of determining why a regime shift occurred. This project used a long-running experimental site in southeastern Arizona to study rapid changes in a desert ecosystem. The project developed new methods for quantifying rapid biodiversity change, testing with the site&rsquo;s 40 year data set monitoring small mammal populations. Research showed that at this site, rapid reorganization events have actually been occurring every 10-15 years and appear to be associated with extreme climate events (floods and droughts). This work also suggested that climate events can trigger biodiversity change by disrupting the population of the most abundant species in the ecosystem, thus providing opportunities for rarer species to dominate. This mechanism for rapid change gained additional support from an additional study that ceased a long-term experiment and monitored the recovery of the small mammal community. The results from that study indicated that existing assemblages of small mammals can slow down how quickly experimental plots recovered after the long-term experiment was halted. Plots with no preexisting small mammal community recovered within 2-3 months, whereas plots with an existing small mammal community took nearly three years to return to a natural state. Another study, using both the experiments and the long-term data from the site showed that habitat preferences of species can be dramatically altered depending upon the presence or absence of dominant species. Together, the body of work generated by this project has provided evidence that events that negatively impact a dominant species can cause rapid biodiversity change as rarer species respond positively to their finished populations. Once these rarer species become abundant, they - in turn - can make it more difficult for a dominant species to re-establish itself, thus slowing or preventing ecosystem recovery to a previous state.</span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;" dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; color: #000000; background-color: #ffffff; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">The project accomplished a variety of broad impact goals with the aim of improving data management for long-term data, investing in improved training for scientists in data management and computational analysis, and directly training students and trainees associated with the project in advanced computational skills.
