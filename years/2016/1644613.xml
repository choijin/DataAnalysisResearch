<AbstractNarration>This I-Corps project investigates the commercialization potential of printed, flexible pressure sensors. The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is that, as a platform technology, the proposed system can be easily ported for use in a range of applications including: sports performance, physical therapy, medical diagnostics markets, and many others.  The method of fabricating this sensing system, using additive print manufacturing technology, may have a profound technological and economic impact on the emerging printed-electronics industry, It demonstrates the capability to manufacture cost effective, flexible, conformable and light weight electronic devices. The adoption of this new technology will be of particular importance to those seeking to develop wearable electronic devices. The commercialization of this product will also validate the ability to fabricate electronic devices with sensor performance comparable to that of silicon based devices. In terms of cost efficiency, the use of printing technology for fabricating sensing systems is anticipated to reduce the average production cost by approximately 70%. The long-term goal of this project is to use this technology to develop a range of smart, wearable sensors to detect impacts that causes injuries and improve diagnostics. For example, an identifiable market for this technology already exists, that is, for protective headgear.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Impact-related traumatic brain injuries often result from concussions.  The complications associated with concussions increase for unreported injuries, often left untreated, when compared to injuries that receive prompt medical attention. In many cases the current methods of relying on self-reported injuries runs the risk of aggravating a potentially dangerous head injury. This team's technology would help reduce the risk of traumatic brain injury by automatically detecting and recording the occurrences of potentially dangerous impacts. Impact data would be used to objectively measure the level of a user's possible injury, thus reducing the chance of an inaccurate diagnosis which can result in further injuries to the user.</AbstractNarration>
