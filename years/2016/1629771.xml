<AbstractNarration>The effort and cost of maintenance dominate activities in a software system's lifecycle. Over the past two decades, software architecture research has yielded many tools and techniques for understanding and maintaining the architectures of software systems. However, empirical research and technology transfer are impeded by myriad disjoint environments, lack of a shared research infrastructure, the costs of making tools robust, and lack of datasets needed to conduct architecture-oriented empirical research. Consequently, researchers and practitioners often repeat each other's efforts, thus limiting potential breakthroughs. This projects develops the plans and an initial prototype for an integration framework that assembles architecture-related techniques to enable maintenance-focused empirical research. The framework revolutionizes the future of software systems research and development. It facilitates the discovery and adoption of cutting-edge techniques and tools, and fosters much more effective university-industry collaboration than exists today.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This planning project elicits and prioritizes the requirements, collects the community feedback, and develops a prototype for the Software Architecture INstrument (SAIN), a first-of-its-kind integration framework. SAIN comprises three principal components: (1) a catalogued library of tools for reverse engineering and analyzing software architectures; (2) a plug-and-play instrument for integrating the techniques to enable architecture-oriented empirical studies; and (3) a repository of Web-accessible software-architecture datasets and benchmarks. This planning project develops a proof-of-concept solution that demonstrates the feasibility of the proposed instrument, as well as the research activities enabled by this instrument. SAIN provides an effective, community-wide platform for software architecture research and practice through continuous integration of diverse tools. It supports architecture's central role in a broad range of software engineering activities. The framework comprises the first repository hosting large numbers of recovered architectures to enable researchers to effectively evaluate their techniques, and is aimed at reinvigorating empirical research in software architecture.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   We have actively engaged with the software-engineering research and practitioner communities in determining and refining the requirements for the SAIN infrastructure. The main outcomes of our project have been requirements and design suggestions for SAIN elicited from dozens of attendees at three workshops, two of which were co-located with international conferences, and over 150 researchers and practitioners throughout the world via an online survey; 40 letters expressing an intent to collaborate with our team on the construction of SAIN through contribution of tools or datasets, serving as alpha testers, and through use of SAIN for the letter writers' research; expansion of our project team; and an initial prototype of SAIN. We initially gathered 17 researchers for our first workshop to present SAIN and elicit design suggestions and requirements for it. Attendees gave 13 presentations over two days in January 2017. Sessions included ample discussions about design and requirements of SAIN. As a follow-up to REINFORCE, we held a second workshop at the 39th International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE) in Buenos Aires, Argentina in May 2017. In addition to the continued focus on requirements elicitation, planning, and design of SAIN, ECASE featured 6 refereed paper presentations on novel tools and techniques, or useful benchmarks or datasets, that support empirical research on architecture-based maintenance; and two keynote speakers on constructing infastructure like SAIN. 13 attendees joined this second workshop. Continued engagement of the community resulted in a third workshop conducted in November 2017 in Urbana-Champaign, Illinois co-located with the 32nd IEEE/ACM International Conference on Automated Software Engineering. The workshop had 11 invited attendees; four of the attendees presented work relevant to our efforts. The workshop included a session where the attendees completed a survey regarding the requirements for SAIN, and two sessions where the relevant issues were discussed in depth. One outcome of the workshop was a prioritization of requirements for SAIN. Another outcome was a refinement of the survey, which was subsequently sent to an additional 130 researchers and practitioners. To complement the obtained requirements and design suggestions, we secured over 40 letters, from across the worldwide software-engineering research and practice community, expressing the need for SAIN and the intention to collaborate with our project team on its creation. The cross-institutional project team has also worked together to construct and iteratively expand an initial prototype of SAIN. This infrastructure contains preliminary versions of architecture-based tools for conducting large-scale empirical studies of software systems in the maintenance phase.  A final key outcome has been the creation of a slightly explanded team that has submitted a follow-up proposal to turn these initial efforts into a full SAIN infrastructure that will fundamentally alter how research and development are performed in the area of architecture-based software maintenance.
