<AbstractNarration>This project aims to develop a method to "film" proteins, the tiny machines that enable all of life as we know it, as they perform their critical biological functions.  Understanding how proteins function is one of the most exciting frontiers of science, and is necessary in order to address societal needs in fields as diverse as renewable energy and agriculture.  The rich and intricate 3-dimensional shapes of more than 100,000 different kinds of proteins are now documented, thanks to revolutionary advances in X-ray spectroscopy, magnetic resonance, and other methods.  However, while knowing the shape of a machine, for example, seeing a photograph of a sewing machine, might give one a clue as to how it works, a movie of a machine in action is far more revealing.  The goal of this project is to develop new methods to make such "movies" of proteins, or stated more precisely, to develop methods to measure the time resolved conformational changes in protein structure (or structural dynamics).  A team of graduate students and undergraduates, working at the interface between physics, chemistry, and biology, and working closely with international collaborators, will tackle this exciting problem, and will emerge well-positioned to become leaders in the nation's science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) workforce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;"Filming" proteins in action requires a calibrated tool to measure distances of several nanometers with high throughput and, ideally, sub-millisecond time resolution.  This tool must be compatible with the complex local environments in which proteins perform their functions; ideally, in aqueous solutions although many proteins continue to function as long as they are above about 215K.  The primary goal of the proposed research is to use high-frequency (&gt;200 GHz) electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) combined with site-directed spin labeling with spin-7/2 Gd3+ moieties to measure time-resolved conformational changes of proteins.  With prior NSF support, the PI and co-PI's collaboration has demonstrated that the simplest possible 240 GHz EPR measurements; measurements of the lineshapes of molecules containing a pair of Gd3+ spin labels; is capable of resolving distances greater than 3 nm even at room temperature.   The proposed research will build on these key developments, focusing primarily on time-resolved distance measurements in the model protein Proteorhodopsin (PR), a photosynthetic trans-membrane proton pump that can be triggered with flashes of light to begin synchronized cascades of conformational changes on time scales ranging from less than 1 microsecond to more than 1 second. The main activities undertaken will be: (1) Developing a simple method based on measuring the lineshape of the Gd3+ EPR line to extract distances and distance distributions in the 1.5-4 nm range from PR doubly labeled with Gd3+.  (2) Measuring conformational changes of PR at temperatures ranging from about 215K (where PR is frozen but active) to room temperature with sub-millisecond time resolution. (3) Pulsed EPR studies of Gd3+ to understand the spin physics of Gd3+ at very high frequencies.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Proteins are the molecular machines that power life as we know it.  Some of the most interesting and important proteins are membrane proteins that use light to power them.  Such light-responsive proteins can control the flow of energy, matter, and information across the cell membrane.  The goal of this award has been to work towards a method to "film" light-activated membrane proteins in the act of moving as they do their important work.  Success in this endeavor has the potential to revolutionize the design of proteins optimized for important tasks like converting sunlight into fuel, or developing microbes that can manufacture useful substances.    Filming things as small as proteins is a challenge, as they are much too small to see even with an optical microscope.   We have chosen a protein called proteorhodopsin to develop the filming method.  Proteorhodopsin, in the presence of blue or green light, acts as a pump that transports protons across the cell membranes of marine bacteria, allowing them to move towards or away from the light and to harvest its energy.  Our chosen method is to  1.      use tricks of molecular biology to attach magnetic molecules to most of the proteins in a sample.  2.     put the protein sample in a magnet that is several times stronger than even the magnets used in medical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).  This makes the magnetic molecules ring like a bell, but at very high microwave frequencies. The frequencies at which these molecules "ring" depend on how far apart they are, and their orientation with respect to the strong magnetic field.  3.     Reflect from the sample a beam of very high frequency microwaves that are close in frequency to the magnetic molecules "ringing."  4.     Repeatedly flash a beam of light at the sample to start all the machines moving at the same time, while monitoring the strength of the reflected microwave beam.  If this sounds hard, well, it is.  However, by the end of the award, the team of biologists, physicists, and chemists was successful in measuring very small changes in the reflected microwave power after flashing proteorhodopsin with light.  This is an important milestone on the team’s road to "filming proteins in action."  Stay tuned!          Last Modified: 01/19/2021       Submitted by: Mark Sherwin]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
