<AbstractNarration>"Fast Radio Bursts" (FRBs) are linked to exotic astronomical objects in distant galaxies that produce a sudden and very dramatic burst of radio waves. The burst lasts a fraction of a second. Yet modern radio telescopes like the Green Bank Telescope (GBT) in West Virginia can detect these remarkable events - if they are equipped with sensitive equipment and sophisticated computer programs to analyze the data. A collaboration of scientists and students (both graduate and undergraduate) from the University of West Virginia and Virginia Tech plan to develop these programs for the GBT. Astronomers do not yet know what produces FRBs. They could be the result of colliding stars, or perhaps black holes swallowing neighboring stars. Either way, telescopes like the GBT should lead astronomers much closer to an answer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The detection of FRBs, believed to be extra-galactic in origin, and other potentially exotic radio transits, has in recent years been enabled by a revolution in radio instrumentation and computing power. The latter has lead to the development of sophisticated signal processing algorithms. The principal investigator, working with her graduate and undergraduate students and a collaborator at Virginia Tech., aims to develop such algorithms with a view to deploying them on the GBT and detecting radio transients in real time. The techniques will be prototyped on radio receivers already in place and in operation at the GBT; the software will run in parallel with existing data processing systems. The algorithms will enable sensitive, wide-field surveys of pulsars and other radio transients, in additions to the FRBs mentioned above. The algorithms and source code will be made freely available to the astronomical community once commissioned on the GBT. The PI also aims to develop a "Statistical Signal Processing for Sensor Arrays" undergraduate course to help make the technology more accessible to a wider audience and to educate the next generation of scientists and engineers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Natalia Schmid and her two collaborators, Richard Prestage and Ryan Lynch, have completed their development of new algorithms for the detection of exotic astrophysical pulses named Fast Radio Bursts and for the detection and mitigation of Radio Frequency Interference in radio astronomy data.     With the goal of bringing a set of new pulse detection algorithms to the radio astronomy community, the research group consisted of the three researchers above and two graduate students of Natalia Schmid has analyzed the composition of a spectrogram (astrophysical data displayed as an image in time and frequency) from spatial frequency perspective. The group also analyzed the energy in projection lines formed by adding the intensity of a spectrogram along imaginary lines passing through it. The projection lines are calculated for each discrete orientation angle, from zero to ninety degrees. In digital signal processing this is known as Radon Transform.  The performed analysis demonstrated new perspectives on the frequency and energy content of astrophysical signals and led to the development of two new pulse detection approaches, alternatives to the traditional pulse detection approach, which is currently used in practice.      The traditional approach is based on the concept of de-dispersion. Due to its propagation through interstellar medium composed of free electrons, the high frequency component of the signal arrives to the telescope before the low frequency component of the signal. This phenomenon is known as dispersion.  The traditional approach aligns all frequency components by applying a de-dispersion method and then adds the image columns along the frequency components which results in a one-dimensional signal with Signal-to-Noise Ratio much higher than each individual frequency component of pulse in the spectrogram.     The first newly developed pulse detection algorithm displays a spectrogram of a pulse in a space reciprocal to time and frequency space of the spectrogram.  The dispersed pulse is observed as a fan in the transformed image.  A basic calculation of the energy of pixels composing the fan leads to a new pulse detection rule.  A similar idea is involved in the development of the other detection algorithm, where the energy of the spectrogram projected along several lines is analyzed.   The description of the algorithms and the analysis of their performance were presented at ICASSP 2017 and GlobalSip 2018 and published in the fifth issue of MNRAS in 2018.  Xiaoqian He, one of the graduate students working on the project, applied the algorithms to analyze performance of ten Rotating Radio Transients (RRAT) and summarized the results of her analysis in her MS thesis, which she presented to her committee in Spring 2018.  The theory and performance analysis of the second developed algorithm are the foundation for two chapters of the PhD dissertation of Marwan Alkhweldi. He is planning to defend his dissertation in Fall 2020.  Marwan is the second graduate student involved in the project.      In summers of 2017 and 2018 Richard Prestage worked with several undergraduate students during the summer program at the Green Bank Observatory.  He and his advisees have developed a new algorithm capable of detecting and mitigating Radio Frequency Interference in raw radio astronomy data.   The algorithm was implemented in hardware, which ensured that the mitigation of Radio Frequency Interference is performed in real time.  This algorithm is currently implemented at the Green Bank Telescope.  The developed algorithms for the detection and mitigation of Radio Frequency Interference in raw radio astronomy data demonstrate a considerably reduced number of false alarms compared to the methods previously applied for the suppression of Radio Frequency Interference. The results of the development and analysis of the algorithm were published as a Senior Honors Thesis/paper of Emily Ramey from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, in Spring 2019.     The educational component of the project included the involvement of graduate and undergraduate students in research and the development of a short lecture series on statistical signal processing in sensor arrays. These lectures were offered at West Virginia University in Fall 2018 as a special topic of a PhD level class on Detection and Estimation.
