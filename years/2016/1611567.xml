<AbstractNarration>Adams State University (ASU) will implement an ADVANCE Institutional Transformation-Catalyst (IT-Catalyst) project to undertake institutional self-assessment activities and adapt ADVANCE best practices.  During year one of the project, ASU will collect institutional data, including a salary survey and recruitment pool analysis, and workload assessment, and will also conduct faculty surveys and focus groups.  During year two, the team will visit ADVANCE IT institutions to learn about best practices, hold meetings with key stakeholders (faculty/chairs/administrators) to discuss data and best practices.  During year three, the university will work to implement changes and incorporate them into the next iteration of the university's strategic plan&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ASU provides a unique context in which to examine the recruitment, retention and promotion of women faculty in STEM disciplines.  ASU is a small, primarily undergraduate, public, Hispanic-serving institution (HSI) in rural south-central Colorado.   The campus has been challenged to recruit and retain women, who account for 27 percent of STEM faculty.  ASU has demonstrated readiness for change; all stakeholder groups have communicated their commitment to the project, and the campus already has extensive programming and policy organized around the theme of "inclusive excellence."   ADVANCE will build on this strong foundation, and the program could serve as a model for small, rural HSIs. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ADVANCE program is focused on developing systemic approaches to increase the participation, retention, and advancement of women in academic STEM careers.  The IT-Catalyst track funds projects that aim to conduct institutional self-assessments and implement ADVANCE strategies that have been shown to be effective to address gendered issues for STEM faculty.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Introduction  The goal of Adams State University's NSF ADVANCE IT-Catalyst project was to develop strategies in recruitment, retention, and the advancement of tenured and tenure-track faculty women in STEM fields, Psychology, and Sociology that form the basis of a plan for institutional transformation. The supporting self-assessment and review processes and procedures, and the resulting plan, set an example for disciplines across campus. The project identified the most critical areas of need and develop organizational mechanisms that gender equity in science technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) and social and behavioral sciences (SBS) disciplines and provide foundational work for an institutional transformation plan.  Studies  During the self-assessment phase of the grant period, staff conducted several studies comparing women and men regarding salaries, student evaluations, and time spent on job related tasks. Project staff followed up these studies through focus groups and a questionnaire survey of faculty.  Salary Study - Salary data for tenure-track professors in all fields were examined for the years 2012 - 2016.   Student Evaluations of Teaching - A comparative analysis was done for male and female faculty student evaluation scores in the STEM/SBS fields (n = 1,760) and in the non-STEM/SBS fields (n = 3686) for Fall Semester 2012 through Fall Semester 2016. Written comments from student evaluations for STEM/SBS faculty from 2012-2017 were analyzed for word frequency (over 300,000 words).  Time Log Study - Ten STEM/SBS faculty (female = 7, male = 3) completed time log charting of daily tasks for two weeks, recording activities performed in 15-minute increments. Only one SBS faculty member completed the log along with three department chairs.  Focus Group Study - Two one-hour focus groups were conducted in conjunction with the time log study. There were different focus groups for faculty and department chairs. Nine STEM/SBS Faculty (Males=3; Females=6) completed the first focus group, and 11 (Males = 4, Females = 7) completed the second focus group.  Faculty Survey - A survey, composed of relevant questions taken from the report of the Promotion, Gender, Race, Ethnicity, and Service Committee from University of Massachusetts Boston and the Faculty Job Satisfaction Survey, was sent to all faculty in STEM and SBS in March 2018. Sixteen surveys were completed (female = 9, male = 7).  Products  Literature Review - A literature review on "Advancing Women in STEM and SBS" was developed by project staff. This paper is a review of the literature on women, minorities, and persons with disabilities in science and engineering. Included are references to publications that present research studies, statistical information, survey results, reviews of research, organizational diagnostic tools, new approaches to research studies, document analysis, and program models.  Institutional Transformation Plan - Through the efforts of the NSF ADVANCE grant, ASU has developed an Institutional Transformation Plan (IT-Plan) that will increase the recruitment, retention, and advancement of faculty women, and of Latinas in particular, in STEM and in SBS areas at ASU. Two of the key initiatives are outlined in the following paragraphs.  Changes to the faculty handbook were developed by the ADVANCE team with input from other campus constituents. These changes focus on the faculty expectations and evaluation and fall under four general topics: 1) Addition of language related to diversity and inclusive excellence; 2) Removal of language that may lead to evaluation bias; 3) Addition of language related to life-long learning of best teaching practices; and 4) Addition of language related to assessment and learning outcomes.  The changes have been submitted to the Colorado Attorney General. When returned, these proposed changes will be voted upon by faculty with the hope of inserting approved changes into the faculty handbook for the 2020/21 academic year.  Advocates and Allies group - ASU has formed an Advocates and Allies group consisting of male faculty and staff who have been trained to become more aware of gender biases on campus and to promote gender equality. This group of men faculty and staff advocates, named the MAGEs (Men Advocates for Gender Equity), have developed a mission and strategic plan for moving forward. Their mission is to increase awareness among men employees about gender inequity on campus, take ownership and responsibility in how men participate in systems that perpetuate gender bias and discrimination, and pursue an equitable climate by addressing, challenging, and eliminating gender inequities at ASU. The strategic plan includes building an active network of ASU men allies, hosting regular workshops and discussions to train men on gender bias, and promote and support gender equity in policy and practice.
