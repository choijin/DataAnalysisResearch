<AbstractNarration>Part 2: &lt;br/&gt;Women, people of color, LGBTIQA individuals, and people with disabilities continue to be underrepresented in STEM fields, including the geosciences. The lack of diversity and inclusion of people with different identities and backgrounds in the geosciences harms the profession, by failing to recruit, retain, and nurture the best talent, and create welcoming and inclusive environments where all staff can reach their full potential. The purpose of this study is to develop and test new methods for helping geoscientists become more actively inclusive of diversity in their profession. In particular, the study aims to create at least 10 three-person geoscientist change-teams who are trained to 1) recognize and manage their own implicit biases; 2) intervene as social justice advocates when witnessing the biases of others; and 3) target critical gatekeeping decisions as a strategy to transform their home institutions. To do so, the study proposes evidence-based professional development that uses active learning techniques and is carefully evaluated for efficacy. Change teams will attend a workshop that spans three days - one day of innovative methods to address each specific aim. Day 1 will give leading-edge perspectives on implicit bias to build self-awareness in a non-threatening manner, and provide a proven, flexible  framework for empathy, motivation, and successful self-regulation. Day 2 will teach a ?social-closure? perspective on institutional exclusion, that focuses on key gatekeeping processes as inclusion/exclusion decision points (e.g., search committees, annual review, promotion, graduate admissions) and offers a coherent strategy to initiate and drive institutional change. Day 3 will build upon earlier awareness and motivational work to focus on practicing effective habits for bystander interventions. An innovative aspect of this training will be the creation of an immersive virtual environment of geoscience colleagues committing various microaggressions and acts of exclusion. The conversations among participants and avatars will be based on geoscience-specific interview data, and will provide participants with a safe space to actively practice effective interventions and create new habits that promote inclusion. The study will assess participants? knowledge and beliefs via surveys and interviews after the workshop over the span of a year, and will create and moderate a peer network for mentoring and continuing education.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In this part of the collaborative GEODES (Geoscience Diversity Experiential Simulations) project, PI Richardson leveraged the Critical Zone Observatory network and extended geoscientists to find underrepresented mintory (URM) participants. We interviewed the URM geoscientists and determined geoscience specitic bias, microaggressions, or prejudice in their departments or during their professional careers. From the qualitative data collected from the interviews, we constructed a series of virtual simulations.   Qualitative results:  After reviewing 11 of 13 interviews, there are clear patterns about negative impacts on participants when they were students working with faculty.  6 of the 11 participants admitted that moving to a new location to pursue their undergraduate or graduate program was a difficulty.   9 of the 11 participants expressed some negative interactions with their faculty adviser or other faculty in their department. Either faculty had committed some form of microaggression to them as a women/URM. A subset of these faculty were sometimes responsive and open to talking about the issue but according to the participants, the majority of the faculty have not experienced any reprimand or intervention.   8 of the 11 participants expressed negative impacts coming from fellow students or graduate students. Women and URM felt unable to connect with fellow students that were the ?average geoscience student? and their dominance of department culture set unspoken standards and accepted/normative behaviors. Many of these affected important moments in their career: publishing, dissertation completion, class grades, hiring.   7 of the 11 participants struggled to identify ?subtle? microaggressions that made them feel unwelcome by their department. Along the ideas of social closure, they felt isolated by not participating in clothing, drinking, games, and other social activities adopted by the majority of geoscience students.   9 of the 11 participants described the importance of having a faculty member, scientific mentor, outside examiner, or fellow graduate student as a crucial positive force to help address gender, racial, or homophobic issues.   5 out of the 11 participants mentioned negative events occurring in the field while the other 6 of the 11 focused on events occurring in group discussions or private meetings.  In addition, I generated sets of geoscience job applications for a pseudo-job search. These materials were used as part of the "Understanding and Countering Bias in the Geosciences" Institute held at Matrix Center for the Advancement of Social Equity &amp; Inclusion at the University of Colorado - Colorado Springs. These simulated scenarios and simuated job search helped create personal bias-literacy training of habits and self-efficacy in institute participants, allowing them to become active disruptors of bias in their home departments. Our project provides professional development for ten university faculty, and PI Richardson as champions for diversity, trained as active disruptors of bias.
