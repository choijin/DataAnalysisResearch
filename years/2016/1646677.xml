<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will support the development of a confocal optical microscope with two-dimensional topographical profiling and multiple spectroscopic modes in a single, affordable precision instrument. The system will make a major impact in the $6.2 billion microscope market, with a near-term market penetration potential of over 5%, and significant growth potential. This technology will span the needs of materials science research laboratories through quality control in manufacturing to supply chain monitoring. Integration of topographic mapping with a diverse set of spectroscopic tools enables comprehensive materials analysis at the micron and submicron scale. Users will be able to identify features and defects in electronic, optoelectronic, and structural devices, as well as coatings, tubing, devices, disks, and specialty mirrors. Combinatorial materials and chemical research will also be furthered by the ability to acquire several spectroscopic maps with a single instrument. Societal impacts include practical improvements in the design and manufacture of components and systems.  Because of its compact size and low cost, the microscope can be used in schools at all levels, providing students with experience in measuring properties of complex objects and helping prepare them for careers in various research, development, and production settings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this project centers on the advancement of optical microscopy into the realm of spectroscopic and surface analysis of topographically complex structures. Micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS), for example, have micron-to-millimeter features that can be analyzed by the developed instrument. The key innovation is the development of precision profiling and its integration with multiple spectroscopic interrogation methods. This profiling innovation centers on the capture of two-dimensional optical images with an array detector from each point on a sample and the conversion of the image properties to a vertical focus error, which is then corrected in a subsequent spectroscopic scan. The instrument can then provide Raman, photoluminescence (PL), and topographic surface (morphology) mapping of a sample, with diffraction-limited resolution. Research objectives include integration of optical profiling with spectroscopic scanning to produce accurate two-dimensional spectra from topographically rough samples, and automation of the image capture and analysis software. The instrument is designed to capture the surface topography and spectrum of a sample with tens of thousands of sample points in a few minutes and with 10-50 nanometer vertical accuracy.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual merit     Klar Scientific LLC is a startup specializing in spectroscopic microscopy using its confocal optical profile (COP) technology, for which it has patent priority in the U.S.  This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project had as its primary goal the translation of the science of the spectroscopic COP microscope from the lab bench to prototypes for evaluation of samples from academic and commercial customers.  The Klar approach is to integrate all functions into a compact system.  The functions include photoluminescence (PL) and Raman spectroscopy, wide-field imaging, spectroscopic mapping, and surface topography.  The overall objective of the Phase I program was to create two prototype microscopes and to advance their hardware and software designs to prepare for market sampling and entry during Phase II.  In Phase I, the prototypes were tested using material samples from industry and academia in order to evaluate the designs and refine them to achieve a set of specifications acceptable to customers.  The two prototypes were a benchtop model containing the suite of measurement instruments, and a portable model emphasizing rapid and simple acquisition of photoluminescence spectra for use in a network-based identification system.  The specific activities for Phase I were to (1) Design and assemble an integrated COP microscope containing spectroscopic and imaging components, and the scanning modules, with improved resolution and precision, (2) Improve the acquisition and analysis software to maximize performance of the instrument, and (3) Test the instrument with irregular samples from key customers.  The company successfully produced the prototypes and tested them using polymers and semiconductors from industrial and academic customers.  Also tested were organic samples from the environment.  One major scientific advance was the achievement of an autofocusing method&mdash;hardware and software&mdash;that produced highly accurate, two-dimensional spectroscopic surface scans of irregular, complex materials.  This advance is the first to enable long-time scans whereby changes due to the local environment changes&mdash;temperature, humidity, pressure, vibration&mdash;would normally prevent capture of such scans.  Consequently, the Klar prototypes enable users to make measurements in a wide variety of places&mdash;laboratory, factory, field, for example, which were heretofore impossible.     Broader/commercial impact     Klar?s mission is to provide a cost-effective instrument that yields accurate two-dimensional spectroscopic and imaging maps of a material sample with irregular surface structure.  Materials scientists and device engineers working with polymers, graphene, optical semiconductors, silicon, and coatings will for the first time be able to acquire and use their own multifunctional instrument for spatial spectroscopic characterization of samples regardless of their surface uniformity.  The instruments will lead to lower development and production costs for devices and structures used across nearly all vertical markets.  For the first time, rapid, accurate spectroscopic imaging with a depth precision to 10 nm of structures at least 400 nm wide will be possible, opening up discovery of fundamental topographical, structural, and chemical properties of simple and complex materials.  Klar intends to become a major supplier of the COP instruments to R&amp;D labs in academia, industry, and government.
