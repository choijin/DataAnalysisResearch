<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the promise to revolutionize bio-medical research via the development of machine vision algorithms for automating video analysis and behavioral monitoring. Many areas of the life sciences demand the manual annotation of large amounts of video data. However, the robust quantification of complex behaviors imposes a major bottleneck and a number of controversies in behavioral studies have arisen because of the inherent biases and challenges associated with the manual annotation of behavior. Many of these issues will be resolved with the use of objective quantitative computerized techniques.  The goal of the project is to leverage machine learning and computer vision to analyze large volumes of data and discover novel visual features of behavior that are literally hidden to the naked eye.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project proposes the large-scale development, testing, and research application of algorithms and software for automating the monitoring and analysis of behavior. We have developed an initial high-throughput system for the automated monitoring and analysis of rodent behavior. The approach capitalizes on recent developments in the area of deep learning, which is a branch of machine learning that enables neural networks composed of multiple processing stages to learn visual representations with multiple levels of abstraction. The current system accurately recognizes a myriad of normal and abnormal rodent behaviors at a level indistinguishable from human when scoring typical behaviors of a singly housed mouse from video. The proposed activities will bring algorithms closer to commercial deployment by addressing the fundamental problem of visual recognition in biological, cognitive, and psychological research.</AbstractNarration>

More specifically, we have interviewed more than a hundred scientists, researchers, and business developers in the pharmaceutical industry to understand the problems surrounding drug development and preclinical research.

We solidified the pain points of scientists conducting animal trials for preclinical research, which are primarily, translating animal models. Finally, we validated whether our research effectively solves a business problem.  From our interviews, we have discovered that animal trials are not an emphasized area of research for scientists -- rather, scientists prefer to move from in vitro to human clinical trials as quickly as possible, because of the translational difficulties in mice models.  We have identified a clear need for reproducible results in preclinical experiments: many variables can derail the outcomes of an experiment including any human in the loop unintentionally introducing bias (especially during the collection of important metrics and increasing stress levels in mice.)
