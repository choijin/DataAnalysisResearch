<AbstractNarration>The main goal of this project is to develop computationally efficient statistical methods for analyzing large complex metagenomics data and generate a broad impact on future microbial community studies. In particular, by thoroughly combining information across samples and species through a carefully constructed Bayesian hierarchical model, better understanding of influences of environmental and biological factors in microbial communities will be made possible. The PI's findings will be integrated into biology through close collaboration with researchers in Ocean Sciences at University of California Santa Cruz. The PI will disseminate computational tools online via user-friendly software. The developed models, although motivated and constructed to address the problems in microbial community studies, are applicable in general to applications outside the metagenomic field. The project will provide graduate students excellent training opportunities in cutting-edge methods on Bayesian modeling to develop methodological research motivated from practically important and scientifically relevant application areas. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Microbial communities interact with the environments and host organisms. Scientific investigations of how microbiome interacts with their host, with their environment, and with each other are of great importance to better understanding of their functional roles such as influences on disease risk susceptibility of the host. In microbial community studies, recent breakthroughs in high-throughput sequencing technology allow deep interrogation of microbiome taken from environmental samples and generate statistically new and interesting challenges for analysis of complex sequencing data. The three main objectives are: (1) to develop Bayesian nonparametric (NP) approaches to probabilistically characterize distributions of abundance levels of microbial species; (2) to develop Bayesian regression models to investigate association between abundance of species and covariates; and (3) to develop a Bayesian graphical method to model interaction of species. Instead of treating individual species as separate outcomes, graphs will be used to represent dependencies between species in a probabilistic model and to identify important relationships between species. This will provide more improved inference on the co-occurrence and co-exclusion of the species with honest uncertainty quantification and lead to greater understanding of the microbial interactions. In addition, the PI will develop scalable and efficient computational algorithms to carry out posterior inference for large sequencing data.</AbstractNarration>
