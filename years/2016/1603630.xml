<AbstractNarration>The study of how black holes evaporate is perhaps the most important outstanding problem in theoretical physics today. Its solution  requires understanding the behavior of two of the pillars of modern physics, gravity and quantum field theory, in their most extreme regimes. Understanding how physical theories fit together in challenging regimes has in the past led to insights of spectacular consequences. An example of this could be Maxwell's understanding of how electricity and magnetism fit together, a synthesis that led to the discovery of radio waves, with the ensuing transformational changes they induced in our society. A second very important objective of this type of work is the formation of human resources of very high quality. Physicists trained in these disciplines have moved on to make contributions leading to rewarding careers in industry and in finance, as well as science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The group will study the application of techniques of loop quantum gravity in spherically symmetric contexts with the ultimate goal of understanding black hole evaporation. They will study the back-reaction of quantum fields living on spherically symmetric quantum space-times that they developed in a previous project. The discreteness of the quantum space-time naturally regularizes the infinities of quantum field theory yielding all results finite. To study the back reaction will require quantum space-times more realistic than the ones we have up to now, including dynamical evolution. They propose to find the quantum space-time of a collapsing shell and compute the back reaction of fields living on it. In addition to this they propose studying the structure of the quantum space-times we have up to now, in particular their singularity structure in the case of extremal and super extremal charged black holes and the Cauchy horizons that appear in the solutions. They also propose to continue the study of uniform discretizations as a quantization approach, in particular comparing with the exact quantization that was used to construct the spherical quantum space-times, which relied on the Abelianization of the algebra of constraints, a condition that one does not expect to generalize for more complex models. They will also explore a proposal for the problem of time and an ensuing proposal for solving the measurement problem in quantum mechanics. They wish to explore more general models than the ones worked out up to now and to study the issue of strong emergence.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Perhaps the central problem of fundamental theoretical physics today is to understand how Einstein's theory of general relativity -which describes gravity- fits with the theory that describes the subatomic world, quantum mechanics.  In no place are the fit more challenged that in the problem of understanding how a black hole evaporates. Black holes are astronomical objects whose gravity is so intense nothing can escape from them, not even light. Hawking showed in 1974 that such objects emit radiation.

Unfortunately the picture painted by Hawking is heuristic, it is not based on a detailed calculation.   In this grant several insights were acquired about issues related to the above described process. In particular it was understood that the Hawking radiation could carry away non-trivial information about what is inside the black hole, therefore explaining how something as non-trivial as a black hole could end up becoming just a bunch of featureless radiation.  We also studied other arenas in which to probe gravity and quantum mechanics, in particular situations that have rotational symmetry.
