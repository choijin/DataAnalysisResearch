<AbstractNarration>The International Conference on Design of Experiments (ICODOE 2016) will be held at the University of Memphis on May 10-13, 2016. The design and analysis of experiments is at the foundation of the scientific method; it is used in applications across all scientific disciplines and engineering. The conference will help in the advancement of knowledge in the area of experimental design as prominent researchers from all over the world will be participating in the conference. This award provides travel support to increase the number of junior researchers who are able to attend.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary objective of the conference is to encourage and support young researchers in the field, to make them aware of the latest developments, and also to bring them together with established researchers in experimental design. The conference will also catalyze research in new directions by bringing together leading researchers from all over the world in the area of design and analysis of experiments and practitioners in the pharmaceutical, chemometric, physical, biological, medical, social, psychological, economic, engineering, and manufacturing sciences. Topics of the conference include design of experiments for big data, design for uncertainty quantification, computational methods, and computer experiments. The focus will be on emerging areas of research in experimental design as well as innovations in traditional areas.

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Department of Mathematical Sciences, University of Memphis organized two international conferences, and the first titled: International Conference on Design of Experiments (ICODOE-2016) was held in the department during May 10 &ndash; 13, 2016 and the second titled: International Conference on Mathematics and Statistics (ICOMAS 2018) was held in the department during May 7-10, 2018. The major goals of both conferences were to support and encourage participation by junior researchers and researchers from underrepresented groups (women and minorities) and also to bring together distinguished researchers from around the world who are actively pursuing theoretical and methodological research in design of experiments, mathematics, statistics and their applications in various allied fields. Both ICODOE 2016 and ICOMAS 2018 were a grand success as each attracted outstanding researchers from all over the world. Participants included more than 10 nations and more than 20 states in USA. All presentations were notable for high quality and considerable breadth.  A large number of young researchers participated in each of these conferences. Many of them presented their research as contributed talks while some of them presented their research as invited speakers.     Comments received from participants of ICODOE-2016  Junior Researchers  Piyush Pandita (5/14/2016), Ph.D. student, Purdue University  I am writing to express my gratitude for the hospitality extended by you and the rest of your team. Every bit of my stay at Memphis was enjoyable and meaningful. I hope to use in my research the fruitful takeaways from the conference.     Xun Huan, Sandia  It was extremely fruitful to meet other researchers, learn their latest developments in experimental design, and have insightful discussions.     Diversity of Participants: Both ICODOE-2016 and ICOMAS 2018 provided ample opportunities to underrepresented groups, mainly minorities and women to showcase their talent. Both the conferences witnessed results of these efforts, with 30% of the conference participants belonging to underrepresented groups.     The project outcomes:  Many of the junior researchers and researchers from underrepresented groups received an opportunity to participate in the international conferences ICODOE 2016 and ICOMAS 2018. Many of the junior researchers presented their research work as contributed speakers while some of them presented their research work as invited speakers.  Many of the junior researchers were able to interact with distinguished senior researchers and they received encouraging input and inspiration from these interactions.      NSF Financial Support: Twenty five junior researchers were provided NSF financial support for participating in ICODOE 2016 while 19 junior researchers were provided NSF financial support for participating in ICOMAS 2018.
