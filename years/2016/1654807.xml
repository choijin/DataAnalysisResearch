<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to improve upon orthopedic medical device design. The medical device market for orthopedics is currently a multi-billion dollar industry. Back pain is the second most common complaint heard by primary care physicians, while over 500,000 knee-ligament reconstructions are performed in the US annually. The total cost of back pain has been estimated to cost the United States between $100 and $200 billion annually. These costs have been calculated from the direct costs of surgery and the indirect costs of lost wages, reduced productivity, and cost of care. This project will challenge the standard of care for orthopedics by integrating a new class of smart and novel polymer materials into medical device design.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project focuses on translating liquid-crystal elastomers (LCEs) into the medical device marketplace. LCEs are a class of stimuli-sensitive "smart" materials that display remarkable mechanical properties and can actively respond to a stimulus; however, these materials have traditionally been difficult to manufacture in a practical and scalable way. This I-Corps project will utilize a newly discovered manufacturing method to produce main-chain LCEs using a thiol-acrylate reaction. This project aims to exploit the unique properties of these materials, such as thermo-reversible actuation, soft elasticity, or damping, to unlock new functionalities in medical device design.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This project was to investigate the commercial potential of using liquid-crystal elastomers for biomedical applications. These materials are unique in their ability to demonstrate reversible shape change when exposed to heat or light as well as dissipate energy when impacted. While liquid-crystal elastomers have been proposed for applications such as artificial muscles, they have only been studied in research laboratories. As a result of an NSF CAREER award (1350436), we uncovered a novel method to produce these materials in a scalable manner, unlocking the potential to commercialize these materials. During this I-Corps award, 101 customers were interviewed to assess the potential of using liquid-crystal elastomers in orthopedic applications. More specifically, we examined the medical device ecosystem by determining the needs of surgeons, manufacturers, patients, and more. At the end of the I-Corps workshop in December 2016, it was decided that our business model was not ready to incorporate a company with a focus on liquid-crystal elastomers for implantable medical devices; however, we continued customer discovery and pivoted to a new market segment, energy absorbing materials for protection. In July 2017, the I-Corps team founded a company, Impressio Inc., to pursue this idea. By using the skills developed with creating a business model canvas and customer discovery, Impressio won the NFL&rsquo;s 1<sup>st</sup> and Future Pitch competition in February 2018 for creating enhancements in protective equipment.&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 02/09/2018<br>      Modified by: Christopher&nbsp;Yakacki</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
