<AbstractNarration>Threats to scientific instruments and data that are accessible via the Internet are ubiquitous.  The SouthEast SciEntific Cybersecurity for University REsearch (SECURE) project helps protect the National Science Foundation's investments in scientific research while providing scientists with tools to safeguard intellectual property and ensure data integrity. The project team provides education, training, and selected cybersecurity services to NSF-funded researchers across the Southeast.  The team is multidisciplinary, comprised of cybersecurity experts (both research and practitioner), scientists, and experts in communication.  Team members are located in South Carolina, Alabama and Mississippi, with strong representation from Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU).  This program raises investigators' awareness of their essential role in creating a secure and trustworthy cyberspace and offers concrete assistance in risk assessment, vulnerability testing, and mitigation tailored to NSF-funded scientists? workflow and program size.  Through past collaborations, the team is well positioned to leverage both national and regional cybersecurity organizations and programs to effectively reach the target audience.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;SouthEast SECURE impacts the region by raising cybersecurity awareness; providing concise training, assessment, tools and one-on-one help; and assisting in preparation of select cybersecurity metrics.  Student interns are conducting many of these activities by means of practicum-based deployment and support, thus developing capabilities in the next generation of cyber professionals.  An online survey of NSF-funded investigators in the region will be conducted to learn about their primary cybersecurity challenges and concerns.  Training is then tailored to provide concrete and practical assistance in how to do right-sized risk assessment and mitigation.  A "toolkit" is provided to test and validate local cybersecurity, and measures of cybersecurity are created and field-tested.  The team?s approach facilitates communication between research faculty and university IT/Data Security staff.  A long-term goal is building communities with common interests in cybersecurity and a commitment to helping others; and building connections with other regions and with national centers and programs.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit :  Southeast SECURE identified and addressed NSF-funded scientists; specific concerns about the security, integrity and availability of their research infrastructure and data.  The multidisciplinary, multi-institutional team of Information Technology professionals, computer science faculty, and communications experts guided graduate students to develop training, assessment, and tools for NSF-funded investigators.  Undergraduate students bridged the gap between university cybersecurity staff and faculty research involving unregulated open science data.     Broader Impact:  Southeast SECURE helped Clemson?s NSF-funded scientists improve their ability to protect integrity and availability of their research data.  On-demand cybersecurity training videos created by the project are available to scientists and to the public. Voorhees College, a Historically Black College (HBCU), funded a new cybersecurity lab and created a cybersecurity focused curriculum for Voorhees students, in collaboration with other institutions in the Orangeburg/Columbia South Carolina area..  A new, user-friendly web-site vulnerability scanning tool was created at University of Tennessee-Chattanooga.     Project Outcomes:  NSF funded investigators in the SouthEast were surveyed. The 707 respondants represented the types of institutions and variety of disciplines funded by NSF. We learned that these scientists wanted more information about understanding appropriate cybersecurity requirements; brief on-demand training videos; and help securing their websites and software they write.  These results were presented to campus cybersecurity staff via REN-ISEC (a consortium of university cyber security professionals) and EDUCAUSE (the largest professional organization for university information technology professionals) to raise awareness of NSF investigator needs.     The project produced seven cybersecurity training videos designed for NSF funded researchers. These videos are available on a YouTube Channel; several of the videos have been adopted for training by other universities and also by the NSF Cybersecurity Center of Excellence.     Software to find and report on web site vulnerabilities was developed to help the average user test web sites they may be developing or using.
