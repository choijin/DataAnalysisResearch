<AbstractNarration>The conference "Geometry, Topology and Complexity of Manifolds, and applications to Biology" will be held at the University of California, Berkeley, during 20-22 May, 2016. The aims of this conference are to bring together mathematicians, computer scientists and biologists to discuss recent developments in understanding geometry of three dimensions and related algorithms, and how these ideas can be applied to biology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There have been many advances in the last few years in the area of 3-dimensional topology and geometry, algorithms to solve geometric problems and to understand their complexity, and applications of ideas from topology and geometry to biology. In order to make these developments known to a larger mathematical audience and to establish connections, this conference will bring together leading experts in these various fields along with early career mathematicians and scientists.

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ We organized and held a successful conference on the topics in the title. It was well attended by grad students and postdocs, as well as more senior mathematicians and a few biologists. For example, there were talks and conversations about applications to biology, specifically using conformal mappings (these can change length but not angles) to measure characteristics of objects with the aim of deciding how similar two objects are.   These objects could be fossil bones where is issue is to what animal does the bone belong.  Or they could be comparing brains.  Or they could be comparing possibly cancerous moles. Other talks involved the mathematics behind these applications.   We organized and held a successful conference on the topics in the title.
