<AbstractNarration>With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation Program (MRI) and support from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program (CRIF), Professor Peter Geissinger from the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee and colleagues Graham Moran, Arsenio Pacheco, Deyang Qu and Nicholas Silvaggi have acquired a 500 MHz Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectrometer. This spectrometer allows research in a variety of fields such as those that accelerate chemical reactions of significant economic importance, as well as the study of biologically relevant species. In general, NMR spectroscopy is one of the most powerful tools available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution or in the solid state. The results from these NMR studies have an impact in synthetic organic/inorganic chemistry, materials chemistry and biochemistry. This instrument is located a general user facility managed by highly qualified scientists is an integral part of research, research training and teaching in the Departments of Chemistry and Biochemistry. The spectrometer helps in the overall mission by providing students with NMR knowledge and enable their success in the chemical/engineering workforce for many industries (chemical, pharmaceutical, biotechnological, engineering, environmental and others), government agencies and laboratories, educational and research institutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The award is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels, especially in areas such as (a) enzyme mechanisms; (b) non-proteinogenic amino acid L-enduracididine; (c) multi-heme respiratory enzymes involved in the interconversion of ammonia and nitrite; (d) enantio- and stereospecific methods to synthesize antimalarial and antileishmanial bisindole alkaloids; (e) asymmetric catalysts for organic synthesis; (f) vitamin D receptor modulators; (g) reactivity and function of DNA and its application for DNA sequence detection and drug discovery; (h) energy technologies and (i) reagents, media, and processes for the separation of metal ions.</AbstractNarration>
