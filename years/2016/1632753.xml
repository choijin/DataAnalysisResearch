<AbstractNarration>This award will support a conference "Perspectives on integral geometry" which will take place at the University of Georgia in Athens, GA on May 30 - June 3, 2016. Despite its long history, only in the past few decades, and especially since the turn of the century, has integral geometry begun to mature as a coherent mathematical subject, both in its internal development as a part of pure mathematics and externally as a source of powerful tools for scientific applications. This conference will bring together researchers working in all of the major strands of the subject, with the aim of catalyzing further progress.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Alesker's theory of valuations has provided a penetrating new language that has greatly enhanced the depth and effectiveness of the traditional ideas on integral geometry, growing mainly from Blaschke's famous kinematic formulas. At the same time, integral geometry has found new applications in stochastic analysis and data compression. The aim of the conference is to bring all of the major contemporary strands of the subject together in order to promote further internal development, to explore connections with other parts of pure mathematics, and to enhance the effectiveness of applications to science and technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;conference website: https://faculty.franklin.uga.edu/fu/content/perspectives-integral-geometry</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The main purpose of this award was to fund a conference entitled "Perspectives on integral geometry", held at the University of Georgia from May 30&mdash;June 2, 2016.   The subject of integral geometry constitutes an approach to geometry based on aggregated numerical data, typically in the form of integrals of curvature. While its roots reach back to the 1700s, systematic development of the subject has begun only more recently. In fact, prior to this century only a rare few mathematicians adopted the subject as a primary focus of research effort. Since roughly the year 2000, however, a number of mathematical workers have attacked it in a more systematic way, introducing a variety of new ideas.   This conference brought together many of the most prominent mathematicians from around the world who have been active in these developments. The resulting exchange of ideas will stimulate accelerated progress in the area.  The original conception of the proposal was to fund also a few smaller regional conference on geometry which were to have been less topically focused. As the integral geometry conference came in under budget, with the permission of the NSF we used the residual funds to stage two such conferences, at Georgia Tech on February 26, 2017 and at Vanderbilt on August 26, 2017.
