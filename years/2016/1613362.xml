<AbstractNarration>The origin of the chemical elements is one of the fundamental problems in nuclear physics and astrophysics, and the detailed understanding of the structural and dynamical properties of nuclei is the key ingredient for progress in understanding the nucleosynthesis process that allows for the formation of atomic nuclei from constituent nucleons (protons and nucleons). One of the challenges posed by this problem concerns the study of nuclei that feature a large imbalance between the number of protons and neutrons. These nuclei are generally unstable, leading to radioactivity, and have important societal relevance for industry, medicine and defense applications. In that broader context, this project will provide theoretical support for the science programs at leading experimental facilities, such as the future Facility for Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB) under construction on the campus of Michigan State University. In particular, the PI and his students will continue the development of a theoretical approach aimed at providing a consistent description of nuclear structure and nuclear reactions needed to analyze the experimental data at FRIB and other nuclear physics facilities. The PI will mentor graduate students in this research and collaborate with experimental colleagues who will perform related experiments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project aims at providing a simultaneous description of positive energy nucleons, the domain of elastic scattering, and bound nucleons, the domain of nuclear structure, using the framework of the propagator method of quantum mechanics. The application of the propagator method will employ the nonlocal implementation of the description of the potentials that allows for the accurate description of ground-state properties using the method of dispersion relations. Accompanying the implementation of the propagator method to describe all relevant experimental data, including elastic scattering cross sections and matter and charge distributions, will be the calculation of these properties using the same framework but starting from the underlying interactions between nucleons as constrained by the symmetries of the fundamental theory of quarks and gluons, Quantum Chromo Dynamics, and the available data for the properties of two nucleons. Such calculations will be applied with a new scheme that allows the ab initio calculation of properties of heavier nuclei that have not been studied in this way to date. The method will also be applied to calculations of the superfluid properties of neutron stars.</AbstractNarration>

In particular, these potentials must be nonlocal, in other words the interaction must not only depend on where the nucleon is but also where and how fast it is going. This feature has been well known on the basis of theoretical consideration but has now been confirmed on the basis of our analysis of experimental data. The implementation of this new approach has for the first time been able to describe where the protons are located in the Calcium-40  and 48 nuclei as well as Lead-208. The method has also been shown to have predictive properties that includes the determination of the location of neutrons when there are more neutrons than protons in the nucleus like in the Calcium-48 nucleus and Lead-208 one. The prediction for the so-called neutron skin is of great importance for the understanding of neutron star properties and ties in with the experimental effort at Jefferson Lab where the neutron skin of these nuclei is determined by employing parity-violating electron scattering.  For the first time all the ingredients for the analysis of the electron-induced proton knockout reaction have been provided using potentials determined by other experimental data. It was therefore possible to assess the validity of the reaction model for both Calcium-40 and 48 nuclei in the kinematic regime employed in the original Nikhef, Amsterdam experiments. The excellent agreement with these data makes future analyses of the proton-induced nucleon knockout experiments possible for rare isotopes. The current results demonstrate unambiguously that the removal probability of protons near the Fermi energy decreases when neutron are added answering the science question what nucleon properties change when exotic nuclei are studied.  In complementary work the superfluid properties of neutron stars were investigated at very high density by employing the same Green's function method but now starting from the underlying interaction between neutrons in free space. Such a so-called ab initio calculation includes the proper treatment of the repulsive nature of this interaction and its consequences for the modified properties of neutrons inside the stellar medium. The method has been applied to the exotic pairing phase which has magnetic properties similar to those observed in the atomic Helium-3 liquid at extremely low temperatures. Additional complications of the nuclear interaction related to its intrinsic angular momentum dependence are included as well as the effect of low-energy collective motion of the neutron liquid on the interaction between the neutrons. We predict weak superfluid behavior for this exotic system which appears to be of a magnitude that is necessary to explain recent cooling observations of a neutron star in the Cassiopeia A system.
