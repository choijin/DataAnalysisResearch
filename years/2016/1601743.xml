<AbstractNarration>Emerging applications of photonics, photonics-enabled technologies, and precision optics impact both economic development and national security in the United States. To help meet the expanding need for photonics and precision optics technicians, this project at Montana State University Gallatin College will develop a two-year photonics and laser technician program designed to advance the knowledge and skill-sets of students entering the photonics workforce, prepare students for rewarding jobs with photonics employers, and provide employed technicians additional education and training to support technical innovation. The project will enhance the photonics infrastructure in the Gallatin Valley, which supports the goal of the Montana Photonics Industry Alliance to make the Gallatin Valley one of the premier photonics region in the nation. The project will advance rural technician education and broaden the diversity of the technician workforce while it increases the number of photonics trained technicians to support critical industries in the national economy. It will expand productivity and efficiency of local companies by providing highly skilled technicians for employment. It will improve industry connections to academia through the participation of industry on an industry advisory board and in curriculum review, an internship program, job placement, resource sharing, and program feedback.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Following the framework developed by the ATE National Center for Optics and Photonics Education (OP-TEC) (DUE 1303732) and advice from industry partners, this program will educate students; teachers, and the community about photonics technology. To meet this goal the project will (a) implement an Associate of Applied Science Photonics and Laser Technology (AAS PLT) program, (b) adapt and further develop photonics curriculum and coursework; (c) equip an optics/photonics laboratory for education and training; (d) provide professional development for faculty to prepare them to teach photonics courses in the AAS PLT program using the Fundamentals of Light and Lasers curriculum of OP-TEC; (e) conduct outreach activities to promote the new program in eight area high schools, offering career pathways and dual enrollment; and (f) implement an internship program to assure that students have exposure to local photonics companies. High school students and teachers will be taught about the importance of photonics technology in the 21st century and thus increase the knowledge of photonics by high school instructors, students, and the community through direct recruiting, career fairs, dual enrollment, professional development activities, and marketing strategies. All of the results of this project will be fed back to OP-TEC and the broader photonics community to advance their knowledge and help refine their framework for enhancing Optics and Photonics education. A comprehensive evaluation will be conducted to determine the success of the project and its deliverables.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Obj. 1. In June of 2016 teh PI hired a qualified Program Director to continue the program development and teach the Photonics, Laser and Optics (PLO) courses.  A best practice for Gallatin College is to hire a faculty that was recently engaged with industry.  This PLO Program Director came directly from a photonics company which allowed for easy industry connections and a relevant understanding of industry needs.    The new Program Director was added to the NSF grant as Co-PI,  and established two electronics labs and one optics teaching lab. Along with these spaces a traditional teaching space is also  being utilized by the new program thanks to this NSF funding.    Obj.2: Both electronics and Class IV laser labs where set up as a result of the NSF-ATE funding.  There are many specific pieces of equipment that were purchased using NSF funds, broadly speaking some items included are; One ELAS Nd: YAG Laser System, Optical workstations, power meters, opt-mechanical components, beam profilers etc. The college and Perkins funding also funded matching Class IV Laser teaching stations.  This NSF grant was the impetus to get the program rolling and created leveraged funds for the college support.     Obj. 3: Train faculty to teach photonics courses in the AAS PLT program   The program secured a new part-time faculty hire to assist in the teaching of technical courses of the program. This new faculty member was immediately enrolled in OP-TEC's online hybrid course "Fundamentals of Light and Lasers". This course is designed to teach new faculty members how to execute OP-TEC's "Fundamentals of Light and Lasers" course which is the framework for Gallatin College's introductory optics/photonics course. The faculty member has completed the online portion of OP-TEC's "Fundamentals of Light and Lasers" hybrid course and is currently teaching the lab portion of Gallatin College?s "Fundamentals of Light and Lasers" course with excellent results. No additional faculty have been hired.   Obj. 4: Gallatin College Program Director and Student Success Director provided a variety of outreach activities for the Photonics AAS.  These activities include developing a brochure, visiting middle and high school classrooms, working with the Bozeman Children's Museum to develop traveling kits for classrooms or to be used in the museum.  The program also received attention from local media outlets when the Governor visited the Laser lab and a couple of articles were written about the new program and it's collaboration with Montana State University.    Obj. 5. The Gallatin College PLT AAS has had success with 12 graduates. Within the first year of the program, all 7 students from the first cohort (started the program in AY 2016-2017, graduated May 2018) had internships/part-time employment at local photonics companies. All original 7 graduates are currently still employed at those companies. Similarly, all 8 students from the second cohort (started the program in AY 2017-2018) had internships, and  five graduated May 2019. This second cohort of students participated in  paid internships/part-time employment in local photonics companies. Finally, 4 of 12 students from the third cohort (started the program in AY 2018-2019) also have internships/part-time employment. These numbers have far exceeded the expectations of the program this early in the life cycle, and therefore the internship/employment program has been a huge success.  This is a total of 19 students that have participated in paid internships.         Last Modified: 07/29/2019       Submitted by: Stephanie Gray]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
