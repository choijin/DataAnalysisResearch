<AbstractNarration>Conifers are globally important, both ecologically and economically. Many conifer species have recently experienced extreme mortality events due to drought, fire and insect outbreaks. There is an urgent need to understand conifer physiology, and especially conifer needles - the organs responsible for carbon uptake and regulation of water loss. Conifers have an intriguing paradox in the link between their leaf anatomy and physiology: with such a simplistic, single-vein vascular system, how can they compete with broadleaf species or inhabit extreme environments? This project aims to understand how conifer leaf anatomy influences water transport and photosynthesis, and how needle water transport declines during drought. This information will then be used to develop a mechanistic model to help predict forest productivity and mortality in response to drought and other environmental challenges. The project will provide training for a postdoctoral researcher, a graduate student, and multiple undergraduate students. Also, in collaboration with the McCall Outdoor Science School, 5th and 6th grade students, their parents and teachers will participate in a workshop called "What happens inside a leaf?" To illustrate how cellular-level modifications can influence landscape processes, 3D-printed conifer needle models generated from X-ray imaging will be used. Anatomical models will be freely available through a website for teachers and students to 3D print hand-held models at schools, or as teaching kits for schools without access to 3D printing technology. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Conifers inhabit some of the driest and coldest habitats where trees are found.  Many conifer species are threatened by heat waves and droughts that induce physiological stress that can make them more vulnerable to pests and pathogens. Although most conifer leaves have only a single vein supplying water to the leaf, the internal anatomy outside the vein is incredibly diverse across the conifer phylogeny. The impact of this diversity on water transport and carbon uptake is unknown. The primary goal of this project is to develop a mechanistic framework to understand the influence of conifer leaf anatomy on leaf hydraulic conductance and photosynthetic capacity. This mechanistic understanding will be used to illuminate how conifers have adapted to arid and cold environments and have also been able to successfully compete with angiosperm species over evolutionary history. The project will combine state-of the art 3-dimensional imaging methods (high-resolution X-ray computed micro-tomography) with a hydraulic model and measurement of leaf hydraulic conductance to clarify the impact of conifer leaf internal anatomy on hydraulic function.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The overarching goal of this project was to leverage advancements in high-resolution X-ray micro-computed tomography (microCT) imaging technology to explore the three-dimensional (3D) organization of conifer leaves, with a special focus on the genus<em> Pinus</em> (pines) and other non-flowering plants, the gymnosperms. Our research team utilized the microCT facility at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory Advanced Light Source in Berkeley, CA to collect 3D image data of over 25 pine species as well as an additional 10 gymnosperm species. We then coupled these anatomical images with photosynthesis and water transport measurements on those same leaves to determine the relationships between 3D structure and function. We further developed a machine learning algorithm for semi-automating the image processing steps to convert the raw microCT data, which allows us to now study the different leaf cell types independently and in 3D, which is the first time this has been possible at this level of detail. Our microCT and physiology dataset includes samples from trees at multiple locations throughout the US, including Idaho, California, Georgia, and Connecticut, and commercially and ecologically relevant species like ponderosa pine, southern yellow pine(s), and radiata pine. Our data reveal for the first time the relationship between the 3D surface area on the inside of the leaf (needle) exposed to the atmosphere and their maximum photosynthetic rate, as well as their water use efficiency. Pines have a surprisingly high number of stomata in their epidermis, which are the cell complexes that act like micro-valves allowing atmospheric gases to pass across the leaf surface. Our data show that pines have an exceptionally high tissue volume and surface area per stomate when compared to the flowering plants. This information helps to explain the lower photosynthetic rates found in many pine species despite their high stomatal density, and suggests that there are fundamental constraints on productivity given this type of leaf form (the needle) compared to flat, laminar leaves found in other plant groups. Furthermore, variability in these traits is low within the pine species we studied, even within a species across its geographical distribution. We therefore conclude that these traits are relatively fixed with low plasticity, and that leaf form in terms of the internal cellular architecture does not appear to be highly adaptable to a given habitat. These data therefore suggest that other traits, such as rooting depth or allocation of the ratio of xylem area to leaf area, may be more plastic, allowing pines to adapt to various habitats. Our 3D imaging dataset is being made available through the Brodersen Lab website for teaching and research purposes. These 3D models can be downloaded for free from the web portal and are available in an interactive format for exploration in a web browser or mobile phone app. They can also be used in virtual reality headsets, as well as sent to a 3D printer to provide a physical, hand-held model for teaching. These models have been incorporated into Brodersen's graduate and undergraduate courses, and have been downloaded and used by colleagues and the general public, both within the US and internationally.&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 02/04/2021<br>      Modified by: Craig&nbsp;R&nbsp;Brodersen</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
