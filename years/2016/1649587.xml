<AbstractNarration>The goal of this project is to facilitate increased interest in cybersecurity careers and cybersecurity hygiene through a research workshop for graduate students interested in cybersecurity. To encourage participation, the project proposes to provide support to students to attend the workshop and associated Conference on Cybersecurity Education, Research and Practice (CCERP). The proposed workshop will recruit recognized security research faculty to serve as mentors to selected graduate students chosen based on proposed research projects in cybersecurity. In addition, the project will support undergraduate research in Cybersecurity Hygiene by funding stipends for undergraduate students to attend the conference and conduct poster sessions. These undergraduate students will be encouraged to create and present poster sessions during the main conference day. The support provided by this grant will improve the visibility and understanding of the topic of cybersecurity hygiene as the theme of the conference and undergraduate presentations. An increase in cybersecurity professionals and an increase in cybersecurity understanding will directly and indirectly benefit society through increased information protection and privacy. The proposed improvements to the conference will directly support national efforts like the Strategic Plan for the National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education (NICE), and the White House Cybersecurity National Action Plan (CNAP). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference and proposed workshop will focus on increasing the knowledge and understanding of participants by concentrating on the need for an increased cybersecurity workforce as well as on practices used to increase awareness of recommended practices in developing curriculum for increasing awareness of cybersecurity hygiene. Also, improving the research methods of graduate students by linking them with mentors who are established researchers and offering them an exposure to an academic conference will encourage the development of future cybersecurity faculty. These activities will enable the participants to take lessons learned back to their home institution and share with colleagues and future students, improving the quality of cybersecurity education and hygiene within their institutions. The results of the conference will be disseminated through the open access publication of proceedings. Best papers of the conference will be published in the Journal of Cybersecurity Education Research and Practice (JCERP).</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Thanks to the support of the NSF, Dr. Piotrowski and our host institution, Kennesaw State University, this project provided mentorship and research development support for 22 graduate students who wrote research-in-progress papers, and recognized 3 undergraduate students who presented posters on Cybersecurity Hygiene issues.  Each of the graduate students submitted competitive research-in-progress papers and were paired with a team of faculty mentors representing the best in information security/cybersecurity research throughout the southeast.  The students had their work reviewed prior to a face-to-face meeting, and then presented their updated work to their peers at a regional cybersecurity conference, the Conference on Cybersecurity Education, Research and Practice (CCERP) held annually at Kennesaw State University, Georgia.    Due to a shortage of submissions for the 2016 CCERP, the PIs received an extention to repeat the best practices of the event at the 2017 CCERP and at a special Graduate Student Research Workshop, also held at KSU in March 2018.  Abstracts of presented papers at the 2016 and 2017 CCERP events are available at https://digitalcommons.kennesaw.edu/ccerp.  The working papers for the 2018 event were returned to the students for further development and eventual publication at conference and journals in the field.  This support has increased the interest in Cybersecurity research by graduate students in the southeast in a variety of topics, including Cybersecurity Hygiene, Workforce Development and general security topics.
