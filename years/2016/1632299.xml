<AbstractNarration>General Audience Summary &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award provides support for a two-day international workshop; specifically, it provides travel support for workshop participants. The workshop will be jointly hosted by Arizona State University, the European Commission, the Institute of Medicine, and the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development.  Its focus is open and responsible innovation at the interface between neuroscience, brain research and technological convergence. It will draw together researchers working on national brain initiatives with social scientists working on bioethics, law, public policy and science and technology studies. Its goal is to increase clarity and better mutual understanding amongst all stakeholders about the implications of ethical, legal, and social values in brain science and the development and use of emerging and converging technologies within the field of brain research. Outputs and recommendations stemming from the workshop shall be used to inform policy makers and other groups to strengthen values of responsible innovation in public sector research funding, development and implementation of regulatory frameworks, public and private sector research activities and commercialization.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Summary &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop will provide an opportunity to stimulate interdisciplinary dialogue and collaboration around responsible brain research and related technology development. It will offer a platform for members of the scientific community, policy makers, funders, regulatory agencies and civil society to address a number of issues. They will consider options to increase the creativity and social responsibility of brain science and neuro-technological innovation through more open and collaborative approaches. They will analyze mechanisms to integrate values of open and responsible innovation into major brain research initiatives and funding programs, and consider the role of standards for the development of industrialized process and products. In addition, they will work to identify opportunities for brain science and neuro-technology innovation to inform the broader set of stakeholders in biomedical research, engineering, policy, regulation, funding and commercialization about the societal needs and desires in science and technology.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ A number of jurisdictions now have large-scale brain projects, each of which - in one way or another - is focused on unlocking the secrets of the human brain. These include, for example, the United States, Israel, Japan and the European Union. Knowledge creation and inventions generated out of these projects offers the promise of new solutions to treating numerous mental and physical health conditions, leading to huge social and economic benefits.  Advances in brain science also give rise to a myriad of ethical, social and legal issues - all of which must be considered along side the development of the science and technologies itself. Brain science and technologies should, in short, be developed using a lens of responsible innovation.  In order to advance the discussion and understanding of what responsible innovation may look like for large-scale brain projects, a 1.5 day meeting was held in Washington, D.C. in September 2016. The event was co-organized/co-sponsored by the OECD, the National Academies and Arizona State University. 100 leading experts from across the globe participated in the event, with representatives from industry, government, non-governmental organizations, science and academia present. The backgrounds of individuals in the room ranged from ethics to law, neurotechnologies to business, policy to philosophy to name just a few.   Over the course of the 1.5 days, four general themes emerged that were deemed to be important to the success of the science and its uptake by the public. They were:  1. cross-project learning  2. learning across different governance frameworks  3. innovating governance, and   4. facing the challenge of integrating society and science.   Each now requires stakeholders to examine each in depth, and determine how the learnings from this work can feed into the decision-making processes of large scale brain projects.   Key outputs associated with the project include the workshop itself, along with:   - an article in the journal Neuron which reported on the workshop and its key take aways, and  - a forthcoming special issue of the Journal of Responsible Innovation.
