<AbstractNarration>This project provides cyberinfrastructure upgrades that will allow UC Santa Barbara to continue to scale and expand the capability of both internal and external research computing while simultaneously supporting increased cybersecurity and threat detection measures. Upgraded services will enable rapid, unimpeded movement of the diverse and distributed scientific data sets utilized by 120 research teams at UC Santa Barbara. Networking infrastructure upgrades will facilitate learning, science and research, and establish greater accessibility of scientific and research data within the UC Santa Barbara campus as well as with research partners across the nation and the world. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposed network enhancements address urgent network saturation challenges across campus by facilitating efficient movement of large data sets between three critical groups of data producers, users, and repositories: (1) Earth and Environmental research groups on campus who affiliate within the Earth Research Institute; (2) the Alexandria Digital Research Library, which is UC Santa Barbara Library's home for collections of digital research materials hosted in the UCSB Library; and (3) the North Hall Data Center on the UC Santa Barbara campus, which is a central repository of data archives, storage, and backup. Additionally, the proposal supports UC Santa Barbara's national and world-wide collaborative computing efforts by increasing networking bandwidth at the edge of campus. These collaborations include involvement in the NSF-funded Pacific Research Platform, the Aristotle federated cloud initiative, the Large Hadron Collider Open Network Environment, and the Extreme Science and Engineering Discovery Environment (XSEDE).</AbstractNarration>
