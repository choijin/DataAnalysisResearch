<AbstractNarration>This project focuses on developing efficient models for multi-way functional data and multi-layer network data.  Functional data refers to data recorded over a continuum, such as growth curves for many children.  Examples of multi-way functional data include brain-imaging data measured over space and time, and data obtained from mobile tracking apps where daily activity profiles are recorded for a number of individuals over a period of many days.  Despite the growing number of applications, the complex structure and high-dimensionality of the data pose significant challenges for statistical modeling and inference.  The second part of the project focuses on multi-layer network data obtained from multi-modal and multi-task brain connectivity studies.  A rigorous statistical framework for these network structures will be developed.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the long history of image processing and spatial-temporal analysis, many methods have relied on separability, the assumption that the covariance can be factorized as a product of a spatial covariance and a temporal covariance.  Recent approaches for repeated functional data and multi-way functional data also invoke separability, either explicitly or implicitly, to achieve efficient dimension reduction.  A new notion of weak separability, that includes covariance separability as a special case, will be introduced.  Tests of weak separability will be developed, and principled answers to several open questions will be provided.  In the second part of the project, generative models of multi-layer network data with community structures will be introduced.  Least squares estimation of memberships will be studied from a novel relational k-means perspective, and theoretical justification provided under a statistical inference framework.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[       The project focued on developing methods to model functional data with multiple indices and relational data with multiple sources of interaction, both of which can be viewed as tensor objects.     In recent years, an increasing amount of multi-way functional data have been made available, for instance, brain imaging data with spatial and temporal indices. Other examples include repeatedly observed functional data, such as data obtained from tracking apps where users' 24-hour profiles of activities are recorded every day.

It generally falls into the nonparametric statistics paradigm, where minimal assumptions are imposed on the shape of the random trajectories. In particular, this NSF funded project developed nonparametric modeling of the covariance structures and the random multi-way functional objectives through a concept of weak separability. The weakly separable structure supports the use of factorization methods that decompose the signal into its spatial and temporal components. The analysis reveals interesting connections to the usual strongly separable covariance structure, and provides insights into tensor methods for multi-way functional data.          Another line of the work in this project focused on the modeling of multi-layer network data where the relationships between pairs of elements are reflected in multiple modalities and may be described by multivariate or even high-dimensional vectors.

Our theorems show that, as compared to single-layer community detection, a multi-layer network provides much richer information that allows for consistent community detection from a much sparser network.           Almost all of my work in functional data and network data analysis has been motivated by the great needs of developing new statistical methods to address unique challenges in my collaborative work. Over the years, I have developed a vibrant collaboration with researchers in mental health. The proposed methods have been applied to analyze neuroimaging data and genetic data collected in various schizophrenia and suicide research projects. Meanwhile, the work integrated a number of emerging and active research problems from applications to theoretical analysis, which provided education and training opportunities to students, and led to two pieces of thesis work.
