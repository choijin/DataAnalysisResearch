<AbstractNarration>This research centers on finite reflection groups -- these are the symmetries that, for example, make the five Platonic solids known to the Greeks (the cube, tetrahedron, octahedron, dodecahedron, and icosahedron) so irresistibly attractive and fascinating. Part of their mystery and beauty is a bit frustrating; we want to understand their common features, not just as a list of five unrelated objects. It has long been known that having enough reflection symmetries is part of this story.  This project is about understanding reflection groups, via their generating reflections and the algebra that governs how the reflections compose, in a broader context. Results of the work are expected to have application to random sorting networks and to better understanding of the representation theory of the finite general linear groups.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Classical reflection groups are not only unified in that they are generated by reflections -- they also share common features with general linear groups over a finite field. Particularly gratifying is that, when viewing the finite general linear group as a reflection group, one is led to questions about its representation theory and its invariant theory that (conjecturally) have surprisingly simple and elegant answers. In this project, the ordinary representation theory of finite general linear groups will be explored using the method pioneered by Okounkov and Vershik for studying symmetric groups. Also, the characteristic-p invariant theory of finite general linear groups will be studied using ideas arising from the connection between Catalan combinatorics and the characteristic zero invariant theory of real reflection groups.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goals of the project were to understand more about reflection groups, whose most famous examples are the symmetries, such as rotation about axes and reflection through mirrors, of the regular solids  known to ancient civilizations; see accompanying figure.  These regular solids have cousins in two dimensions, the regular polygons, and also relatives in higher dimensions, which become harder to picture.  There are amazing common features to all of their reflection group symmetries, some well-understood, and some still mysterious.  These solids become even more tantalizing when one extends them from living in spaces that use real numbers as coordinates to those that use complex numbers!  In studying the reflection groups, it has been known since the1800's that algebra plays a crucial role.  In the last two centuries, much more theory was developed to understand them, in a topic called invariant theory.  The goal of this project was to develop more invariant theory, and also use it to understand many amazing counting formulas that come up when studying these reflection groups.  This was achieved in the PI's various collaborations with colleagues at U. Mass-Amherst, at U. North Texas, in various PhD theses supervised by the PI, and in the research of many undergraduates that he supervised in REUs over several summers.  The upshot of many of these results was that various counts are described by surprisingly simple formulas, often in the form of easy to write down products.  In the end, this is explained because of structural results from the invariant theory of reflection groups.
