<AbstractNarration>The Historically Black Colleges and Universities - Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP) provides support to undertake an institutional self-analysis in preparation for a Broadening Participation Research Center.  Broadening Participation Research Centers are expected to serve as national hubs for the rigorous study and broad dissemination of the critical pedagogies and culturally sensitive interventions that contribute to the success of HBCUs in educating African American STEM undergraduates. This project is a collaborative effort between the initial members of an education research consortium: Tennessee State University, Prairie View A&amp;M University, Morgan State University, North Carolina A&amp;T State University, and Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University. The consortium of schools and team of researchers will work to plan research activities that will lead to the formation of a research center that delineates which individual factors, environmental factors, institutional practices, procedures, and policies are most effective in ensuring that students successfully complete STEM degrees at HBCUs. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Activities of this project include: implementating a strategic planning framework built upon the broadening participation education research expertise of the collaborating institutions involved in the development of an expanded education research consortium of HBCUs; using evidence-based strategies to generate a high-quality plan for the research thrusts and research methodologies of the resulting center; and addressing the gap in the literature regarding STEM education research results, practices and policies pertinent to student persistence and graduation at HBCUs. The project will be guided by an on-going evaluation and an external advisory committee.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[My participation in this project began while at Virginia Tech and moved with me to Old Dominion University. An outcome of the project was the creation of ENHANCE2 (The Emerging Network of HBCUs Advancing kNowledge Critical to Engineering Education). Primary activities included: attending monthly team meetings;  participating in strategic planning meetings; reviewing relevant white papers on the state of research and practice and speaking to or visiting STEM research centers and subsequent analysis of best practices and procedures; and  initiating a pilot research project on HBCU STEM graduation rates, programs, and policies to encompass individual, institutional, and environmental variables.   The results of the pilot study suggested, the preparation of students and the extent to which instructors help students overcome barriers would be a promising area to address through the formation of our Center. Furthermore, the data also suggests that the overall learning environment of the HBCUs is a strength, worthy of additional study by the Center.  Armed with this information, ENHANCE2 was born. ENHANCE2 is organized around the pre-college characteristics of students, the organizational context each university works in, and the peer environment students and faculty experience. Over the next 5 years, research activities will focus on these three broad, interconnected themes to form the center?s research thrust areas: 1) cultural translation, 2) institutional climate, and 3) workforce development.    1. Cultural Translation: research projects will focus on advancing theoretical understanding of student development broadly and, more specifically, how students gain knowledge in engineering&mdash;based on race, gender, class and other salient identities. The Center will leverage student development theories, motivation theories, identity theories, and learning theories to guide research focused on better understanding the development and experiences of students attending HBCUs, a population that is not often the central focus of theory development in these knowledge areas.   Example research questions, such as the following, will help shape research projects within this thrust: a.   What current models and theories are being implemented in engineering programs at HBCUs and how has this impacted student success? b.  How can academic success in engineering education be enhanced when taking into account intersectional components of student identity?   2. Institutional Climate: research projects will focus on advancing HBCUs as a means to broadening participation in engineering. The Center will focus on advancing an understanding of access as it relates to engineering programs at HBCUs, the presence (or absence) of bias in these unique environments, multiculturalism, and inclusivity. Additionally, this thrust will focus on research projects that advance our understanding of faculty training and development practices that lead to improvements in content pedagogy and educational outcomes for all students. In collaboration with the other research thrusts, this area will provide a framework for understanding how the institutional climate influences diversity efforts and how diversity is linked to the educational mission of student success.   Example research questions such as the following will help shape research projects within this thrust: a.   How do HBCUs define diversity and how does that definition guide the hiring practices of faculty in the engineering? Student enrollment in engineering programs? b.  What resources are available to faculty and how does this impact the student success? c.   What challenges need to be addressed in order to establish faculty development efforts?   3.
