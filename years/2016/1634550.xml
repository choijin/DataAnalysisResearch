<AbstractNarration>Dark social networks consist of illegal and covert networks of people. Given the nature of being "dark", it is vital to disrupt the network through capture (interdiction) or intelligence gathering (monitoring). In contrast, information on these networks is often incomplete, inaccurate or not available. Gathering information on dark networks dates back to World War II and has become more prevalent today given the current climate of "The War on Terror"; the increased access to information; and the usage of social network analysis to analyze these networks.  This award supports fundamental research using innovative mathematical techniques to interdict or monitor cohesiveness within dark social networks.  This award also supports a concerted effort to engage underrepresented groups within the research and positively impact engineering education.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In particular, the research team will utilize new techniques within branch decomposition methods and integer programming to investigate the clique-interdiction problem, the minimum clique-transversal problem and the variations of the problems where "clique" is replaced with k-plex, k-clique or k-club.  This research will advance the knowledge base of combinatorial optimization and integer programming while also contributing to the increased scalability and efficiency for solving computationally hard problems related to homeland security, criminal justice, and marketing.</AbstractNarration>

In essence, we focused on the clique-interdiction problem, the minimum clique-transversal problem and variations of the problems where "clique" is replaced with other mathematical interpretations of cohesiveness.   In terms of intellectual merit, the knowledge base in this research area was expanded by studying and exploiting the underlying structure of these mathematical concepts through theoretical and computational techniques.  In addition, the models and algorithms that resulted from this study were validated using laboratory experimental data and expertise provided by using publicly available social network datasets.  In all, this resulted in one published article with at least three more articles submitted for publication.  In terms of broader impacts, it is our hope that the increased knowledge-base will increase the scalability and efficiency for solving computationally hard problems related to homeland security, criminal justice, and marketing.
