<AbstractNarration>Non-technical Description: This research creates special coatings for solar cells that increase the amount of the sun's energy that the cells can use, making them more efficient. The coatings also help reduce heating of the solar cells, which wastes energy. These coatings can be used with currently-available solar cell materials, enabling more attractive viability as a commercial product. The coatings may also be applied to light emitting diodes, helping control the color of light over a wide temperature range. Although not the focus of this investigation, the coatings have additional applications in medical X-ray imaging, non-destructive evaluation and homeland security. These research efforts are integrated with educational activities exposing graduate students to real world problems of energy saving as well as the full academic experience of information dissemination in the form of writing papers and presenting research, travel, grant writing and teaching. As part of the outreach activities, a summer internship is available for high school and undergraduate students, which gives a small number of students, each year, the opportunity to learn more about scientific research, perform experiments, give presentations, and participate in many other aspects of a scientific career. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Description: The aim of this activity is to develop novel 'designer' glass ceramics based on a modified fluorozirconate glass composition, and to explore their luminescence behavior. The ultimate goal is to gain insights leading to optimization of these designer nanocomposites for applications as wavelength shifters pertaining to up- and down-converters in solar cells and light emitting diodes. Pulsed laser deposition is used to synthesize layered nanocomposite materials so that very fine control of the distribution of the optically-active dopant and the nanocrystalline structure responsible for the optical behavior is achieved, leading to the development of a glass ceramic with enhanced light output. Systematic studies of optical behavior, as a function of parameters such as the designed distribution of the optically-active component layers within the glass matrix and the relative concentrations of optical dopants and nanocrystals, enable an understanding of how energy transfer between the luminescent dopant atoms and the nanocrystals (and thus the optical efficiency) can be controlled. The combination of in situÂ¬ transmission electron microscopy, ellipsometry and X-ray diffraction enables the structure-property relationships to be visualized and linked together. For example, critical control over optimum dopant position can be achieved by studying the diffusion paths of the dopants during in situ heating.</AbstractNarration>

The work completed during this project led to new scientific discoveries and contributed to the professional development of the students that participated in the project.</p> <p><strong><em>Intellectual Merit Outcomes</em></strong></p> <p>A series of layered nanocomposite thin films based on FCZ glass ceramics was designed. Pulsed laser deposition (PLD) was the deposition method in order to obtain delicate control of the vertical distribution of each component in the nanocomposite films. The layered nanocomposite films are composed of multiple repeats of a unit that consists of (glass matrix/BaCl<sub>2</sub> or BaF<sub>2</sub>/rare earth dopant). We explored different glass matrix materials (ZLANI and alumina), together with different Ba halide nanocrystal materials (BaCl<sub>2</sub> or BaF<sub>2</sub>). During the materials selection process, a novel fluoride glass matrix material (ZLANI) was synthesized and studied. It was found that the structural relaxation and crystallization (Figure 1) led to an increase and then a decrease in the transmittance of ZLANI films, as the thermal annealing temperature increased. The transparency of the films was correlated to a post-synthesis annealing temperature, which leads to potential applications as passive temperature sensors (Figure 2).</p> <p>Translucent films composed of europium-doped barium chloride nanocrystals and an amorphous matrix were produced and evaluated for use as a storage phosphor plate in computed radiography. A radiograph developed with the experimental film revealed a spatial resolution of 10 lp/mm (Figure 3), which is considered to be high-resolution in commercial applications.</p> <p>We then moved on to layered nanocomposites containing Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> as the glass matrix. We showed that we could design and create layered nanocomposite films with uniform layer thicknesses and controlled vertical distribution of the halide nanocrystals, in this case BaF<sub>2</sub> and rare-earth optical dopants. The BaF<sub>2</sub> layers changed from amorphous to nanocrystalline with an FCC crystal structure as the layer thickness increased, with a weak &lt;111&gt; film texture, and cross-section analysis of the composition showed good separation between the different layers. The nanocomposite films were demonstrated to be optically active and show photoluminescence from both Eu<sup>2+</sup> and Eu<sup>3+</sup> ions. The photoluminescence (PL) of the nanocomposite films could be controlled by changing the configuration of the film structures (see Figure 4) and by thermal annealing. The PL intensity increased considerably after annealing in N<sub>2</sub> at 300 ?C for 1 hour, likely associated with greater interaction of the BaF<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles and the Eu ions (see Figures 5 and 6). These europium-doped nanolayered thin films demonstrated the potential for applications in UV-pumped white LEDs. Manganese and europium were used to synthesize co-doped nanolayered samples, and a threshold for the amount of manganese necessary to optically influence the nanolayered films was determined.<strong><em>&nbsp;</em></strong></p> <p><strong><em>Broader Impact Outcomes</em></strong></p> <p>The synthesis technique established in this project was used to make a scintillating glass ceramic for use in flat panel x-ray detectors; this technology was part of the international patent application, PCT/US21/14786.
