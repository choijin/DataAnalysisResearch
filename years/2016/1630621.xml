<AbstractNarration>A request is made to fund new and replacement instrumentation on the R/V Atlantic Explorer, a 168? general purpose research vessel owned and operated by Bermuda Institute of Ocean Science (BIOS) as part of the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System.  BIOS is a U.S. 501 (c) 3 and 509 (a) not-for profit research and educational institution incorporated in the state of New York, and geographically located on the Island of Bermuda. The mission of the ship is to support funded science research throughout the Central Atlantic but specifically work in support of the BATS program. RV Atlantic Explorer had 157 days funded in 2015, all but 38 of which (76%) were for NSF. In 20165, the vessel is scheduled to sail 160 days with 120 (75%) of them funded by NSF. With this proposal, BIOS provides technical descriptions and rationale for the acquisition of the following Shipboard Scientific Support Equipment:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Steering Control System Upgrade $47,682&lt;br/&gt;Bow Thruster Control System Upgrade $98,880&lt;br/&gt;Ballast Water Treatment System $162,588&lt;br/&gt;Marine Sanitation Device $89,901&lt;br/&gt;Doppler Speed Log $64,922&lt;br/&gt;Electronic Chart Display and Information System (ECDIS) $46,510&lt;br/&gt;      $510,483&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts &lt;br/&gt;The principal impact of the present proposal is under Merit Review Criterion 2 of the Proposal Guidelines (NSF 13-589). It provides infrastructure support for scientists to use the vessel and its shared-use instrumentation in support of their NSF-funded oceanographic research projects (which individually undergo separate review by the relevant research program of NSF).  The acquisition,  maintenance and operation of shared-use instrumentation allows NSF-funded researchers from any US university or lab access to working, calibrated instruments for their research, reducing the cost of that research, and expanding the base of potential researchers.</AbstractNarration>

It is hoped that this equipment will operate as advertised for the remaining life of the vessel.  The purchase, aquisition and installation of the new Doppler speed log on th R/V Atlantic Explorer has been undertaken to improve the capabilitis of the ship and improve the cruise experience of scientific participants and users of the ship.
