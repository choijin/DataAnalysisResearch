<AbstractNarration>The research objective of this Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) award is to develop methods for modeling Phononic Crystals (PnCs) and to characterize them experimentally.  PnCs are a type of micro/nanostructure that are capable of manipulating the manner by which elastic waves travel through a material by a periodic patterning of a material's geometry.  Computer simulations will be used to model the behavior of the PnCs.  These simulations will then guide the design, fabrication and experimental characterization of the PnCs.  Deliverables include analytical and computational tools for PnCs, theoretical and experimental results demonstrating how elastic waves move through PnCs, demonstration of how PnCs alter the thermal conductivity of a material, documentation of results, engineering student education, and engineering research experience for students from underrepresented groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Results from this research will lead to a wide range of technological advances in the areas of signal processing and thermo-electric devices.  Because the inherent geometry of PnCs give them their ability to process elastic waves (signals) these types of devices will be in a position to replace traditional digital signal processing techniques which consume relatively large amount of power in comparison to PnCs. Additionally, by manipulating phonons in materials more efficient thermoelectric devices can also be constructed that can be practically used for thermal harvesting of energy.  Graduate and undergraduate students will participate in this research as well as students from a local community college that serves only Native Americans.  Course material will also be developed as a part of this award that will address the different modes of energy transport in materials and the interplay between them.</AbstractNarration>

More specifically, PnCs are periodic arrangements of one material inside of another.  By judiciously choosing their material properties and their geometry one can alter the way with which vibrations move through the material.  We have demonstrated that one can block vibrations over large ranges of frequencies and then pass a narrow band of frequencies through the blocked range.

These are enabling technologies for advanced telecommunication applications, ultrasonic devices, non-destructive evaluation, circulators, couplers, and other elements for acoustic imaging equipment.    A custom built, Strobing Michelson Interferometer was developed for this work, see figures.  This system strobes light over a small time step of the motion of the PnC or any other dynamic system.  By moving that time step through over the full period of motion of a harmonically oscillating device, a full picture of the device?s motion can be determined.  The interferometric system is capable of discerning time steps on the order of one-millionth of a second.  Patents have been filed for this instrument.    Measurements have been made on PnCs with macro, micro and nanoscale dimensions, see figures.  Changing the dimensions of the PnCs inversely changes the frequency ranges over which waves are manipulated.  For example, the macro-PnCs tested worked over the kHz range.  The microscale PnCs operated over the MHz-GHz range and the nanoscale operated above the GHz range.  We have been successful in modeling, designing, fabricating, and characterizing PnCs from Al, AlN, SiC, and Si.  This work educated PhD and undergraduate students.  Two of the PhD students are now professors at other universities in the USA and the other students who worked on this project are continuing their graduate studies or have jobs in high-tech industry within the USA.
