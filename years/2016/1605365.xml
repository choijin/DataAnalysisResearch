<AbstractNarration>This project supports a 7 day expedition to the heart of the central tropical Pacific during a particularly strong El Niño event, arguably one of the strongest on record. The target is Jarvis Island, located in the path of the cool, nutrient-rich Equatorial Under-Current (EUC). As a consequence of its location, Jarvis, a pristine, uninhabited coral reef ecosystem, is characterized by enhanced productivity, high densities of large predatory fish, turtles, corals and other sea life. However, sea surface temperatures on Jarvis are currently 3.9 degrees Celsius higher than normal for this time of year, due to El Niño. This provides investigators with a unique opportunity to examine how a highly productive reef ecosystem responds to ocean warming, and the mechanisms and timescales for recovery. Information will be collected by deploying state-of-the-art instrumentation on the reef, and sampling seawater, particulates, plankton and corals from surface to 150 meters depth.  This will be the first expedition to Jarvis Island during a bleaching event. The US Pacific Remote Island Marine National Monument (PRIMNM) was recently expanded as part of a multi-national commitment to protect and preserve vast areas of our ocean and ocean resources for future generations. However, these protections do not shield ocean ecosystems from the impacts of 21st century climate change. The project investigates the potential for simultaneous changes in equatorial ocean circulation to lessen the impacts of the global warming for equatorial reefs. It tests hypotheses that improve understanding of fundamental mechanisms of coral reef resilience to climate change, and the ability to identify such reef systems for inclusion in Protected Area Networks.  The cruise supports the training of four PhD students, three of whom are National Science Foundation / National Defense Science and Engineering graduate research fellows, and provide material in support of six PhD theses. Results will be shared at international meetings and workshops, and published in peer-reviewed journals. All data collected and generated from the cruise will be made publicly available via the Biological and Chemical Oceanography Data Management Office.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Global climate models project enhanced warming of the central tropical Pacific over this century. By implication, waters bathing five out of the seven coral reef ecosystems protected within the recently expanded PRIMNM, will warm by more than 3 degrees Celsius. This rate of warming far exceeds the known thermal tolerances of reef-building corals, fueling concerns that these reefs may not survive 21st century climate change.  However the same models project a concurrent strengthening of the EUC, a projection supported by observations. The EUC carries cool, nutrient-rich waters that upwell on the west sides of the equatorial islands, cooling the reefs and enhancing productivity locally.  If the GCM projections are realized, a strengthening EUC could modulate the impact of ocean warming for these reefs by reducing the rate of warming and supporting energetically replete coral communities that survive bleaching. This proposal exploits the current El Niño state of the tropical Pacific to test the following hypotheses: (1) Coral communities bathed in the nutrient-rich, productive waters of the central equatorial Pacific bleach during every El Niño, but mortality is low and as a result, percent live cover remains high. (2) Localized EUC-enhanced productivity supports nutritionally replete coral communities, which metabolize existing lipid reserves to support energetic requirements during bleaching. (3) In addition, equatorial corals adopt a flexible feeding strategy, switching from direct nitrate uptake during nitrogen-rich (greater than 5 micromolar nitrate) La Niña conditions to heterotrophic feeding during nitrogen-"poor" (less than 3 micromolar nitrate) El Niño conditions. We propose that, fueled by exogenous sources, equatorial Pacific coral communities survive bleaching with limited mortality, coral cover remains high and coral growth rates quickly recover. If data generated under this project support our hypotheses, then the combination of oceanographic and political protections could maximize the potential for coral reef survival through the 21st century.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p><em>Intellectual Merit:</em> Coral reefs in the central equatorial Pacific (CEP) experience dramatic swings in sea surface temperature (SST) on inter-annual timescales, the frequency and magnitude of which far exceed that imposed on other Indo-Pacific reefs. In the last 3 decades, CEP coral communities experienced 8 El Ni&ntilde;o-driven warm events during which the Degree Heating Weeks (DHWs) thermal stress index exceeded 10. By comparison, the northern Great Barrier Reef has experienced one such event, in 2015, leading to catastrophic bleaching and mortality. &nbsp;Yet CEP reefs remain highly productive, with high percent live coral cover and fish biomass. &nbsp;This apparent contradiction raises questions about the nature of CEP coral reef response to, and mechanisms of recovery from, repeat episodes of extreme thermal stress.</p> <p>In the absence of direct observations of remote CEP reefs during peak El Ni&ntilde;o, we analyzed 3-D CT scan images of skeletal cores extracted from 40-120 year old <em>Porites</em> corals in the CEP. Each coral has witnessed multiple successive El Ni&ntilde;o events in their lifetimes. We developed an automated Matlab code to identify anomalously high-density skeletal structures or &ldquo;stress bands&rdquo; in the CT images (Figure 1). &nbsp;Our initial Palau study linked <em>Porites</em> stress bands with the severity of coral community bleaching. Interpreting the CEP data within this framework led us to hypothesize that CEP corals are not resistant to extreme heat. Rather, they appear to experience regular episodes of bleaching and mortality with varying degrees of severity.</p> <p>The 2015/16 El Ni&ntilde;o provided an opportunity to test this hypothesis. Under this award, we chartered the 80m schooner Machias, captained by Bill Austin, from Honolulu to Jarvis Island (0&deg;S, 160&deg;W) in November 2015, during the peak of the SST anomaly.&nbsp; By that time, Jarvis coral communities had been exposed to SST anomalies above 3&deg;C for 22 consecutive weeks. Our team of four scientists and graduate students conducted photo-ecosurveys at 3 depths on the east and west sides of the island, deployed pH, oxygen, current, salinity and temperature sensors and collected discrete water samples for alkalinity, dissolved inorganic carbon and nutrients, and <sup>15</sup>N nitrate (Figure 2). We were also permitted to remove small cores from bleached <em>Porites</em> colonies that we had previously tagged and sampled.</p> <p>95% of the corals on Jarvis were bleached down to 30m depth and the biogeochemical environment of the reef had completely changed. pH and aragonite saturation state (?<sub>ar</sub>) were significantly higher than normal, salinity was low and surface nitrate concentrations dropped from an average of 5 &micro;molar to below detection.&nbsp; <em>Porites</em> tissue biomass had declined by 75%, and CT scans revealed 88% of <em>Porites</em> forming skeletal stress bands.&nbsp; These observations enabled us to link prolonged bleaching with stress band formation and played a critical role in validating stress bands as proxies for community bleaching.</p> <p>In collaboration with NOAA&rsquo;s Coral Reef Ecosystem Division, we returned to Jarvis in May 2016. Wind-driven and topographic upwelling had recommenced. &nbsp;The biogeochemical environment of the reef had returned to normal, nitrate and chlorophyll concentrations, and reef fish biomass were high, sharks, dolphins and manta rays were abundant once again. &nbsp;However, 95% of the corals were dead and the reef covered in cyanobacteria and algae. We returned again with NOAA in April 2017. &nbsp;We documented remarkably rapid recovery of many <em>Porites </em>colonies (Figure 3), and live, albeit few, <em>Acropora</em>, <em>Hydnophora </em>and<em> Pocillopora</em> including some juvenile <em>Pocillopora</em>. &nbsp;Encrusting coralline algae, several millimeters thick was observed growing over the cyanobacteria and turf. &nbsp;</p> <p>The historical stress band record from Jarvis, validated by the observations made under this award, implies that Jarvis experiences regular episodes of bleaching, sometimes with catastrophic mortality.&nbsp; Stress bands indicate that the impacts of the 1982/83 and 1997/98 El Ni&ntilde;o may have been close in terms of severity to the 2015 event, resulting in loss of significant live coral cover.&nbsp; Combining our 2017 observations with the record of productivity, coral cover and fish biomass maintained on Jarvis and other CEP reefs, we propose that CEP coral communities may have evolved uncommon resilience as a mechanism for surviving the extreme and dynamic conditions in the region. Our documentation of Jarvis before, during and soon after the 2015 El Ni&ntilde;o provides an important and unprecedented opportunity to test this hypothesis, to study the factors that promote or prevent recovery, and the mechanisms by which reefs might renew themselves after catastrophic loss.</p> <p><em>Broader Impacts:</em> This project supported the research and training of four PhD students, one post-doctoral investigator, and one undergraduate senior thesis.
