<AbstractNarration>Ichiba&lt;br/&gt;DMS-1615229&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The project sheds light on mathematical aspects of information in financial markets.  Here information signifies the data that are observations of a random process, for example the price of a stock over time.  In the era of information technology more financial information is available about markets and each investor needs to process the flooding information.  Precise mathematical understanding of information provides some criteria to decide which information is more important than other information in the financial market.  Sharing this mathematical idea among investors would provide efficiency of information processing, enhance transparency of financial trading, and possibly increase the stability of the financial markets.  The project also has potential consequences in other fields of research where data arise from observations of random processes, such as economics, statistics, engineering, and physics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     In approximating random phenomena in financial markets, financial information is understood as a set of filtrations generated by continuous-time stochastic processes.  The investigator studies rank-based diffusion market models -- these are systems of stochastic partial differential equations with singularities of various sorts -- that may better represent market information.  In order to quantify and better understand the information in these processes, he examines them in two different information settings, non-Brownian filtrations and information drifts, In the first setting he considers existence of solutions, from which he can work to separate non-Browwnian noise from observable information.  In the second he examines the information drift when the filtration is enlarged, which can introduce arbitrage opportunities.  The consequences of emerging non-Brownian filtration and information drifts are examined in the context of stochastic portfolio theory.  These two problems are closely related.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[The project was concerned with noise and information in financial markets. The outcomes of the project consists of the following three parts.  Each investor does not know the other investors investment strategies but knows partially the pivotal quantities in the market. Sometimes, some investors receive the information earlier than the other investors, and hence, the information is conveyed with some delays . Under the additional yet partial information, the investor might have some advantage over other market participants. The additional information may generate the drifts of the portfolio wealth under optimized situations. One of the main outcomes in the project provided the analysis of the relative performance of such advantageous investments, particularly, in the framework of the mean-field games under the circumstances of many investors in the financial market.  The second part of the outcomes is about the classifications of noises. Here, the noises are described by the stochastic differential equations and there are two kinds of noises: Brownian noise and non-Brownian noise. Brownian noises are generated by the aggregation of homogeneous randomness as a realization of the functional central limit theorem in probability. The non-Brownian noises are not represented nor generated by the Brownian noises. The mathematical results from this project are some discoveries about the non-Brownian noise (filtration) in the context of triple or higher collision of stochastic processes. The principal investigator (PI: Tomoyuki Ichiba) and the collaborators identified that the filtration generated by some three dimensional, rank-based stochastic processes is indeed non-Brownian after triple collisions under some condition.  The third part of outcomes is about the filtering problem from observations in the stochastic processes interacting through directed-chain network or directed tree structures in the financial markets. This part is closely related to the systemic risk problem in the financial markets. The PI and the collaborators proposed a new class of systems of infinite-dimensional non-linear stochastic differential equations (and also, infinite-dimensional, non-linear difference equations for discrete-time stochastic processes and time series data), identify the solutions and then derived the infinite-dimensional filtering equations (Zakai equation and Kushner-Stratonovich equations) as well as the stochastic differential games in the directed network. The detailed study of this filtering problem is forthcoming. As an interesting byproduct of the open-loop Nash equilibrium, the Riccati equation provides a sequence of functions closely related to Catalan Numbers.  These results have been disseminated to the communities of interest through domestic and international conferences.
