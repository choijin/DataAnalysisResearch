<AbstractNarration>The 2017 Pacific Institute for the Mathematical Sciences (PIMS) and Centre de Recherches Mathematique (CRM) Summer School in Probability will be held at the University of British Columbia, Canada, from June 5-30, 2017. The school will be devoted to the training of doctoral students in the area of probability. The PI anticipates some participation of advanced undergraduate students and postdoctoral researchers. The summer school will consist of two principal courses and three short courses. The participants will learn the current techniques in cutting-edge areas of probability. The themes of the main courses will be the discrete Gaussian free field and lattice spin models. It is expected that the participants will engage in active research on some topics covered by the main courses and related areas, and many will give presentations on their current research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Summer School will be widely advertised and under-represented groups will be encouraged to apply. The information about the school is available at the following Web sites: https://www.pims.math.ca/scientific-event/170605-pcssp and http://www.math.ubc.ca/Links/ssprob17/index.php</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Summer School was held at the Pacific Insittute for Mathematical Sciences on the University of British Columbia campus, from June 5-30, 2017.  The summer school was a major educational event with more than 120 participants exposed to thecutting edge of several areas under active investigation in probability. It is also a major networkingevent, where the next generation of researchers spent four weeks living and hiking and studyingtogether, making contacts that will be valuable for their future careers.  There were 2 main courses consisting of 24 hours of lectures each, 3 mini-courses consisting of 3 hours of lectures each, and 29 30-minute lectures by participants.  The topics included statistical mechanics, Gaussian Free Field, Stochastic Partial Differential Equations, Random Trees and Graphs.  The main speakers and the topics of the main lecture series were the following.  Marek Biskup: Extrema of 2D Discrete Gaussian Free Field. The Gaussian free field (GFF) is a fundamental model for random fluctuations of a surface.  Hugo Duminil-Copin: Graphical approach to lattice spin models. Phase transitions are a central theme of statistical mechanics, and of probability more generally.  Christina Goldschmidt: Scaling limits of random graphs.In the last 30 years, random combinatorial structures and their limits have been a flourishing area of research at the interface between probability and combinatorics.  Martin Hairer: A BPHZ theorem for stochastic PDEs.  Sandra Cerrai: SPDEs on graphs: an asymptotic approach. The course introduced a new class of SPDEs defined on graphs, obtained as the limit of suitable SPDEs,defined on two-dimensional domains and depending on some parameters.
