<AbstractNarration>This doctoral dissertation research project will investigate how the temporal aspect of auditory map symbology affects the perception of general information available from a geospatial map.  The project will enhance general understanding of how timing in the delivery of spatial information influences a listener's ability to make sense of that information, and it will contribute to cartographic theory that is outside of its traditional visual emphasis.  Project results will assist in the design of audio-based cartographic displays, which will facilitate increased participation in discussion and analysis of geospatial information by a diverse population of map readers, including those who are blind or who have limited vision.  As a Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement award, this award also will provide support to enable a promising student to establish a strong independent research career.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Geographic maps serve an important role in the communication of spatial information, and scientists have developed many techniques in map design that target the human visual system.  However, an increasing awareness of the need to make maps accessible to people who are blind or who have limited vision as well as the growing size and complexity of digital data sets have prompted scientists to explore audio as an alternative to established cartographic techniques.  Previous research has identified several areas of the brain that are associated with the processing of spatial information and other areas that are related to understanding the temporal sequence of events.  In the conduct of this research project, the doctoral student will use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to record brain activity in response to sequential and concurrent presentation of spatial information through audio while participants make judgements about the geospatial information that they hear.  The fMRI data will quantify differences in the level of activity in the brain areas of interest.  These data will address two research questions:  (1) How does the temporal aspect of an auditory map display influence effectiveness in communicating general spatial patterns in the data?  (2) How does neural activity in response to a geographic map that is presented through a serial auditory display contrast against that of a concurrent auditory display?  The student will analyze the fMRI data to address these research questions, and she will make publicly available software that facilitates auditory display of geospatial information.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This research investigated how timing in an auditory map display influenced the way people interpreted the geographic data it represented.  Geographic data was translated into a collection of musical notes that formed auditory map symbols.  The temporal order of the display, or how those notes were arranged in time, influences how people interpret the contents of the display.  Existing displays have used a sequence of notes to communicate data values one-by-one.  The resulting long sequences are a challenge to remember and interpret, even with small data sets. Compressing the display symbols in time, by letting the notes overlap and play concurrently, means that an entire data set can be displayed in less time.  The total auditory map duration is more comparable to the time spent getting an overview of a graphic map.  The tradeoff, however, is the increased complexity of the sounds. In order to create usable auditory displays, there is a need to understand the impact that the temporal order of the auditory map symbols has on map legibility.  With the support of the NSF Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement Grant, I was able to explore the influence of temporal order on responses to auditory maps using neuroimaging methods.  Neuroimaging provided a unique perspective on differences between map designs by considering not only behavioral outcomes such as response time and accuracy, but also investigate possible mechanisms behind those differences.  To support this study, I designed three types of auditory map.  One mimicked existing auditory maps by presenting information through a sequence of notes.  The second compressed the notes in time, by letting them overlap and form chords and rhythmic patterns.  The third was a hybrid between the two.  The scripts to create these three types of auditory maps will be available to the public with the publication of my upcoming dissertation manuscript.  Participants in my study listened to the maps, provided valuable feedback on the design, and completed a map interpretation task while the scanner recorded images of blood flow in their brains.  After results have been published, the data from the neuroimaging sessions will be available through OpenNeuro.org.  There is a need for non-visual displays to address accessibility for people who are blind or low vision and to satisfy a growing need for new map display techniques for the ever increasing volume of geo-tagged and geo-referenced data.  This investigation of audio as a form of map display found that reducing the duration of the map display led to faster response times, but also lower accuracy.  Future work will be needed to explore how other aspects of the design can bolster effective communication without falling back on the longer, memory-demanding sequential displays.  In addition, emphasis on the temporal arrangement of auditory displays also highlights a fundamental difference in the way that designers approach map design.  In contrast to the preparation of graphic maps: a process of revising and polishing a draft graphic produced by an automated process, design decisions for audio are made and implemented prior to rendering.  There is separation between design tools and the audio result, meaning that the audio map designer needs to be able to imagine the map before they can implement it.  It also means that audio map products will be strongly influence by the available tools.  Adaptation of visual maps will not be sufficient.  The idiosyncrasies of audio will need to be considered from the early stages of map design.       Last Modified: 07/06/2018       Submitted by: Megen E Brittell]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
