<AbstractNarration>This award provides funding for the summer school "Orthogonal Polynomials and Special Functions to be held at the Norbert Weiner Center for Harmonic Analysis on the the University of Maryland-College Park campus, from July 11 to  July 15, 2016.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference focuses on recent developments in Analysis, especially on the topics of  exceptional orthogonal polynomials, elliptic hypergeometric functions, q-series  and the like.  A number of distinguished mathematicians have agreed to attend and speak at this conference. The award gives early career researchers, researchers who are members of underrepresented groups, researchers not funded by NSF a chance to attend and participate in this conference.  The organizing committee will strive to make this funding opportunity known to target groups through a number of different activities.  More information will be made available at:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;http://www.norbertwiener.umd.edu/Education/OPSFS6/</AbstractNarration>
