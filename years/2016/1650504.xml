<AbstractNarration>CBSS operates at the intersection of life sciences and photonics engineering and focuses on precompetitive research that provides the enabling technologies for advanced methods to detect, sense and identify biological properties, conditions or changes at the molecular, cellular and subcellular level.  These innovations will address solutions in the areas of Disease Diagnosis, Drug Efficacy Testing &amp; Monitoring, Drug Discovery, and Food &amp; Water Safety through long-term partnerships with industry members. During Phase II, research efforts will continue at Boston University (lead institution) and UC Davis (university site) to develop collaborations with faculty across our campuses whose research is relevant to the Center?s mission.  BU?s Creating the Societal Engineer, a concept of a social consciousness and appreciation for how products advance our quality of life while creating jobs and economic opportunity, resonates well with a primary mission of the Center to educate a diverse pipeline of trained scientist and engineers.  Students have an opportunity to directly participate in the technology transfer process and with industry learn to identify applications and define areas of greatest needs, evaluate new technologies and research tools, and pursue research that can be applied to solving real-world challenges and improving healthcare outcomes. As CBSS grows, the Center intends to capitalize on a trend by companies in the life sciences sector to accelerate innovation through collaborative research and university-led innovations, specifically in the area of biophotonic sensing. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Center's value to the membership is based on the ability to deliver pre-competitive research that can be adapted to align with a member?s product portfolio plans. This high priority research and product directed research typically remains the focus of each individual company, but collectively, the membership values the Center for:&lt;br/&gt;- Adding to the breadth and diversity of a member's research portfolio.&lt;br/&gt;- Working on pre-competitive technologies that could add some benefits in the future.&lt;br/&gt;- Working on alternative approaches that have merit but which a member company has neither, the time or resources to pursue.  This also helps a member better position their existing product/technology approaches.&lt;br/&gt;- Providing exposure to emerging areas of research that may be outside the company?s domain, thus adding to a member?s innovation capability.&lt;br/&gt;The research projects, guided by industry strategic oversight, will lead to breakthroughs in understanding cell/host interactions, new biomarker discovery, point-of-care and interoperation diagnostics, personalized cancer treatment, and many other technologies that will improve the quality of healthcare. The Center?s research is aligned with three overlapping thrust areas: Bio-Imaging, Optical Diagnostics and Analytics, and each of these thrust areas has a component in Systems, Sensors &amp; Devices, and Materials &amp; Biology. The goal of the Analytics research is to embed data retrieval and computing processing power in imaging and diagnostic tools to develop an understanding of biological, genetic, behavioral and environmental data gathered so that healthcare decisions can be made down to the individual level.  At BU recent developments in high-resolution tip-tilt-position deformable mirrors (TPP-DM) combined with computation and machine learning algorithms demonstrate the combinations of bio-imaging and analytics for applications such as imaging of blood and tissue samples or cell sorting.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Center for Biophotonic Sensors and Systems (CBSS) focused on precompetitive research and provided enabling technologies for advanced methods to detect or sense and identify biological properties, conditions, or changes at the molecular, cellular and subcellular levels. Targeted applications were development of diagnostic tools, tools to be used in the drug discovery process and tools for food and water safety.  The Center is led by Boston University (BU) and has a second university site at the University of California, Davis (UCD) campus.  The Center Director and Site Director, along with the Industry Advisory Board set the direction for the Center and selected the projects to be funded.  A diversified faculty with broad engineering and science expertise supported the Center.  CBSS has involved the Medical, Engineering and Science schools of both BU and UC Davis.  Faculty have encouraged graduate students and post-docs to spin-out promising technologies and these efforts are supported by the Business Innovation Center (BIC) at BU.  One such spinout is NanoView Biosciences whose core technology was developed under a CBSS funded project.  The I/UCRC provided opportunities for creating the administrative infrastructure and developing skills in managing multi-university sites and an Industry Advisory Board, which positioned the University well for other large center awards.  Intellectual Merit:  The research in CBSS led to tools that have significant impact in studying biological properties leading to a better understanding of the mechanisms of cell behavior and cell to cell interaction, which enhances a scientist ability to develop therapeutic options for various diseases.  Each year, the Center conducted a program formulation process, where faculty submitted proposals in response to a solicitation that outlined the members technology needs.  During Phase I, the faculty generated a total of 145 proposals with 28 projects funded.  In the only year of Phase II, 38 project proposals were generated and the IAB selected six projects to be funded with research highlights that included:  Potential use of Raman spectroscopy in clinical retinal imaging systems and 1st ever multimodal imaging system allowing Raman and OCT imaging of tissue ex vivo. Enhancements that build-in versatility for microscopes used for diagnostic imaging of either static or dynamic samples. Enhancements for faster Raman imaging speeds Improved adaptive optics retinal imaging systems. High-throughput screening for AB protein, a biomarker for Alzheimers Disease.  This is a useful tool in drug discovery process. Tool for label-free quantitative assessment of microarray performance so precise it could be used as a standard for quality assurance.   All of the IAB funded projects had some degree of commercial potential and have the common theme of being true to the technology roadmap that was prepared for the Phase II program.  Two of the projects dealt with refinements to the IRIS instrumentation which uses an interferomic optical metho for real-time protein binding monitoring. Three other projects used a combination of adaptive optics and computational methods to improve biological imaging speed and quality.  Each project had an industry mentor and was reviewed twice during the year with written reports to keep industry appraised of progress.  The goal of the I/UCRC is to have at least one platform per year be adopted by an industry member and further developed for commercialization.   The members had the opportunity to take a non-exclusive, royalty-free license to inventions related to work on IAB funded projects.  There was one provisional patent filed during Phase II, entitled "Apparatus and Methods for Speckle Reduction and Structure Extraction in Optical Coherence Tomography"  (Robert Zawadzki &ndash; inventor).  As the Center was ceasing operations, the IAB members were offered an extended window to declare intentions to exercise their licensing rights.  There were thirteen publications related to Phase II member funded projects, some of these papers were co-authored with Industry members.  Broadening Participation:  The Center has run several activities to promote student career development to include networking sessions between students and IAB members, including mock-interview sessions where students were cycled through interviews with IAB members, and poster sessions at IAB meetings.  In total, there were 25 graduate level students or post-doctoral students trained in such diverse fields as engineering, chemistry, physics and microbiology on projects requiring a diverse and integrative skill set.  Students also had an opportunity to engage with industry and work under the demands of set budgets, milestones and timelines.  There were 8 Ph.D. graduates and anticipated graduation dates for the other students range from Spring 2019 to Spring 2021.  There REU supported on an IAB funded project.  This URM student was specifically recruited by the project PI because of her prior experience and laboratory performance.  Additionally, one of the IAB members supported a RET teacher in their lab for the Summer.                 Last Modified: 04/23/2019       Submitted by: Thomas G Bifano]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
