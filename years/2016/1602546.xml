<AbstractNarration>The Maryland-Penn State Semi-annual Workshop on Dynamics and Related Topics will meet in the Spring in 2016, 2017 and 2018 at the University of Maryland, College Park.  Each spring, the conference will take place over three to four days; the 2016 meeting will be April 15-17. The goals of this conference are to promote the communication of mathematical results; to facilitate interaction and progress in dynamical systems and related fields; to nurture the sense of community and common mission in these fields; and to contribute to the training of graduate students and recent Ph.D. recipients and to their integration into the dynamics community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This conference represents the Maryland half of this workshop, cosponsored for the last 24 years by the dynamics groups at Maryland and Penn State; the Penn State conference is in the fall.  The conference has regular participation from many dynamics experts in the Eastern United States, and has drawn many prominent mathematicians from around the world who are working on dynamical systems. There are speakers at all stages, from graduate student to senior professor; among many prominent mathematicians, six Wolf Prize winners and six Field medalists have spoken at the Maryland meeting. In some years, there is a topical focus (geometry, ergodic theory, low dimensional dynamics, celestial mechanics, etc.); in all years, there is some reflection of the enormous breadth of dynamics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference URL is http://www-math.umd.edu/dynamics-conference</AbstractNarration>

Dynamical systems is the field which studies systems changing with time and it has been used in a wide range of scientific disciplines, such as physics, biology and economics to list just a few examples. Dynamical systems also plays a central role in the development of mathematics as can be seen from the fact that a significant portion of top international prizes in mathematics in recent years was give for the work in dynamical systems. The conference plays a significant role in maintainig the United States leading position in the area by providing a forum presenting the recent developments in the field and for giving a venue for the interaction for the leaders in the field and early career researchers. The present grant was used to support four meetings in 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2019. The topics covered a wide range of topics in the field as well as the interaction with other areas of mathematics, including geometry, probability, and number theory and ith other scientific disciplines. The average number of particiapnts was about 80 people per conference and about 40% was supported by conference grant. The priority for funding was given to graduate studunts and postdoctoral fellows as well as for women and other members of the underrepresented groups, who also constituted a significant portion of the speakers.
