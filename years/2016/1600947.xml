<AbstractNarration>Mineral dust constitutes a critical nexus between the geosphere, atmosphere, biosphere, and hydrosphere. One of the most abundant atmospheric aerosols by mass, mineral dust can influence numerous ecosystem processes through its effects on climate and biogeochemistry. Dust supplies essential limiting nutrients as well as toxic pollutants to ecosystems, with long-term implications for elemental cycling. This project will address the considerable uncertainties regarding dust influence on terrestrial ecosystem processes, including wet dust deposition, carbon uptake, and evapotranspiration. It will maximize financial and societal return from publicly available data, provide training for the next generation scientific workforce, and broaden the participation of underrepresented groups in science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This highly interdisciplinary project will develop the foundation for testing an integrative framework for conceptualizing dust events, dust sinks, and ecosystem interactions during a period of historic drought. It will: (1) characterize dust events during a period of widespread severe to exceptional drought; 2) analyze the chemical composition and quantify the magnitude of wet dust deposition; (3) quantify the influence of dust events on ecosystem light use efficiency, water use efficiency, and carbon sequestration. The project integrates research and education with students at all levels, including a concerted effort to recruit underrepresented students. The team will produce a lecture and laboratory module on drought and dust in arid and semi-arid regions. The project will contribute to the career development of one early career and one postdoctoral scholar (both female and Hispanic).</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Dr. Thomas Gill at the University of Texas- El Paso completed work for his grant, "EAGER Collaborative Research: Exploring dust impacts on terrestrial ecosystem processes using an innovative and integrated approach," supported by the National Science Foundation (NSF)?s Geomorphology and Land Use Dynamics program.  This project was carried out in tandem with funding from the same NSF program awarded to a researcher at the University of North Texas, and the research was performed by a team of scientists from those and other institutions.  The project looked at the environmental impact of dust storms across Texas (at the Guadalupe Mountains in far west Texas, and in the Gulf Coastal Plain west of Houston), with a focus on dust falling/washing out in rain (wet deposition).  Most previous studies of dust storms in Texas had focused on dry falling dust, ignoring dust mixed into rain.  The team looked at samples collected weekly over the course of the year 2012, a year of extreme drought (and dust) in Texas.  Samples of dusty rain were obtained for the National Acid Deposition Program (NADP) from the two sites.  The researchers developed methods to separate the dust from the rainwater without contamination, and to analyze the dust and the rainwater (which included any dissolved components of dust) by several chemical and physical techniques to reveal and obtain the concentrations of many different chemical elements (titanium, iron, etc.) and ions (chloride, phosphate, etc.) in the samples.  End-Member Mixing Analysis (EMMA), a statistical procedure, was used on the chemical data to understand how the different components of the dust grouped together, which could help track the sources of the dust and show the path the dust travelled to and across Texas before falling out.  The team?s analyses showed that the concentrations of many ions and elements detected in the samples (including sodium, calcium, iron, and titanium) were higher during weeks with dust than during non-dusty weeks, while others (including ammonium, zinc, and lead) were higher during the non-dusty periods.  In 2012, dust-in-rain events delivered ~19% of the rainwater  yet 46-70% of annual wet deposition of calcium, magnesium, potassium, sodium, phosphate and chloride.  Comparatively less sulfate, nitrate, ammonium, and bromide deposition happened during dust-in-rain events.  Calcium was the dominant ion dissolved in rainwater, while iron was the dominant element the team measured in solid particles of dust carried with rain.  Statistical analyses are underway to relate the components of dust suspended and dissolved in Texas rain to its sources from the Texas Panhandle and Plains to the Chihuahuan Desert near El Paso, and even to the Sahara Desert, whose dust can be carried all the way across the Atlantic to Texas by tropical winds.  The results of the project show that scientists and land managers cannot ignore the input of dust falling out in rain to the land and the environment.  Dusty rain contains some substances that act as nutrients to plants and ecosystems, as well as others that could be harmful.  The team has also learned and demonstrated the success of a new scientific technique for preparation and chemical analysis of dust particles filtered out of rainwater.  The research team has presented the results of this project to the scientific community at meetings of including the American Association of Geographers and the American Geophysical Union, and is preparing at least three papers for publication in international scientific journals.  Beyond the impacts relevant to the research community and environmental managers, this project has helped train many young scientists, from biology to earth science to physics, from diverse groups including a Latina and a disabled veteran.
