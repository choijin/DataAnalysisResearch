<AbstractNarration>Biomass represents a promising alternative to non-renewable, carbon-emitting petroleum resources and is the only known renewable resource that can replace liquid fuels and chemicals in a carbon-neutral manner.  Both the United States and China have made replacing petroleum with biomass feedstocks a part of their energy strategy, which has been reflected in increased research in developing biomass conversion technologies in both countries.  This research project is focused on the production of high-value chemicals from biomass, fulfilling the goals of i) developing sustainable processes for chemical production and ii) improving the overall economics of biomass conversion technologies.  Research will be carried out under the supervision of Dr. Tao Zhang: a leader in the field of catalytic conversion of biomass in China and the Director of the Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics (DICP). &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Utilizing the state-of-the-art equipment and vast technical experience of Dr. Zhang and other DICP researchers, this project will focus on the development of novel catalysts and catalytic pathways for the production of high-value chemicals such as alpha-omega diols from biomass.  More specifically, this research is centered on the application of catalysis and reaction engineering to reduce catalyst cost and improve catalyst stability for liquid-phase biomass conversion reactions, such as the ring-opening of cyclic ethers to alpha-omega diols. While much research has been performed on these reactions, there has been limited success in replacing costly noble metal catalysts with the inexpensive base metal catalysts necessary for commercialization of these processes.  By applying novel catalyst characterization techniques, developing fundamental reaction kinetic parameters, and studying thermodynamic relationships between reaction intermediates, progress will be made in utilizing base metal catalysts and in improving upgrading pathways to alpha-omega diols. This will facilitate the promotion of biomass conversion technologies and thus in helping pave a path to a sustainable future.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award under the East Asia and Pacific Summer Institutes program supports summer research by a U.S. graduate student and is jointly funded by NSF and the Ministry of Science and Technology of China.</AbstractNarration>

The other main benefit of SACs is the presence of only one type of catalytic active site versus the several types of sites present on nanoparticles (we know where the reaction is occurring on SACs).   The discovery of SACs and the large amount research dedicated to studying them is a recent phenomenon, with the group I worked with at the Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics (DICP) in China playing a large role in their development.  While at DICP, I attempted to repdroduce the synthesis of SACs that had previously been made at DICP.  While not able to completely reproduce all their catalysts exactly, my overall goal of learning how to synthesize the SACs and how to potentially make even more at back in the United States was certainly met. This knowledge was used to further develop SACs and similar catalyst-types back in the United States, where research is still ongoing.   Perhaps the biggest outcome of my stay in DICP through NSF EAPSI, however, was the development of the collaboration between my home research group at the University of Wisconsin and Chinese host research group at DICP.
