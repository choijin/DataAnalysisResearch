<AbstractNarration>The project addresses a new set of problems that will increasingly&lt;br/&gt;arise with a gradual shift to massively open online courses and&lt;br/&gt;large classes where new assessments to test active learning of the&lt;br/&gt;concepts are costly to design. The context of the project is a&lt;br/&gt;prototype cloud-based quiz management system that leads the online&lt;br/&gt;learners through scaffolded activities, such as creating,&lt;br/&gt;answering, and improving of student-sourced quiz items. The system&lt;br/&gt;then automatically evaluates the competence of learners and the&lt;br/&gt;quality of questions from outcomes of these activities. This&lt;br/&gt;project addresses the key algorithmic issue in such systems of&lt;br/&gt;efficiently determining the quality of the students and the&lt;br/&gt;submitted items. Preliminary ideas for new algorithms will be&lt;br/&gt;developed and deployed in the test system to understand their&lt;br/&gt;advantages and shortcomings. The development and testing of&lt;br/&gt;algorithms will provide opportunities for training two graduate&lt;br/&gt;students. This will also lead to a refinement of the eventual&lt;br/&gt;algorithmic design of a system for scalable online assessments with&lt;br/&gt;significant societal impacts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In particular, the project develops new algorithmic frameworks for&lt;br/&gt;problems in the joint ranking of students and student-sourced quiz&lt;br/&gt;questions based on feedback in the form of peer performance and&lt;br/&gt;review. A key contribution is the formulation of these problems in&lt;br/&gt;terms of abstract problems amenable to both combinatorial and&lt;br/&gt;continuous optimization, which in turn allows a completely&lt;br/&gt;unrelated subfield of people (those of optimization) to work on&lt;br/&gt;these problems in the future. At the same time, the project will&lt;br/&gt;undertake the groundwork of developing the first such algorithms&lt;br/&gt;that solve these problems with current approaches.</AbstractNarration>
