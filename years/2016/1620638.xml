<AbstractNarration>This award funds the research activities of Professors Kevork Abazajian, Mu-Chun Chen, Jonathan Feng, Manoj Kaplinghat, Arvind Rajaraman, Yuri Shirman, and Timothy Tait at the University of California, Irvine. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is an exciting time in particle physics and cosmology.  Data from a variety of particle-physics experiments are deepening our understanding of the fundamental interactions and probing the physics of higher and higher energies with unprecedented detail.  At the same time, outstanding questions in astrophysics and cosmology also guide theoretical work, and the interaction between cosmology and particle physics has been very fruitful.  This grant will support research across a wide spectrum of frontiers, with an eye towards exploiting innovative ideas in particle physics, cosmology, and at their interface to address outstanding problems in a wide variety of fields.   Particular directions to be studied include searches for new elementary particles at underground colliders, studies of the properties of neutrinos, and work that aims to shed light on the mysterious dark matter that makes up most of the matter in the universe.   This research will also study new ideas at the interface between particle physics and cosmology.    The research supported by this award thus advances the national interest by promoting the progress of science in its most fundamental directions:  deepening our understanding of the physical Universe at both the smallest and largest length scales, and furthering our knowledge of the basic building blocks and forces that make up and shape our Universe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of the group's activities are directed toward increasing public interest in and improving public understanding of the exciting results of physics and astronomy. The group's activities include developing and teaching a COSMOS summer course on particle physics and cosmology to high-achieving high school students from diverse socio-economic backgrounds, programs to strengthen the representation of underrepresented minorities in physics and other STEM fields, a wide array of public talks and outreach activities through print and web-based media, the training of postdoctoral researchers and graduate students both at UC Irvine and around the world, and significant contributions in the area of professional service.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This grant supported research, teaching, and public outreach in the fields of particle physics and cosmology at the University of California, Irvine.  The work was led by Professors Jonathan Feng, Kev Abazajian, Mu-Chun Chen, Manoj Kaplinghat, Arvind Rajaraman, Yuri Shirman, and Tim Tait, who collaborated with and mentored 8 postdoctoral scholars and 11 Ph.D. students, as well as a host of domestic and international collaborators and visitors.  Intellectual Merit: The work resulted in over 80 peer-reviewed publications that deepened our understanding of the fundamental particles and forces that govern our Universe.  The researchers proposed new ideas for the dark matter that makes up 85% of the matter in the Universe and showed that a class of self-interacting dark matter models can explain structure formation in the Universe on large and small scales.  In addition, they explored new ways to search for new particles, and have led a new search experiment, FASER, now under construction at the Large Hadron Collider in Geneva.  The work built new interdisciplinary ties between particle physics, nuclear physics, and astrophysics, and also was closely connected to leading experiments worldwide, including not only the LHC, but also dark matter searches underground and in space, and a host of other world-leading observatories and experiments.  Broader Impacts: The group increased public interest in and improved public understanding of exciting results of physics and astronomy. The principal investigators were interviewed for a host of news articles in print, television, and web-based media. In addition, the researchers developed and taught a COSMOS summer course on particle physics and cosmology to high-achieving high school students from diverse socio-economic backgrounds.  They also organized UC Irvine Women in Physics and Astronomy to strengthen the representation of underrepresented minorities in physics and other STEM fields and organized a wide array of lectures and other events for the general public.
