<AbstractNarration>In this project, funded by the Chemical Structure, Dynamics, &amp; Mechanisms B Program of the National Science Foundation, Professor Jack R. Norton at Columbia University leads a team exploring fundamental issues in organotitanium chemistry.  Titanium, inexpensive and nontoxic, offers sustainable ways of carrying out a variety of chemical transformations.  This project aims to use inexpensive titanium-based reagents for the synthesis of valuable organic compounds - not only heterocycles but also the enantioenriched compounds essential to the pharmaceutical industry.  This project involves a mixture of inorganic, organometallic, and organic chemistry, and is therefore ideal for training young workers for careers in science.  Students in the research group are encouraged to interact with both academic and industrial scientists, better preparing themselves for permanent positions on either side of the academic/industrial divide. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More specifically, the project addresses three fundamental questions in organotitanium chemistry: (1) The insertion of isonitriles into titanium-carbon (Ti-C) bonds.  The insertion of carbon monoxide (CO) into Ti-C bonds has served as a powerful synthetic tool.  In principle CO can be replaced by any of the isoelectronic isonitriles (RNC), giving transformations that could be as useful as CO insertion;  (2) Dynamic kinetic asymmetric transformations.  Chiral titanaaziridines and titanaoxiranes undergo rapid enantiomer interconversion, a property which makes them potentially useful for dynamic kinetic asymmetric transformations.  In principle, this approach can generate enantioenriched chemicals from inexpensive racemic starting materials; and (3) Replacement of cyclopentadienyl ligand based Ti reagents with less expensive and more abundant alkoxy ligand based Ti reagents.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[            The development of selective catalysts for the synthesis of anti-Markovnikov alcohols from asymmetrically substituted olefins has been a long-standing challenge with few solutions.  (An apparent solution to this problem appeared in the 1980's, but proved irreproducible.)  The hydrogenation of epoxides is a highly attractive, yet largely unexplored, alternative way of preparing these alcohols.  Existing epoxide hydrogenation catalysts have generally left the oxygen attached to the more heavily substituted carbon (the Markovnikov product). We have now shown that the cooperative interaction of two different metal catalysts can invert this selectivity pattern.  A titanium catalyst pries open the epoxide ring, while a chromium catalyst activates hydrogen and delivers it to the transformed epoxide on titanium.  The chromium complex appears to deliver a hydrogen atom, a proton, and an electron at different stages of the cycle.               Both elements (chromium and titanium) are abundant and our catalyst is therefore "sustainable".  (Chromium is nontoxic in the oxidation states we employ.) In addition, this combination enables the use of hydrogen as the only reductant, which is clean, green, and atom-economical.               We have also studied the insertion of isonitriles in to Group 4 M?C bonds.  Our chemistry enables the 4 + 1 cycloaddition of a diene to an isonitrile, forming a five-membered ring (an iminocyclopentene).                The cleavage of Group 4 M?C bonds is essential in generating the alkyl metal cations that serve as olefin polymerization catalysts. Many electrophiles have been used in such cleavage reactions, but the simplest and most generally useful is H+.  We now have determined the rates of the H+ cleavage of M?C bonds and the factors that enhance such rates.               This project involves a mixture of inorganic, organometallic, and organic chemistry, and is therefore ideal for training young workers for careers in science. Our students have learned how inorganic chemistry can benefit from theoretical chemistry, and how inorganic chemistry can contribute to organic synthesis.
