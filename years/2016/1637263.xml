<AbstractNarration>This research project will apply interdisciplinary expertise to multiteam behavioral and learning research through the re-engineering of an innovative sociotechnical system to potentially transform research on multiteam systems in smart, connected communities. Multiteam systems are found in healthcare, military, disaster response, emergency response contexts,and many others, and can include the transfer of people, equipment, information, and coordination of cross-team interaction. One such example is the emergency response team transporting and handing over a patient to a hospital emergency department trauma team, however, multiteam behavioral tracking systems and the process of designing and developing them for smart, connected communities are applicable to other team-based contexts. Learning and coordination across multiple teams to prepare for an emergency or crisis response is crucial to prevent mistakes and to protect citizen health and safety. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research builds upon a proof of concept, mobile-based behavioral sensing system tested in real world conditions to connect learning, behavior and performance among multiple teams in a high fidelity simulation through establishing and modeling meaningful protocols toward improved sensor-based measurement, real-time data analysis and actionable insights for smart connected communities and the well-being of their citizens. This research will provide an unprecedented level of insight into multiteam behavior, transition points, and learning by participants. Processes to model and measure meaningful team-based interaction and activity will be addressed to identify metrics that matter in gauging multi-team performance. The researchers will study and leverage mobile behavioral sensing techniques and utilize sociotechnical analysis connected to real-time visualization techniques to aid multi-team learning. This research will link interdisciplinary perspectives in the learning sciences, behavioral sciences, engineering, data analytics and human factors to iteratively refine and test a system with potential to transform feedback and actionable insight for multiteam training contexts.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project directly addressed the need for learning and coordination within and across multiple teams in preparing for an emergency or crisis response. The mobile-behavioral sensing and integrative data stream system trialed in this work tested in real world conditions produced knowledge related to how to connect learning, behavior and performance within and among multiple teams with realtime data analysis and actionable insights for the participants.  Applying interdisciplinary expertise to multiteam behavioral and learning research, the project investigators accomplished the goals of the grant award through reengineering an innovative sociotechnical system to inform research on multiteam systems in smart connected communities.  The research was conducted across several public safety contexts including fire and rescue and law enforcement live simulation training exercises involving teams and multiteam systems. This project integrated multimodal data streams leveraging mobile-based behavioral sensing tested under real world conditions in high fidelity simulation exercises with first responder teams.   The results demonstrated new protocols for integrative sensor-based management including the importance of the triangulation of data sources and value of real-time data analysis for reflection and learning in the simulation debrief stated by the first responder participants.  Coordination within and across teams was exemplified by near real-time processing and visualization on-site of the sensor-based data providing some evidence for how teams worked together in component teams and across teams.  The intellectual merit of this work demonstrated informed insight into multiteam behavior, transition points between and among teams and important reflection on action to uncover patterns of behavior in high fidelity, real world conditions.  Leveraging mobile behavioral sensing techniques combined with rich video and audio data streams to provide real time visualization to inform learning and behavior was perceived to be valuable for improvement of performance for the participants.   This interdisciplinary research generated new knowledge and informed the literature in the learning sciences, information science and organizational psychology related to new forms of feedback and actionable insights for multiteam training contexts.  Meaningful metrics were identified through direct input by the first responders that grew out of their lived experience in the simulations and prior work to contribute to the measurement of team-based and cross-team interactions and activity.  The research findings and integrated system as well as the user experience design and development process was found to be applicable to several multiteam settings in medical, fire and rescue and law enforcement live simulation scenarios contributing to the burgeoning area of smart connected community research. This complex, multiteam, real-world research project adds to knowledge about important points of transitions and behavior within and between first responder teams in demanding, real-world conditions situations through the use and integration of sensor-based and other multimodal data streams to address the well-being of citizens in smart and connected communities.
