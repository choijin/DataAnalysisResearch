<AbstractNarration>Modifications to integrated circuits (ICs) or the insertion of foreign intellectual property pose a serious threat to U.S. sovereignty, as ICs are found in many consumer electronic devices, including phones, computers, and televisions. More importantly, many commercial and military U.S. assets rely on ICs for computation and management of critical infrastructure such as banking, energy, and defense systems. The primary impact of the proposed work is to improve the security of U.S. electronic assets by assuring that the integrated circuits placed in these critical systems do not include functions or modified functions that compromise the integrity of the ICs running these complex systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will implement a run-time detection methodology based on the noise on the power distribution network to effectively detect, locate, and recover from malicious circuit modifications. A novel application of game theory will be utilized to optimally place voltage sensors on the power distribution network to enhance the detection of hardware Trojans, and therefore, increase the cost on the adversary to develop and implement an attack. In addition, the project aims to develop two techniques to recover from the activation of a hardware Trojan: 1) logic encryption key manipulation, and 2) a segmented power distribution network for locally powering off sections of an IC. Algorithms to automate the insertion of circuits that detect hardware modifications will also be developed, leading to long term and widespread use of the proposed methodologies by the semiconductor industry. Overall, the project strongly complements ongoing research examining hardware Trojan detection and countermeasures. The outcome of the proposed research will result in novel circuit techniques and methodologies to detect and neutralize circuit anomalies due to adversarial modifications, as well as design IP that improves the robustness of an IC against circuit attacks. The educational goal of the project is the development of secure IC design practices for the detection, identification, and localization of hardware modifications. A course related to the proposed research and its applications will be developed and offered to graduate and advanced undergraduate students.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ During the first year of this research project, two primary research tasks and one educational task were completed.  The two research tasks included defensive countermeasures that limit the insertion of hardware Trojans and a framework to evaluate real-time hardware Trojan detection.  More specifically, circuit obfuscation techniques were developed to protect against the insertion of hardware Trojans.  Techniques for both analog and digital circuits were separately developed.  In addition, a simulation environment, beginning from RTL to physical design and parasitic extraction, was developed that permitted placement of hardware Trojans within an integrated circuit and allowed for the analysis of real-time measures to detect and neutralize such threats. The educational objective completed during Year 1 was the development and offering of a hardware security course to senior level undergraduate and graduate students.   During the second year of this research grant, two primary research tasks were completed.  In addition, the course on hardware security developed during Year 1 was expanded to include two new laboratory exercises on side-channel analysis.  The first research objective was the development of sequential logic locking techniques for digital circuit blocks, a continuation of defensive countermeasures from Year 1 that limit the insertion of hardware Trojans.  The second research objective was the development of a SMART grid on-chip, a distributed on-chip power delivery network designed to provide recovery from a hardware attack.  The SMART grid is designed with distributed voltage regulators that provide the average power/current demand of an executing workload on a core, as we have shown that power demand exceeding the average power occurs approximately less than 22% of the time. The distributed on-chip regulators permit a modular ‘shut-off’ of circuit blocks that are determined to contain Trojans that can not be resolved.  During the third year of this research grant, one primary research task was completed.  Specifically, machine learning algorithms were applied on the thermal side-channel to estimate the per-core power consumption of a modern system-on-chip (SoC) that includes accelerators.  Correlation of the thermal and power profiles of the SoC is performed to determine, at runtime, 1) the activity factor of each accelerator, and 2) whether the SoC is infected by malware.  The resulting power estimates are provided as input to a combination of machine learning and statistical models that predict the core activity factors of the accelerators within no more than 5% mean average error and detect malware even when the range of core activity factors that are observed due to workload variation is comparable to the activity factor offset induced by the malware.
