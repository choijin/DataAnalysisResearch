<AbstractNarration>As a part of its overall strategy to enhance learning in informal environments, the Advancing Informal STEM Learning (AISL) program funds research and innovative resources for use in a variety of settings. This media and technology project will scale up Youth Radio's proven model of STEM education through youth-driven multimedia journalism and related app development using the MIT App Inventor.   A new Youth News Network (YNN) will implement a nationwide feeder system of youth reporters and educators using the previously developed and proven STEM curriculum.  Previous research and evaluation has demonstrated that this model can engage underserved youth and put them in leadership positions in technological innovation.  Key deliverables include the YNN STEM Desk that will produce 15-20 STEM-related stories each year; bootcamps (1-3 day workshops) training youth around the country focusing on app development and media links; and new toolkits providing resources to help with app development, data analysis and other STEM-specific skills.  Project partners include MIT Media Lab, National Public Radio, Best Buy's Teen Tech Centers, National Writing Project, Computer Clubhouses, and PBS Learning Media among others.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Over the previous eight years, research and evaluation findings had been used to refine the project.  These data served as the foundation for this scale-up project. The research conducted by the investigator and the Scholar-in-Residence in this scale-up uses an embedded ethnographic approach that combines field notes, recorded meetings and discussions, media artifacts, etc.--data that is transcribed and coded for indicators of STEM learning and critical computational literacy.  The external summative evaluation will build on prior evidence regarding how this unique model engages youth and impacts their skills in STEM related media and technology.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[           Through a one-of-a-kind partnership between YR Media (formerly Youth Radio) and MIT App Inventor, the WAVES initiative broadened participation in STEM by unlocking robust learning pathways for thousands of young people and partnering with them to reframe national conversations on key social issues related to science and technology in our lives.
