<AbstractNarration>This award funds work that will help us understand how federal regulations affect oil and natural gas markets in the United States. The project will proceed in several stages. First, the research team will catalog and characterize federal regulations that affect the development of petroleum and natural gas resources. Second, they will develop methods to estimate the effects of these regulations on industry, including the possible impact of changing existing regulation. Third, they will estimate the effects of these regulations on the public, including consumers of oil and natural gas. The final part of the project will examine the overall welfare economics of lifting and/or lessening federal regulation in this sector of the economy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is directly relevant to issues facing the US Department of Energy, and the results will help policymakers make judgements about the appropriate types and levels of regulation in this economic sector.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This grant led to the tabulation of all regulations in the last decade that affected directly or indirectly the upstream portion of the oil and gas sector and then the conduct of six case studies from those regulations to analyze the costs and benefits of modifications and repeal of these rules.

The most important parameter was the social cost of carbon.  Further, we examined the Trump administration's RIA's in support of repealing and modifying some of the six rules we choose for case studies.  We found that, in contrast to the original RIA's from the Obama administration, the new RIAs were generally less transparent.  We also found that modifications of some of the rules proposed by the administration were responsive to industry complaints, but that not all major complaints led to rule modifications.
