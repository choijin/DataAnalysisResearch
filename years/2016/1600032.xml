<AbstractNarration>Tensor triangular geometry, the theme of this research project, bridges a large class of specialized areas of mathematics, including stable homotopy theory, algebraic geometry, modular representation theory, motivic theory, and noncommutative topology.  Tensor triangular geometry promises to serve as an overarching theory that facilitates the transposition of techniques and methods from one specialized area to neighboring ones, providing conceptual unification among those fields. Moreover, it displays steadily expanding influence in mathematics. For instance, via tensor triangular geometry, the subject of étale topology in modern algebraic geometry now bears new applications in modular representation theory, where it provides answers to longstanding problems about the relations between representations of finite groups of order a power of a prime number and representations of arbitrary general finite groups.  This research project aims to broaden and deepen understanding in the field of tensor triangular geometry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project studies the geometry of tensor-triangulated categories as they appear in several areas of mathematics. Tensor-triangulated categories are now in common use in algebraic geometry, in modular representation theory, stable homotopy theory, and its equivariant versions, in motivic theory, in equivariant noncommutative topology, and beyond. This project aims to develop new methods in tensor triangular geometry, in order to study those many different incarnations from a unified perspective. In recent years, much progress has been made in étale extensions (i.e., separable and commutative extensions) of tensor-triangulated categories and on the related theory of descent. The present project builds on these and related results and aims to apply descent to connect the algebraic geometry of projective support varieties with the modular representation theory of finite groups. Some applications of these techniques can be spelled out in concrete terms without tensor-triangular technicalities. For instance, in work on endotrivial modules the investigator introduced "weak homomorphisms." It appears that the very same weak homomorphisms are connected to complex line bundles on the Brown simplicial complex of p-subgroups. Further investigation of their role in algebraic geometry is part of the current project. Another general theme of the project is the computation of the "spectrum" of a tensor-triangulated category. A new general approach for such computations comes through filtering tensor-triangulated categories and understanding the successive strata via étale extensions. An early prototype of this method has been applied to compute the spectrum of the equivariant stable homotopy category of a finite group. The project aims to transport those ideas to new examples.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Mathematics is divided in many specialization, separated in a variety of subfields, sometimes with little interaction. This compartmentalization is not necessarily negative and is the natural effect of high-level focused research. A healthy counterweight to hyper-specialization is the principle of unification, that brings together the common features of different sub-fields into a more sophisticated hyper-topical theory.  Tensor-triangular geometry is such a unification. It brings together parts of homotopy theory, in topology, parts of algebraic geometry and of representation in theory, in algebra, and parts of KK-theory, in analysis. The common feature that supports this unification is the concept of tensor-triangulated category, a mathematical structure that is present in all those examples. The key tool of tensor-triangular geometry is a topological space, that is, a geometric contruction, that can be associated to every tensor-triangulated categories in examples and that contains preciou information about those structures.  The specific achievements of the present award can be divided into two categories: the theoretical ones, aimed at establishing new general properties of tensor-triangulated categories and the applied ones, aimed at computing new spectra and deriving consequences from this.  Among the theorical results, we can list:  - The analysis of smashing subcategories and the associated topological structure (with Krause and Stevenson).  - A book (with Dell'Ambrogio) dedicated to Makey 2-functors and Mackey 2-motives. This unifies various equivariant structures and isolates the initial (or `motivic') such structure.  Among the applications, we count:  - The determination of all commutative separable ring objects in the stable module category of cyclic groups (with Carlson). This result shows that the "etale topology" in this part of modular representation theory is controlled by the subgroups of the finite group.  - The determination of the spectrum of the category of Artin-Tate motives over the real numbers (with Gallauer). This result allows the classification of such objects into 14 possible families and opens the door to further similar classifications in motivic theory.
