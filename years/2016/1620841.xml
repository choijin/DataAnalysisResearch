<AbstractNarration>This award supports the participation of a select group of graduate students from US institutions at the International Conference on Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems (AAMAS 2016) and the accompanying doctoral mentoring consortium (DMC) to be held in Singapore, May 9-13, 2016. AAMAS is the premier conference on multi-agent systems. There is an increasing interest in research on agents worldwide because of the many technologies where agents are applicable including: information retrieval, electronic commerce, robotics, and education tasks among many others. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The DMC will be held before the start of the main conference, enabling the students to participate fully in all aspects of both the conference and the consortium. The activities at the DMC will involve interactions at multiple levels, where: 1) students will present and discuss their work with their peers; 2) students will hone their ability to succinctly describe their research in a one minute elevator pitch; 3) student research will be shown at a poster session, open to any conference attendee; and 4) students will be paired with a mentor from the senior program committee, who will meet with them privately during the conference to provide feedback on their dissertation topics. The DMC usually features a selection of invited speakers and culminates with a career advice panel with researchers from academia, industry, and government. During the course of the conference, students will have the opportunities to maximize international interactions and make new professional connections.</AbstractNarration>

It also helped them become members? of the international community of scholars, by making personal connections with other researchers from around the world. Student scholarship funds also make it possible for groups to send multiple students to attend the same conference, rather than simply having all conference papers presented by a senior researcher.  Scholarships were chosen on the basis of   Match between their research topic and the topics covered in the Doctoral Mentoring Consortium; Diversity of the participants, including ethnic, regional, and gender considerations; Limited means to attached the Doctoral Mentoring Consortium; Level of participation in the AAMAS conference; and Time to anticipated graduation.   In addition to the PI, two additional members rounded out the 3-person panel that assigned scholarships: Katsuhide Fujita, from Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology, and Koen Hindriks, from TU Delft.
