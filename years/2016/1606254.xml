<AbstractNarration>This award is made as part of the FY 2016 Mathematical Sciences Postdoctoral Research Fellowships Program. Each of the fellowships supports a research and training project at a host institution in the mathematical sciences, including applications to other disciplines, under the mentorship of a sponsoring scientist. The title of the project for this fellowship to Kathryn Mann is "Actions of infinite groups on manifold." The host institution for the fellowship is University of California Berkeley, and the sponsoring scientist is Ian Agol.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project funded research on actions of infinite groups on manifolds, an area at the intersection of many areas of mathematics: topology, geometric group theory, foliation theory, and topological dynamics.  This work was motivated by fundamental questions about the relationship between the algebraic structure of an infinite group, the possible dynamics of its actions by homeomorphisms on a manifold, and the topology of the moduli spaces that parametrize all actions of a given group on a manifold. The PI obtained major results on the relationship between rigidity (a dynamical concept) of group actions, and related geometric structures, showing in a fundamental setting that the only source of rigidity is underlying geometry.  She also initiated a program to study the large-scale geometry of transformation groups, resulting in two publications, and made major progress on a program to relate the space of circular orders on a group (an algebraic construction) to the dynamics of the group's actions on 1-manifolds.    Broader impact: the PI worked on several programs to increase participation in mathematics and expose young people to mathematics research.  This included designing a course and teaching at high-school summer enrichment programs, supervising independent study projects and small research projects for undergraduate students, and giving undergraduate colloquia talks.  She has also been actively involved in AWM activities, undergrad-graduate mentorship structures, and diversity initiatives in her department.
