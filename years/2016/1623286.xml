<AbstractNarration>This award supports participation in the conference ''Fifty Years of the Hales-Jewett Theorem,'' held at Western Washington University, May 6-8, 2016. The conference provides a forum for mathematicians working on problems related to the Hales-Jewett theorem, a cornerstone result in combinatorics. The conference features ten plenary talks by distinguished mathematicians and provides an opportunity for students and junior researchers to meet and learn from leaders in the field.  The meeting provides a venue for exchange of ideas to catalyze new developments in the field, as well as the training of graduate students working in this area. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Hales-Jewett Theorem is a central theorem in the area of research known as Ramsey Theory. This area has been actively investigated by leading mathematicians for more than one hundred years, with recent spectacular progress. In a large collaborative effort through the Polymath Project, one of the long sought-after goals in the area, the density Hales-Jewett Theorem, was finally proved in 2012. The conference features current research on this topic and others in Ramsey Theory and related areas. Leading researchers will present new results, and during the conference there will be ample time for open discussions on the field's many unsolved problems.

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Hales-Jewett theorem, first published in 1963, acts as a cornerstone result in Ramsey theory and extremal combinatorics. It is a generalization of van der Waerden's theorem which states that there is some combinatorial structure in high-dimensional hypercubes; this structure can be expressed by its containment of a combinatorial line.  The international conference titled "Fifty Years of the Hales-Jewett Theorem" was held May 6-8, 2016, at Western Washington University and brought together three generations of mathematicians working in areas related to this fundamental result. The idea of this meeting was driven by the continued and excited interest in topics surrounding the Hales-Jewett theorem. The conference featured twelve outstanding invited speakers while allowing ample time for mathematical interactions among the participants.  The variety of topics exposed at the conference included ordered Ramsey numbers, constructions for several hypergraph Ramsey problems, the algebraic structure of the Stone-Cech compactification of a discrete semigroup, epsilon-nets for geometric ranges, monochromatic infinite sumsets, applications of the polynomial Hales-Jewett theorem and the computational aspects of the Boolean Pythagorean triples problem. The synergy of ideas presented by the speakers proved to be a rich source for further research by the attendees, several of which were in the early stages of their careers.
