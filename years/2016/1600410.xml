<AbstractNarration>Promoting student involvement in the geosciences is of utmost priority for geoscience educators at all levels, as the broader community is experiencing mass retirement and a shortage of qualified individuals to replace them in the workforce. The geoscience community is also struggling to diversify its workforce. Much research demonstrates that undergraduate geology students who are exposed to geoscience research early in their education are much more likely to pursue geoscience careers than their peers who did not have this exposure. Wake Technical Community College (Wake Tech) is addressing these issues by providing its diverse population of introductory geology students with paid summer geoscience research opportunities at partner institutions: North Carolina State University (NCSU) and the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences (NCMNS).  Students who participate in the summer internships also are being integrated in an ongoing program of mentoring and professional socialization through multiple opportunities to present their research projects to various audiences, including at professional meetings, to other undergraduates, to high school students, and to the public.  The project is creating broader impacts beyond the immediate research experiences for students in the program, because of the potential of outreach by a more diverse group of students for attracting additional students from underrepresented groups as they consider their own choice of major.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wake Tech, located in Raleigh, North Carolina, has a large and flourishing introductory geology program consisting of diverse freshman and sophomore students who are looking to transfer to four-year institutions. This project is working to: 1) increase the number of students, including those from groups underrepresented in geosciences, transferring from community college to geoscience programs at four-year colleges and universities; 2) provide three cohorts of 12 Wake Tech students with engaging, cutting-edge geoscience summer research internship experiences at partner institutions (NCSU and NCMNS); 3) demonstrate the effectiveness of early research experiences for community college students; and 4) engage more than 1300 Wake Tech geoscience students each year in a greater number of inquiry investigations based on current NCSU/NCMNS geoscience research. Students completing the summer research internship are also involved with promoting a better understanding of geoscience careers and issues among the broader population of Wake County through participation in the Wake Tech Student Chapter of the Association of Environmental and Engineering Geologists (AEG) and outreach to local high schools, Wake Tech students, and NCMNS visitors. The strong partnership between Wake Tech, NCSU, and the NCMNS ensures the highest quality of research experiences and mentoring with careful attention to mentoring students from their initial interest through acceptance in a four-year college geoscience program.</AbstractNarration>

The project has created broader impacts beyond the immediate research experiences for students in the program, because a more diverse group of students is likely to attract additional students from underrepresented groups as they consider their own choice of major.  During the summers of 2017, 2018, and 2019, a total of thirty-one Wake Tech student interns successfully completed a paid summer research project under the guidance of faculty mentors at NCSU and NCMNS.  Recruitment of students to participate in the extracurricular research and mentoring experience efforts focused on diverse students, particularly underrepresented minorities.  Prior to the internship, selected students had completed only one or two geology courses at Wake Tech.  Student interns performed meaningful research, including planning, data collection, and analysis, under the mentorship of faculty researchers and graduate students, and presented their research at an undergraduate research symposium and/or professional geoscience meeting.  Eleven student interns were selected to travel with Wake Tech faculty members to present their research at a national/international professional meeting, including the Geological Society of America (GSA) national meetings in Seattle, Washington, Indianapolis, Indiana, and Phoenix, Arizona, and the Society of Vertebrate Paleontology (SVP) international meeting in Brisbane, Australia.  Wake Tech student interns also had additional opportunities for professional socialization, including participation in a student chapter of the Association of Environmental and Engineering Geologists (AEG), and promoting geoscience opportunities to their Wake Tech peers in the geology classroom, at Wake Tech STEM events, and to local primary and secondary schools.  Over 70% of the student interns who returned to Wake Tech participated in these additional outreach activities.  During the three years of the project, the diversity (based on female and/or racial minority) of student participants in the program fluctuated from 30% in 2017, to 80% in 2018, and to 45% in 2019.  Several participants were also military veterans, first generation, and/or non-traditional students.  After completing the program, 37% of the student interns interviewed indicated they had or would be transferring to a geoscience degree program at a four-year college within the next year. Additional interns are expected to transfer into a four-year geoscience degree program within two years of program completion, or after completing their two-year degree requirements.   Out of the 2018 and 2019 cohorts, at least 75% interviewed indicated that the experience had increased their interest in pursuing a degree in the geoscience field.  Over the course of the project, it was found that meaningful paid research experiences early in a student's career encourages diverse two-year college undergraduates to choose a major and career path in geoscience.
