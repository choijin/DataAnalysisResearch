<AbstractNarration>Researchers have shown that one's pereceptions and experiences of one's physical self are affected by language, culture, and ethnicity. The question the research funded by this award is asking is,  what happens when people from different cultural and ethnic backgrounds must interact in relation to their biologies? How do those differences get negotiated and with what result? While this can be seen as an interesting theroetical question, it also has important practical implications, such as when a provider of healthcare services comes from one cultural group and the recipient comes from another. Arizona State University anthropology doctoral student, Ms. Dimitra Mari Varvarezou, with the guidance of Dr. Elizabeth A. Brandt and Dr. Jonathan Maupin, will investigate the problem through the lens of of disability. She will focus on how indigenous epistemologies affect Diné (Navajo) adults' experience of physical disabilities,  as well as the understandings of Diné individuals who care for them; examine the epistemologies and understandings of physical disabilities held by Anglo service providers and healthcare professionals; and determine what happens, and why, when the two groups come together.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will be conducted in the Phoenix Metropolitan Area and in off-Reservation locations. Varvarezou will employ a mixed methods design, including participant observation; free lists and cultural consensus analysis to determine cultural models of physical disability, symptoms, causes, and treatment; and focused semi-structured interviews. The researcher will also assess the patterns of agreement and degree of variation in relation to disability perceptions among the Diné, among Anglo healthcare workers, and between the two cultural groups.  Findings from this research will promote a better understanding of the role that social perceptions play in cross-cultural healthcare. Findings will also contribute to theorization of cultural negotiations in cross-cultural situations.</AbstractNarration>

Drawing upon ethnographic interviews with Dine (Navajo) individuals with physical disabilities, family members, as well as Dine/Anglo healthcare workers and service providers, findings show that perceptions of disability are closely connected to understandings of Indigenous/non-Indigenous identity, constructs of personhood, and embodiment of disability. This research advances scholarship by offering a critical analysis of the role that history plays in shaping current, every-day social relationships. Findings show that narratives of identity and relationships between consumers and providers are firmly situated within a broader context of interpretations of the social impacts of colonization and historical trauma. In addition to advancing academic knowledge this project has broader social impacts. Responding to community concerns, this project contributes to promoting (self) empowerment and (self) advocacy of groups that have been historically marginalized: not only of those who self-identify as individuals with disabilities, and Indigenous peoples, but also those who embody both those identities.
