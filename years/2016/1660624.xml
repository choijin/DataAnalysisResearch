<AbstractNarration>With funding from the NSF Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program, a team at Albany State University (ASU, listed among Historically Black Colleges and Universities) partnering with the Dougherty County School System (a high-need local educational agency, LEA), will use capacity-building funds to develop a strong infrastructure to establish pipelines for STEM teachers in southwest Georgia. This project will work to address an increasing need for highly-qualified STEM teachers in this rural region. Toward meeting this need, the project team will: conduct needs assessments across the region to determine priorities; strengthen partnerships between ASU and regional LEAs; design alternative curriculum pathways for teacher certification; and develop a systematic pipeline to recruit future STEM teachers. The project will develop a model that can be adapted for other rural contexts, while reflecting the needs of the local and regional business, industry, and education communities of southwest Georgia.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ASU and project partners will develop a long-term plan for increasing the number of STEM teachers prepared to teach in high-need school districts. In collaboration with the partners, the project team will conduct needs assessments for the region, identifying common needs and goals with the systems, parents, and community partners. The project team will develop streamlined curricular pathways that emphasize culturally responsive teaching. Evaluation questions include, (1) What are barriers to becoming a STEM educator in Southwest Georgia? (2) What are the specific STEM shortage areas in high-needs schools? (3) What specific strategies can be implemented to produce increased numbers of qualified STEM teachers who are willing to teach in high-need schools? Thus, this Noyce Capacity Building project will support the partners in developing evidence-based innovative models and strategies for recruiting, preparing, and supporting teachers and will establish the infrastructure for implementing a future Noyce scholarship project.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ "Linking Theory to Practice: Developing a School-University Partnership to Supply STEM Teachers in High-Needs School Districts," a Noyce Track 1 Capacity Building Grant at Albany State University (ASU) in Albany, Georgia, focused on addressing the STEM teacher shortage in a rural, high-needs area in southwest Georgia.  In order to identify potential causes for the shortage, the researchers focused on four major goals.  Goal 1, Developing Partnerships, addressed the need to improve communication among the local and regional school districts, the university, and area businesses and industries.  The collaborations resulted in a broader dialogue regarding the needs of the local and regional communities, as well as the requirements of the business partners for future employees.  The STEM Advisory Board, developed through the grant, provided rich insights into both these topics.  Developing and conducting a needs assessment followed from the conversations from Goal 1.  The needs assessment highlighted the areas where there may be greater STEM teacher shortages and identified some potential causes for the ongoing problem.  To address the shortages, Goal 3?s focus was to develop a recruitment pipeline by identifying future teachers at an earlier age.  The most promising outcome from Goal 3 was the partnership articulation between a local career academy and ASU that provided high school students the opportunity the "practice" teaching during summer academies.  Finally, Goal 4 allowed the education and STEM faculties to partner in developing a new curriculum pathway for initial teacher certification.  The pathway provided STEM professionals and STEM majors an alternative pathway for obtaining full certification and a Master?s degree in education.  Intellectual Merit       In addressing the problem of a STEM teacher shortage, the capacity building project has added to the body of knowledge that supports teacher preparation by increasing collaborative efforts between STEM and education faculty.  This resulted in improving processes that focus on recruitment and retention of potential STEM teachers from the pool of STEM majors.  The project supported the idea of recruiting from the school system pipeline (middle and high school) and developing high levels of interest in STEM, supporting the idea that leads to STEM interest in later years (Jack, Lin, and Yore, 2014).  The data collected from the completed project provided new knowledge on the following: What specific strategies could be implemented to produce increased numbers of qualified STEM teachers who are willing to teach in high-needs schools?  This effort engaged higher education and its partners in K-12 schools, and encouraged local and regional stakeholders to examine data and practices in order to identify innovative solutions for building an effective STEM pipeline from high school to higher education. The experience learned from our first Robert Noyce will be readily shared with other institutions and programs that are interested in initiating a capacity building program through a report at the Southwest Georgia Regional Educational Service Agency early Fall meeting  (Fall, 2018) and the College of Education Educator Summit (Spring, 2019).  The results will be developed into an article and submitted to The Journal for College Teaching for publication during 2019.   Broader Impact       The current teacher preparation program at Albany State University has been in place with few revisions for over six years and is based on current best practices in teacher preparation.  However, the numbers of STEM teachers completing the program has decreased and the teacher shortage in southwest Georgia has continued to increase.  Since the teacher shortage is not being met, the NOYCE Capacity Building grant findings provided a foundation for addressing that shortage.          The results of the project had two significant impacts.  First, our partnership would result in a significant increase in the number of fully certified and highly qualified STEM teachers serving in high-needs school districts, with a special focus on rural high-needs school districts.  The teacher training component was designed to support implementing innovative teaching strategies that are culturally relevant, inquiry-based and problem-based.  Second, it positively impacted the synergy between STEM and education faculty by improving communication, collaboration, and creativity by partnering to design culturally relevant, inquiry-based teaching experiences and improving STEM instruction in area schools to impact student learning in regional schools.  Our findings and recommendations can be applied to other institutions, most especially HBCUs, struggling with a STEM teacher shortage.
