<AbstractNarration>Title: Northeastern University Planning Grant: I/UCRC for Energy-Smart Electronic Systems&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Datacenters are being constructed daily across the United States at an ever-increasing rate. Just in the first half of 2015, 94.8 megawatts of data center environments were constructed. Financial services, technology, social media and healthcare sectors are just a few of the drivers in this rapidly expanding market. Given the ambitious goals of cloud computing providers and exascale supercomputing, power-smart technologies are going to play a key role in order to reach these aggressive computing targets. This project addresses datacenter power usage. This planning grant will create a new I/UCRC Site at Northeastern University, joining the existing I/UCRC Center for Energy-Smart Electronic Systems (ES2).  The Northeastern team brings critical research expertise to the existing Center, and leverages the availability of the Massachusetts Green High Performance Computer Center (MGHPCC). The ES2 I/UCRC is committed to engaging women and underrepresented minorities students in research activities associated with the Site through a research coop model, and through a new Research Experiences for Undergraduates program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Datacenters and supercomputing facilities struggle in terms of their effective use of power and cooling resources.  The addition of the Northeastern University Site to the existing ES2 Center adds new research capabilities across the computing stack, ranging from low-power mixed signal design to introducing emerging memory technologies into the memory hierarchy, and from leveraging accelerators to power-aware workload scheduling, that can be used to resolve current and future challenges.  The new ES2 Site joins the lead institution Binghamton University, as well as Center partners at Villanova University, Georgia Tech and University of Texas at Arlington. The existing Center partners already have established 25 industrial partners in the Center. The addition of Northeastern builds on this success, and positions the Center to expand in a number of areas in a Phase II program. These areas include: i.) memory system design and optimization, ii.) accelerators, both hardware and software, and iii.) power-effective design.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goal of this project was to enable a team of researchers at Northeastern University to join the existing IUCRC for Energy Smart Electronic Systems (ES-2) Center, headquartered at SUNY Binghamton.  The Northeastern team included researchers working across the areas of computer architecture, cloud computing, integrated circuit technnology, power management and data center management, adding important expertise to the existing ES-2 IUCRC team.  The two-day planning meeting was held November 30th, and December 1st, 2017.  NSF Director Andre Marshall was in attendance, as well as the ES-2 directors Bahgat Sammakia (online) and Kandad Ghose.  Don Price was our Assessment Coordinator.  The Assessment Coordinator helped to guide the process, and NSF director Marshall clearly explained the IUCRC program to all assembled.  The ES-2 directors started the meeting with a overview of the existing ES-2 Center, and the benefits that the Northeastern team would be bringing to the Center.  From industry, we had representatives from AMD, NVIDIA, Analog Devices, Dell/EMC, Draper Laboratories, MGHPCC and Qualcomm.  Additional companies that had provided supporting letters, but were not able to attend in person, included Cavium, Cigna, Google, Oracle and Samsung.  All presentation materials were made available to all potential industry partners.     The main program of the meeting included short project presentations from 10 Northeastern faculty.  LIFE forms were used to solicit feedback on each project.  The feedback provided by the industry attendees was extremely useful, and the overall experience was positive in terms of establishing links between the assembled industry and the Northeastern team.  At this point in time, there were not enough industry partners ready to join the ES-2 Center to allow for the Northeastern team to submit a full Phase 2 proposal.  While a new ES-2 IUCRC Site did not result, the overall exercise produced multiple new connections between the industry partners and the Northeastern faculty (resulting in new funding from Dell/EMC and Analog Devices, and continued funding from AMD).  Even more importantly, many of these same partners are involved in another IUCRC effort in the Center for Hardware and Embedded Systems Security and Trust (CHEST), which is a Phase 1 effort across 6 collaborating institutions.  Analog Devices and Draper Labs have letter of support to the Northeastern site director of the CHEST Center.  So while a new ES-2 site was not spawned, the planning meeting and associated activities have generated positive outcomes.
