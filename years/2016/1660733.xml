<AbstractNarration>The ECR program emphasizes fundamental STEM education research that will generate foundational knowledge in the field. To that end, this research project will collect data about the experiences, beliefs, and praxis of Black mathematics teachers from historical and contemporary perspectives to: (a) inform recruitment and retention efforts; and (b) contribute to theory building. This study is highly important since the number of Black mathematics educators choosing to teach mathematics at the secondary are either choosing not to select mathematics as a career or leaving the profession due to racial/ethnic biases and stereotype threats that often question their ability to teach the subject. To help encourage more Black educators to choose teaching mathematics as a career, this study will document the oral histories and experiences of Black mathematics teachers pre- and post-de jure school desegregation as a means of informing contemporary recruitment and retention procedures and processes. It will also examine the experiences of practicing Black secondary mathematics teachers about their beliefs about mathematics content, recruitment, retention, racialized experiences in education, and perceptions and beliefs about current pedagogical practices. This information will be used to inform educational policy and provide implications for recruiting and maintaining a more diverse mathematics education teaching force. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A mixed methods research design will be used to collect data through oral history interviews with retired Black mathematics teachers and focus group sessions with current mathematics teachers. A large-scale survey will also be adapted and administered to capture the experiences of current Black secondary mathematics teachers from a sociocultural perspective. Through these data sources, this research will advance knowledge of the historical and sociocultural influences that impede recruitment and retention of a diverse teaching force by focusing efforts on understanding these issues in relation to Black mathematics teachers. It will also inform research methodology in STEM by integrating untapped, yet appropriate methodologies suitable for challenging issues of recruitment, retention, and praxis of other underrepresented racial and ethnic groups across time periods and school contexts. Further, this project will contribute to theories about the development of mathematics identity and mathematics teaching. This outcome, in turn, will help broaden participation of underrepresented teachers and students in STEM while improving mathematics achievement and performance overall. Through these avenues, findings from this research will reach a variety of academic and general public audiences through online digital portal and website that will provide informational and educational tools for the larger education community.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ There are two popular and continuous conversations regarding the recruitment and retention of teachers taking place in educational circles and in public discourse. One conversation iconcentrates on the need to recruit Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) teachers for the purposes of maintaining global leadership increasing the pipeline of students who seek STEM careers post-K-12 education. Meanwhile, educational stakeholders, policymakers, and the general public are engaging in a separate and equally important conversation about recruiting a diverse teaching force. These conversations are not mutually exclusive. As such our research answered several questions:  To what extent did the research team document the retired mathematics teachers’ rich historical and racialized experiences with respect to mathematics teaching and learning pre- and post-de jure segregation?  We conducted 13 interviews (oral histories) with mathematics teachers who worked in Atlanta; Washington, DC; and Maryland between the 1950’s and 2000’s. On average they taught mathematics to Black children for 40 years. For each participant, one pre-interview was conducted by telephone and a follow-up interview was conducted face-to-face. Participants allowed the research team to record audio and video from their second interviews. Oral histories for 7 participants are included in the project’s website and the digital archive (blackmathteachers.org). These oral histories addressed the retired mathematics teachers’ racialized experiences with respect to being mathematics teachers and learners, as well as their historical experiences pre- and post-de-jure segregation. They are presented in video format and categorized by themes: "College &amp; Path to Teaching", "Professional Development", "Content &amp; Pedagogy", "Racialized Experiences", and "Advice to Teachers".  To what extent did the research team use the oral histories of the retired mathematics teachers to inform (a) theory development with respect to the praxis of Black mathematics teachers; and (b) contemporary challenges to recruiting and retaining Black mathematics teachers?  We submitted a paper to Harvard Educational Review that delineates the theory of an "arc of resistance" to educational racism as demonstrated by the Black mathematics teachers over the last six decades. It draws on the quantitative documentation of racial microaggressions that contemporary Black teachers face. In addition, it draws from the oral histories of retired teachers and the focus group data of contemporary teachers to show the many ways that Black mathematics teachers have resisted racism, and the similarities of this resistance over time.  To what extent did the research team illuminate issues facing currently practicing teachers, including issues of recruitment and retention?  We surveyed over 1000 currently practicing mathematics teachers and conducted focus groups with practicing mathematics teachers. The team illuminated issues related to how race impacts retention. Namely, the research team found that racialized microaggressions were statistically significant in predicting teachers’ thoughts of leaving the field.  To what extent did the research team disseminate their research to impact policy, research, teacher education, and public knowledge?  We disseminated information in both traditional academic and public settings. To date, we conducted 11 conference presentations, one journal publications (consumed by researchers and practitioners), and several other peer-review journal submissions. Additionally, we participated in policy-based podcast interviews (e.g., Edutopia) and written for several blog posts (e.g., Brookings).  From this body of work we have generated several recommendations for addressing the needs of Black mathematics teachers include:  Teacher Education:   Rethinking how methods and content courses, in both climate and subject, become gatekeepers to Black mathematics teachers’ participation. Look to teacher preparation programs at Historically Black Colleges and Universities as models of supporting Black mathematics teacher candidates. Center and integrate Black students’ lived experiences and alternative perspectives into mathematics teacher education &ndash; Culturally Relevant Teacher Education Pedagogy. Honor and learn from Black teachers’ and teacher candidates’ knowledge of community wealth. Respect Black teachers as pedagogues. Look for opportunities to situate PD in schools that have significant populations of teachers of color.   Education Policy &amp; Leadership:   Identify and remedy latent racial discriminatory policy practices in tangible ways by:   o   Working with leaders on reducing anti-Black bias in hiring and evaluating teachers  o   Rethinking discipline practices that burden Black teachers with disciplining Black students  o   Revising course schedules to increase the numbers of Black teachers who teach advanced mathematics  o   Advancing Black teachers into mathematics instructional leadership  o   Recruiting prospective Black mathematics teachers from their communities             Last Modified: 07/29/2021       Submitted by: Marvin Powell]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
