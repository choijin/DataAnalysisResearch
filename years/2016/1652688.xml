<AbstractNarration>This is a collaborative effort between scientists from 5 western universities whose research is focused on the study of the emissions from western U.S. wildfire plumes.  A sampling strategy will be employed using a wide range of instrumentation on the NSF/NCAR C-130 aircraft to study atmospheric chemical reactions occurring in wildfire plumes. This field campaign is being conducted in collaboration with related campaigns supported by other agencies: the FIREX campaign by NOAA and the FIREChem mission by NASA. These campaigns are planned to take place in the late summer of 2018. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Western wildfire Experiment for Cloud chemistry, Aerosol absorption and Nitrogen (WE-CAN) campaign addresses scientific questions related to fixed nitrogen, absorbing aerosols, and cloud activation and chemistry in wildfire plumes. This research focuses on the first day of plume evolution following initial emissions. The chemistry and microphysics occurring during this time impacts the partitioning of reactive nitrogen, alters cloud chemistry and nucleation, and largely determines aerosol scattering and absorption.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In this project, we studied the gaseous and particulate emissions from Western U.S. wildfires and the subsequent atmospheric chemistry and transport of the associated smoke plumes.  Intellectual Merit  In terms of intellectual merit, the UW team deployed a state-of-the-art mass spectrometer to separately measure and quantify the abundance of several inorganic and organic reactive nitrogen species emitted from fires or formed from chemistry in the smoke plume. We used these measurements together with computer models to test our understanding of the emissions and transformations of reactive nitrogen in wildfire smoke and its connection to the formation and properties of organic particulate matter.  Outcomes  We found that nitrous acid (HONO) is emitted in higher amounts than expected from previous laboratory studies, and therefore is a dominant source of the radical oxidants which drive smoke plume chemistry. We also found that oxides of nitrogen are transformed rapidly into organic nitrogen reservoirs and inorganic nitrate in fresh wildfire plumes, with as much as 25% forming organic nitrates not accounted for by existing chemical mechanisms. One fate of reactive nitrogen is to form nitroaromatics in the smoke plume through reactions involving phenols. Nitrophenols were identified for the first time in real-time in the smoke plumes and we showed that the can account for a significant fraction of light absorption by particulate organic matter. We also showed that particulate organic matter undergoes transformations once emitted, with evaporation of particulate matter occuring with dilution of the smoke plume being offset by formation of particulate matter from condensing vapors produced in the smoke.   Broader Impacts  This project provided training and experiences for a woman undergraduate student, two women graduate students,  and a postdoctoral research fellow on the development, operation, deployment and interpretation of sophisticated analytical instrumentation. Moreover, it has enabled more general science training for these early career scientists in developing testable hypotheses and interpretation of field observations of complex environmental phenomena, writing scientific peer-reviewed publications, and giving presentations of research findings at local and national conferences.  The new scientific insights we have developed about wildfire emissions and associated smoke plume chemistry are important for simulating the downwind impacts of wildfires on atmospheric composition, air quality and climate. Organic particulate matter is a major component of wildfire PM2.5, which adversely affects human health and affects climate through altering transmission of solar energy through the atmosphere. Moreover, wildfires are a significant source of reactive nitrogen to the atmosphere which regulate the oxidizing capacity of the atmosphere and contribute to the formation of secondary pollutants in wildfire plumes such as ozone and inorganic and organic PM2.5. Our findings provide guidance on how to estimate the evolution of PM2.5 mass and its impact on sunlight transmission, and of reactive nitrogen in wildfire plumes. This scientific guidance will therefore impact air quality forecasts and assessments of wildfire emissions on local air quality as well as on regional and global climate.
