<AbstractNarration>The goal of this project is to develop, implement, and study robust and efficient computational (Partial Differential Equation) solvers for large-scale systems of equations that describe coupled physical problems.  In particular, we aim to investigate applications in the computation of electromagnetic phenomena around obstacles, as well as poromechanic applications, such as the study of groundwater flow in porous media. Designing these solvers represents an important class of challenging problems in computational mathematics, because those coupled systems usually describe complex multiphysics phenomena across different time and spatial scales.  Currently, most efficient and robust solvers are developed for single-physics problems, whereas each tool we develop will strongly consider the importance of the inherent coupling.  The research will provide new computational paradigms for electromagnetics and poroelasticity, both of which have crucial applications in physics and engineering, such as fusion energy applications, shale gas recovery, carbon dioxide consolidation, and cardiac muscle behavior, to name a few. Finally, the project supports one graduate student. Through training and collaboration with investigators and other experts in the field, they will become involved in the broader research communities of scientific computing and engineering. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each of the applications described above corresponds to a discretized coupled system of partial differential equations (PDEs).  Due to the complexity of the multi-physics and multi-scale phenomena described by such models, an essential component is efficient and robust nonlinear and linear solvers, due to the fact that the computational time needed to simulate complex physics is in many cases dominated by solving the large-scale linear systems of equations representing the discretized PDEs.  Therefore, this research focuses on developing, analyzing, and implementing efficient iterative methods and preconditioners for coupled PDE systems. More precisely, this is achieved by two possible approaches. When structure-preserving discretizations are applied, properties of the PDE models that are carried over to the discrete model are used to derive an exact block factorization and we will design novel preconditioners without approximating the Schur complements. For general numerical schemes, monolithic multigrid methods will be developed by generalizing the multigrid theoretical framework for indefinite coupled systems. Finally, by applying these new iterative solvers and studying their interplay with accurate discretization schemes, the investigators will create robust and efficient numerical simulations for systems such as Maxwell's equations and those describing poromechanics. More generally, the new solvers developed here will provide insight on how to use analytic tools in the design of algebraic solvers and novel theoretical foundations for the design of robust solvers for general coupled PDEs will be considered.</AbstractNarration>

We investigated two main applications: the computation of asymptotically disappearing solutions for Maxwell's equations and the simulation of poromechanic problems. These models present many interesting challenges common to models used in physics, mathematics, and more generally in the numerical simulation and analysis of physical phenomena. The resulting outcomes of this project addressed several important aspects of these challenges. Namely, the PIs were able to develop advanced numerical discretizations that preserve important physical quantities and which are stable for different physical parameters.  Efficient solvers based on block factorization and monolithic MG methods were also developed.   Working on this project, the PIs addressed both the computational modeling (discretization methods) and the solution algorithms to simulate these applications.  Specifically, the PIs investigated a structure-preserving discretization for solving Maxwell's equation with dissipative boundary conditions, preserving the inherent conservation laws exactly on the discrete level. Two types of block preconditioners were developed by taking advantage of the well-posedness and structure-preserving property of the discretization.  The PIs theoretically showed the optimality and robustness of the proposed solution methods and demonstrated their effectiveness based on efficient numerical implementations. Similarly, for poromechanics, the PIs investigated different discretization techniques and developed a stable scheme that achieves robust results with minimal computational cost.  They then introduced block preconditioners that are proven to also be robust with respect to both physical and discretization parameters.    In accomplishing all of these outcomes, the results were disseminated via several publications, as well as in conference talks.  Additionally, a major product of this project included the development of a software package, HAZmath, to implement the advanced discretizations and robust solvers.  This package is currently being used to perform experiments to validate the theory developed under this project, but also has been successfully used on other application areas, including simulations of flow in fractured porous media and computational biology.    Additionally, a major impact of this project has been the professional development of graduate research assistants (GRA).  One GRA, directly supported by the project, and another working on related topics, developed an in-depth background in numerical methods for solving poromechanics and in the analysis and implementation of multilevel methods.  They were given the opportunity to present their work at several conferences, both domestically and internationally.  Both have independently won the Student Paper Competition of the Copper Mountain Conference on Multigrid Methods and have authored several publications produced by this project.    Finally, the advancement of techniques developed under this project to solve coupled PDE systems has the potential to be applied to a wide-range of applications other than Maxwell's equations and poromechanics.  This includes related areas such as magnetohydrodynamics, shale gas recovery, CO2 consolidation, and cardiac muscle behavior.  In addition, the open-source software, HAZmath, is now available to the scientific community.        Last Modified: 10/30/2019       Submitted by: Xiaozhe Hu]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
