<AbstractNarration>The predicted national shortfall of 135,000 geoscientists by 2022 will have major consequences for the provision of energy and water resources and the quality of the environment, necessities that sustain a strong economy and ensure the health and welfare of all Americans.  This project is addressing the personnel shortfall by testing a comprehensive program of career-related extracurricular activities that aims to improve retention and achievement levels of students earning four-year college degrees in the geosciences and increase the number and diversity of these skilled scientists that succeed in the workforce after graduation.  The best practices defined from evaluating the success of the program are being used to build a model that can be followed by other universities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is examining the effect of experiential learning opportunities on higher student retention rates in the geosciences, improvement in academic performance, and successful career placement. A diverse group of 18 undergraduate geology majors at the University of Texas at San Antonio (a Minority-Serving and Hispanic-Serving Institution) are engaging in a sequence of three internships in different geoscience fields to provide multiple career-related work experiences. Each student is completing an academic internship involving research and teaching activities on campus, followed by two placements in the energy resources, geo-environmental assessment, and water resources fields.  The four career trajectories have clear pathways into the local employment market through private companies and governmental agencies.  Students are also participating in a suite of academic and professional workshops to enhance competencies and skills in preparation for their careers. A multi-level mentoring strategy that promotes personal and professional growth and an integrated scheme of networking opportunities aims to smooth the transition into the geoscience workforce. Program activities are being assessed through a systematic plan of surveys, interviews, and external reviews.  The project seeks to improve undergraduate education to address the projected shortfall in geoscientists, promote the participation of underrepresented groups in both geoscience majors and careers, and contribute to research on strengthening partnerships between higher education institutions and external geoscience organizations. The project will increase the number and diversity of skilled workers entering the geoscience workforce and lead to best practice strategies that can be implemented at other universities to impact meaningfully on the retention, education, and career trajectories of geoscience majors.</AbstractNarration>
