<AbstractNarration>This proposal seeks NSF support for a three-day workshop on Geometry for Signal Processing and Machine Learning to be held October 13?15, 2016 in Estes Park, Colorado. The workshop is being organized by Ali Pezeshki, Colorado State University (PI of this proposal), Doug Cochran, Arizona State University, and Louis Scharf, Colorado State University. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop will explore applications that impel manifold modeling, and develop a framework for solving inference problems on manifolds. Specific objectives of the workshop include&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;? identifying challenging problems of signal processing and machine learning that lie outside the scope of subspace methods, &lt;br/&gt;? identifying models and methods from modern geometry that address these problems, &lt;br/&gt;? identifying a set of open research questions that would inform NSF?s continuing and future investments in signal processing and machine learning. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The long-term objective is to develop a theory as broad in its scope and as precise in its methodologies as modern statistical signal processing. Such a theory would extend linear subspace models and augment statistical reasoning with geometrical reasoning.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    Overview: A three-day workshop to assess emerging roles for geometry in signal processing and machine learning was held in Estes Park, Colorado, between October 12th and 15th, 2016. The workshop was sponsored by the NSF Directorate for Computer and Information Science and Engineering (CISE).   The purpose of the Estes Park Workshop was to assemble mathematicians, statisticians, and engineers to explore problems in signal processing and machine learning, within the purview of CISE, that would be illuminated by a geometric view and be solved by methods of Riemannian, differential, symplectic, and algebraic geometry. Twenty four participants with expertise in mathematics, signal processing, machine learning, computer science, and statistics attended the workshop.  Outcomes: Several broad themes emerged from discussions during and after the Workshop: (1) a number of new and important problems in signal processing and machine learning do not fit traditional methodologies; (2) there exists a body of mathematical theory which, if widely disseminated and embraced, would equip engineers and applied scientists with new methods for addressing these problems; (3) these new problems will encourage the development of new theory and new computational methods in geometry; (4) a review of case studies where geometry has already had an impact argues in favor of continued successes for geometry. According to the dynamics of scientific development, the application of new methods will bring better solutions and new insights. This will lead to deeper and more general mathematical theory, and a broader range of applications for the theory.     Recommended Initiative: With the advent of the internet, social media, big-data, massive sensor nets, cybersecurity, computational intelligence, and autonomous control, the time is propitious to revisit the mathematical foundations of signal processing and machine learning. Based on the outcomes of this workshop, we conclude that geometry should be central to these foundations. An NSF-funded Center or Institute for the study and application of Geometry in Signal Processing and Machine Learning would advance our understanding of emerging problems of national significance.        Intellectual merit: The intellectual merit of the proposed initiative may be defined by its proto- and meta-objectives. The proto-objective is to identify and solve geometric problems of detection, estimation, tracking, clustering, and classification, as they arise in physics, chemistry, and biology; in radar, sonar, geophysics and remote sensing; in image processing; in big data and predictive analytics. These problems are geometric by virtue of data and parameter constraints and by virtue of symmetries and invariances that are imposed on admissable solutions. The meta-objective is to develop a geometric theory of signal processing and machine learning that is as broad in its scope and as precise in its methodologies as multivariate analysis and subspace signal processing . Such a theory will augment statistical reasoning with geometrical reasoning, and bring new mathematical methods into play. It will address in a rigorous way the processing of signals and data sets that are constrained to manifolds, or whose underlying parameters are so constrained. It is anticipated that the geometry of signal processing and machine learning will illuminate the vices and virtues of existing algorithms and lead to improved algorithms with definable attributes or optimalities. It will open up to analysis and design problems in signal, image, and data analysis previously inaccessible to subspace methods. It will encourage development of numerical methods that are matched to analysis on manifolds in the same way that numerical linear algebra is matched to subspace methods.  Broader Impact: The workshop resulted in identifying an array of emerging and challenging problems in signal processing and machine learning, with important applications in surveillance, microscopy, medical imaging, remote sensing, and cybersecurity.
