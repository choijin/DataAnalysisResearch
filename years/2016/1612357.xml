<AbstractNarration>Almost 150 years ago, the foundations of geometry were rocked when it was realized that the familiar (flat) Euclidean geometry that we all learned in high school was not the only possible geometry to consider.  In retrospect, it seems natural to consider non-flat geometries as the Earth we live on is, of course, round.  Since their first discovery, mathematicians have studied various model geometries with nice curvature properties, such as the round sphere, and we continue to extract new information about these model geometries, how they are distinct from flat Euclidean geometry, and their applications to the universe we live in.  The principal investigator will study special model geometries called homogeneous, Einstein spaces to learn more about their basic properties and work towards their classification.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project's main goal is to advance the classification of non-compact, homogeneous Einstein and Ricci soliton spaces.  In addition to addressing the question of whether or not these spaces are necessarily solvmanifolds, the PI will work to develop a deeper understanding of the special properties of homogeneous Ricci solitons regarding their stability under the Ricci flow and their isometry groups.  To approach these problems, the PI intends to develop more completely the program of using Geometric Invariant Theory to study homogeneous Einstein metrics initiated by Heber, Lauret, et al.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ During the support period, the PI investigated homogeneous Einstein spaces, their related cousins called Ricci solitons, and solvmanifolds, more generally.  Specifically, the PI and collaborators made substantial progress towards classifying these spaces by extending and refining the existing literature and tool sets available to researchers.  Through our investigations, a new property for Einstein solvmanifolds was discovered by the PI and collaborators; as we learned, Einstein solvmanifolds have the largest isometry group among all their different homogeneous metrics - this property is called maximal symmetry.  The property of maximal symmetry was further studied for unimodular solvmanifolds and Ricci solitons; motivated by discoveries there, a larger program to explore these ideas in the general setting of solvmanifolds is now underway.     The PI also explored questions around the geometry of the set of Einstein metrics in the larger space of homogeneous metrics on a given manifold.     The grant also supported the work of the PI's graduate students and postdoc; this includes 3 PhD students and 1 Masters student.  The PI served on PhD committees for 6 other PhD students and advised 9 undergraduate students on research projects.  Through the support of the grant, the PI and his research group were able to disseminate their results to audiences beyond Oklahoma.  Conversely, using grant funds, we were fortunate to be able to bring experts from across the United States, and abroad, to visit Oklahoma.  The PI regularly serves the mathematical community as a journal referee, a journal editor, and reviewer for the NSF.  During the project period, the PI helped to organize 4 conferences.  With colleagues, the PI ran two long running seminars on Geometric Invariant Theory and Data Science in topology/geometry.  The PI serves on the advisory board for the math dept. at Cameron University.  The PI continues to serve as graduate director in his department; in this role, the PI is helping the department to build up a STEM workforce to meet areas of national need.
