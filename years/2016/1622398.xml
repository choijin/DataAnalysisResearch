<AbstractNarration>Our understanding of the tree of life, a tree that summarizes the evolutionary relationships of living organisms, has grown rapidly in recent years. However, interpreting and analyzing large evolutionary trees has proven difficult. This project will create visual workflow software, "Arbor", to help scientists and the general public understand the growing tree of life. Arbor will be easy to use:  anyone will be able to carry out analyses by creating a specific workflow of their methods. Users will be able to easily obtain data over the internet and share their Arbor workflows with others, promoting collaborative efforts. Finally, Arbor will be easily expandable and able to grow as new methods are invented.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Arbor will enable "tree-thinking" to permeate scientific research, while also providing extensive educational outreach to classrooms and museums. Students and the general public benefit tremendously from a better understanding of the relationships among all species. Likewise, the visual workflows and user interfaces we develop will be freely available to the programming community, stimulating additional software development. Finally, enabling the scientific community to analyze the dynamic tree of life will enable new research across a tremendous range of fields, including medicine, public health, agriculture, ecology, and genetics.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The primary goal of this grant was to develop a web-based computer platform where students and researchers could explore comparative evolutionary hypotheses across the tree of life. With a phylogenetic tree in hand, researchers could ask and answer questions about how different traits evolved, whether or not particular traits were associated with particular environmental conditions, or whether community structure was influenced by species phylogeny. The platform, ARBOR, leverages existing software to enable researchers to (1) upload their phylogenetic tree, (2) upload data about characteristics of the organisms (color, size, shape, presence/absence of features, etc.), (3) upload geographic information for each sample, and (4) run analyses to investigate the evolution of traits. Each analysis is recorded as a workflow that can be reproduced by other researchers or included in a publication so that others can follow the same set of analyses for their own data. Once built, we used ARBOR to understand the evolution of the microbiomes found within marine sponges. We found a strong pattern in the species diversity of microbiomes, such that some species of sponges host high diversity microbiomes while others host low diversity microbiomes. We expanded our initial analysis to an extremely large dataset that includes 1,500 individual sponge samples and over 400,000 microbial taxa. We also developed ARBOR workflows to readily enable microbiome comparisons by other users. In addition, we developed ARBOR workflows to facilitate the process of species delimitation for taxonomists and analyses of phylogenetic community structure for ecologists. We are continuing to develop additional tools using ARBOR, including methods to deposit and retrieve data in TraitBank.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 03/29/2018<br>      Modified by: Robert&nbsp;W&nbsp;Thacker</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
