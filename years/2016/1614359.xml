<AbstractNarration>The California Current System off the U.S. west coast includes a coastal upwelling region that is among the most productive ocean ecosystems within the U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone, and the world.  This upwelling domain extends along the coasts of Washington, Oregon, and California.  Many living marine resources develop in this region, which includes five National Marine Sanctuaries.  Variability in ocean climate in this region directly and indirectly influences both harvested and protected marine populations, including numerous species of marine fishes, invertebrates, marine mammals, and seabirds.  The California Current System is also important to drawdown of atmospheric carbon dioxide and carbon sequestration, due to the high primary productivity of the coastal ocean and processes that transfer carbon and other elements into deep ocean waters.  Of sources of climate variability, El Niño is considered the largest climate signal on earth.  It markedly influences many ocean populations, as well as modifying weather patterns across the United States.  The current El Niño of 2015-16 has been characterized as a "strong" event by the U.S. Climate Prediction Center, and may become one of the strongest El Niños in recent history.  In addition, this El Niño follows a sustained, unusual warming in the Northeast Pacific Ocean that began in 2014, and then intensified along the west coast of North America in 2015.  The combination of these two ocean perturbations is expected to alter marine ecosystems in many ways.  The purpose of the proposed research is to quantify the effects of El Niño on key processes acting on planktonic organisms at the base of the ocean food web, because responses of these organisms are fundamental to understanding and forecasting the effects of El Niño on higher order consumers in the food web.  The Broader Impacts of this research include the provision of new quantitative understanding that will be incorporated into future forecast models of the effects of El Niño off the U.S. west coast.  This improved understanding will aid in the management of key living marine resources.  The research will involve numerous graduate students in at-sea science and aid in the training of the next generation of ocean scientists.  The investigators will develop public programs and outreach efforts in collaboration with the Birch Aquarium at Scripps, including an Explore-It: Plankton! public program that will increase public awareness and understanding of El Niño effects on coastal pelagic communities.  They will also develop a Science Exploration Adventure (SEA) Days program that will focus on the CCE El Niño response cruise, in order to connect visitors directly to the process of ocean research and careers in the ocean sciences.  A RAPID response proposal is necessary because this El Niño will be of limited duration and there is insufficient time to submit a proposal through the regular process.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A 20-day research cruise will be conducted in the southern sector of the California Current Ecosystem, a region with an extensive series of baseline measurements against which the effects of El Niño can be compared.  We will quantify the effects of El Niño on key rate processes that control the structure of the pelagic food web and control rates of elemental cycling.  The processes measured will include primary and secondary production, grazing, dissolved iron effects on phytoplankton growth, carbon and nitrogen recycling, and elemental export in both particulate and dissolved forms.  The measurement approach entails a Lagrangian (water parcel-tracking) study of a series of discrete water parcels that represent different subregions: the nearshore coastal upwelling region, the offshore wind-stress curl upwelling domain, the low salinity core flow of the California Current proper, and more stratified ocean conditions offshore. Measurements will be done by in situ incubations at multiple light depths, by simulated in situ incubations aboard ship, and by vertically stratified sampling in each discrete water parcel. These measurements will facilitate the development of quantitative forecast models that can be used to project ocean responses to future El Niños and perhaps other warming phenomena.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit  Our major goals were to quantify the effects of El Ni&ntilde;o on key rate processes that control the structure of the pelagic food web and rates of elemental cycling.  The processes measured included primary and secondary production, grazing, dissolved iron effects on phytoplankton growth, carbon and nitrogen recycling, and elemental export in both particulate and dissolved forms.

As El Ni&ntilde;o 2015-16 followed major Pacific Warm Anomalies of 2014-15, the effects of both climate perturbations were analyzed.

Some of the processes underlying these changes include decreased availability of nutrients, changes in the rate of photosynthesis in relation to irradiance, and depressed mesozooplankton grazing rates.  However, the egg production rate of three species of planktonic copepods, a proxy for secondary production by zooplankton, was not significantly depressed during El Ni&ntilde;o.  Similarly, bacterial secondary production was not significantly altered during our El Ni&ntilde;o cruise, but was depressed in the preceding Warm Anomaly conditions, probably due to limitation by available carbon substrates.  Total zooplankton  carbon biomass was relatively unaffected by El Ni&ntilde;o, but this masks highly significant changes in community composition, especially of the species composition of euphausiids (krill).  Phytoplankton community changes were modest, and confined to slightly increased abundances of chlorophytes, prasinophytes,  and Synechococcus.  Iron limitation was not a major factor structuring the phytoplankton community in nearshore regions during the cruise, although a small but significant reponse to iron addition in deckboard incubations was detected in transitional waters somewhat further offshore.

These results suggest that the CCE-LTER space-for-time substitution &ndash; i.e., using spatial variability as a proxy for how the ecosystem will change over time &ndash; is a viable approach, even during El Ni&ntilde;o perturbations.  This finding makes it feasible to build ocean ecosystem models forecasting the effects of future El Ni&ntilde;os.     Broader Impacts   CCE-LTER led a national workshop on Forecasting ENSO Impacts on Marine Ecosystems of the US West Coast at Scripps.  A series of articles resulting from this workshop was published in the CLIVAR/OCB Newsletter "Variations" in Feb. 2017.  The workshop led to a US CLIVAR Webinar on "Forecasting ENSO Impacts in the California Current System."  The workshop also stimulated a plan to develop a Research Coordination Network devoted to Marine Ecosystem Forecasts (MECOFOR), including highlighting the effects of El Ni&ntilde;o.  Art Miller was active in numerous outreach events associated with discussing climate change impacts with the general public.  REU students participated in summer research internships.  Our Education, Outreach, and Capacity Building (EOCB) team created several activities.  These included Full Moon pier walks, background information and activities taken to six local middle schools, and a Teacher Professional Development Workshop where educators received training in science content and hands-on lessons designed to increase their understanding of El Ni&ntilde;o and its impacts on the California Current Ecosystem.  The CCE site was featured at Birch Aquarium?s SEA (Science! Exploration! Adventure!) Days event.  Six members of CCE participated in the Exploring Ocean STEM Careers Night at BAS.  An Explore-It Plankton station is now open daily to guest at BAS.   A new CCE investigator, Alexis Pasulka, initiated a coastal pier time series at California Polytechnic University, measuring temperature and chlorophyll, together with samples taken to characterize the nearshore phytoplankton community using molecular genetics.  Plankton photographs from the Stukel lab taken on the CCE El Ni&ntilde;o cruise have been widely disseminated and used as outreach tools in multiple settings.  A dance video was created depicting an imaginative day in the life of a marine biogeochemistry graduate student.  We developed a quantitative basis for formulating ecosystem models, to improve understanding and forecasting of future El Ninos and possibly ocean warming.  We have begun a collaboration with scientists at NCAR (the National Center for Atmospheric Research) to develop a numerical model of a composite El Ni&ntilde;o-ecosystem response in the California Current System.  El Ni&ntilde;o-related changes in key plankton species in the pelagic food web are likely to influence feeding and breeding success of a variety of fishes, marine mammals, and seabirds.
