<AbstractNarration>Ramsey theory is the study of finding order within seeming chaos.  The classic example of this is Ramsey's Theorem, which states that for any coloring of all pairs of natural numbers into two colors, there is an infinite set of numbers from which every pair has the same color.  Extensions of this theorem to more complex structures, rather than just pairs of numbers, have led to and continue to lead to breakthroughs in  mathematics.  The finding of exact copies of complex structures in which all small structures of some form behave simply is a means for sorting structural results in mathematics.  Topological Ramsey space theory unifies many of the important  theorems in the area into one general framework.  The interrelations between  in Ramsey theory, set theory, and Tukey order fuels progress in each of these areas.  The project aims to continue development of topological Ramsey space theory and its applications to mapping  exact structures in some fundamental topological spaces constructed from the natural numbers; to promote better understanding of the axiomatic foundations of mathematics; and to find dividing lines between those complex structures, for instance networks, which have large copies in which all small structures behave simply and those which do not. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ramsey theory and set theory overlap both in problems of interest and in methods of proof.   This is seen in particular in the theory of topological Ramsey spaces, classic examples of which include the Ellentuck space, the Carlson-Simpson space of equivalence relations, and the Milliken space of infinite block sequences.  Tukey reduction between partial orderings is a means for classifying partial orderings when isomorphism is too fine a notion to be useful.   The Tukey structure of ultrafilters on the natural numbers is exactly  the structure of the neighborhood bases in the Stone-Cech compactification of the natural numbers.  The project's  goals are to continue developing topological Ramsey space theory and its connections with set theory and Tukey structure, with applications to ultrahomogeneous relational structures and analysis.  The aims of the project are several-fold but all interrelated.  These include mapping the exact Tukey structure of ultrafilters on the natural numbers, and on Boolean algebras in general, and proving new pigeonhole principles relevant to the ultrafilters.  In forcing theory, the project aims to streamline some areas of forcing by characterizing those partial orderings which are forcing equivalent to a topological Ramsey space, one particular focus being on creature forcings, again involving new pigeonhole principles.  Another line of work is Ramsey theory at large cardinals, extending classical Ramsey theorems on countable structures to the uncountable.  Finally, the project aims to solve problems regarding Ramsey theory on ultrahomogeneous relational structures, and to construct new types of Banach spaces via topological Ramsey space theory.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Ramsey theory is the study of finding order within seeming chaos.   The classic example of this is Ramsey's Theorem, which states that for  any coloring of all pairs of natural numbers into two colors, there is  an infinite set of numbers from which every pair has the same color.    Extensions of this theorem to more complex structures, rather than just  pairs of numbers, have led to and continue to lead to breakthroughs in   mathematics.  The finding of exact copies of complex structures in which  all small structures of some form behave simply is a means for sorting  structural results in mathematics. The outcomes of the project are roughly in three areas.    The first is in big Ramsey degrees.  Dobrinen answered a long-standing open problem showing that the infinite homogeneous triangle-free graph, also called the triangle-free Henson graph, has finite big Ramsey degrees.  This graph is the triangle-free version of the infinite random graph.  An infinite structure S is said to have finite big Ramsey degrees if the following holds: Given a finite substructure F of S, there is a positive integer T(F) such that upon coloring all copies of F in S into finitely many colors, there is an isomorphic subcopy S' inside S such that the copies of F in S' take at most T(F) many colors.  The quest to discover which infinite structures have finite big Ramsey degrees has been of interest for many decades, but has found renewed momentum since the 2005 paper of Kechris, Pestov, and Todorcevic.  However, a large obstacle was how to handle forbidden substructures of size three or more.  After developing techniques to handle the triangle-free Henson graph, Dobrinen proved a second and more general result: For any k  greater than two, the k-clique-free Henson graph has finite big Ramsey  degrees.  The techniques developed by Dobrinen opened up avenues to explore more general structures with some forbidden substructures, and this is currently being investigated by a growing cohort of researchers.    Topological Ramsey space theory moves from coloring finite objects to coloring infinite objects.  The members of a topological Ramsey space are themselves infinite sequences, so a coloring of the points in the space is essentially a coloring of an infinite set.  A topological space is a Ramsey space if given any definable partition of the space into finitely many pieces, there is a point in the space such that all points determined by that point (think subsequences of the sequence) are in the same piece of the partition.  With Hathaway, we extended a seminal result of Henle, Mathias, and Woodin (1970) to many classes of topological Ramsey spaces, showing that as long as an ultrafilter is forced by a well-behaved topological Ramsey space, it adds no new sets of ordinals over the Solovay model.  This provides many models of ZF plus at least one ultrafilter which preserve many properties of the Solovay model.  With Arias, Giron-Garnica, and Mijares, we constructed new classes of Banach spaces using barriers on high dimensional Ellentuck spaces.  These form a hiearchy of natural Banach spaces which project to l_p spaces.  This work has been central in PhD theses for two students at the University of Denver.  In another line of work, with PhD student Navarro-Flores we developed general methods for calculating Ramsey degrees of ultrafilters  satisfying weak partition relations, utilizing the fact that such ultrafilters are constructed using topological Ramsey spaces.   This provided new methods and answers to older questions about the properties of these ultrafilters. With Wang, we utilized topological Ramsey space theory to find exact big Ramsey degrees in uncountable universal limit structures.  The third line of results regards Ramsey theory for infinite trees.  The celebrated theorem of Halpern and L&auml;uchli has found many applications in big Ramsey degrees and has also been studied in its own right.  Shelah showed the consistency of Halpern-L&auml;uchli at large cardinals.  With Hathaway, we lowered the upper bound on the consistency strength at measurables, and found conditions under which the Halpern-L&auml;uchli theorem at an inaccessible is preserved under forcing.      The broader impacts of this project include supporting the work of one of Dobrinen's graduate students and two postdoctoral visiting scholars. It provided the starting point for work in at least four other PhD theses (not Dobrinen's students).  Work in this project was incorporated into graduate courses, and discussions with undergraduates.  The work has been widely disseminated at national and international conferences.  Dobrinen has been actively supporting the careers of minoritized mathematicians.  This includes  work with the AWM student chapter and leading a mentoring group for female graduate students in mathematics at the University of Denver.
