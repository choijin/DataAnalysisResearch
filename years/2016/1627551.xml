<AbstractNarration>What happens when internationally heralded policy approaches to problems conceived as 'global' problems with 'global' solutions are launched at the national and local levels?  How do international law and global governance practices play out through particular practices, institutions, and different levels of government?  Do hybrid processes emerge when global regulations are inserted into already functioning and yet functionally different systems?  As a governing consensus takes shape around the world in particular policy areas, this project asks how policies that follow this consensus impact local places and marginalized people, and how, in turn, various actors in these places respond.  It does so by examining global regulations seeking to sustainably manage electronic waste.  E-waste has attracted international attention for the rapidly growing quantities of electronic devices -- from computers and cell phones to washing machines -- reaching their end-of-life across the world, and their management in informal or 'backyard' recycling processes in developing countries. Since e-waste has been broadly conceived as a global problem, with regulation focusing on preventing the hazardous processes used by informal recyclers, this research undertakes a significant re-examination of e-waste as embedded in wider reuse and repair industries.  The project seeks to explain how two systems -- that of the established unregulated industry and a new government-authorized corporate sector -- co-exist and potentially even reinforce each other, and how we understand regulation when its implementation plays out in unpredictable and potentially contradictory ways. In addition to advancing theory on the complex relationship between global governance, local practice, and informality, the findings have policy relevance for regulatory interventions that target the informal sector in the Global South.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project explores the above questions by examining how e-waste regulation is produced and implemented in India through 17 months of research on used, repair and scrap electronics markets in the National Capital Region of India, which includes Delhi and its environs. Using primarily ethnographic methodologies, this research examines the evolution of a hybrid e-waste management system in India produced by adaptations to the new regulations and their uncomfortable fit with pre-existing informal industries. Semi-structured interviews are conducted with a wide range of participants in Delhi's used electronics markets, including small-scale scrap collectors, recyclers, IT maintenance experts and international electronics traders, as well as interviews with policy makers and government officials.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Electronic waste has drawn international attention for the rapidly growing quantities of electronic devices reaching their end-of-life across the world and their management in informal recycling processes in countries like India. Globally prevalent environmental legislation and regulations seeking to sustainably manage e-waste have focused on preventing the hazardous processes in informal recycling, and India?s new regulations on e-waste follow this policy model by seeking to dismantle India?s well-established informal used electronics infrastructure. Contrary to the regulatory emphasis on the management of electronic ?waste?, this research argues that e-waste regularly returns back into commodity circuits through widespread processes of reuse, repair and remanufacturing across India. Tracing the movements of these supposed waste products back into secondary use industries, we situate e-waste in India as operating predominately within economies of reuse and repair, rather than waste and recycling. Instead of managing waste, we demonstrate how India?s broad reuse industries are production-based, maintaining and making new things out of a diversity of new and used materials. This research offers an ethnographically-based study of local e-waste economies and e-waste governance that illustrates India?s informal sector?s provision of important environmental and social services through its deferment of waste.  To study e-waste as both a global environmental problem and a local urban industry, co-PI Corwin used multiple qualitative methods with a range of actors involved in the policy and practice of used electronics maintenance, reuse, repair and recycling. While Delhi was the geographic center of this research, co-PI Corwin also conducted research in Bangalore and the North Indian city of Moradabad. In Bangalore, Corwin interviewed formal recyclers and visited formal recycling facilities, and in Moradabad, known as India?s primary location for informal e-waste recycling, Corwin visited underground informal recycling sites and discussed informal recycling with local officials and recyclers.  This research reveals the importance of environmental policy that is broad spectrum, and illuminates waste beyond attempts to ?manage? it, instead demonstrating its embeddedness in matters of consumerism, informal sector livelihoods and urban ecology. Our research has resulted in an article written by Corwin and published in Environment and Planning A, entitled "?Nothing is useless in nature?: Delhi?s repair economies and value-creation in an electronics ?waste? sector"  and a co-written article by Gidwani and Corwin, "Governance of waste" in Economic and Political Weekly. It has also been presented at a number of geography and area studies conferences and incorporated into a geographical course taught by Corwin on global cities.
