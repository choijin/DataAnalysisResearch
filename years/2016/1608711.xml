<AbstractNarration>Non-technical Abstract&lt;br/&gt;With the support of the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program, this project provides new synthetic methods that can be predictably manipulated to yield materials with controllable composition and structure. This control allows the properties of materials to be enhanced for applications in solar energy conversion and catalysis. This expansion of the synthetic toolkit is achieved in this project by integrating new chemical methods with the aerosol technique ultrasonic spray synthesis, which provides a scalable route to solids. The principal investigator and her students develop these methods to achieve new materials for energy applications, with the goal being the elucidation of criteria for the synthesis and design of materials with the ability to use light efficiently to drive chemical reactions. Ultimately, this research forges links between disciplines that include nano/inorganic/solid-state chemistry, condensed matter physics, chemical engineering and materials science by distributing new knowledge through high-impact publications and presentations. This research also enhances scientific training through multidisciplinary research and outreach activities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Abstract&lt;br/&gt;Specifically, by spatially and temporally confining molten salt syntheses with aerosol droplets, crystal growth can be limited to the nanoscale. This project demonstrates that the supersaturation conditions achieved within the aerosol droplets can be manipulated to achieve nanocrystals with different shapes. This ability is being used to synthesize shape-defined metal oxynitride nanocrystals for photocatalytic applications by topotactic conversion of nanoscale templates prepared by aerosol-assisted molten salt synthesis. This ability is also being used to synthesize shape-controlled layered double hydroxide nanocatalysts by aerosol-assisted molten salt syntheses. This project is enabling ultrasonic spray synthesis to emerge as a general and continuous route to advanced nanomaterials and brings new perspective to both confined nanomaterial syntheses and molten salt syntheses.</AbstractNarration>
