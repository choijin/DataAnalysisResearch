<AbstractNarration>The Earth's mantle influences the movement of tectonic plates and volcanism on the surface.  One way to understand the composition and nature of the Earth's mantle is by studying the chemistry of basalts, which originate by volcanic eruptions of partially melting mantle rocks.  This study will establish the budget and distribution of volatile elements (hydrogen, carbon, fluorine, chlorine, sulfur) in volcanic basalts to better understand the composition of the Earth's interior.  Volatiles influence mantle melting, magma crystallization, magma migration and volcanic eruptions.  Their abundances and spatial distribution provide important constraints on models of mantle flow and temperature. Moreover, volatiles are key constituents of the Earth's atmosphere and oceans.  Establishing the cycles of volatiles between the Earth's interior and surface is of fundamental importance to understand the long-term evolution of our planet.  This project supports a graduate student and research scientist at Brown University. It promotes the collaboration with geochemists from eleven institutions representing six different countries: USA, Germany, United Kingdom, Argentina, South Korea and Japan, and utilizes several NSF-funded USA analytical facilities.  Communication of results will occur through: 1) peer-reviewed journals, presentations at conferences and invited university lectures, 2) hands-on science learning activities for local elementary and high school classes, and 3) outreach to the general audience through public lectures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Over the last 60 years of funded research, the Antarctic Peninsula and nearby ocean ridges have been extensively investigated providing information on the origin of the magmatism, and the composition, structure, temperature and evolution of the lithospheric and asthenospheric mantle. Diverse hypotheses have been proposed for the origin of the magmatism in the Antarctic Peninsula, from flux melting of the mantle wedge during devolatilization of the subducted Phoenix plate, to adiabatic decompression melting of a carbonated and hydrous asthenosphere, to melting of a volatile-rich metasomatized subcontinental lithospheric mantle. All proposed hypotheses invoke the role of volatiles. Surprisingly, data on the volatile contents of basalts and mantle from this region are non-existent. This is a significant omission from the geochemical data set, given the important role volatile elements play in the generation and composition of magmas and their sources. The focus of our research is to examine the regional variations in volatile contents (C, H, F, S, Cl) in geochemically well-characterized Pliocene-recent basalts from the Antarctic Peninsula and Phoenix ridge. Our goal is to establish the budget and distribution of volatiles in the mantle to understand 1) the processes responsible for the generation of chemically diverse basalts in close spatial and temporal proximity and 2) the nature (lithology, composition and temperature) of the heterogeneous mantle source beneath the Antarctic Peninsula and Phoenix ridge.</AbstractNarration>
