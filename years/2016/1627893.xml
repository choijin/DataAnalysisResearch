<AbstractNarration>This project examines the history of urban growth, legalization of urban squatters, and its effects on developing communities. The research will examine how different governments evaluated the issue of squatting and framed it to the public; it will identify for whom and why states legalized squatting; and it will assess the effects of legalization, including compliance and resistance.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research will be multi-method, including archival research, quantitative analysis of community characteristics and state responses, and qualitative interviews. The co-PI will remain on-site in two locations for several months to collect these data. The research helps re-theorize state-building, contributes to the literature on symbolic governance, and identifies the effects of extending urban citizenship under differing conditions.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This research supports a dissertation project examining the political development of urban clientelism in 20th century Latin America, focusing on the capital cities of Lima, Peru, Caracas, Venezuela, and (with additional support from the Social Science Research Council) Mexico City. Clientelism--an informal and hierarchical type of authority relations between well-resourced political elites and relatively-poor clients, often mediated by brokers--has been an important aspect of the politics of modern Latin America and has shaped the nature of citizenship in that region and beyond. Despite its substantive importance, however, until now it has not been studied comparatively and historically with an eye to explaining its origins, variants, extent, and limits.  Urban clientelism arose in 20th century Latin America and beyond due to the rapid and massive influx of rural inhabitants to major urban centers. Lacking economic means to purchase residences, the new urban poor requisitioned land and established vast self-built squatter settlements, especially in the periphery of capital cities. Urban brokers arose to mediate between the state and political parties, on the one hand, and the new urban poor, on the other. This research is the first to systematically compare varieties of clientelism and urban brokers? authority vis-&agrave;-vis the state and squatters.  In addition to drawing from the existing research on the three cases, this study is based on three kinds of original evidence: (1) petitions and letters written by squatters, settlement leaders, and urban brokers; (2) government reports and circulars about squatter settlements; and (3) press and other contemporaneous third-party sources.
