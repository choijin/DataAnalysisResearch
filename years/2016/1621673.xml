<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this project centers on bringing enhanced independence, productivity, and quality of life for hundreds of thousands of individuals in the US who suffer severe physical disability due to spinal cord injury or other debilitating neurodegenerative disorders, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.  Due to improvements in emergency medicine and increasing average age in the society, these individuals represent a growing population that is underserved by current assistive technologies (ATs). The ATs being relied upon to carry out basic tasks are still primitive, offer limited versatility, and fail to meet end-user needs. Meanwhile, computers and internet play ever-growing roles in everyday life and are regarded as equalizers that allow all individuals to have similar vocational, recreational, and educational opportunities. The Tongue Drive System (TDS) offers individuals with severe physical disabilities an intuitive and superior mechanism for accessing computer based resources ? wheelchairs, smartphones, computers, smart homes, etc.  TDS harnesses the power of the tongue, which often retains full capability in these individuals despite losses of other body functions, to drive human-computer interfaces.   TDS has the potential to revolutionize the current US AT market with an overall anticipated market size of $1B within its primary market segment. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project aims to establish a new architecture for a wireless and wearable tongue drive system (TDS) to address existing barriers to commercialization.  While functional, the current research-grade TDS prototype is based upon a sub-optimal architecture relying on multiple devices to process and deliver user commands, opening the door to reliability, performance, and safety issues.  The current system?s reliance on off-board processing, the commonly used 2.4 GHz band, and the use of multiple wireless links for command transmission result in a slow implementation that is sensitive to packet loss and interference.  In safety critical modes of operation, such as steering a powered wheelchair, these sources of risk and performance degradation are unacceptable.  The proposed research will consolidate key TDS functions within a standalone TDS headset that can interface with any target peripheral with a direct wireless link.  Hardware redesigns will include a powerful microcontroller to onboard sensor data acquisition and signal processing algorithms.  Dual radio chipsets will be incorporated to maintain interoperability with commercial devices using 2.4 GHz radios, while also supporting less utilized frequency bands for safety critical operations.  The result of this research will be a robust AT suitable for safely critical deployments.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This SBIR Phase-I award resulted in further development and enhancement of a novel assistive technology (AT) for improving the quality of life of people with severe physical disabilities, such as paralysis. It also helped resolving some of the barriers to commercialization of this technology, even though there is still more work to be done. We adopted the core technology, known as the Tongue Drive System (TDS) and created a new architecture for a wireless and wearable dual-band standalone TDS (sTDS), which is a new tongue-operated AT that allows harnessing the power of the human tongue, which often retains its full functionality even in individuals with severe physical disabilities. This is because, unlike hands and feet, the tongue has its direct hotline to the brain through a cranial nerve, which remains untouched even in the worst types of spinal cord injury, maintaining the voluntary tongue motion. Tongue is also one of the last parts of the body to be affected by many neurological diseases, such as ALS. At the same time, because a large area in the motor cortex is dedicated to the tongue, it can move very rapidly and precisely without requiring training or concentration. Moreover, unlike brain, the tongue is readily accessible without any invasive procedure or surgery. As a minimum viable product (MVP), our goal is to offer the sTDS as an intuitive and superior mechanism for accessing computers and smartphones. Users simply define up to 6 positions in the mouth for mouse cursor movements and mouse-clicks. Then by touching those spots with the tip of the tongue, they can move the cursor in a desired direction or click on icons. Later on, we intend offer a premium version of the sTDS for driving wheelchairs with voluntary tongue motion, as a substitute for joysticks.</p> <p>The TDS consists of a headset with 4 magnetic sensors extended on two arms to be positioned near the users&rsquo; cheeks. It also has a small magnetic tracer, the size of a lentil, attached near the tip of the tongue by tissue adhesives or implantation. When the tongue moves, the sensors measure the changes in the magnetic field around the mouth. The original TDS was dependent on a target device to process the raw data from magnetic sensors to detect the tongue position, which ultimately determines the user&rsquo;s intended command. In terms of intellectual merit, a key achievement in this SBIR-I was consolidating key processing capability within the sTDS headset by redesigning its hardware architecture and incorporating an advanced yet low power microcontroller unit (MCU) in a way that it can detect tongue commands onboard via pattern recognition, and directly interface with any target peripheral device using the widely accepted human interface device (HID) protocol. Another important achievement was developing efficient pattern recognition algorithm that can fit within the limited resources of the low power MCU and detect the tongue commands in real time.</p> <p>To improve reliability of the sTDS, particularly in noisy environments, a dual-band communication mechanism is implemented. We have added an auxiliary 433 MHz radio to the default 2.4 GHz Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) link that is built in the MCU. The auxiliary radio allows the sTDS to switch from 2.4 GHz to the less-congested 433 MHz band when performing safety-critical tasks, such as driving a wheelchair in response to potential interference and loss of connectivity. For dual-band wireless operation, we have developed an automatic context switching that allows changing the communication band between the headset and target device based upon changes in the status events in the MCU. By default, the headset enables radio communications over the 433 MHz radio, which is setup more quickly while trying to establish the lower power BLE link. When the BLE connection is established, the auxiliary radio is disabled to save power. When a disconnection is detected on either side of the wireless link, the auxiliary radio is reactivated to maintain the wireless connectivity between sTDS headset and the target device.</p> <p>In terms of broader impacts, we have continued our efforts in further advancing the sTDS technology, and achieved a more robust, reliable, and agile system than the adopted research-grade TDS. We have created a standalone, dual-band wireless, and wearable headset with an advanced architecture and efficient embedded signal processing firmware that can be a blueprint for future revisions of the TDS technology or other similar wearable systems. More importantly, we have paved the way for the sTDS MVP, which is expected to offer individuals with severe physical disabilities an intuitive and reliable mechanism for accessing computers and smartphones. The R&amp;D team have learned a great deal about embedded system design and programming as well as advanced real time signal processing. They have also learned about disabilities, medical devices, assistive technologies, and their societal and business aspects.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 08/01/2018<br>      Modified by: Seyedabdollah&nbsp;Mirbozorgi</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1621673/1621673_10434039_1533165607622_sTDS_Headset_Block_Diagram--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1621673/1621673_10434039_1533165607622_sTDS_Headset_Block_Diagram--rgov-800width.jpg" title="sTDS Block Diagram"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1621673/1621673_10434039_1533165607622_sTDS_Headset_Block_Diagram--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="sTDS Block Diagram"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Simplified block diagram of the standalone dual-band Tongue Drive System (sTDS).</div> <div class="imageCredit">Seyedabdollah Mirbozorgi</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Seyedabdollah&nbsp;Mirbozorgi</div> <div class="imageTitle">sTDS Block Diagram</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1621673/1621673_10434039_1533169911599_sTDS_Headset_Prototype--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1621673/1621673_10434039_1533169911599_sTDS_Headset_Prototype--rgov-800width.jpg" title="sTDS headset prototype"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1621673/1621673_10434039_1533169911599_sTDS_Headset_Prototype--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="sTDS headset prototype"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">The dual-band wireless standalone Tongue Drive System (sTDS).</div> <div class="imageCredit">Seyedabdollah Mirbozorgi</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Seyedabdollah&nbsp;Mirbozorgi</div> <div class="imageTitle">sTDS headset prototype</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
