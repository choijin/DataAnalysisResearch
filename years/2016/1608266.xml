<AbstractNarration>There is a growing awareness that the microbial populations that encompass them are an integral component of the life history of plants and the functioning of plant ecosystems. Understanding of how plants and their immune systems interact with pathogens and symbionts continues to rapidly advance. At the same time new understanding is emerging of how plants interact with broader populations of environmental microbes, especially resulting from the application of genomics, bioinformatics and systems biology. These new levels of understanding are leading to safer, more effective and more sustainable ways to manage plant pests and diseases in crops and natural ecosystems. The latest research findings on these topics will be presented and discussed at the 17th International Congress on Plant-Microbe Interactions in Portland, Oregon from July 17 through July 21, 2016. This grant will provide partial financial support for 20 promising U.S. students and postdoctoral scholars to attend this conference. These young scientists will participate in a small meeting workshop designed to enrich their engagement and participation. Established scientists and the supported participants will work in teams throughout the meeting to critically discuss the research findings. In addition, the students and postdocs will be contribute to the dissemination of the conference findings by releasing daily meeting highlights via social networking and publishing a final congress report. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Throughout its history since 1982, the International Congress on Plant-Microbe Interactions has been a unique and comprehensive congress covering both plant-pathogenic and plant-beneficial microbial interactions in both model and major crop plants, which distinguishes it from more specialized meetings. The 17th IC-MPMI will convene in Portland, Oregon from July 17 through July 21, 2016. In this meeting, the plenary and concurrent sessions will highlight the latest advances in fundamental research as well as translational studies critical for advancements in agricultural science. Highlights include a strong focus on the plant microbiome and multiway associations, a renewed focus on symbiotic associations, and new sessions on RNA-mediated interactions, population genomics, modeling and systems biology, and problems in the developing world. As with previous IC-MPMI congresses, the broader impacts of the 2016 congress will include the sharing of emerging data, the establishment and strengthening of international collaborations, and development of innovative strategies and technology to improve plant health, productivity and security. The participation of US scientists, especially graduate students and postdoctoral scholars, will be critical for the success and vitality of this congress. The workshop activities planned for the participants supported by this grant will enhance participation and learning by these young scientists, help them build their professional networks and communication skills, as well as inform others who are not able to attend this meeting.</AbstractNarration>
