<AbstractNarration>Neutrino physics probes a wide range of unknown physics, including the nature of neutrino oscillations and the ordering of the neutrino masses. The T2K (Tokai to Kamioka) experiment in Japan is making precision measurements of important experimental values related to neutrino physics. As T2K tries to improve the precision of their findings, better modeling methods must be included in order to keep pace with experimental measurements. This award support research at the University of Tokyo with Dr. Yoshinari Hayato to improve the simulation software, NEUT, used by T2K. Dr. Hayato is the maintainer of the simulation software used by T2K, providing direct access to the person who best understands how the software should work.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The current model for deep inelastic scattering (DIS) used in the simulation software for T2K is likely to be outdated and needs to be updated. The PI will compare the DIS model in NEUT against T2K data and a large variety of other data available, so that an understanding can be developed as to where the model excels and where it begins to break down. By understanding where the model begins to break down, work can be done either to improve the current model itself, or create a new model that correctly represents the world's data in the region(s) where the model breaks down. While not the dominant interaction process, DIS is still a key interaction mechanism between neutrinos and nucleons at the T2K experiment. Because of its importance, finding a model that accurately portrays the process, both in predicting outcomes and fitting existing data, is crucial. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award under the East Asia and Pacific Summer Institutes program supports summer research by a U.S. graduate student and is jointly funded by NSF and the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science.</AbstractNarration>

The T2K (Tokai to Kamioka) experiment in Japan is making precision measurements of important experimental values related to neutrino physics. As T2K tries to improve the precision of their findings, better modeling methods must be included in order to keep pace with experimental measurements. I am working to improve the simulation software, NEUT, used by T2K.  NEUT makes use of a number of supplemental software programs as a part of its simulation routine. The software currently used by NEUT to simulate high energy events in T2K is outdated. The focus of my work was to update NEUT, such that it is compatible with a newer version of the high energy simulation program. This included adapting NEUT to account for changes between versions of the supplemental code and comparing the NEUT simulation using the different programs.  Following a brief introduction to NEUT, I began looking into how the ancillary software currently used by NEUT differs from the newer software version. Throughout the rest of the summer, I worked on adapting NEUT, such that the new version works within the NEUT framework. Initially, I worked to understand how the improved supplemental code worked in a standalone fashion. Once I had a better understanding of how the software worked on its own, I successfully integrated the improved software into NEUT. However, due to some limitations of the new software, several issues have arisen.  Because of these issues, further work has been placed on hold while the effects of these issues can be discussed and dealt with appropriately. At this time, the two leading options are to either continue using the current version or to implement the new version in a different manner than a simple replacement of the current software.
