<AbstractNarration>Community colleges play a vital role in educating undergraduate students. These higher education institutions educate nearly half of the nation's undergraduate students, particularly among low-income and first-generation students and students of color. Because of the rich diversity that currently exists at these institutional-types, there are immense opportunities to broadening participation throughout the engineering enterprise. To this end, the investigator outlines a joint collaboration with five community colleges, three school systems, two college career academies, and a state partner in Georgia - referred as the Georgia Science, Technology, and Engineering Partnerships for Success (GA STEPS) - to provide dual enrollment classes in career pathways for Georgia high school students in grades 9-12, thereby allowing secondary students to earn college credit. The Georgia STEPS program proposes to leverage mechatronics engineering as a means for broadening engineering participation for community colleges and underserved, underrepresented populations in 48 rural counties to increase engineering awareness, skills training and college and career readiness. The project builds on an existing collaboration that has developed successful engineering opportunities at the community college level, by including a wider regional network of rural Georgia counties and high schools. Further, this project has immense potential to transform engineering education and course-taking for students at the secondary and postsecondary level in Georgia and beyond. It has potential great potential to be scaled and replicated at other placed around the United States.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project's intellectual merit and innovation is that it leverages a successful mechatronics engineering curriculum that supports engineering skills that support local industry as well as supporting innovations in the mechatronics field. The project includes a collective impact framework, involving various stakeholders and aligning quantitative and qualitative metrics and measurable objectives. The broader impacts of this project is that it increases the engineering knowledge and skills of underserved, underrepresented students that are enrolled in community colleges. Also, the impact to rural communities in Georgia support the fact that this project would meet broader groups that can be positively impacted by this type of collaborative. The ability to provide different parts of this engineering discipline across broad audiences in community colleges - that support underrepresented groups understanding of mechatronics engineering - is broadly useful to the field of engineering.</AbstractNarration>

The lead partner and fiscal agent, Wiregrass Georgia Technical College (WGTC) made significant progress toward achieving the proposed goals and objectives. While some difficulties were encountered in developing a collective impact approach across the technical college system, WGTC made significant progress in its 11-county service delivery area, increasing high school and college student enrollment, forging industry partnerships and bringing attention to the need for trained instructors and middle-skills workforce.  During the two-year grant, student enrollment in STEM classes at the five colleges participating in the grant increased from 357 students to 642 students. The number of underrepresented students (females and Hispanics) enrolled also increased in 2018 compared to the baseline year of 2015.  Thirty high school students from five school systems, a private school and home schooling attended a five-day Summer STEM camp at WGTC. The camp exposed the students to career and college opportunities while building their skills.  WGTC secured more than $1.8 million from federal, state, local and industry during the two-year grant. The money was used to support and expand middle-skills STEM programs, provide new equipment, professional coaching for instructors, professional learning, and the expansion of the Launch Pilot to three additional high schools.   More than 30 high school instructors received weeklong training on how to use WGTC?s Mechatronics curriculum. The result was an increase in qualified and up-to-date Mechatronics instructors able to produce qualified middle-skills workers for industry. The instructors were provided state-of-the-art professional learning and coaching, which helped to increase their instructional effectiveness and ensure their classroom activities were articulated with K-12 curriculum standards and industry expectations.
