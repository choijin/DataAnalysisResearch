<AbstractNarration>The Summer Intern Program at the College of William and Mary's Virginia Institute of Marine Science (VIMS) introduces undergraduate students to the complex environmental issues facing coastal ocean and estuarine systems globally. With funding from the Division of Ocean Sciences, VIMS will host twelve students each summer for a ten-week internship. Student participants are recruited from throughout the United States and include individuals from underrepresented groups and those from colleges and universities where research experiences are limited. Students who are accepted into the program contribute to the advancement of scientific knowledge through independent research projects and participation in ongoing long-term research. They receive a stipend, housing and travel expenses to attend the program. In addition to conducting independent research, students receive training in professional skills such as communication, scientific writing, public presentations and scientific ethics. Through this intern program, a total of thirty-six U.S. students will have opportunities to participate in coastal ocean science research and career development activities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Within the coastal ocean science theme, internships are available in the areas of marine ecology, biological and chemical oceanography, biogeochemistry, geological and physical oceanography, and marine policy. The coastal ocean is an accessible natural laboratory, faces significant environmental pressures and is of high socio-economic and aesthetic value to the nation. A high percentage of the students who have participated in prior REU programs at VIMS are enrolled in graduate school, have obtained advanced degrees in science and/or continue to work in a scientific or technical career. Thus, the program provides an important contribution to the nation's scientific and technical workforce.</AbstractNarration>

The major objectives of the intern program conducted from 2017 to 2019 were to: (1) provide meaningful research and training opportunities for undergraduates in coastal marine science and (2) increase the participation of under-represented groups in the ocean sciences. Internships were available in the areas of marine ecology, biological and chemical oceanography, biogeochemistry, geological and physical oceanography, and marine policy. Student participants were recruited from throughout the United States and included individuals from under-represented groups, women, and those from non-research colleges and universities.

Through this intern program, we provided hands-on opportunities in coastal ocean science research training and STEM education for talented undergraduate students. Interns accepted into the program contributed to the advancement of scientific knowledge through independent research and participation in ongoing long-term faculty research projects, including 32 conference presentations with REU intern co-authors with published abstracts (2011-2019), another 10 conference presentations without published abstracts or with REU interns acknowledged, and 23 publications in peer-reviewed journals with REU intern co-authors (2011-2019).

NSF funds supported 218 interns for the period 1997-2015, with 36% from ethnic or racial groups that are traditionally under-represented (URMs) in marine science (African American, Hispanic or Latino, American Indian, Native Pacific Islander, Asian). This helps to ensure a more diverse community of scientists and a well-prepared workforce in the future. Our successes with students from all groups, including those that are traditionally under-represented in the sciences, also have societal benefits. These students will likely be leaders in science, academia and other professional careers in the future. The majority of REU alumni (69%) obtained degrees in Ocean Science, Geoscience, and STEM fields, or were in graduate degree programs in those fields at the time of our alumni survey. Relative to all students, the careers of alumni from under-represented groups involved a higher proportion of fields such as medicine, law, or alternative fields (Figure 1). Many of the alumni reported that they were planning to apply for graduate school admission in the near future. Some of our alumni who participated during the program?s early years (1989-1996) have completed PhDs in marine or earth science, advanced to research or teaching positions, and are currently active members of the ocean science community.&nbsp;No matter what career path they have chosen, participation in our REU program has better prepared our alumni to understand the science and technology issues that increasingly permeate all aspects of our lives.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 08/27/2020<br>      Modified by: Rochelle&nbsp;D&nbsp;Seitz</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Image         </div> <div class="galControls onePhoto" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation onePhoto" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1659656/1659656_10478626_1598542594061_Figure1-CareerTrajectories1024_1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1659656/1659656_10478626_1598542594061_Figure1-CareerTrajectories1024_1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 1"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1659656/1659656_10478626_1598542594061_Figure1-CareerTrajectories1024_1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 1"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">VIMS REU Alumni Career Trajectories. 173 interns reporting(36%URM) successful career/edu trajectories.
