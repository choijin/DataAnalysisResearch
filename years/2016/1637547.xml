<AbstractNarration>This project will support of the Doctoral Student Consortium at the Twenty Fourth International Conference on Case-Based Reasoning (ICCBR'16) to be held at Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta, USA, from October 31st through November 2nd 2016. ICCBR is an international conference series covering all aspects of research on case-based reasoning, such as memory, problem solving, decision making, learning, recommender systems, analogy, creativity, and applications in industry, business and government. Research on case-based reasoning often is interdisciplinary, with connections to artificial intelligence and intelligent agents, cognitive science and cognitive computing, human-centered computing and interactive systems, and human learning as well as machine learning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With the resurgence of cognitive systems cognitive computing as evidenced by IBM's Watson system and Apple?s Siri program among many others, the ICCBR community is growing once again. The ICCBR conferences attempt to foster research carried out in the original spirit of AI, which aimed to design and implement computer programs that exhibited the breadth, generality, and flexibility often observed in human intelligence on one hand, and use the design of AI systems for insights into human intelligence on the other. We expect ICCBR'16 to significantly increase our understanding of case-based cognitive systems, and add momentum to the development of new theories, techniques and tools for case-based cognitive computing. The conference sessions and workshops will help develop human research capital by enabling interactions between senior and junior researchers and catalyzing new collaborations. The doctoral consortium will increase the exposure and visibility of young graduate student researchers in these areas, and train them by providing early input and feedback in the field in an interactive and constructive environment.</AbstractNarration>
