<AbstractNarration>Sweet potato, with its carbohydrate- and vitamin-rich storage roots, is a vital source of nutrition for people in many countries. Current efforts to improve crop yield in sweet potato are focused on a small number of breeding lines. Wild relatives of crop species can also be an important source of genetic material for crop improvement, but the evolutionary relationships between sweet potato and its wild relatives are currently unknown. This project will use genomic data to reconstruct evolutionary relationships between sweet potato and its wild relatives, and shed light on the genetic changes that have contributed to the evolution of the carbohydrate- and vitamin-rich storage root in cultivated sweet potato. Root characteristics and genetic variation are poorly known for wild relatives of sweet potato and this project will provide a greatly improved understanding of the potential of wild relatives for sweet potato breeding programs. The project will train one graduate student and several undergraduates in laboratory techniques.  Results from the research will be integrated within new teaching materials for middle school, high school and undergraduate students that emphasize the domestication process and importance of diversity in crop breeding programs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will characterize the timing of whole genome duplication events within sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas) and closely related species, and test whether these events are linked to the evolution of storage roots in the group. Numerous studies have implicated polyploidy as a major driving factor in the evolution of complex phenotypes; however, few studies have linked whole genome duplication events with the evolution of novel root traits. This study will apply modern phylogenomic methods to estimate relationships within the Ipomoea batatas complex and reconstruct the history of polyploidization and storage root development in the group. Genetic markers developed through gene capture and Restriction site Associated DNA Sequencing (RADSeq) technologies through this research will be useful for germplasm stock centers characterizing and preserving diversity within sweet potato and across the Ipomoea batatas complex. These findings will advance sweet potato breeding efforts, including recent work to develop productive and robust cultivars for Africa.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Beyond its importance as a staple for our Thanksgiving Day feasts, sweetpotato is a major source of calories and nutrition around the world.  With six copies of most if not all genes in its hexaploid genome, sweetpotato has been challenge for those attempting to use genetic markers to speed breeding efforts.  Our research program combined careful measurements of root development, gene expression analyses and evolutionary analyses of genetic diversity in sweetpotato and its wild relatives to shed light on the origin of hexaploid sweetpotato and the genes contributing to the formation of massive storage roots.  Three key findings are relevant for fundamental understanding of polyploid evolution and storage root evolution, as well as sweetpotato breeding: 1) storage root formation is inferred to have evolved repeatedly among sweetpotato and morning glory ancestors, and lost in association with shifts from a perennial to annual life histories; 2) the origin of hexaploid sweetpotato involved hybridization between at least two genetically divergent populations or species; 3) there is extensive variation among sweetpotato accessions in which genes have retained ancestral variation or become fixed for one of its parental gene copies.  This last point is particularly important for sweetpotato breeders.  Crosses between distinct sweetpotato accessions is predicted to produce very complex populations of offspring exhibiting varying degrees of genotypic diversity across protein coding and regulatory genes.  Measuring among-copy diversity for each gene will enable future efforts to understand the genetic basis of horticulturally important traits including storage root size, time to maturity and disease resistance.
