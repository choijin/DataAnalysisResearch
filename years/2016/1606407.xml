<AbstractNarration>This award is made as part of the FY 2016 Mathematical Sciences Postdoctoral Research Fellowships Program. Each of the fellowships supports a research and training project at a host institution in the mathematical sciences, including applications to other disciplines, under the mentorship of a sponsoring scientist. The title of the project for this fellowship to Liam T. Solus is "Combinatorial Convex Geometry of Real-Rooted Polynomials." The host institution for the fellowship is the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockhom, Sweden, and the sponsoring scientist is Petter Branden.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This award was supported with funding from the Office of International Science &amp; Engineering.</AbstractNarration>

To do so,  we need to  understand how to relate such discrete objects to a  geometric object and  what kind of information each object encodes about  the other.  This  information is typically encoded using sequences of  nonnegative integers  p0, p1, p2,..., pd,  which we normally represent with a polynomial  p(x) = p0+ p1x + p2x2 +...+ pdxd.   We can call the polynomial p(x) real-rooted if, when we draw its graph,   it crosses the number line d times.  It turns out that if the polynomial   is real-rooted, it can provide us with useful information about the   sequence of numbers p0, p1, p2,..., pd encoding information about our geometric object.
