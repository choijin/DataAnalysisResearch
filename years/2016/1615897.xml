<AbstractNarration>Interstellar space, or the space between the stars, contains extremely cold and tenuous clouds of gas seeded with tiny dust grains.  Within the densest interstellar clouds, dust grains are coated with ice, providing sites for chemical reactions of simple atoms and molecules.  Reactions on dust grains and ices can produce increasingly complex molecules, some of which are the building blocks of life.  This research project will use advanced experimental and theoretical tools from a variety of scientific fields to study how atoms and molecules react on dust grains and ices under harsh conditions similar to those in space.  Results from the study will help astronomers understand how processes on dust grains and ices can lead to the rich chemistry of space.  The project will also train students in an interdisciplinary field at the forefront of astrophysical research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will combine proven experimental techniques (atomic and molecular beams, quadrupole mass spectrometry, and infrared spectroscopy) with new techniques (time-resolved reactive scattering) to obtain quantitative information on adsorption, diffusion, reaction, and desorption of atoms and molecules that are commonly found in the interstellar gas.  Newly developed theoretical methods will be used to derive adsorption (sticking) and diffusion coefficients of the atoms and molecules from the experimental data.  The data and derived parameters will be used in simulations of interstellar environments.  The PI and his team will: (1) measure diffusion coefficients of atoms and molecules on surfaces of dust grain analogs and ices; (2) measure sticking coefficients of atoms and molecules on surfaces of various grain analogs; (3) perform theoretical analyses of the experimental data; (4) use the new diffusion coefficients in chemical models that will help interpret observations of interstellar clouds; and (5) provide the data in a format that can be used by astronomers studying the chemical evolution of the interstellar gas.  The project will also support an undergraduate student, a graduate student, and a postdoctoral scholar at Syracuse University.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>One of the most exciting discoveries in exploring interstellar space, the space between stars, is the presence of complex organic molecules (COMs), some of which are precursors to the building blocks of life. Some of these molecules are made in ices coating submicron dust grains ("stardust"). These ice mantles consist mostly of water with significant abundance of CO, CO<sub>2</sub>, NH<sub>3</sub>, CH<sub>4</sub>, CH<sub>3</sub>OH and other molecules. While astronomical observations have shown that these COMs&nbsp;are present in space, and theoretical work has shown that many of these COMs can be formed only in ices, there is no consensus how these molecules formed. More broadly, we should ask: what are the other biogenic molecules that can form in the conditions of interstellar space?. Our research focused on an important step in molecule formation in ices: the process of diffusion, in the ice, of reactants that eventually come together and make a new molecule. Because of the extreme conditions of interstellar environments (very low density and temperature), little is known about diffusion of atoms and molecules in ices in these conditions. We came up with a technique to measure the diffusion of molecules in ices in interstellar conditions. It consists of measuring the changes of specific infrared features of amorphous solid water (ASW) - a good proxy of interstellar ice - as molecules diffuse in its pores. Our quantitative measurements of the activation energy of diffusion of key molecules, such as CO, N<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>2</sub>, CH<sub>4</sub>, and NH<sub>3</sub>, are key input parameters in computer simulations of the chemical evolution of ice in interstellar environments.</p> <p>Another aspect of our research, and a necessary complement to the study of diffusion of molecules in ices, is the investigation of the properties of ices and their kinetic evolution due, for example, to thermal input. We studied infrared signatures of ices of CO<sub>2</sub>, CO, NH<sub>3</sub>, and CH<sub>4</sub> (all major components of interstellar ices) in order to understand their properties and their changes due to thermal input. These data can be used by astronomers and theoreticians to relate astronomical observations to specific conditions of ices. For example, in a collaboration with astronomers we showed how CO<sub>2</sub> dispersed in ASW segregates as the temperature is raised. The laboratory results were then used to fit infrared CO<sub>2</sub> signatures towards different young stellar objects (or stars in the process of formation). This finding can be used to evaluate whether ices in certain environments have experienced a thermal spike in their past. In turn, a thermal spike could have facilitated diffusion of guest molecules, leading to possible reactions and eventual ejection in space, where are more easily detected.</p> <p>Connected to this point, we implemented a new direct technique to probe chemical desorption. Chemical desorption is the process of ejection of molecules from the surface due to the release of energy in a reaction. In an experiment using a pulsed atomic beam of hydrogen, the product of reaction (O<sub>2</sub>) between an impinging H atom and a layer of ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) layered on a substrate was detected in real time as coming off from the surface. We established not only that the energy gained in the reaction H+O<sub>3</sub> --&gt; O<sub>2</sub>+OH is sufficient to eject O<sub>2</sub>, but we also obtained&nbsp; the distribution in time of O<sub>2</sub> reaching the detector.</p> <!--    @font-face  {font-family:"Cambria Math";  panose-1:2 4 5 3 5 4 6 3 2 4;  mso-font-charset:0;  mso-generic-font-family:roman;  mso-font-pitch:variable;  mso-font-signature:-536870145 1107305727 0 0 415 0;} @font-face  {font-family:Calibri;  panose-1:2 15 5 2 2 2 4 3 2 4;  mso-font-charset:0;  mso-generic-font-family:swiss;  mso-font-pitch:variable;  mso-font-signature:-536859905 -1073732485 9 0 511 0;}    p.MsoNormal, li.MsoNormal, div.MsoNormal  {mso-style-unhide:no;  mso-style-qformat:yes;  mso-style-parent:";  margin:0in;  margin-bottom:.0001pt;  mso-pagination:widow-orphan;  font-size:12.0pt;  font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;  mso-ascii-font-family:Calibri;  mso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin;  mso-fareast-font-family:Calibri;  mso-fareast-theme-font:minor-latin;  mso-hansi-font-family:Calibri;  mso-hansi-theme-font:minor-latin;  mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman";  mso-bidi-theme-font:minor-bidi;} p  {mso-style-noshow:yes;  mso-style-priority:99;  mso-margin-top-alt:auto;  margin-right:0in;  mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto;  margin-left:0in;  mso-pagination:widow-orphan;  font-size:12.0pt;  font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;  mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";} .MsoChpDefault  {mso-style-type:export-only;  mso-default-props:yes;  font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;  mso-ascii-font-family:Calibri;  mso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin;  mso-fareast-font-family:Calibri;  mso-fareast-theme-font:minor-latin;  mso-hansi-font-family:Calibri;  mso-hansi-theme-font:minor-latin;  mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman";  mso-bidi-theme-font:minor-bidi;}size:8.5in 11.0in;  margin:1.0in 1.0in 1.0in 1.0in;  mso-header-margin:.5in;  mso-footer-margin:.5in;  mso-paper-source:0;} div.WordSection1  {page:WordSection1;} --><br> <p>            Last Modified: 11/26/2020<br>      Modified by: Gianfranco&nbsp;Vidali</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1615897/1615897_10435797_1605570779201_Picture1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1615897/1615897_10435797_1605570779201_Picture1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Chemical Desorption"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1615897/1615897_10435797_1605570779201_Picture1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Chemical Desorption"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Time resolved desorption of O2 following the reaction H+O3(ice) to O2+OHHe, Emtiaz and Vidali, ApJ 851, 104 (2017)</div> <div class="imageCredit">Vidali</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Gianfranco&nbsp;Vidali</div> <div class="imageTitle">Chemical Desorption</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1615897/1615897_10435797_1606401456480_diffusion--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1615897/1615897_10435797_1606401456480_diffusion--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Diffusion of molecules in water ice"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1615897/1615897_10435797_1606401456480_diffusion--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Diffusion of molecules in water ice"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Top: cartoon of diffusion of molecular nitrogen (N2) in amorphous solid waterBottom: time evolution of infrared dangling bonds of water signaling the penetration of N2 in the pores of amorphous solid waterHe et al.
