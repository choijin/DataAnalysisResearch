<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project seeks to de-risk the volume manufacturability and reliability of thin crystalline power MOSFETs fabricated with a novel exfoliation technology demonstrated in Phase 1.  The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to enable lower cost and better performance for power devices in switching or transferring electricity under varying power requirements across the voltage spectrum in a variety of applications ranging from consumer, to communications, automotive and industrial applications.  In all of these applications, the ON resistance of the power MOSFET and IGBTs can be reduced and the switching speed and performance further improved by reducing the device thickness.  Additionally, in consumer and mobile applications, reducing the form factor of the power MOSFET devices can enable slimmer and lighter products.  A significant broader impact of this technology will be the reduction of expensive and environmentally hazardous waste treatment processes associated with wafer grinding technology used in the power MOSFET industry.  While the power MOSFETs developed using this technology can have broad commercial and societal impact, the use of this thin crystalline technology can have even broader impact across all modern semiconductor devices such as LED, PV, flexible CMOS and passive devices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses challenges to further scaling of Power MOSFETs which are one of the key building blocks of the electronic revolution over the last few decades. While the feature size of transistors has been constantly shrinking, the substrate thickness has been increasing. These substrates are currently mechanically thinned to minimize the negative impact of this increased thickness on performance and form-factor. There are significant challenges to continue this trend and the thin crystalline technology and device architecture proposed here can enable continued scaling of device metrics over the next decade with favorable cost structures.  During phase I, functional power MOSFETs were demonstrated with this thin crystalline technology to establish the feasibility of this technology for power devices. This phase II effort will focus on the following specific technical challenges to bring it to market. (1) Develop power MOSFETs with improved switching characteristics using the thin crystalline technology (2) High voltage high current characterization of the thin crystalline power MOSFETs (3) Process yield and reliability characterization of package thin crystalline power MOSFET parts and (4) Convert existing process line to use thin crystalline exfoliation technology in high volume manufacturing flow.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Semiconductor manufacturing requirements forces devices to be manufactured on larger and thicker wafers while thin devices are needed to improve performance targets. This competing need for thicker wafers and thinner devices is limiting the further scaling of devices and reducing operating margins. These processes also utilize copious resources for waste management of the effluents used to grind and thin wafers. As part of the SBIR project, AND Inc. addressed all these concerns using a thin crystalline exfoliation technology to eliminate wafer backgrinding as is currently practiced by the industry.  As part of this NSF SBIR phase II project, it was proposed to develop power transistor devices using the novel thin crystalline technology developed by AND Inc using parts sourced from power device vendors.  During the project, we identified opportunities to fabricate and sell our own power devices based on a novel device architecture.   We were successful in demonstrating the novel device architecture and this technology has since been licensed by a US based Si wafer foundry as was announced to the public in a press release (https://finance.yahoo.com/news/skywater-chosen-applied-novel-devices-090000432.html).  A picture of a 30V n-channel power MOSFET product designed and fabricated using this technology and the associated product specification sheet is shown in figure 1.  During this project, we have used the NSF provided Veterans Research supplemental funding to hire and train two student veterans from the University of Texas, Austin.  The student veterans were trained in many aspects of semiconductor processing in the cleanroom and system integration.   AND is currently qualifying the power MOSFET parts for high volume manufacturing with its foundry partner.  These parts are expected to meet critical needs of various electronic systems.  The first parts designed using this NSF funding will target applications that are 30V and below used in power management in consumer electronics and data servers.
