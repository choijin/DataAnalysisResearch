<AbstractNarration>With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation Program (MRI) and support from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program (CRIF), Professor William Dougherty from Susquehanna University and colleagues Geneive Henry and Elizabeth Valentin have upgraded a 400 MHz Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectrometer by equipping it with a new radio frequency console, a broadband probe capable of operating between -100 and +150 degrees Centigrade and a 24-position autosampler. The upgraded electronics for the spectrometer allows research in a variety of fields such as those that accelerate chemical reactions of significant economic importance, as well as those that allow study of biologically relevant species. In general, NMR spectroscopy is one of the most powerful tools available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution or in the solid state.  The results from these NMR studies have an impact in synthetic organic/inorganic chemistry, materials chemistry and biochemistry. The acquired probe acts both as a broadband and high-field probe which increases sensitivity. This instrument is an integral part of teaching as well as research performed by undergraduate students via independent student research and traditional academic coursework.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The award is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels, especially in areas such as (a) understanding the influence chemical structure has on the redox properties of transition metal complexes; (b) studying the redox properties of first row transition metal complexes bearing sterically bulky trispyrazolylborate ligands and (c) isolating and spectroscopically characterizing natural products from Carex (grassy plants or sedge) and Hypericum species (herbaceous shrubs) growing in Pennsylvania.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This project supported the upgrade of a 15-year-old, 400 MHz JEOL NMR spectrometer with a new console, a new auto sample changer and a new broadband probe to support both faculty-supervised undergraduate research programs and undergraduate teaching labs. The upgraded instrument supported three undergraduate research groups focused around synthetic organic and inorganic chemistry, natural product isolation and synthesis, medicinal chemistry and green chemistry. Over the three-year period, the research performed by these groups resulted in 25 different regional and national conference presentations and 3 peer-reviewed journal articles, with undergraduate co-authors, to date. The upgraded instrument has been used to introduce over 400 undergraduate students, from diverse STEM majors, to NMR spectroscopy and its applications towards the identification of organic molecules. Ten percent of these students were from traditionally underrepresented groups in the STEM fields. More sophisticated training on the instrument was completed by 40 of these undergraduate students who are now able to run their own experiments, train others in basic use of the instrument and perform 2D and heteronuclear NMR experiments. The addition of the auto-sampler device has significantly minimized instrument downtime over the weekends allowing student researchers to utilize this time efficiently by running longer experiments, automatically.
