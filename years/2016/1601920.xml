<AbstractNarration>One of the fundamental identities satisfied by number systems is the commutative law ab=ba. More complex algebraic systems such as sets of functions or symmetries can have much more intricate behavior, reflected by more complicated algebraic identities. This research project addresses questions such as whether the set of all such identities can be deduced from a finite subset. The results are expected to have applications in algebra, number theory, and theoretical computer science. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project aims to develop a new theory of infinite groups satisfying pro-unipotent or pro-p identities. The theory should be parallel to the theory of algebras with polynomial identities and provide a new approach to linear groups over commutative rings. Important steps in implementation of this program will be (1) a proof that linear pro-p and pro-unipotent groups satisfy nontrivial identities, (2) proofs that these identities are finitely based, and (3) a structure theory that would establish that under certain conditions groups with identities are linear.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The findings of the project shed light on an important class of infnite groups that are close to linear groups over commutative rings. The hope is to develop a structure theory that is parallel to the theory of of PI-rings and has applications to the wide range of problems in Algebra and Number Theory.  In particular, one of the theorems establishes the most general conditions for the General Burnside problem to have a positive solution. The proof uses large variety of techniques from Combinatorial Algebra, Lie Theory and the theory of Quadratic Jordan Algebras.  Another result paves a new way to determination of bounds in the Restricted Burnside Problem.We hope to prove that for finite groups of prime exponent nilpotency class grows linearly with the number of generators.  In a series of three papers we developed a new construction of Matrix Wreath Products of associative algebras that is analogous to the wreath product construction in Group Theory. Matrix wreath prodicts were used to solve several open affinization problems and construct new examples of finitely generated associative rings. We hope that matrix wreath product will provide explicit constructions of algebras / nil algebras with prescribed growth functions.  I gave lectures on these results at numerous international conferences including CIMPA conferences in mathematically developing countries.
