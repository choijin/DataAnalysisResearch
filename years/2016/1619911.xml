<AbstractNarration>The 4th International Workshop on Fluid-Structure Interaction Problems (http://www2.ims.nus.edu.sg/Programs/016wfluid/index.php) will be hosted by the Institute for Mathematical Sciences (IMS) at National University of Singapore during 30 May - 3 June 2016. The workshop aims to bring together mathematicians, computational scientists, and engineers having a common interest in solving fluid-structure interaction problems. The ultimate goal is to initiate new research collaborations that improve on existing techniques and generate ideas for new approaches. Funding from the NSF is sought to support the travel of ten US participants, including graduate students, post-docs and junior faculty. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop will address many challenging and important computational and modeling techniques for fluid-structure interaction problems in biological flows, multiphase flows, material sciences, and manufacturing processes. It will provide a platform to exchange, promote and generate ideas across a wide range of research areas in scientific computing and applications. The workshop will also introduce US researchers to a broad international community, expands and creates research collaborations with their international peers, and provides research and career counseling for junior US researchers.</AbstractNarration>
