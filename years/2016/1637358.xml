<AbstractNarration>This is an Early-concept Grant for Exploratory Research supporting research in Smart and Connected Communities. The research supported by the award is collaborative with research at the University of Colorado. The researchers are studying the use of technologies to enable communities to connect youth and youth organizations to effectively support diverse learning pathways for all students. These communities, the youth, the youth organizations, formal and informal education organizations, and civic organizations form a learning ecology. The DePaul University researchers will design and implement a smart community infrastructure in the City of Chicago to track real-time student participation in community STEM activities and to develop mobile applications for both students and adults. The smart community infrastructure will bring together information from a variety of sources that affect students' participation in community activities. These include geographic information (e.g., where the student lives, where the activities take place, the student transportation options, the school the student attends), student related information (e.g., the education and experience background of the student, the economic status of the student, students' schedules), and activity information (e.g., location of activity, requirements for participation).  The University of Colorado researchers will take the lead on analyzing these data in terms of a community learning ecologies framework and will explore computational approaches (i.e., recommender systems, visualizations of learning opportunities) to improve youth exploration and uptake of interests and programs. These smart technologies are then used to reduce the friction in the learning connection infrastructure (called L3 for informal, formal, and virtual learning) to enable the student to access opportunities for participation in STEM activities that are most feasible and most appropriate for the student. Such a flexible computational approach is needed to support the necessary diversity of potential recommendations: new interests for youth to explore; specific programs based on interests, friends' activities, or geographic accessibility; or programs needed to "level-up" (develop deeper skills) and complete skills to enhance youths' learning portfolios. Although this information was always available, it was never integrated so it could be used to serve the community of both learners and the providers and to provide measurable student learning and participation outcomes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The learning ecologies theoretical framework and supporting computational methods are a contribution to the state of the art in studying afterschool learning opportunities. While the concept of learning ecologies is not new, to date, no one has offered such a systematic and theoretically-grounded portfolio of measures for characterizing the health and resilience of STEM learning ecologies at multiple scales. The theoretical frameworks and concepts draw together multiple research and application domains: computer science, sociology of education, complexity science, and urban planning. The L3 Connects infrastructure itself represents an unprecedented opportunities for conducting "living lab" experiments to improve stakeholder experience of linking providers to a single network and linking youth to more expanded and varied opportunities. The University of Colorado team will employ three methods: mapping, modeling, and linking youth to STEM learning opportunities in school and out of school settings in a large urban city (Chicago). The recommender system will be embedded into youth and parent facing mobile apps, enabling the team to characterize the degree to which content-based, collaborative filtering, or constraint based recommendations influence youth actions. The project will result in two measurable outcomes of importance to key L3 stakeholder groups: a 10% increase in the number of providers (programs that are part of the infrastructure) in target neighborhoods and a 20% increase in the number of youth participating in programs.</AbstractNarration>

This work has led to the establishment of the L<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;Connects infrastructure which consists of the technology solutions, data agreements as well as networks of educators and organizations that support learning across formal, informal and virtual spaces.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>While the L<strong><sup>3</sup>&nbsp;</strong>Connects infrastructure has begun to engage 10s of 1000s of youth, there is a clear need to continue to develop more equitable mechanisms to spur formal and informal learning organizations, young people and the caring adults in their lives to effectively make use of this citywide ecosystem of opportunities. This requires focused efforts in lowering the friction that exists in capturing, understanding and visualizing what youth are engaging in as well as more differentiated resources to support the varied stakeholders in their efforts to&nbsp;increase participation and&nbsp;engagement by young people over time in learning experiences that span formal and informal spaces. This EAGER attempts to understand three recurring problems of practice that often create friction for efforts to support learning across formal and informal boundaries.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <ul> <li><strong>Network of Trusted Learning Locations:</strong>&nbsp;A vetted set of partner sites across the city that will pilot automated data capturing with select youth on an opt-in basis</li> <li><strong>Brokering Support Network:</strong>&nbsp;Activate a support network to encourage learners to connect to opportunities</li> <li><strong>Reduce Friction and Increase Access:</strong>&nbsp;Seamless data capturing by youth and providers; Greater access to resources</li> </ul> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>This EAGER will address these problems through the creation of a mobile app (descried below) that extends use of the L3 platform to mobile phones by enabling youth to check-in seamlessly, get location-based program recommendations, and support the capturing of learning moments via student mobile devices.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The L3 app will serve as a tool for youth to self-document their out of school activities, report locations where experiences and skill building occur, discover programs that fit their personalized needs, and demonstrate their skills growth over time to their network of peers and caring adults. The final prominent low friction feature of the App revolves around the fact that although internet connected apps are pervasive, the App will aggregate these various points of student activity in online and offline situations. Students will not have to be connected to record their activity or to complete online challenges.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Check-In </strong></p> <p>The Check-in feature allows students to record their location and how and why this location is significant for their set of activities. Check-in builds on top the L<sup>3</sup> program data infrastructure which allows for any known program location &nbsp;to pull up all programs occurring at this location. This essentially permits the learner to check into a program which further documents the building of their skills and experience. Additionally, recording their presence builds the groundwork for providing attendance to program managers and mentors. The learner can describe why they are there that day, and also describe the location with minimal engagement through tags. This tagging mechanism starts to crowdsource why a location is resource and what level of activity takes place there.</p> <p><strong>Capture </strong></p> <p>The mobile app provides teens the ability to capture their activities in the moment anywhere at any point along their creation process. By capturing their work, they will subsequently be able to categorize the activity and use it when building a portfolio to supplement their skills and experience. While keeping the friction of capturing their work low, the app allows them to tag it with helpful metadata such as location, program, and category tags. This type of quick tagging will allow young learners to better represent their work when they share it with mentors or within their portfolio.</p> <p><strong>Discover </strong></p> <p>The App help students discover activities, programs and the work of their peers. The App recommends programs and online challenges to learners based on their location, age and their selected interests. The learner&rsquo;s customized activity feed allows learners to discover news locations and the resources the learners visiting that location find important. Online challenges may be recommended based on program attendance, interests or proximity to a location that may be related to the challenge.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 12/30/2017<br>      Modified by: Nichole&nbsp;Pinkard</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1637358/1637358_10457354_1514670361873_ScreenShot2017-12-30at3.37.52PM--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1637358/1637358_10457354_1514670361873_ScreenShot2017-12-30at3.37.52PM--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Capturing Location-based Learning"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1637358/1637358_10457354_1514670361873_ScreenShot2017-12-30at3.37.52PM--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Capturing Location-based Learning"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Screens that demonstrate how student can document learning moments that can be automatically tagged by location, time, program, and activity.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Digital Youth Network</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyright owner is an institution with an existing agreement allowing use by NSF</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Nichole&nbsp;Pinkard</div> <div class="imageTitle">Capturing Location-based Learning</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1637358/1637358_10457354_1514670207871_ScreenShot2017-12-30at3.38.02PM--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1637358/1637358_10457354_1514670207871_ScreenShot2017-12-30at3.38.02PM--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Location-based Recommendation"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1637358/1637358_10457354_1514670207871_ScreenShot2017-12-30at3.38.02PM--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Location-based Recommendation"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Shows how the app can recommend programs based upon GPS location.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Digital Youth Network</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyright owner is an institution with an existing agreement allowing use by NSF</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Nichole&nbsp;Pinkard</div> <div class="imageTitle">Location-based Recommendation</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1637358/1637358_10457354_1514670126399_ScreenShot2017-12-30at3.36.41PM--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1637358/1637358_10457354_1514670126399_ScreenShot2017-12-30at3.36.41PM--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Discover screens"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1637358/1637358_10457354_1514670126399_ScreenShot2017-12-30at3.36.41PM--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Discover screens"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Screens that support youth in discovering learning opportunities around them.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Digital Youth Network</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyright owner is an institution with an existing agreement allowing use by NSF</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Nichole&nbsp;Pinkard</div> <div class="imageTitle">Discover screens</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
