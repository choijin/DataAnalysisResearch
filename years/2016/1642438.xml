<AbstractNarration>This award provides support for a CAREER proposal writing workshop that will be held concurrent with the American Society of Mechanical Engineers annual design conference.  Approximately 200 young faculty will attend the workshop, which will last a full day.  The workshop will enable young faculty to better frame their research and to write higher quality proposals.  This will lead to better research, more effective teaching and more effective use of NSF funds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop will be conducted on August 23, 2016, in Charlotte, North Carolina.  The workshop agenda includes a session on proposal writing best practices, presentations by previous CAREER awardees, and a session of framing research hypotheses and broader impacts.</AbstractNarration>

A second goal of this workshop is to encourage interaction between junior and senior faculty and strengthen the community bonds by providing a forum to discuss career development and planning. This objective was met by discussing best practices and success stories, and highlighting the perspectives of reviewers and program directors.
