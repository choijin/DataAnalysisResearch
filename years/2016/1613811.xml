<AbstractNarration>This project will advance efforts of the innovative Technology Experiences for Students and Teachers (ITEST) program to better understand and promote practices that increase students' motivations and capacities to pursue careers in fields of science, technology, engineering, or mathematics (STEM) by producing empirical findings and/or research tools that contribute to knowledge about which models and interventions with K-12 students and teachers are most likely to increase capacity in the STEM and STEM cognate intensive workforce of the future.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will build a path to further research on best practices for Native American youth education. It will enhance the existing Indigenous Arts and Sciences (IAS) project by addressing cultural perspectives of Native students and educators. The approach describes the need to include ecological relevance in STEM learning for Native American youth, with an integration of Western science with Native knowledge, process, and core values, which will give a positive impact on Native American youth's interest in and learning of science. The project will deliver a culturally relevant stewardship-based education model applying science to indigenous knowledge and community culture connections in collaboration with four tribal communities in Wisconsin. Informal science education will come through the Earth Partnership (EP) and will involve participants in habitat restoration and stewardship as a context for intergenerational science learning across age, discipline, culture and place. EP Indigenous Arts and Sciences (IAS) integrates Western science with Native knowledge, process, and core values including relationship, reciprocity, respect and responsibility.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will convene the expertise of elders and community members from Red Cliff, Bad River, Lac du Flambeau, and Ho-Chunk Nations with university social, physical, and life scientists to expand informal science learning incorporating ecological protection and restoration, citizen science, and cultural diversity. STEM learning and career pathways for underrepresented groups will occur in an informal and culturally relevant contexts becoming important for enhancing ecological and STEM literacy, efficacy and civic engagement. IAS will engage students, educators, elders, informal educators, natural resource professionals, and parents in community dialogues and relationship building, informal-formal professional development collaborations, and indigenized STEM learning experiences and mentoring for students in grades 8-12. The science content will be explored through technology-enhanced, project-based learning in real-life contexts integrating culture in classroom and informal settings. This project is based on a growing body of research on Indigenous wisdom that reconnects Native youth and the broader community with the environment. The project occurs broadly at the intersection of science learning, environmental justice, ecological restoration, tribal history, and culture at a crucial time of global climate and social change. IAS will use this project-based learning model to advance the knowledge of how and why indigenizing informal science learning through a collaborative effort including elders, families, youth, formal and informal educators will revitalize culture, community and education.</AbstractNarration>

Our program advances knowledge and understanding on providing innovative experiences to middle and high school Tribal youth, resulting in their increased interest in STEM classes, majors and careers. The team-approach to STEM learning brings together university and Tribal experts to deliver environmental education experiences centered in Indigenous cultures. The process of developing the Youth institutes includes collaboration with Tribal communities, aligning with Native learning styles and processes, and leveraging Traditional Ecological Knowledge to connect to STEM learning. The intellectual merit of this project is summarized as follows: IAS leverages a process-oriented community-based research approach to cultural teaching of STEM education, supporting Native student identity and engagement in STEM learning.</span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p style="line-height: 1.2; margin-left: 36pt; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;" dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">We implemented community-based research to conduct interviews with Tribal youth, families, leaders and professionals of the four partner Tribes. Our research illustrates how Tribal environmental stewardship ethics and Native learning processes connect to STEM learning. Youth interviews demonstrate the significance of learning hands-on, at home in their own communities, from Elders, and in their Native languages through stories and songs. Youth report that hands-on learning helps with saliency of content and also confidence in science skills. One high schooler describes his learning experience as: <em>Hands on...outside, to physically experience the science part of it</em>.</span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p style="line-height: 1.2; margin-left: 36pt; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;" dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Parents report their youth are: 1. Learning diverse approaches to science: <em>Our ancestors used way more science than we give them credit for</em>; and 2. Connecting their cultures to science: <em>[Our child's] learning [traditional] songs that go with whatever project she's doing</em>.</span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p style="line-height: 1.2; margin-left: 36pt; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;" dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Tribal communities share about the influence of culture on Native youth identity, engagement with STEM learning and environmental careers. For example, a Red Cliff parent explains the infusion of culture and science on identity:</span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p style="line-height: 1.295; margin-left: 72pt; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 8pt;" dir="ltr"><em><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">It helps them a lot because if you don?t have part of that, your culture, in this, being outdoors, being a part of the program, dealing with the land, the water, that defines who you are as a Native American. I?m glad that it is part of STEM. In many ways they both go together?.The science part of it, the technology, the trail cams, the science learning about different plants, and things, species of fish, and cultural parts that help you learn and grow as an individual.</span></em></p> <p style="line-height: 1.2; margin-left: 36pt; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;" dir="ltr">&nbsp;</p> <p style="line-height: 1.2; margin-left: 36pt; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;" dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Regarding impacts on </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">youth wanting to go into STEM careers; a team instructor says, <em>Earth Partnership... says to a young person, you can enter a professional field in the sciences, and not give up on your Native culture</em>. Earth Partnership IAS leverages Tribal and university educational systems to advance cultural approaches to science learning, engaging youth in STEM that resonates with their cultural identities, and supports Tribal community ethics of conservation and cultural revitalization.&nbsp;</span></p> <p style="line-height: 1.2; margin-left: 36pt; margin-top: 0.12060546875pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;" dir="ltr"><br /><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">IAS works to advance knowledge and processes for Indigenizing science education through a collaborative effort involving Tribes, school districts, and universities. IAS leverages Tribal_University partnerships to advance a model that serves Tribal communities across Wisconsin, and is scalable to other First Nations. IAS advances cross-cultural partnerships across educational infrastructure including: Tribal educators, K-20 institutions, natural resource agencies, and Tribal colleges. Broader impacts of the IAS program include initiating and sustaining processes that fortify Tribal_University partnerships and alliances between Tribes and school districts, and mobilization across the education spectrum for Native Education Pathways into natural resource careers.&nbsp;</span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p style="line-height: 1.2; margin-left: 36pt; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;" dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Indigenous Arts and Sciences contributes to a larger effort statewide, </span><a style="text-decoration: none;" href="http://nativenations.nelson.wisc.edu/"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial; color: #1155cc; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: underline; text-decoration-skip-ink: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Native Nations_UW</span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">, a Tribal_University partnership that builds relationships and respect and acts on shared priorities. Regarding higher education for Native youth, EP is committed to reorienting UW away from recruiting of Native high school students, to focusing on pre-college programs for Native youth and young adults. Earth Partnership convenes&nbsp; a statewide planning committee to respond to challenges in access to higher education pathways.</span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p style="line-height: 1.2; margin-left: 36pt; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;" dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Alliances between districts and Tribes include Tribal members serving on school boards, hosting board meetings on the reservation, and establishing memoranda of understanding between districts and Tribal Nations. EP IAS work has advanced these objectives with partner Tribes and their districts. Looking broadly at Native Education Pathways into STEM majors and natural resource careers, IAS advances a statewide conversation. In 2019, EP and partner Tribes hosted the first annual Native Education Pathways Forum in Wisconsin, bringing together participants representing Tribal education, social services, and natural resource departments, together with school districts, Tribal colleges, and UW. We have now hosted two forums and the work is ongoing.</span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p style="line-height: 1.2; margin-left: 36.16178894042969pt; margin-right: 5.47796630859375pt; text-indent:

We implemented community-based research to conduct interviews with Tribal youth, families, leaders and professionals of the four partner Tribes. Our research illustrates how Tribal environmental stewardship ethics and Native learning processes connect to STEM learning. Youth interviews demonstrate the significance of learning hands-on, at home in their own communities, from Elders, and in their Native languages through stories and songs. Youth report that hands-on learning helps with saliency of content and also confidence in science skills. One high schooler describes his learning experience as: Hands on...outside, to physically experience the science part of it.    Parents report their youth are: 1. Learning diverse approaches to science: Our ancestors used way more science than we give them credit for; and 2. Connecting their cultures to science: [Our child's] learning [traditional] songs that go with whatever project she's doing.    Tribal communities share about the influence of culture on Native youth identity, engagement with STEM learning and environmental careers. For example, a Red Cliff parent explains the infusion of culture and science on identity:    It helps them a lot because if you don?t have part of that, your culture, in this, being outdoors, being a part of the program, dealing with the land, the water, that defines who you are as a Native American. I?m glad that it is part of STEM. In many ways they both go together?.The science part of it, the technology, the trail cams, the science learning about different plants, and things, species of fish, and cultural parts that help you learn and grow as an individual.   Regarding impacts on youth wanting to go into STEM careers; a team instructor says, Earth Partnership... says to a young person, you can enter a professional field in the sciences, and not give up on your Native culture. Earth Partnership IAS leverages Tribal and university educational systems to advance cultural approaches to science learning, engaging youth in STEM that resonates with their cultural identities, and supports Tribal community ethics of conservation and cultural revitalization.   IAS works to advance knowledge and processes for Indigenizing science education through a collaborative effort involving Tribes, school districts, and universities. IAS leverages Tribal_University partnerships to advance a model that serves Tribal communities across Wisconsin, and is scalable to other First Nations. IAS advances cross-cultural partnerships across educational infrastructure including: Tribal educators, K-20 institutions, natural resource agencies, and Tribal colleges. Broader impacts of the IAS program include initiating and sustaining processes that fortify Tribal_University partnerships and alliances between Tribes and school districts, and mobilization across the education spectrum for Native Education Pathways into natural resource careers.     Indigenous Arts and Sciences contributes to a larger effort statewide, Native Nations_UW, a Tribal_University partnership that builds relationships and respect and acts on shared priorities. Regarding higher education for Native youth, EP is committed to reorienting UW away from recruiting of Native high school students, to focusing on pre-college programs for Native youth and young adults. Earth Partnership convenes  a statewide planning committee to respond to challenges in access to higher education pathways.    Alliances between districts and Tribes include Tribal members serving on school boards, hosting board meetings on the reservation, and establishing memoranda of understanding between districts and Tribal Nations. EP IAS work has advanced these objectives with partner Tribes and their districts. Looking broadly at Native Education Pathways into STEM majors and natural resource careers, IAS advances a statewide conversation. In 2019, EP and partner Tribes hosted the first annual Native Education Pathways Forum in Wisconsin, bringing together participants representing Tribal education, social services, and natural resource departments, together with school districts, Tribal colleges, and UW. We have now hosted two forums and the work is ongoing.    IAS is a collaborative process that builds community with educators statewide, Indigenizes STEM learning, and supports Native youth to enter into conservation careers that meet workforce needs for protecting Tribal natural resources.  The IAS model is scalable to other Tribal Nations and Tribal_Univeristy partnerships.                       Last Modified: 03/31/2021       Submitted by: Cheryl Bauer-Armstrong]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
