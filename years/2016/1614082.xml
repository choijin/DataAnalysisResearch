<AbstractNarration>The detection and quantification of small molecules is of great importance to fundamental biological and environmental research, pharmaceutical development, and clinical practice. Oligonucleotide-based sensors provide a robust and powerful option for the detection of small molecules, but the development of these sensors has been hindered by the difficulty of separating potential sensor molecules from inert species. Droplet-based microfluidic technologies are uniquely situated to address these issues; these technologies allow for the separation and handling of individual sensor molecules and small molecule targets. This project will focus on the design and characterization of a droplet-generating microfluidic device with improved efficiencies and functionality over existing devices. This research is being done in collaboration with Dr. Saif Khan, an expert in droplet-based microfluidics, at the National University of Singapore. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Aptamers, short oligonucleotides that bind targets with high affinity and specificity, are promising new tools for small molecule detection that overcome problems with current antibody based sensors, namely high production costs and low thermal and biochemical stability. However, the development of aptamers for small molecule targets has not been fully scaled up due to issues with partitioning aptamer candidates from large starting libraries of oligonucleotides. Droplet-based microfluidics can be utilized to overcome the partitioning issues as water-in-oil droplets provide a platform for the separation and handling of single oligonucleotides at both the amplification and selection stages during the aptamer development process. In order for microfluidic devices to be a viable tool for the aptamer development process, the devices require very high rates of droplet generation. The project aims to improve the rate of droplet generation of the 3D microfluidic droplet generators developed in the Khan lab. The project will also explore how channel dimensions, continuous phase composition, and the flowrate ratio between continuous phase and dispersed phase affect droplet diameter and thermal stability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award under the East Asia and Pacific Summer Institutes program supports summer research by a U.S. graduate student and is jointly funded by NSF and the National Research Foundation of Singapore.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Background  The formation of drug delivery vehicles that allow for precise and controllable release of drug has important applications in academic and industrial fields.  To be able to fully achieve this goal of precise and controllable release, one must have a fundamental understanding of properties that affect drug release and be able to control these properties during the formation of drug delivery vehicles.  Polymer microparticles are a type of drug delivery vehicle that are currently of interest because they allow for controlled and sustained release of drug.  Dr. Saif Khan at the National University of Singapore has developed a novel, droplet-based microfluidic technology that allows for the selective formation of drug-loaded microparticles with complex structures.      Objective  Characterize parameters of drug-loaded microparticle structure that affect drug release behavior.   Results and Outcomes  Drug-loaded microparticles were prepared with one of two internal structures using the droplet-based evaporative crystallization process developed by the Khan lab.  Brightfield microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and digital scanning calorimetry were used to verify correct microparticle formation.  A protocol to study drug release from the microparticles was developed and optimized; drug release from both particle types was measured over a 5-day period with a focus over the first 12 hours to study how particle structure affects both short-term and extended release behavior.  Analysis of the release data with empirical models of drug release demonstrated that release from both types of particles occurred with a decelerated exponential behavior which was consistent with the observed drug release from an insoluble matrix.  Mechanistic models of drug release are being explored to better elucidate the physical phenomena responsible for the different release behavior observed between the two microparticle structures.  The following outcomes were achieved as part of the EAPSI fellowship:  I received training on various analytical techniques including scanning electron microscopy and digital scanning calorimetry. I learned how to perform the droplet-based microparticle formation method developed by the Khan lab, and I am currently in the process of replicating their setup in my home lab at Boston University. I gained experience in analysis of release data, particularly analyzing experimental data with empirical and mechanistic models. I formed an international collaboration that I will continue to utilize throughout the duration of my dissertation project.     Summary  The results from this project demonstrate that microparticle structure can be used to tune drug release behavior.  Further analysis seeks to map properties of microparticle structure to specific release behavior.  With this understanding, microparticle formation methods, like the one developed in the Khan lab which allow for precise control of the micro- and macrostructure of the drug-loaded particle, can be utilized in the development of novel drug delivery vehicles with tunable release behavior.   My dissertation work at Boston University involves developing experimental techniques to study drug release from pharmaceutical tablets as a quality assessment measure.  The experience and training that I received as a part of the EAPSI fellowship has greatly improved my capabilities in accomplishing this effort.  The microparticle formation technique that I learned in Dr. Khan?s lab will be utilized to produce model systems for testing the drug release experimental techniques being developed as part of my dissertation work.  The analytical techniques and data analysis experience that I received training in will also be directly applied in my research at Boston University.
