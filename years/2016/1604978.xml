<AbstractNarration>PI:  Elbing, Brian&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: 1604978&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The addition of a very small amount of polymers to a fluid can result in a dramatic reduction of friction for turbulent flows.  It is proposed to conduct state-of-the-art experiments in a newly built facility to obtain an extensive amount of detailed data for the process at different conditions, and then develop a predictive model for the polymer effects on the fluid velocity. Drag reduction with polymers can be used to save energy for fluid transportation over long distances, e.g., for oil pipelines. It can also reduce energy costs for ocean faring vehicles (ships and submarines). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research is to investigate how drag-reducing polymer solutions modify the near-wall region of a high-Reynolds number turbulent boundary layer. While this has been thought to be understood for decades, recent numerical and experimental data show significant deviation from the classical view. Available data shows a non-universal behavior when the drag reduction is above 40%, which can only be partially explained by a Reynolds number effect. Consequently, the behavior must be dependent on polymer properties. Thus, this project will focus on characterizing the near-wall region at various values of drag reduction, Reynolds number and polymer properties (i.e., Weissenberg number, viscosity ratio, and length ratio). The first objective is to perform this characterization in a polymer ocean to eliminate the influence of a non-homogeneous polymer concentration field. Then testing will be repeated with polymer injection to assess the sensitivity of the profiles to the homogeneity of the concentration field. Finally, the ultimate profile, an empirically derived upper limit for the velocity shift, will be reexamined in both a polymer ocean and with polymer injection to determine the validity of numerical and experimental observations that the profile is not logarithmic. It will also be examined under what conditions this profile can actually be exceeded. In addition to graduate and undergraduate student participation, high-school students will be engaged in research through the PI's involvement with the job-shadowing component of Oklahoma State University's Upward Bound program, which is focused on low-income and/or first generation high school students. Each year, up to 3 of these students would work with the PI for 6 weeks.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The objective of the proposed work was to determine the dependence of the near-wall velocity profile of a turbulent boundary layer (TBL) modified with the addition of PEO polymer solution. The central hypothesis was that the velocity profiles would deviate from the classical view in the high drag reduction regime (&gt;40%), primarily in proportion to the Reynolds number and Weissenberg number (Wi). This hypothesis has been proven to be true via a combination of experiments with polymer oceans and polymer injections that have been compared against established results. Creating a repeatable and controlled polymer ocean within a recirculating water tunnel has been rarely achieved, and the current work was more challenging since the polymer properties had to be precisely controlled and characterized. This work produced insights into how to control polymer performance with degraded samples to match non-degraded samples at the same molecular weight. These results were published in Farsiani et al. (2020a) and provided insights into scaling the performance deviations, which enabled us to create controlled polymer oceans.</p> <p>The baseline (non-polymeric) near-wall velocity profiles in the custom-designed water tunnel were published in Elbing et al. (2018). The mean velocity profiles within the log-region were demonstrated to be dependent on the Wi when scaled using inner variables (Farsiani et al., 2020b). Furthermore, the polymer ocean results were shown to be consistent with the polymer injection results, and the scatter in the von K?rm?n coefficient between various studies reported in Elbing et al. (2013) was explained with the inner variable scaled Wi (Elbing, 2021).</p> <p>The near-wall turbulent structure was further analyzed and the dominant coherent structures within the log-region were shown to have a linear relationship with the drag reduction. These dominant structures become elongated and aligned with the streamwise direction (i.e. the inclination angle decreases with increasing drag reduction) (Farsiani et al., 2020b). These insights have since been expanded upon with analysis of the fluctuating velocity profiles, spectral analysis of the fluctuations, quadrant analysis to isolate ejection/sweep events, and POD analysis (Farsiani, 2020). These results are consistent with the coherent structure analysis findings, but of particular note is that the inner variable scaled Reynolds shear stress is significantly suppressed once the Wi exceeds unity. This points to the significant changes observed within the log-region require the polymer time scales to exceed that of the turbulent scales. These findings are currently being written up for an additional journal article.&nbsp;</p> <p>Finally, this project also had numerous broader impacts related to under-represented student involvement, undergraduate involvement in research, impact on research and infrastructure on the EPSCOR state of Oklahoma, and dissemination of results. Women were heavily represented within this project in numerous ways, including having 5 undergraduate assistants that provided critical input and regularly hosting a hands-on demonstration as part of the National Lab Day (63% of participants were women). However, most significantly was that the student project leader was a woman, which during this project she completed her PhD. Low-income/first generation (LI/FG) students were also a focus of the outreach efforts. We were able to have 14 LI/FG high school students work in our laboratory, with my graduate students, for 6-weeks during the summer as part of the OSU Upward Bound program. We also had significant undergraduate involvement with this project that included having 12 undergraduate research assistants and 8 semester-long course projects. This project also had significant impact on the research and education infrastructure through creating polymer drag reduction related course content, incorporating project activities into a college-wide laboratory course, and advancing the careers of numerous individuals.
