<AbstractNarration>While there have been many advances in disciplinary-specific quantitative, qualitative, and mixed methods approaches for disaster research, interdisciplinary methods in the field have not yet been sufficiently inventoried or studied. In light of this gap in knowledge, the central objective of the workshop series is to bring together leading interdisciplinary researchers to advance the science and practice of interdisciplinary research for hazards and disasters. The expected products of the workshop series are two clearly defined deliverables: a special journal issue dedicated to understanding issues involved in framing and organizing interdisciplinary research, and an edited book volume focused on developing methodological guidance for interdisciplinary teams. The workshops will engage a broad range of disciplinary perspectives from a wide array of participants. The journal issue and edited volume will be designed to reach researchers engaged in or interested in interdisciplinary disaster research, helping to advance the field, to educate current and future generations, and to encourage ongoing discussions of methodological perspectives on disaster research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work will (1) inventory interdisciplinary methodological approaches and associated epistemological and theoretical underpinnings used across the disaster life-cycle; (2) assess the theoretical and methodological approaches used to form and sustain interdisciplinary teams; (3) identify the major challenges that the field faces in terms of interdisciplinary methods; (4) assess the unique contributions and methodological advances of interdisciplinary teams; (5) reveal the dynamics of implementing an interdisciplinary methodological approach; and (6) discuss interdisciplinary research, teaching, and next generation mentoring needs moving forward into the future. As such, the two workshops and associated deliverables will directly help to address gaps in knowledge regarding how, when, where, and to what ends interdisciplinary research is implemented. The activities will engage a team of leading interdisciplinary hazards and disaster researchers, resulting in new insights into the challenges and methods of interdisciplinary disaster research while also providing timely guidance for teams engaged in this type of scholarly activity.</AbstractNarration>
