<AbstractNarration>The upper atmosphere within the mesosphere and lower thermosphere (MLT) regions (80 to 105 km) is continually populated with waves generated in the lower atmosphere by a variety of weather-related sources or with waves generated by auroral activity. This award would deploy to the Poker Flat rocket range located near Fairbanks, Alaska, a state-of-the-art meteor radar system that would make middle atmosphere wind measurements with good height resolution (1-2 km) and good temporal resolution (30 to 60 min). The application of this instrument is to study the dynamics of the Arctic MLT region continually day and night. These new wind observations would be integrated into a study that combines radar and lidar measurements, satellite measurements, and meteorological re-analyses, to understand the wave-driven circulation of the Arctic polar atmosphere. The satellite observations and meteorological re-analyses yield synoptic-scale measurements of the mesosphere, stratosphere and troposphere.  The lidar observations yield high-resolution height profile temperature and density measurements that allow characterization of the existing planetary waves, tides, and gravity waves. The new radar would yield accurate MLT wind measurements that complete the characterization of these waves and would support modeling efforts aimed at improving the understanding of the wave-driven global circulation. The investigators would use or re-analyze the MERRA (lower atmosphere below 80 km) and SABER profile data (to cover higher altitudes for the range of 90 to 110 km) to characterize the synoptic stratospheric and lower mesospheric activities. The radar observations would help to understand the extent to which nitrogen compounds produced by energetic particle precipitation in the thermosphere contribute to the composition of the lower atmosphere by transport across the MLT region into the stratosphere and the ozone layer. The activity in this new award will support the education and training of students in science and engineering. The award would extend research infrastructure in the Arctic, especially at the Poker Flat Rocket Range, enhance international and national collaborations, and promote collaboration among observers and modelers. The research results will be integrated into the University of Alaska programs and disseminated through a variety of professional, educational, and outreach programs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Analyses based on temperature and pressure measurements and gradient winds are used to describe planetary wave activity in the stratosphere and lower mesosphere, and the circulation follows well-defined synoptic patterns of cyclones and anti-cyclones. However, direct wind measurements are increasingly important at higher altitudes where the amplitudes of shorter-period waves and tides are the largest component of the winds. The activity would provide new observations as well as a coherent framework for understanding these interactions.</AbstractNarration>
