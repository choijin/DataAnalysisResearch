<AbstractNarration>This grant provides travel support for about 16 U.S. based graduate student participants to participate in the 2016 International Conference on Data Mining (ICDM 2016) that will be held in Barcelona, Spain, December 12 to 15, 2016 (http://icdm2016.eurecat.org). ICDM is a premier research conference in data mining. It provides an international forum for presentation of original research results, as well as exchange and dissemination of innovative, practical development experiences. The conference covers all aspects of data mining, including algorithms, software and systems, and applications. In addition, ICDM draws researchers and application developers from a wide range of data mining related areas such as statistics, machine learning, pattern recognition, databases and data warehousing, data visualization, knowledge-based systems, and high performance computing. Besides the technical program, the conference will feature workshops, tutorials, panels, the ICDM data mining contest, demos, and the PhD Forum. The ICDM organizers recognize the importance of recruiting and engaging students in data mining research in early stage of their graduate study. The PhD Forum is designed to provide an interactive environment in which PhD students can meet, exchange their ideas and experiences both with peers and with senior researchers from the data mining community in an international scope. Students from underrepresented minority groups are particularly encouraged to apply for support and participate in ICDM.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference seeks to continuously advance the state-of-the-art in data mining. With the growth of the Web, the Internet, and data intensive technologies such as Sensor Networks, and Bioinformatics, Data Mining is an extremely important area in Information Technology. The conference proceedings are published by the IEEE Computer Society Press.</AbstractNarration>
