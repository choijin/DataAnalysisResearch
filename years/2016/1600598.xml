<AbstractNarration>PI: Goel, Ramesh&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: 160059&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;EAGER: Bacteriophage-nanomaterial interactions in the environment-a totally unexplored research area&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Engineered nanoparticles are used in many consumer and industrial products and, eventually released into the environment through different mechanisms. Understanding the fate and transport of metal and metal oxide nanoparticles has been the focus of numerous studies over the past one decade. Efforts now also include understanding the interactions of nanoparticles with biota at different levels. Biocompatibility and antimicrobial activity of nanoparticles have been studied widely in context of selected bacteria. In natural and engineered systems, along with prokaryotes, other tiny entities known as bacteriophages also exist. Bacteriophages are viruses that infect bacteria only through their well-known lytic and lysogenic cycles. However, nothing is known about the effect of engineered nanoparticles on bacteriophages. The overarching goal of this Early Grant for Exploratory Research (EAGER) project is to understand the effect of silver and titanium nanoparticles on the infectivity of bacteriophages. The project will use lytic phages specific for antibiotic resistant bacteria and will study the effect of silver and titanium nanoparticles on plaque formation, oxidation of protein coat forming the body of bacteriophages and attachment of nanoparticles to phage particles.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project has three distinct objectives; (1) Evaluate the interactions of silver and titanium NPs with bacteriophages isolated from natural ecosystems using microscopic techniques, (2)  evaluate the infectivity of lytic phages specific to pathogenic antibiotic-resistant bacteria after these lytic phages are exposed to different types of NPs and, (3) formulate a mechanistic understanding using molecular modeling. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results from this innovative research will establish a platform for advancing scientific knowledge in the area of nanoparticle-phage interactions. In addition, the outcomes of the proposed research will impact other disciplines such as environmental microbiology, aquatic toxicology and environmental nanoscience and engineering. For example, the results from this research may guide phage mediated drug delivery systems and enable more holistic approached for drug therapies to be developed. Also, sustainable approaches for environmental protection can also emanate from the results of this project if successful.  In the area of science education, the PI will: 1) integrate findings in his graduate and undergraduate courses, (2) incorporate this novel topic into an ongoing high school summer program in order to enhance high school laboratory research and (3) disseminate findings through conferences and peer reviewed journal articles.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Nanotechnology has rapidly expanded with applications in electronics, contaminant remediation, toy manufacturing, drug delivery and food processing. Engineered nanomaterials (ENMs) are being used to manufacture items such as scratchproof sunglasses, bactericidal paints, non-stick surfaces, stain-resistant and smell-resistant fabrics, and improved photovoltaic solar cells . The ENMs most used in consumer products are silver, titanium, carbon nanotubes, iron oxide, silica, zinc and gold with the main applications in antimicrobial protection, coatings and health products. ENMs have been shown to be toxic to microorganisms, algae, macroinvertebrates and fish in aquatic systems. While we have learned a great deal about the negative effects of ENMs on different living entities, research on the effect of ENMs on viruses remains largely unexplored. Bacteriophages, viruses that infect bacteria, make up the majority of organisms on earth and have a profound impact on prokaryotic life everywhere, tempering microbial populations and promoting biodiversity though predation and gene transfer. Some studies, mostly involving silver nanoparticles and human viruses, suggest that silver ENMs can inactivate human viruses of different types, such as HIV-1, monkey pox virus, hepatitis B, distemper and adeno viruses, among others. However, these limited efforts did illustrate any mechanisms of interactions between viruses and ENMs and, ENMs used were not well characterized in terms of their surface charge, solution chemistry and agglomeration.             Understanding ENM and bacteriophage interactions is important for various reasons including recent developments related to phage mediated nanodrug delivery and the fact that bacteriophages may act as a carrier for ENMs in the environment and thus support the transport of ENMs in aquatic systems. These are many unaswered questions related to ENM-phage interactions. The overall goal of this EAGER grant was to generate preliminary findings related to phage-ENM interactions. The main outcomes of this project are listed below.  1. The results shows that indeed metal nanoparticles affect phage growth cycles in a negative as well as positive way.  2. One-step growth curve studies indicated that the presence of these nanoparticles, and the associated ions of silver, produce pronounced effects on lytic infection of certain bacteriophages.  3. Effects include 96% reductions in post-infection phage yield after phage were incubated with silver nanoparticles and 28% - 43% reductions from the presence of Ag+ alone.  4. When some phages were exposed to silver nanoparticles coated with poly-N-vinyl-2 pyrrolidone (PVP), an increase in final phage yield by as much as 250% was observed compared with the same phage not incubated with nanoparticles.  5. A proposed mechanism, observed by transmission electron microscopy, is the binding of metal nanomaterials to phage virions, resulting in potentially inhibitory steric effects to host attachment and effective localized Ag+ concentrations.
