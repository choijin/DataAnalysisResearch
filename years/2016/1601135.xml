<AbstractNarration>Living within the leaves of every plant species on our planet are diverse communities of microscopic fungi, known as fungal endophytes. Unlike pathogens that cause plant disease, fungal endophytes can be beneficial for their plant hosts. Due to their variety of health benefits for plants, there is currently great interest in using endophytes in sustainable agriculture and biological control. Although recent research has begun characterizing endophyte communities and their functions in agricultural crops and other plants, we lack basic knowledge of how endophytes benefit the plants in which they live. Just as we understand the mechanisms by which drugs promote human health, understanding the mechanisms by which endophytes interact with plant physiology and the immune system is imperative for using these fungi in restoration ecology and sustainable agriculture. This research will work to uncover these mechanisms, improving knowledge of how and why plants and fungal endophytes form and maintain their beneficial relationships. Additionally, this research will train undergraduate students, as well as high school students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will use Theobroma cacao, the cacao tree, as a host species for studying assembly, maintenance, and function of the plant-endophyte interaction. First, the researchers will use total RNA sequencing to understand how changes in plant and fungal gene expression underlie increased plant pathogen resistance following application of leaf litter to conspecific seedlings. The researchers expect that exposure to leaf litter, a source of endophytic inoculum, will not only alter baseline gene expression in plants, but will also change how plants respond genetically to pathogen infection. Second, this project will use stable-isotope techniques to track the nutrient exchange between plants and endophytes, and determine if plants "pay" endophytes to mount an immune response against their enemies. The researchers hypothesize that plants can direct nutrients toward more beneficial endophytic fungi.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In early dissertation work, I showed that experimentally manipulating local spore sources and vertical stratification within the forest canopy affects community assembly in the fungal microbiome of Theobroma cacao (cacao, the source of chocolate). I further showed that these differentially assembled microbial communities then have direct effects on host health. Specifically, exposing cacao seedlings to leaf litter from healthy conspecific adults enriched the seedling microbiome with a fungal endophyte known to enhance pathogen resistance of cacao seedlings by upregulating host defense pathways. As a result, seedlings exposed to healthy conspecific leaf litter experienced reduced pathogen damage (published in Proceedings of the Royal Society B). Analogous processes of "seeding" a healthy microbiome into hosts have been documented in human microbiome studies, including fecal transplants and maternal transmission of a healthy microbiome to infants.  My Doctoral Dissertation Improvement Grant allowed me to improve this experiment by using RNA sequencing to more rigorously define how host and microbial gene expression drives patterns of community assembly and plant pathogen resistance. I am currently analyzing these data and will be preparing a manuscript for publication.  Using stable isotope techniques, I also tested how interactions between endophyte and pathogen species alter the uptake and distribution of resources within cacao plants. I found that inoculation with a protective endophyte increased nitrogen (N) uptake in cacao seedlings. Additionally, when challenged with a foliar pathogen, leaf Nincreased with increasing foliar damage, but only when leaves were co-inoculated with the protective endophyte. In the absence of the endophyte, there was no relationship between N and pathogen damage, suggesting context-dependent N allocation to endophytes when they are most likely to have a beneficial effect (i.e., pathogen defense) (manuscript in revision for resubmission).  Recent research has examined how endophytic fungi and nutrient cycling interact during the process of litter decomposition, but here I demonstrate that endophyte colonization can also affect the plant N cycle prior to leaf senescence by modifying N uptake of living plants.
