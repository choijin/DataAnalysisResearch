<AbstractNarration>Nitrogen is a vital plant nutrient, and its availability often limits tree growth. The microbial process of denitrification removes available nitrogen from ecosystems and produces a range of nitrogen gases, including nitrous oxide, a potent greenhouse gas. Earth system models often fail to capture the magnitude or global distribution of these nitrogen gas losses. Denitrification occurs under low-oxygen conditions, and measurements are complicated by both analytical challenges and tremendous spatial and temporal variation. This project will apply a suite of measurement approaches to test hypotheses about the way that several environmental factors regulate denitrification, and it will improve the representation of denitrification in an important earth system model. This research has important implications for policies regulating nitrogen as an air and water pollutant, and improvements to the earth system model support international science and policy programs for predicting future environmental change.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will advance understanding of the environmental regulation of denitrification in both field studies at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest in New Hampshire and as represented by the Community Land Model (CLM-CN). At Hubbard Brook, the project will test the role of several environmental factors hypothesized to regulate denitrification, including soil oxygen levels, soil depth, rainfall variability, soil warming, and soil acidification. The project will deploy measurement approaches that include soil core-based fluxes of nitrogen gases, continuous soil oxygen sensors, chamber-based gas fluxes, and nitrate stable isotopes. Together these measurements will provide a comprehensive assessment of denitrification and its environmental drivers, and will enable this project to improve representation of plant-microbe competition and carbon-nitrogen-oxygen biogeochemistry in the Community Land Model. The project will also train two graduate students and one postdoctoral associate, and it will offer hands-on biogeochemistry boot camps for diverse groups of graduate students on the advanced techniques used for measuring greenhouse gas emissions and related ecosystem processes.</AbstractNarration>
