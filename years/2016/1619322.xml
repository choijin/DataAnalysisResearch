<AbstractNarration>The project explores building support for malware detection in hardware.   Malware detection is challenging and resource intensive, as the number and sophistication of malware increases.  The resource requirements for malware detection limit its use in practice, leaving malware unchecked on many systems.  We use a low level hardware detector to identify malware as a computational anomaly using low level features such as hardware events, instruction mixes and memory address patterns.  Once malware is suspected, we inform a higher level software detection or protection mechanism that can focus its resources only on suspected malware.  The detector uses low complexity machine learning approaches to classify malware from normal programs using implementations that are feasible in hardware.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project explores countermeasures based on adversarial machine learning to limit attackers trying to evade detection, develops secure integration between the hardware and software detection, and evaluates implementation tradeoffs. The project contributes a new approach to improve the effectiveness of malware detection and to allow systems to be protected continuously without requiring the large resource investment needed by software monitors.  The project holds the promise of significantly impacting an area of critical national need to help secure systems against the expanding threats of malware.  The principles pursued in the proposal can generalize to different computational environments including mobile phones, clouds, and cyberphysical systems.</AbstractNarration>

Finally, the project demonstrated that the  integrated hardware-software framework extends to other types of  security monitoring, such as dynamic information flow tracking.  New  hardware designs to address emerging attacks that are rooted in hardware  vulnerabilities, such as side-channel attacks on SMT processors, were  also explored.  These new techniques, designs, and analyses represent  the intellectual merit contributions of this project.    The project also produced datasets and analytical models for reasoning  about the performance impact of hardware detectors.  Several  publications in top conferences came out of the project, and have made  substantial impact including receiving a high number of citations  already, and being featured in technical press.  A research highlight  was in Nature electronics was written about the project contributing to  the dissemination of its results.  Several graduate and undergraduate  students have been trained and supported on this grant.  The primary PhD  student supported by the project graduated and started a tenure track  position at George Mason University.
