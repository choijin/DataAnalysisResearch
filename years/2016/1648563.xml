<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is the expansion of autonomous unmanned aerial systems (UAS, or drones) to new maritime operational environments and commercial markets. The proposed technology will enable small UAS to operate from vessels moving at sea, without the need for a dedicated pilot or installed hardware, even while far from shore and beyond the reach of established communication networks. Small UAS can offer the same aerial perspective provided by manned helicopters at a fraction of the size, cost, and risk. Real-time aerial imagery from UAS will supply maritime operators with invaluable information about their surroundings at sea, which is not available by any other means. This information is critical for many maritime applications, including fishing, ocean monitoring, scientific exploration, maritime surveillance, and search, and rescue. This information will offer a particularly large and immediate impact for 98% of worldwide commercial fishing vessels (those that do not carry embarked manned helicopters for fish-finding) by dramatically reducing their fuel costs; providing net economic and environmental gains for the industry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project will develop algorithms and software to enable small UAS autonomously and reliably land onto a moving platform at sea. Commercially-available small UAS can offer invaluable real-time aerial imagery for maritime operators. But, this technology is not currently in widespread use due to technological barriers. In particular, the key enabling technology is the ability to autonomously and reliably land a small UAS onto a moving platform. The research objective is to develop algorithms and software that enable small UAS to autonomously operate from moving vessels at sea. Computer vision algorithms automatically detect the host vessel and the dedicated landing area. Data fusion algorithms estimate the relative drone-boat position and orientation in real time, including compensation for vessel roll, pitch, &amp; heave. Precision control algorithms optimize the drone?s trajectory for save, reliable, autonomous launch and landing. A prototype system will be built by integrating the STTR-developed software with commercially available hardware components.</AbstractNarration>

However, today&rsquo;s drones still suffer from some severe capability limitations. We call them the &ldquo;STOP&rdquo; problems. First, drone operation requires a skilled operator who needs stop what he or she doing to pilot the drone. Second, the operator must physically stop moving; this is because drone guidance systems were not designed to operate from a moving vehicle or a moving vessel at sea. These &ldquo;stop&rdquo; problems have severely limited drone utilization and commercialization in many industries and government operations, including fishing, offshore energy production, oceanographic research, Naval operations, Coast Guard, and Border Patrol. There is an immediate need and market opportunity for drones capable of &ldquo;on-the-move&rdquo; operations.&nbsp;</p> <p>Current drone technology does not facilitate operating a drone from a moving vehicle or a moving vessel at sea. Furthermore, GPS-based navigation is not fast or precise enough for high-precision landing on a moving vehicle or vessel. Vehicular and vessel-based mobile launch and landing is extremely difficult, due to the movement of the vehicle/vessel, winds and turbulence, and the high precision control required during launch and landing.&nbsp;</p> <p>Under NSF STTR award #1648563 Planck Aerosystems and Brigham Young University developed technology to enable drones to safely and reliably operate from moving vehicles and moving vessels at sea. Our technology development addressed both the moving-base navigation problem (i.e. the &ldquo;STOP&rdquo; problems described above), and high-precision launch and landing required for operating from small mobile platforms.
