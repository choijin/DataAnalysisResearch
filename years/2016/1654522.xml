<AbstractNarration>The study of scissors congruence has two major influences.  The first is purely geometric, asking which shapes can be cut up and rearranged into one another.  For example, given 250 sq ft of carpet, is it always possible to carpet a 250 sq ft room with it?  One may think that this depends on the shape of the room, but it actually does not: assuming that both the carpet and the room have straight sides, it is always possible.  However, this is no longer true with three dimensions: if you have a 100 cu in box to fill with foam rubber and I give you 100 cu in of foam rubber, you may not be able to fill up the box because the rubber may be the wrong shape.  Generalizing these problems to other dimensions and geometries is very difficult, and very little is known about the answers.  The second influence is more philosophical: as mathematicians, we often address problems by "cutting" them up into smaller problems, solving each of the smaller problems and the reassembling the solutions.  However, there is always an important last step: figuring out whether there is a unique way to reassemble a solution to the large problem, or whether there are many.  The current project on scissors congruence addresses these issues simultaneously by constructing a framework for "cutting" and "pasting" together different kinds of "objects," be they shapes or mathematical objects.  This framework allows us to analyze all such questions together and learn more about the difficulties that arise when reassembling solutions.  In addition, it has applications in many different subfields of mathematics, including algebraic geometry, logic, number theory and category theory, producing a novel viewpoint from which to unify different problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A scissors congruence problem is the problem of classifying certain objects (such as definable sets, varieties, or polytopes) up to decomposition and isomorphism. Using previously developed techniques for turning a scissors congruence problem into a spectrum, this project continues analyzing scissors congruence problems through the lens of stable homotopy theory. This project has three general objectives: (1) analyzing the Grothendieck ring of varieties using the higher homotopical information present in the scissors congruence spectrum, (2) extending results of Goncharov relating mixed Tate motives to spherical scissors congruence groups to scissors congruence spectra, and (3) exploring the possibility of using scissors congruence spectra for developing spectrum-valued motivic integration. By generalizing classical maps between scissors congruence problems to scissors congruence spectra we hope to produce new geometric and algebraic invariants which will extend understanding of these problems.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Many mathematical objects can be analyzed by cutting them into pieces, studying the pieces individually, and then reassembling our understanding of the pieces into an understanding of the whole.  Some objects have the property that they are "local": if you understand the object at each point, then you understand the object everywhere.  For example, once the value of a function is known at every point in the domain, the entire function is known.  Other objects have "global" structure, as well as local: for example, the difference between a mobius strip and a cylinder is in how it is glued together.  There is a significant body of mathematical theory on how to study local information, and on cases in which local information determines global information.  The study of how local information can be glued to become global information is much more difficult: the question of manifold gluing and K-theory is difficult, and often intractable.  The goal of this project was to develop a novel theory of such decomposition and assembly in a new context: scissors congruence.  Classically, scissors congruence deals with classification of polygons (and higher-dimensional polytopes) up to cutting and rearrangement.  The answer to the question of which polygons can be cut up into pieces and rearranged into one another is known: two polygons that have the same area can always be cut up into finitely many pairwise-congruent polygons.  (In other words, any two polygons with the same area are scissors congruent.)  For polyhedra (and four-dimensional polytopes) this question is also known, although the answer is much more complicated: the polyhedra must have the same volume and the same Dehn invariant (a measure which is, at some level, the "sum of the angles" of the polyhedron).  For higher dimensions, and in other geometries, the question is wide open.  Moreover, scissors congruence with other objects (manifolds, varieties, finite sets) appears in many fields of mathematics.  However, no general theory for analyzing such questions existed.  In this project we developed two new approaches for analyzing questions of scissors congruence: the notion of a "CGW-category" and the construction of "squares K-theory."  We also developed the notion of an "assembler" (defined by the PI prior to this grant).  All of these are tools for creating a measure for the complexity of a scissors congruence problem.  The goal of the project was to construct a method for capturing and enriching well-known invariants of such problems (such as the volume and Dehn invariant for scissors congruence, or various motivic measures for the K-theory of varieties) into the general framework of scissors congruence problems and investigating the new information this enrichment grants us.  In addition to developing the theory of the objects mentioned earlier, this project has achieved the following:  In a collaboration with Jonathan Campbell and Jesse Wolfson, the PI has constructed classical notions of Euler characteristic for varieties, both over the complex numbers and over finite characteristic, to the K-theory of varieties.  This has produced interesting new measures on automorphism groups of varieties, as well as proving that the Grothendieck spectrum of varieties (the measure of how difficult scissors congruence of varieties is) has interesting information beyond a measure of which varieties are scissors congruent. In a collaboration with Jonathan Campbell, the PI has extended Quillen's classical theorems of devissage and localization to geometric contexts with scissors congruence information, and used this to prove that Campbell's and the PIs constructions of the K-theory of varieties are equivalent. The PI has further developed the theory of assemblers and has shown that the K-theory of assemblers preserves a natural product structure.  This has allowed the PI to find further interesting measures on scissors congruence problems. In collaboration with Irina Bobkova, Gemma Halliwell, Eva Hoening, Ayelet Lindenstrauss, Kate Poirier, and Birgit Richter, the PI has developed new computational techniques for approximations to classical notions of K-theory.     Broader Impacts: while supported by the grant, the PI has been involved in several enrichment activities for local elementary- and middle-school students, including teaching an after-school class on the mathematics of infinity, coaching the local middle-school math team, and presenting at a local math club.  In addition, the PI has founded a math circle for K-2 children in the local area, with weekly meetings to teach young children about mathematics beyond the school curriculum.
