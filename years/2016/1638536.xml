<AbstractNarration>This project will identify how emerging social differentiation can affect household quality of life and community social cohesion in traditional societies. How do local households negotiate an expected quality of life? Do community interactions shift to become more exclusive and focused on elite members of society? Archaeologists have postulated that political authority and economic practices are not just a coercive component of the ruling elite; rather, household quality of life and social cohesion are a balance of wants and needs of both high status groups and everyday people that are grounded in moral expectations and communal trust. Recent political science studies show pronounced social inequality not only undermines trust at the community level, it also threatens governing bodies and civic engagement. The goal of this project is to add meaningfuly to these current conversations because it provides rich data sets of long-term change on how people negotiate, successfully and unsuccessfully, power dynamics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By comparing households and communal spaces, Barry Kidder will examine how household quality of life and community-building interactions changed (or did not) during this transitional period at the Mayan site of Ucanha. Preliminary research indicates a high quality of life and commnunal prosperity during a former period but greater inequality during a latter. Combining broad-scale excavations, geochemical studies in conjunction with spatial statistics, and the analysis of archaeological and paleobotanical remains, Kidder and colleagues will reconstruct past household quality of life by examining five variables: 1) architectural investment, 2) feasting practices, 3) diversity of household goods, 4) costliness of caching/burial rituals, and 5) the use of space. Spatial statistics with geochemical analysis, particularly, will improve archaeology's ability to study ancient households by capturing patterns of overlooked past activity. Furthermore, this project will contribute to local household quality of life by training descendant communities in archaeological methods that will lead to future employment since archaeological salvage projects are rapidly expanding in the area. By working locally, as opposed to seasonal work in Cancun, salaries will be reinvested in local households and the entire community. Research results will be circulated as presentations, summarized field reports, and hands-on activities at local schools. These components will give local populations the opportunity to engage with their cultural heritage and to be a stakeholder in its preservation.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This project chronicles whether or not social inequality increased among households and investigates the processes of community formation in Ucanha, Yucatan, Mexico, at the time it was physically integrated by a long-distance roadway with a larger regional polity headed by Uc&iacute; around the Terminal Preclassic/Early Classic (100 BCE &ndash; CE 400) transition. In order to measure social inequality at the household level, Kidder applies concepts from quality of life studies to analyze four variables: architectural energetics, feasts, household assemblages, and caching/burial rituals. Results from excavations indicate household assemblages during the Late Preclassic included nearly equal access to fancy bichrome ceramics. Given Ucanha&rsquo;a built landscape, which included a series of roadways and large plazas, coupled with this distribution pattern, Kidder argues household provisioning of these goods resulted from incipient marketplace exchange. Patterns from household assemblages at Ucanha indicate access to Early Classic polychromes, however, were unequal, suggesting a shift in economic distribution networks. This shift included the gifting of imported polychromes from the Pet&eacute;n, thereby excluding some households and increasing social inequality. &nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, ceramics from a sample of Ucanha&rsquo;s residential platforms show a depopulation and drastic reduction in household quality of life.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Architecturally, the megalithic style of building, which appears around the same time as physical integration, was widespread in domestic and monumental contexts. These enormous stones would have required help to find, quarry, carve, and carry thereby augmenting external social networks, which is a sign of higher household quality of life. Gini scores, which measure the distribution of (in)equality of access, show that some households had greater abilities to mobilize labor than others. Excavations from one structure uncovered evidence for large-scale feasting, which was a common means to mobilize labor. This evidence included an in-tact oven; faunal remains of deer and turkey, both of which are associated with more elite feasts in the Maya area; and high concentrations of fancy ceramic serving and preparation wares dating exclusively to the Late Preclassic. Unfortunately, household excavations did not encounter burials or caches, both of which have been nodes of social differentiation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>At the community level during the Late Preclassic, massive amounts of labor were mobilized to construct roadways and monumental architecture. These collective projects materialized the community in these finished works and functioned as reminder of civic pride on the lived landscape of Ucanha. Four roadways that converged at a central plaza provided a spatial metaphor that marked this area as the place of creation, drawing people towards Ucanha. This infrastructure likely held ritual processions in which people moved to the four-corners of the world, a common trope for animating a landscape. In the central plaza, excavations from the building on the north side uncovered a Late Preclassic megalithic staircase that led to a broad raised platform that would have likely held ritual performances. Given that evidence elsewhere indicates the presence of possible kingship, ritual performances would have been an integral component of galvanizing the masses. Ceramic evidence included massive serving vessels that suggest large-scale food consumption accompanied these performances. Results from geochemical analyses from plaster floors showed high levels of heavy elements associated with pigment production located next to large pyramids suggesting colorful regalia was part of the show. These community engagements would have strengthened social cohesion during the Late Preclassic, a time of demographic growth, the emergence of centralized authority, and new expressions of social distinction; yet, by the Early Classic this space was enclosed by a wall and ceramic evidence indicates this area became less intensively used. Interestingly, a Late Classic burial was found in the central plaza, which implies a significant individual claim over a previously more communal space.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Archaeology can meaningfully add to current conversations on inequality because it provides rich data sets of long-term change on how people negotiate, successfully and unsuccessfully, power dynamics. More specifically, household archaeology has the ability to generate comparative data sets across time and in differing geopolitical, environmental, and social landscapes that can be used as case studies by disciplines such as political science, sociology, and geography to historically contextualize the relationship between social inequality and political-economic institutions. While incipient leaders were successful at fostering wellbeing for Ucanha&rsquo;s Late Preclassic population, both at the household level through access to fancy ceramics and at the community level through social engagement, subsequent leadership failed to attend to the needs of the general populace. Instead, elites focused more on forging inter-elite alliances through gifting polychromes and more tightly controlling access to sacred space. As a result, people voted with their feet and left Ucanha. Now, just as in the past, we must approach social inequality from top-down and bottom-up perspectives to more fully comprehend the constellation of wants and needs at play and how authority as well as household standard of living is a give and take between all actors. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 03/05/2019<br>      Modified by: Barry&nbsp;Kidder</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1638536/1638536_10445832_1551500637782_SitemapUcanha--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1638536/1638536_10445832_1551500637782_SitemapUcanha--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Site Map of Ucanha"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1638536/1638536_10445832_1551500637782_SitemapUcanha--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Site Map of Ucanha"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Map of Ucanha showing site proposed site boundaries.
