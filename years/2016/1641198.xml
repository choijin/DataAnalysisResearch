<AbstractNarration>Climate change projections for this century suggest that the Southern Ocean will be the first region to be affected by seawater chemistry changes associated with enhanced carbon dioxide (CO2). Additionally, regions of the Southern Ocean are warming faster than any other locations on the planet. Ocean acidification and warming may act synergistically to impair the performance of different organisms by simultaneously increasing metabolic needs and reducing oxygen transport. However, no studies have measured krill acid-base regulation, metabolism, growth, or reproduction in the context of ocean acidification or synergistic ?greenhouse? conditions of elevated CO2 and temperature. In the present project, the investigators will conduct both short and prolonged exposure experiments at Palmer Station, Antarctica to determine the responses of Euphausia superba to elevated CO2 and temperature. The investigators will test hypotheses related to acid-base compensation and acclimation of various life stages of krill to elevated CO2 and temperature. Furthermore, they will determine these impacts on feeding, respiration, metabolism, growth, and reproduction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Antarctic krill, Euphausia superba, is a key species in Antarctic food webs as they are a primary food source for many of the top predators in the Southern Ocean including baleen whales, seals, penguins, and other sea birds. This project will determine the responses of Antarctic krill exposed to elevated CO2 and temperature and whether or not krill have the capacity to fully compensate under future ocean conditions. The proposed field effort will be complemented by an extensive broader impact effort focused on bringing marine science to both rural and urban high school students in the Midwest (Kansas). The core educational objectives of this proposal are to 1) instruct students about potential careers in marine science, 2) engage students and promote their interest in the scientific process, critical thinking, and applications of science, mathematics, and technology, and 3) and increase student and teacher awareness and understanding of the oceans and global climate change, with special focus on the Western Antarctic Peninsula region. Finally, this project will engage undergraduate and graduate students in the production, analysis, presentation and publication of datasets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

Specifically, we investigated short- (days) and long- (weeks) term effects of these climate-related variables on their metabolism and acid-base status.  We conducted two extensive field expeditions at Palmer Station, Antarctica in 2013 and 2014.  Krill, as important components in the diet of fish, penguins, and whales, are critical indicators of the health of Antarctic ecosystem.  Previous studies have suggested that krill populations are sensitive to enironmental changes including warming and acidification that result from elevated atmospheric CO2.  A highly pH-sensitive blood-oxygen transport protein (hemocyanin) suggested the possibility of reduced metabolism and scope for growth.  However, our study found no independent effect of CO2 on metabolism despite a reduction in blood pH under elevated PCO2 (800 ppm) and high temperature (3&deg;C).  Blood pH was not reduced at ambient temperature (0&deg;C).  A small increase in temperature lead to a pronounced elevation in metabolism that could diminish energy available for growth and reproduction.  Ongoing studies in collaboration with Rutgers University are exploring the effects of CO2 and temperature on feeding and growth in Antarctic krill.  We conducted an outreach and education project called "Planting Antarctica in Kansas" (PARKA) with the goal of bringing marine climate change and polar research to high school students in a land-locked region of the country that may have limited direct exposure to such research.
