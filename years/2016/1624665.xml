<AbstractNarration>This project will prepare a 5-year strategic plan for the Northern Kentucky University (NKU) Research and Education Field Station (REFS). This station is located adjacent to the St. Anne Woods and Wetlands (SAWW), 155 acres of conservation easement natural areas on and near the Ohio River. REFS is located in the Outer Bluegrass Ecoregion, with open- and closed-canopy forested wetlands, upland grassland, and wooded natural areas containing substantial old growth forest, primarily dominated by beech. Although current and past ecological research at SAWW has included some national data collection programs, the breadth and depth of studies have been limited by the lack of laboratory facilities at the site. The acquisition and recent refurbishment of a building by NKU and associated land as its first field station opens the door to new research initiatives and associated education and outreach opportunities. This project is significant in that it will provide a plan of action for both enhancing and building university research and education programs while initiating and developing P-12 and community outreach programs. The field station provides a space for activities that were previously not possible, including indoor laboratory and field processing procedures, meetings, research and education workspace, storage, and restrooms. Therefore this project is important because it will promote the progress of science in a three-fold manner: namely, it will provide a framework for the new REFS to 1) develop and enrich new and existing field research programs at SAWW to contribute to long-term projects and network with national databases such as our on-going Ecological Research as Education Network (NSF-EREN) studies on litter decomposition and permanent forest plots and active membership in the Kentucky Organization of Field Stations (KOFS), 2) expand ecological and transdisciplinary educational opportunities for undergraduates, and 3) increase engagement with our community partners (business, government, education, nonprofit organizations, and public-at-large) to expand learning and research opportunities, enhance nature awareness, and increase environmental literacy to create a better informed public.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The St. Anne Woods and Wetlands (SAWW) contain 155 acres of conservation easement natural areas on and near the Ohio River. It is located in the Outer Bluegrass Ecoregion, with open- and closed-canopy forested wetlands, upland grassland, and wooded natural areas containing substantial old growth forest, primarily dominated by beech. Research at SAWW began over 100 years ago by E. Lucy Braun and most recently has focused on field biology (amphibian and reptile diversity, plant diversity, bird nesting biology), biogeochemical processes, monitoring of the impacts of introduced and invasive species, and the restoration of damaged systems. Through these projects, scientists at Northern Kentucky University (NKU) have also trained undergraduates in field research. Our intent through this project to develop a 5-year field station strategic plan to create a systematic organization of research activities that can be networked with other sites on local, regional, and/or national bases, particularly for long-term data sets. The newly acquired NKU Research and Education Field Station (REFS), which is located adjacent to SAWW and only a few minutes from the NKU campus, will centralize these research efforts and allow for processing and analyses of samples, receive monitoring instrumentation output, and complement field studies. The planning process will facilitate the establishment of a budget-conscious field station usage plan and supply direction for the incorporation of new technologies in monitoring studies and communication informatics. Simultaneously, it will provide incentives for broader research use of this facility by NKU faculty and others. These activities will begin with our current participation in the Ecological Research as Education Network (NSF-EREN) and the Kentucky Organization of Field Stations (KOFS). The proximity of the field station to the NKU campus will expand opportunities for ecological undergraduate instruction while providing unique transdisciplinary teaching opportunities over a range of other disciplines. REFS will expand our partnerships with businesses, educational institutions, non-profit organizations, and the public-at-large to catalyze regional growth and vitality. To do so, the facility will enhance community outreach activities for P-12 schools to improve college readiness, host summer camps, and facilitate teacher continuing education. The plan will also incorporate the use of the field station and SAWW by the NKU Center for Environmental Restoration, an instructional-based environmental consulting center, to train undergraduates in improved techniques of land management and restoration. The station website (http://stannewetlands.org/) provides an overview of activities that have been done at SAWW.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p><strong>Overview:</strong></p> <p>This NSF FSML supported project resulted in the development of a five-year strategic plan for the Northern Kentucky University (NKU) Research and Education Field Station (REFS). REFS has a mission of enhancing the University&rsquo;s strategic goals by serving as a center for environmental and ecological discovery and learning by using natural areas as a classroom and laboratory for scholars, students, and the broader community. REFS and the Campbell County Conservation District (CCCD) work to use, manage, and conserve the adjacent St. Anne Woods and Wetlands (SAWW) natural areas. These contain 155 acres (63 ha) of open and closed canopy wetlands along the Ohio River, upland old-growth forest, secondary forests, and associated grasslands. While E. Lucy Braun initiated research here over 100 years, most has occurred over the past 10 years, with field studies on ecological impacts of invasive species, biogeochemical processes, amphibian and reptile ecology, bird nesting biology, environmental restoration, and Ecological Research as Education Network (NSF-EREN) studies on litter decomposition and permanent forest plots. These areas are also used for coursework-related field activities and outreach programs. The acquisition of a small building, now newly refurbished, with associated land opens an array of new research initiatives and associated education and outreach opportunities. The facility supports a number of functions that were previously not possible, including indoor laboratory and field-processing research, meetings, workspace, and restrooms. Thus, the timing was optimal for a strategic plan for REFS, and it will be used to guide us toward the development of a successful and functional field station.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>In the spring of 2017, a REFS Steering Committee comprised of NKU faculty, the Center for Environmental Restoration director, and the Campbell County Conservation District director began work on the REFS five-year strategic plan. Stakeholder groups in research, university curriculum, community and P-12 outreach, and university administration met for two separate strategic planning conferences. They drafted vision and mission statements and conducted a SWOT (Strength-Weakness-Opportunities-Threat) organizational analysis of REFS. A sustainability plan to address the SWOT assessment was then used to develop a set of goals for programming, operations, and management of REFS. Visits to regional field stations and two Organization of Biological Field Stations (OBFS) meetings provided additional direction and assistance in the development of this strategic plan. The seven broad strategic goals for REFS include: 1) to support and expand research and creative activities for NKU and non-NKU scholars and students; 2) to acquire and maintain staff for effective station operations; 3) to upgrade REFS facilities to accommodate building space and cyberinfrastructure; 4) to serve as an ecological and environmental resource center for outdoor-based university curricular activities; 5) to become a center for nature-learning for the community and P-12 students in the Northern Kentucky Region; 6) to seek financial sustainability as a field station while REFS functions as a field-based research and education unit within NKU; and 7) to aid in the conservation of the SAWW natural areas managed by the CCCD.<em> </em>In addition to the SWOT analysis and the sustainability plan, a budget model canvas and an evaluation plan to measure success were also developed for REFS.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Intellectual Merit:</strong></p> <p>The prioritized goals of the strategic plan call for expanded scholarly activity, student training in field studies, and university courses from all disciplines at NKU, state-wide through the Kentucky Organization of Field Stations (KOFS), and to other regional universities at REFS. We already see results, with new research activities and classes from Xavier University, Cincinnati State, and the University of Louisville. An increase in REFS staffing, however, is needed to manage station operations, research activities, and other programs. Proposals to NSF FSLM and other agencies are planned and are also necessary to fund REFS facility space capacity expansion and upgrading cyberinfrastructure to accommodate increased research activities and support a standard university class size (24-26). This plan will allow for systematic organized research activities and networking with other sites on a local to national basis and an interactive data management program with a digital data archive. The plan facilitates budget-conscious usage and supply directions for the incorporation of new technologies and field programs, while using communication informatics in a budget model canvas. Simultaneously, this plan provides incentives for broader research and curriculum use of this facility.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Broader Impacts:</strong></p> <p>This plan uses the proximity of REFS to the NKU campus to promote expanded outdoor-based undergraduate instruction and interdisciplinary teaching opportunities. This plan also facilitates enhanced community engagement and outreach programs for K-12 education, summer camps, and teacher continuing education, as well as for the general public. Moreover, REFS will function as a regional nature center for Northern Kentucky, a techniques of land management and restoration training center, and a conduit for NKU and KOFS outreach programs. A REFS on-line presence is also planned to provide many more opportunities to connect and engage the public with nature.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 03/17/2018<br>      Modified by: Richard&nbsp;D&nbsp;Durtsche</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1624665/1624665_10437230_1521244931140_NKU_REFS_A--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1624665/1624665_10437230_1521244931140_NKU_REFS_A--rgov-800width.jpg" title="NKU REFS Logo"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1624665/1624665_10437230_1521244931140_NKU_REFS_A--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="NKU REFS Logo"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Logo of the Northern Kentucky University Research and Education Field Station</div> <div class="imageCredit">Michael Frazier, Marketing Department, Northern Kentucky University</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyright owner is an institution with an existing agreement allowing use by NSF</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Richard&nbsp;D&nbsp;Durtsche</div> <div class="imageTitle">NKU REFS Logo</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1624665/1624665_10437230_1521246276902_GMOX0483--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1624665/1624665_10437230_1521246276902_GMOX0483--rgov-800width.jpg" title="NKU REFS Main Facility"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1624665/1624665_10437230_1521246276902_GMOX0483--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="NKU REFS Main Facility"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">NKU Research and Education Field Station main facility at the Grand Opening</div> <div class="imageCredit">NKU Photographer</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyright owner is an institution with an existing agreement allowing use by NSF</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Richard&nbsp;D&nbsp;Durtsche</div> <div class="imageTitle">NKU REFS Main Facility</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1624665/1624665_10437230_1521247889412_REFSPicts-17--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1624665/1624665_10437230_1521247889412_REFSPicts-17--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Amphibian Research"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1624665/1624665_10437230_1521247889412_REFSPicts-17--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Amphibian Research"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">NKU undergraduate research students marking amphibians in the closed canopy wetlands at NKU REFS to study the impact of invasive plants on amphibian populations in wetlands.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Richard Durtsche</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Richard&nbsp;D&nbsp;Durtsche</div> <div class="imageTitle">Amphibian Research</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1624665/1624665_10437230_1521249420205_REFSPicts-5--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1624665/1624665_10437230_1521249420205_REFSPicts-5--rgov-800width.jpg" title="The Art of Nature Exploration Summer Camp"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1624665/1624665_10437230_1521249420205_REFSPicts-5--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="The Art of Nature Exploration Summer Camp"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Middle school summer camp at NKU REFS, "The Art of Nature Exploration."
