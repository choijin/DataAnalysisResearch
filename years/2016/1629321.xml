<AbstractNarration>This project aims at investigating the impacts of one of the New Deal employment programs during the Great Depression, the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC), which employed young adults from impoverished families as conservation workers in national and state parks. Due to the remote location of the CCC jobs, participants had to move away from their homes in cities and into camps run by military officers.  Narrative evidence suggests that living in these camps led to long-run health and career changes for participants. Though a large literature in labor economics has examined various work programs and subsequent impacts on employment, few studies have examined a program that was implemented on such a large scale. This research is the first to analyze long-run impacts of a large-scale unemployment relief program. This project will provide greater insight into the impact of work training programs and mobility during the Great Depression. Moreover, the project will inform policies regarding national work programs, particularly for periods of economic downturns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigator will examine the effect of CCC participation on human capital attainment, migration, and health by analyzing a novel dataset. This dataset will be composed of personnel records from the Civilian Conservation Corps and individual records from both the 1930 and 1940 US censuses. The 20% sample of the 1930 census will provide a control group to provide counterfactual outcomes for CCC enrollees.  Both CCC enrollees and this control group from 1930 will be matched to the 1940 census so that post-CCC outcomes can be observed. Using this dataset, the investigator will estimate treatment effects of CCC participation to examine the following questions: Did the CCC influence migration across the country? Did participation in the CCC improve participant's subsequent careers? Were participants able to achieve more than they would have without the CCC?</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Most economists and policymakers agree that work programs can have a positive benefit to society as a whole, but there is a need for investigation into the program mechanisms that lead to success. This project aims to provide greater insight into the impact of work training programs and mobility during the Great Depression through analysis of the outcomes of participants in the Civilian Conservation Corps.  This analysis of the outcomes of the Civilian Conservation Corps program can also inform policy regarding national work programs, particularly for periods of deep depression.   The Civilian Conservation Corps was a New Deal Era program that employed over three million young adults and provided relief to their families from 1933 to 1942.   The program is different from other employment programs of the New Deal Era as it involved sending young men away from their homes to camps where they performed conservation work.  At the camps, they received food, education, and monetary payment in return for their service.  There are a number of narrative histories that make use of national and some state level statistics to tell the story of the CCC and how it might have affected its participants and surrounding communities. However, there is presently no rigorous comprehensive quantitative analysis of the long-run outcomes of the participants in this program, which is due to lack of participant data.    The specific goal in our project is to measure the effect of Civilian Conservation Corps participation on human capital attainment, labor market outcomes, migration, longevity, and other measures of economic and social well-being in the short run and in the long run. The longer-term analysis requires matching of the individuals from the CCC with census records from 1940 and later years and with social security records or with military service records.  The purpose of this grant was to enable the collection of a dataset of Civilian Conservation Corps enrollees, which will enable us to perform quantitative analysis of the long-run outcomes of participants in the program.  Over the course of the grant period, a unique dataset was created of Civilian Conservation Corps enrollee records from the National Archives and Records Administration. This is the most comprehensive dataset of Civilian Conservation Corps enrollees in existence and will enable researchers to empirically examine the long-run outcomes of participation in the program.  Unfortunately, the process of obtaining access to the Civilian Conservation Corps personnel records took nine months, which is was the majority of life of the grant, and data collection is still in process.  However, the data is presently being entered from the raw CCC enrollee records and a working paper investigating the CCC effect on internal migration will be produced in the next year. There is also currently work underway to merge the data with the 1940 U.S. Census and determine whether participation in the Civilian Conservation Corps influenced migration. In the future, projects examining health and career outcomes will be completed using the data collected over the life of this grant.  The project also provided valuable experience for undergraduates interested in eeconomics research.  We hired several undergraduates to assist with records collection and transcription of images of records into a dataset.  These undergraduates gained insight into economic history research and the process involved in collecting and processing data for quantitative research projects.
