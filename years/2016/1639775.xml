<AbstractNarration>Making data discovery more efficient, comprehensive and user-friendly is a critical challenge articulated by geoscientists as well as researchers in other fields. While information discovery portals and search engines have been developed for many data repositories, and systems that simultaneously search multiple resources have been created, cross-disciplinary data discovery remains a serious issue. It becomes especially acute with rapid increases in the volume and diversity of observations, reflecting different components of the Earth System and collected by multiple research groups, government organizations and commercial companies. The main goal of the EarthCube Data Discovery Hub project is to greatly reduce the time and effort necessary to locate and evaluate geoscience information resources across disciplines, and increase the value of investment in data generation by promoting data reuse and reducing duplication of effort. Project outcomes will benefit a wide group of scientists by providing them a user-friendly and powerful gateway to information resources across multiple data facilities and community contributions, and mechanisms for improving the system to answer their research queries in a consistent manner. The project will also benefit geoscience research in several ecosystems that are being used as examples to test the data tools being developed, including rivers, coral reefs and other marine ecosystems, and the critical zone where rock, soil, water, air and living organisms interact.&lt;br/&gt;The EarthCube Data Discovery Hub will be developed as a comprehensive data discovery and content enhancement system, which will leverage improved and community-curated metadata descriptions and integrate previously unregistered information sources. The project will further extend, improve and operationalize the inventory catalog developed in an earlier CINERGI (Community Inventory of EarthCube Resources for Geoscience Interoperability) project, which currently includes over 2 million metadata documents from multiple sources. The key technological innovations include: pioneering the development of an automated cross-domain metadata augmentation and curation pipeline enabled by a large integrated geoscience ontology; mechanisms for ?deep registration? of geoscience data from different sources based on a novel data type registry; an online use case management system; and a methodology for processing several types of complex geoscience queries that cannot be answered by existing systems. In addition, the project will support scientific progress in several representative cross-disciplinary research scenarios, using the contexts of river geochemistry, coral reef and other marine ecosystem analysis, and critical zone science. The project will implement innovative community engagement mechanisms, including community annotation of automatically curated metadata, iterative improvement of geoscience ontology based on community feedback, and joint development of cross-disciplinary use cases semantically aligned with data descriptions.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

To fill in gaps in dataset descriptions and otherwise improve metadata quality, the DDStudio project developed a novel metadata enhancement pipeline. It uses text analytics and a set of domain terminologies (ontologies) to augment the original harvested metadata, adding keywords, missing spatial and temporal extents, organization identifiers, and more. To improve confidence in search results, researchers can track enhancement provenance and validate and edit the generated metadata. Also, users have the ability to publish and immediately index additional resource descriptions, thus expanding the catalog with resources that do not appear in harvested repositories. The expanded and enhanced metadata improves spatio-temporal, text-based and faceted searches across domain repositories for a large group of geoscience researchers working across domains. In addition - and this is a unique key feature of DDStudio - it enables matching data resources with a growing collection of exploratory data analysis and visualization tools implemented as Jupyter notebooks. Unlike other data discovery systems which typically do not extend beyond letting users find and download domain-specific data, DDStudio users can launch the additional software tools directly from individual search results or from data collections, using a lightweight interface to pass datasets or collection identifiers to notebooks that can reside on several Jupyter hubs. This links the DDStudio search system with a widely used modern platform for data science, where the discovered data can be further explored, statistically analyzed, and integrated with other data. Working with several domain communities, the project team demonstrated how the DDStudio system can help researchers assemble data collections and implement complex data discovery workflows, in marine biology (determining available temperature, location, weather and bleaching characteristics of coral reefs related to measurements in a given coral reef survey) and river geochemistry (discovering observations relevant to geochemical measurements outside the tidal zone, given specific discharge conditions).</span></p> <p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;" dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">DDStudio has been assessed through multiple testing sessions with users from different geoscience domains to further refine usability of the online user interface; performance and security of the harvesting, semantic indexing, querying, and user interaction components; and to extend data coverage. The project team has disseminated project results as papers and presentations at multiple national and international conferences, including the American Geophysical Union annual meetings, the EarthCube annual meetings, the Eye-on-Earth Summit, BioVision Alexandria, and the Research Data Alliance plenaries. Technologies behind the DDStudio platform have been integrated in other online systems such as ModelMyWatershed and DataMed, while its keyword augmentation pipeline is being adopted by library data curation projects. The project team has worked with several undergraduate student researchers, in particular on enhancing the catalog content and on Jupyter notebook integration; several of these students are now in graduate school pursuing degrees in computer science and data science. Finally, in an unanticipated benefit, DDStudio?s capacity for harvesting, metadata enhancement and indexing of data collections (e.g., spatially-explicit public health datasets and environmental datasets in California) helped meet increased demand for environmental health data related to the COVID-19 pandemic.</span></p> <p style="line-height: 1.38;
