<AbstractNarration>Following its launch, Japan?s cotton spinning industry increased its output more than 20 times from 1888 to 1900, and 2.8 times more from 1900 to 1914. The value of exports exceeded that of imports in 1897, and by the early 1930s the three largest textile firms in the world were all Japanese. This spectacular growth was at the root of the so-called East Asian miracle, the nature and policy implications of which are still subjects of active debate. More than a story of successful technology adoption; the industry created important innovations of its own. The project enables an analysis behind inter-firm productivity differentials and the relative importance of incumbent advantage. The project examines the coevolution of industries, their systems of corporate governance, and labor practices. The project will inform policy decisions concerning the roles of government policies on innovation and competitive advantage. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The project uses detailed, high-quality historical data on the Japanese cotton spinning industry to investigate the important driving factors for the formation and functioning of individual companies. The project digitalizes and brings together various archival records, including detailed operational and financial reports, prices and wages, hired labor, and information about key individuals (founders, major shareholders, executives, top managers and engineers) for the universe of all firms, from the time of the industry?s inception until the end of World War I. Conventional wisdom emphasizes the role of government industry promotion and its protectionist role, but the project?s early results indicate that innovation was spearheaded by private entrepreneurs. New technologies and markets developed through private initiative, as resource reallocation, was facilitated by novel organizational forms and competitive markets.  Government contributed primarily through preventing entrenched monopolies and ensuring the conditions for free entry and fair competition.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Japan, whose remarkable development prompted Robert E. Lucas to place it in its own category in his account of economic growth since the Industrial Revolution,&nbsp;started its transformation by growing its cotton spinning industry--the same industry that had been the key to industrialization in England and elsewhere. In this project, we have conducted an in-depth investigation of key factors that enabled this industry's growth and considered the implications for modern-day developing countries and economic and management research and policy-making in general.</p> <p>The project commenced with data development, during which we digitalized and processed firm-level monthly output data by product varieties, giving us information about product innovation and product diversification (see exhibit 1 for an example of archival data used to create this part of the database). We also compiled a database of machine capacity for each firm from Japanese archival sources (exhibit 2) and collected and digitalized data on the industry's machine orders using records from the Platt Collection archives in Lancashire, England (see exhibit 3 for an example of an archival order used for this). Finally, we completed the database using semi-annual company reports and other Japanese archival sources. From these, we obtained information on members of firms' top management teams (TMTs) and degreed (university- and technical college-educated) engineers employed (see exhibits 4, 5, and 6). All these data were matched to the firm-month-level input-output data and semi-annual financials that we constructed prior to this project. The result was a comprehensive database covering the industry's technology choices, inputs and outputs by varieties, balance sheets and income statements, and top management teams and engineering personnel.</p> <p>In the project's second phase, we utilized this database to examine several key issues related to the industry's spectacular growth. First, we examined the roles of product upgrading and diversification.&nbsp;The literature on industrial organization and endogenous growth has recognized the importance of heterogeneous firms' choices of what products to produce, but has treated product innovation and diversification as separate issues.&nbsp;In contrast, our conceptual and empirical frameworks allow for combined treatment of innovation and diversification, and we opened the "black box" of firms' product varieties choice by utilizing our data on machine orders, TMT composition, and employment of educated engineers. We found that a firm's key first step toward successfully expanding its scale and product portfolio was introducing innovative products beyond its previous technical capabilities. However, because this process involved a high degree of uncertainty, firms tended to introduce innovative products on experimental basis. One particularly novel contribution of this project stems from our discovery that experimenting with technologically challenging, innovative products was not only necessary to capture the market in innovative products, but also facilitated horizontal product differentiation&nbsp;<em>within</em>&nbsp;the firm's previous technical capabilities.&nbsp;We thus establish what we believe is a new insight: growth-enhancing knowledge capital does not arise from omnidirectional expansion efforts. The identity of the new products added to a firm's portfolio is crucially important.&nbsp;</p> <p>We&nbsp;also examined TMT composition for the universe of industry firms through the prism of individual versus shared leadership. Previous research has highlighted&nbsp;how political jockeying&nbsp;negatively affects firm strategy and performance&nbsp;when there are multiple leaders.&nbsp;We found that&nbsp;while&nbsp;most firms indeed experienced power struggles among top management, firms that were available to avoid this and enjoy stable shared leadership had common elements: a focus on&nbsp;long-term value creation rather than short-term gains, adoption of merit-based promotion systems, power-sharing&nbsp;within TMTs to enable efficient division of labor, and honorable resolution of conflicts and ethical breaches.&nbsp;This let them engage in long-term expansion strategies and emerge as "centers of gravity" for industry outputs and talent.</p> <p>Furthermore, spearheaded by a graduate assistant financed by the grant, we conducted a study of the development of the industry's labor market. We found that workers, especially female factory operatives, experienced large wage increases due to intense competition for workers among firms. Moreover, leading firms, including industry-dominant "centers of gravity," consistently paid their workers more than did other firms.</p> <p>We believe the project's detailed examination of the interactions among industry technology, human capital, market demand, and institutions will have broad impact by informing policy debates relevant to today's efforts against poverty and stagnation. Our findings suggest that the value appropriation issues that are often a priority of policy recommendations for development actually take a back seat to creating conditions for unleashing entrepreneurship and technological prowess. The project also shows that stable shared leadership is key to firms emerging as industry centers of gravity, and competitive selection of firms benefits workers who are potentially the most vulnerable, like female factory operatives. Further still, the project has built a decades-long comprehensive dataset on firms and individuals in a crucially important industry that will shortly become available to other researchers through a dedicated NBER site so as to spur future research.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 10/21/2019<br>      Modified by: Serguey&nbsp;Braguinsky</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1632833/1632833_10444444_1571675156354_Exhibit1ProductvarietiesproducedbyfirmsinMarch1900--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1632833/1632833_10444444_1571675156354_Exhibit1ProductvarietiesproducedbyfirmsinMarch1900--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Product varieties produced"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1632833/1632833_10444444_1571675156354_Exhibit1ProductvarietiesproducedbyfirmsinMarch1900--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Product varieties produced"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Part of an archival materials page showing product varieties produced by each firm in Japan's cotton spinning industry in March 1900</div> <div class="imageCredit">Monthly Bulletin of All-Japan Cotton Spinners' Association (Boren)</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Serguey&nbsp;Braguinsky</div> <div class="imageTitle">Product varieties produced</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1632833/1632833_10444444_1571675503832_Exhibit2MachinecapacitybyfirmsJune1903--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1632833/1632833_10444444_1571675503832_Exhibit2MachinecapacitybyfirmsJune1903--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Machine capacity (Japanese archival source)"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1632833/1632833_10444444_1571675503832_Exhibit2MachinecapacitybyfirmsJune1903--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Machine capacity (Japanese archival source)"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">A page from 1905 Menshi B&#333;seki Jij&#333;
