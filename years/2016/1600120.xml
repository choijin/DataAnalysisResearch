<AbstractNarration>Kalamazoo College has received an award through the Improving Undergraduate STEM Education: Education and Human Resources program to hold a conference entitled, "Science and Social Justice Think Tank." The purpose of this working conference is to bring together (1) postsecondary STEM educators, (2) scholars, scientists, and public health professionals, and (3) higher education STEM thought leaders to consider, discuss, and plan for the inclusion of social justice issues in science. The conference includes several keynote addresses by leaders from various sectors who have expertise in science and social justice issues. These presentations are followed by small discussion groups composed of participants who have been working at the intersection of science and social justice. The participants will be tasked with articulating what science and social justice means, thinking about ways to extend and broaden the conversation, and developing a detailed plan for disseminating the products of the conference. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There has been significant attention to ethics in the natural sciences and considerable attention to the introduction of social justice topics in the undergraduate curricula in disciplines such as economics.  However, there has been little consideration of issues of social justice, such as distribution of wealth, opportunities, and privileges within society, in the practice of the natural sciences. By tackling such considerations and how they can be integrated into undergraduate STEM education, the conference will contribute to the preparation of future scientists, as well as the education of a STEM-literate citizenry, providing them with the ability to evaluate STEM research in the context of its impact on society. Results of the conference will be shared through the Science and Social Justice Praxis website hosted at Kalamazoo College.</AbstractNarration>
