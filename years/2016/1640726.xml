<AbstractNarration>The Museum of Science (MOS) will conduct a conference and associated activities to consider ways to foster the STEM workforce via both science research and science communications experiences for students at the high school level.  The work will draw on and expand the scope in the USA of the NSF-funded National Living Laboratory Network which currently involves more than 350 institutions across 48 states and 21 countries.  The National Living Laboratory initiative involves university researchers and museum professionals in co-implementing research and science communications activities in museum settings with the public, primarily families with young children.  The research and communications focus is on cognitive science pertaining to the development of young children. While many scientists and museum professionals are interested in integrating high school research experiences into their practices, particularly for under-represented youth, existing infrastructure at museums and universities limits the quality of experiences and quantity of students that institutions can support. Current academic and museum members of the National Living Laboratory community have identified an opportunity to advance shared interests and knowledge in engaging youth in STEM by leveraging the Living Laboratory framework. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project involves pre- and post- conference activities and will convene a group of science research and museum professionals at a workshop in Boston, MA to: 1) document current opportunities and challenges in engaging high-school aged youth in cognitive science research activities; 2) outline strategies to engage youth in research and science communication through Living Laboratory, with particular emphasis on cognitive sciences; and 3) create and disseminate a report on workshop outcomes through existing communication channels in both fields.  The project includes pre-conference surveys of professionals about the topic and an evaluation of the project activities and outcomes. It is funded by the Advancing Informal STEM Learning (AISL) program, which seeks to advance new approaches to, and evidence-based understanding of, the design and development of STEM learning in informal environments.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit  This project explored strategies to engage high school students in the Living Laboratory&Ograve; model of museum-researcher partnerships.  A front-end survey of the National Living Laboratory Community explored: 1) previous or current efforts in engaging high school students in science research and/or science communication activities, 2) respondents? goals for broadening access to and engagement with STEM experiences for high school students through Living Laboratory collaborations, and 3) opportunities for future development of experiences for high school students.  Through this survey, the participant list and agenda were created for a workshop that was held in Boston in October 2016.     Broader Impacts:  Survey respondents were most interested in creating a program with outcomes for teens that would include developing STEM interest/knowledge and building STEM career readiness while learning about the research process and developing science communication skills. Conference participants considered strategies to achieve teen outcomes and the capacity of museums and researchers to support them. Project advisors, as featured speakers, shared relevant projects prior work and frameworks that have been used within different disciplines or with alternative age groups to fuel discussion.  Participants shared their prior and current experiences engaging teens using LL as a framework.  In the final session, after sharing successes and challenges of previous efforts to involve high school students in research, in science communication and/or in Living Laboratory, participants formed affinity groups to discuss potential program models.  Two groups considered potential program timelines: a six-week summer program, and a six-week summer program with weekly academic year contact; a third group brainstormed models that integrate a third-party collaborator (e.g., local high school, community organization, potential for sponsors or mentors from the STEM industry).  A summer-intensive "institute" with integrated activities throughout the school-year emerged for participants as a promising construct to be tested for achieving desired outcomes related to involving teens in LL.  A white paper summarized findings from the survey and workshop, including recommendations for future work.  Participants have subsequently drawn upon this to submit a collaborative proposal for a project that would begin to act on opportunities identified through this exploratory work.
