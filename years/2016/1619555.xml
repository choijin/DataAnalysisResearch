<AbstractNarration>This award provides support for students to participate in the 22nd International Symposium on Spin Physics at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, which will be held September 25 - 30, 2016.  The conference covers a broad range of physics related to spin-dependent observables in nuclear and particle physics.  Key features of the conference are recent results from experiments using cutting edge techniques, talks on a future polarized electron ion collider in the U.S., and new theoretical advances.  Some of the technologies developed for this area of physics have found interesting applications, such as the use of polarized target technology for MR imaging of lungs and probing the surface of solids with stopped polarized muon beams. The conference organizers have actively recruited members of under-represented groups to give invited talks and serve as session conveners.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The 22nd International Spin Symposium took place from 25&ndash;30 September 2016 at the i-Hotel Conference Center in Champaign, IL. It was co-hosted by the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) and Indiana University (IU). About 280 participants from four continents attended. The biennial International Spin Symposium focuses on the study of spin phenomena in particle and nuclear physics as well as those in related fields. The hosts of Spin&rsquo;16, UIUC, and IU, have a long history contributing to the progress in nuclear physics going back to the first cyclotron at UIUC in 1936 and at IU in 1941. More recently, both groups have contributed significantly to the instrumentation of collaborative large-scale nuclear physics experiments utilizing the infrastructure of the Nuclear Physics Laboratory at UIUC and theCenter for Exploration of Energy and matter at IU. The research of both groups has been supported by the National Science Foundation (NSF): both IU and UIUC have carried out large NSF-funded research programs studying proton spin structure in polarized proton-proton collisions at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) at Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL). The NSF co-sponsored the symposium along with BNL, Jefferson Laboratory, the Forschungszentrum J&uuml;lich in Germany, IU, and UIUC. We are especially happy to report that the generous support we received enabled us to help a significant number of junior and underrepresented members of the community to attend. The scientific program of Spin&rsquo;16 was organized along eleven topical working groups. A novel feature of the scientific program was a mini-symposium on lattice QCD. The topic has a close connection to the venue located just across the street from the National Petascale Computing Facility (PCF) and several PCF users participated in the mini-symposium. Besides a visit to the Blue Waters facility at PCF, the main excursion led Spin&rsquo;16 participants to the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library in Springfield, IL. The curator of the library, Dr. James Cornelius, presented an interesting new discussion of the role science played in Lincoln&rsquo;s life and provided ample material for discussion during the conference dinner that was also hosted at the library. In addition to the aforementioned mini-symposium on lattice, the scientific program was organized along current advances in the field and essential progress in the development of related instrumentation. The working groups included parallel sessions on Spin Physics in Nuclear Reactions and Nuclei, Nucleon Helicity Structure, the 3D Structure of the Nucleon accessed in Semi-Inclusive and Exclusive Reactions, Low Energy Spin Physics with Lepton, Photon and Hadron Probes, Fundamental Symmetries and Spin Beyond the Standard Model. Instrumentation sessions were focused on acceleration, storage, and polarimetry of polarized beams, polarized ion and lepton sources and targets, future facilities, and experiments and applications of nuclear polarization techniques to other fields. A substantial reason for the great success of the symposium can be found in the excellent work of the Spin&rsquo;16 parallel session conveners who selected outstanding speakers to present highly relevant results. Plenary sessions presentations provided in-depth coverage of significant new experimental and theoretical results in each of the parallel session subject areas. Examples included highlights from the experimental and theoretical program in the transverse and longitudinal spin structure of the nucleon and its 3-D structure in impact parameter space, the recent progress in the study of hadronization, the search for the electric dipole moment of the neutron, and new lattice results on the light-by-light contribution to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon as well as applications of spin-physics like polarized fusion. Finally, the progress at the new and upgraded facilities at Jefferson Laboratory and MAMI/MESA and the exciting physics program enabled by future facilities like FRIB, the EIC, and AFTER@LHC was presented. The organizers congratulate Ting Ling from IU, who received the prize for the best poster and Dr. Felix Ringer from LANL for the best talk given by a young scientist.Prizes were presented by the honorary ISPC member Dr. Alan Krisch. In 1974 Dr. Krisch organized the first symposium on Spin Physics at Argonne National Laboratory.&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 04/21/2018<br>      Modified by: Matthias&nbsp;Perdekamp</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1619555/1619555_10430665_1524353447003_spin48--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1619555/1619555_10430665_1524353447003_spin48--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Spin 2016 Abraham Lincoln Library"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1619555/1619555_10430665_1524353447003_spin48--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Spin 2016 Abraham Lincoln Library"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Spin 2016, Reception at the Abraham Lincoln Library</div> <div class="imageCredit">Mike Suchor, UIUC</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Public Domain</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Matthias&nbsp;Perdekamp</div> <div class="imageTitle">Spin 2016 Abraham Lincoln Library</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1619555/1619555_10430665_1524353056320_spin16-participants-2--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1619555/1619555_10430665_1524353056320_spin16-participants-2--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Spin 2016 Conference Photo"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1619555/1619555_10430665_1524353056320_spin16-participants-2--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Spin 2016 Conference Photo"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Participants of the 22nd International Spin Physics Symposium held at UIUC in September 2016.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Mike Suchor, UIUC</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Public Domain</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Matthias&nbsp;Perdekamp</div> <div class="imageTitle">Spin 2016 Conference Photo</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1619555/1619555_10430665_1524353148980_spin15--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1619555/1619555_10430665_1524353148980_spin15--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Spin 2016 Coffee Break"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1619555/1619555_10430665_1524353148980_spin15--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Spin 2016 Coffee Break"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Spin 2016 - Coffee Break</div> <div class="imageCredit">Mike Suchor, UIUC</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Public Domain</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Matthias&nbsp;Perdekamp</div> <div class="imageTitle">Spin 2016 Coffee Break</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1619555/1619555_10430665_1524353350646_spin43--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1619555/1619555_10430665_1524353350646_spin43--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Spin 2016 Coffee Break"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1619555/1619555_10430665_1524353350646_spin43--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Spin 2016 Coffee Break"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Spin 2016 Drs.
