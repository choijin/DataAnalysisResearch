<AbstractNarration>1626271&lt;br/&gt;Page&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program award supports acquisition of a scanning electron microscope equipped with an energy dispersive spectrometer to allow microscale textural and compositional imaging of solid earth, biological, and synthetic materials.  The instrument will support faculty research and undergraduate research training at Oberlin College.  This support is congruent with NSFs mission of promoting the progress of science and advancing the national health, prosperity and welfare given the importance of training the next generation scientific workforce in modern techniques of microanalysis and research methods.  Faculty research using the instrument will also be of societal interest including studies of antibiotic resistant bacteria and studies of fault rocks with implications for improving understanding of the physics of earthquake rupture.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Specific research that will be facilitated by the acquisition includes investigations of antibiotic resistant bacterial biofilms, the structures of hybrid inorganic-organic network compounds, characterization of elemental zoning in garnet porphyroblasts in high and ultra-high pressure metamorphic rocks to elucidate metamorphic history, the paleoecology of marine mollusks, and study of mineral fabrics in carbonate fault rocks and deformed quartzites to understand deformation processes in fault zones.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;***</AbstractNarration>
