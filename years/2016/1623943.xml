<AbstractNarration>CBET - 1623943&lt;br/&gt;PI: Jaeger, Heinrich&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will support participation of scientists and engineers at the American Institute of Chemical Engineers Particle Technology Forum, which will be held April 11-13, 2016 in Houston, TX. The goal of the forum is to enhance progress in understanding particle attrition, which refers to the wear and breakdown of particles in granular materials. The forum will focus on ways to mitigate particle attrition in bench-scale and commercial processes and on potential applications of attrition. The forum will have a balance of speakers from academia and industry and will be organized to promote connections between academic investigators and their industrial counterparts. Support will be provided to emerging scientists, including students, post-docs, and junior faculty, especially those from underrepresented groups, to help increase their participation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Session topics will focus at the interface of research and industrial practice and will include particle attrition in industrial processes, improving models of particle attrition, breakages of agglomerates, attrition in pharmaceutical manufacturing, fundamentals of particle breakage mechanisms, and scale-up and industrial best practices. Results of the forum will help improve understanding of particle attrition, which will lead to greater process efficiencies, reduced costs, and to potential new applications of attrition.  Encouraging the engagement of young investigators will fill a national need to continue to train the future work force in the science of particle technology and expose the next generation of researchers to the problems and questions that arise in this area.</AbstractNarration>
