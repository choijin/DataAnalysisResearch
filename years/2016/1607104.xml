<AbstractNarration>Most of the world's great earthquakes occur at subduction zones, or "megathrusts". These events pose significant earthquake and tsunami hazards to densely populated coastal areas. This project focuses on the Hellenic subduction zone in Eastern Mediterranean, which is the most seismically active region in Europe. This subduction zone presents an apparent paradox in that the megathrust appears to be weakly coupled at present, rupturing in events with maximum magnitudes of ~6, but this system has been capable of producing M&gt;8 tsunamigenic earthquakes in historical time such, as the 365 AD M 8.3 events south of western Crete which is the largest event ever reported in Europe.  This project will help resolve this paradox by improving our knowledge of the geometry and properties of the plate interface and other faults in the Hellenic subduction zone. Better constraints on the deep architecture of this subduction zone are essential for assessing hazards for the densely populated Mediterranean coastal regions. The study of the Hellenic subduction zone will also benefit studies of other subduction zones, such as the US Cascadia and Alaska margins.  This project involves a strong international collaboration with French and Greek scientists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Funding supports a multichannel seismic survey of the volcanic arc of the Hellenic subduction zone. Acquiring these data takes advantage of a unique opportunity to image the seismogenic part of this subduction zone. The data will be acquired with the deep penetration reflection seismic capabilities of the R/V Marcus Langseth along a 220-km-long profile west of Crete, across the inferred rupture area of the AD 365 earthquake. These data will provide important missing information on the overall geometry of the plate boundary including the thickness of sediment subducting along the plate boundary, interplate roughness and possible downdip variations related to changes in the properties of the interplate, as have been observed elsewhere, allowing a much-improved understanding of the subduction dynamics and processes in this area. The data will be analyzed and interpreted together with co-located ocean bottom seismometer wide-angle reflection-refraction data acquired in 2012 by French partners of this project. Seismicity studies indicate one or more active features in the overriding plate, and some authors recently suggested that past great earthquakes might have occurred on a splay fault rather than on the main plate boundary. The seismic reflection profile will image features in the overriding plate and their relationship to the megathrust and will allow us to distinguish between active faults and relic structures from previous tectonic events. The geometry of these features will provide important constraints on the tsunamigenic potential of these features. In addition to international collaborations, broader impacts include support of an early career female scientist and enhancement of research infrastructure through the first test of the new R/V Marcus Langseth long-offset streamer.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The Hellenic subduction zone (HSZ) in Eastern Mediterranean is the most seismically active region in Europe. This subduction zone is related to the convergence between the African and Eurasian plates, with the African-Nubia subducting plate characterized by a slow NNW motion (~5-10 mm/yr) with respect to stable Eurasia, and with the Aegean upper plate characterized by a fast southwest motion at 35 mm/yr with respect to stable Eurasia (Fig. 1). The southwestern segment of the Hellenic subduction zone, west of Crete has generated a M~8.3 tsunamigenic earthquake in the past (365 AD), the largest event ever reported in Europe. The potential for a very large subduction at this subduction zone is highly debated since the 70s, and several studies concluded to a mainly aseismic behavior. The HSZ presents therefore an apparent paradox in that the megathrust which appears to be weakly seismically coupled at present and rupturing in events with maximum magnitudes of ~6-7, has however produced great, tsunamigenic earthquakes in the past. Resolving this paradox requires better constraints on the deep architecture of this subduction zone system and is essential for assessing hazards for the densely populated Mediterranean coastal regions.</p> <p>As a joint project with scientists from Greece and France, we collected a 210-km-long profile with the 8-km-long streamer and a 6600 cu.in tuned air gun array of the R/V <em>Marcus Langseth</em> shot every 50 meters. The source and the streamer were towed at a depth of 12 m to maximize low frequencies and deep imaging. This profile was the first profile acquired with the new R/V <em>Marcus Langseth</em> long-offset streamer and data are of high-quality, high-resolution and deep-penetration. The main goals of this project was to (1) provide new constraints on the poorly-known geometry and characteristics of the plate boundary located between 15 and 45 km depth, (2) characterize the past and present deformation within the overriding plate and (3) potentially image a major arc-ward dipping splay fault rooted in the megathrust recently inferred from seismological studies to be the source of the 365AD tsunami. The multichannel seismic (MCS) profile reveal a rough topography of the top of the forearc crust made of Alpine nappes in both the outer and inner domains, including a several-km-thick forearc basin with a multi-phase past evolution and that appears to experience, at present, minimal extension. Despite the Messinian evaporites at shallow depths, MCS image clearly reveal several discontinuous arcward-dipping reflections at ~15 km depth beneath the outer forearc domain that could be related to the top of the subducting African plate. At the Matapan trench, instead of a large arcward dipping slay fault as previously proposed, a major trenchward major fault reactivated as an inverse fault is imaged. The recent compressive deformation imaged within the forearc domain has strong implications for the subduction dynamics and could suggest either some coupling to the African plate or that collision between African passive margin and Eurasia has started in this southwestern segment.</p> <p>Lastly, in addition to international collaborations, broader impacts include support of an early career female scientist.
