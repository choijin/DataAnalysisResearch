<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is that it presents a low cost, high quality, alternative to copper for electric power transmission and distribution. This project's new generation conductive polymer wire is durable, strong, light, and easy to manufacture cost-effectively. The new wire  is seen as a potential replacement for copper, which is heavy and a commodity subject to significant price instabilities.  This new technology could be disruptive in electric power industry. Lighter electronic devices will also be possible through this technology that could impact everything from portable devices to a reduction of the weight of automobiles and aircrafts. It also has the potential to revolutionize the current conductive polymer market.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project proposes a technology that may replace copper in electric power distribution and transmission. The proposed technology is based on a newly discovered carbon-based polymer with excellent electrical conductivity comparable to that of copper. This new material is durable, light, strong, and highly conductive with a high melting point over 1000C. Electric wires and cables can be easily manufactured cost effectively using the powder-in-tube technique with a copper sheath. Feasibility assessment requires exploration into fabrication of flexible wires for easy installation and handling and for good connectivity with copper wires, as well as exploring the potential customer base for this technology.</AbstractNarration>
