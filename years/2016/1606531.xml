<AbstractNarration>This award funds the research activities of Professors Edward Witten and Peter Goddard and a group of postdoctoral fellows at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is devoted to the study of elementary particle physics, including its connections to other areas of study ranging from astrophysics and cosmology to condensed matter physics and geometry.  Current and planned work of the researchers supported by this grant covers a very wide range of topics, including the connections between gauge theory (the modern language of elementary particle physics), string theory (a speculative proposal for unifying the fundamental forces of nature), and geometry.  These researchers will also study the possibilities for new models of particle physics that might be relevant at current and future particle accelerators; new methods of computing and studying the ways in which elementary particles scatter off each other;  new experimental hints of the cosmic dark matter which makes up most of the matter in the universe; and more.   Research in these areas thus advances the national interest by promoting the progress of science in one of its most fundamental directions:   the discovery and understanding of new physical laws.   The postdoctoral fellows supported by this project will also gain experience working at a high level on these exciting scientific problems, which have all attracted great interest nationally and internationally. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More technically, Edward Witten has been working most recently on applications of quantum field theory to boundary states of topological insulators and superconductors, and is also currently developing new interests in classical General Relativity, with a view toward implications for quantum theory.  Peter Goddard's focus is on new approaches to scattering amplitudes in gauge theory and gravity.  The postdoctoral fellows supported by this project have a wide range of interests and work with each other on frontier topics in theoretical high-energy physics as well as with Professors Witten and Goddard and other local faculty.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project supported research by a large group of postdoctoral fellows -- members of the Institute for Advanced Study -- and senior visitors, and also the principal investigators, Peter Goddard and Edward Witten.   The research concerned a broad range of problems in quantum field theory, string theory, and particle physics, including relations with other areas of science, notably astrophysics, condensed matter physics, and mathematics.  Specific topics in which notable contributions were made by researchers on this grant include new understanding of perturbative scattering amplitudes in gauge theory, which are important in hadron collider physics; entanglement of many-body quantum mechanical wavefunctions; quantum mechanical behavior of gauge theories, especially in the supersymmetric case, and with many links to string theory; and new probes of the dark matter of the Milky Way galaxy.  These are all very active areas of research worldwide and research supported by this grant has been in the forefront of developments in all of these areas.   PI Edward Witten during this grant helped extend the relation between simple models of gravity in two dimensions and random matrix ensembles.  This also led to new understanding of volumes of moduli spaces and supermoduli spaces.   He contributed to a reassessment of the idea of scalar particles as dark matter, and he helped develop a new perspective on integrable spin systems in two dimensions. Witten also wrote a series of review articles on topics mostly related to quantum information, entanglement, and gravity.  PI Peter Goddard continued his research on scattering amplitudes in quantum field theory including their description in terms of solutions of the scattering equations.
