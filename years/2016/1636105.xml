<AbstractNarration>Refrigeration and building cooling account for 17 percent of total electricity consumption in the US. High efficiency magnetic refrigerants, which heat up or cool down in response to external magnetic fields, have the potential to replace traditional vapor-compression refrigerators and heat pumps, dramatically reducing electricity consumption and radically altering the domestic energy landscape.  However, these materials are currently limited by energy loss that occurs every time the magnetic field is changed, associated with abrupt changes in the internal structure of the material.  This award supports research into the microscopic mechanism causing this energy loss, in order to understand its fundamental origin.  This research will result in a better understanding of how to design high-efficiency near-room temperature magnetic refrigerants.  Such knowledge could also improve the design of other functional materials such as shape memory alloys.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hysteresis plays a critical role in limiting the efficiency of functional solid-solid phase transitions.  While substantial theory has been developed to design low-hysteresis first-order phase transitions in thermoelastic martensites, it remains unclear why certain materials systems exhibit significantly larger hysteresis than other systems.  This research seeks to investigate the phase transformation mechanisms in Fe2P alloys, which can exhibit hysteresis &lt;1 K, with the objective of identifying the origins of hysteresis in that system.  The research plan consists of three goals: 1) Identify microscopic transformation mechanisms in first-order magneto-structural phase transitions in Fe2P alloys, and detect processes that could significantly contribute to hysteresis; 2) Elucidate the origin of hysteresis and its relationship to a shift from first-order to second-order transition behavior; and 3) Analyze magnetic refrigerant cycle-based performance for low-hysteresis alloys.  This research aims to achieve a rational approach to design new low-hysteresis Fe2P alloys, and may additionally provide greater insight into hysteresis engineering in other solid-solid phase transitions.</AbstractNarration>

In these systems, materials engineers strive either to minimize hysteresis (for example, to achieve efficient energy conversion in caloric effect materials), or to increase hysteresis (for example, to develop ?latching? transformations for one-way shape memory effect alloys). To achieve these design objectives requires a rational approach to engineer hysteresis based on a fundamental understanding of the origins of that hysteresis. Here, we investigated phase transformation mechanisms in a system that undergoes a first-order magneto-structural phase transition, with the ultimate objective of developing a rational approach to hysteresis engineering in that system.</p> <p>This research program focused on Fe<sub>2</sub>P alloys because: 1) they are promising magnetic refrigerants, 2) alloys in this family express a wide range in hysteresis widths, from &Delta;<em>T</em><sub>hyst</sub> &gt;20 K to &lt;1 K, including some of the smallest &Delta;<em>T</em><sub>hyst</sub> observed among all solid-solid phase transformations, and 3) the origin of hysteresis in this system is very poorly understood, in part, because the microscopic mechanisms of the transformation have not been previously described.</p> <p>As a result of this program, we developed a detailed understanding of the microscopic mechanisms responsible for the phase transformations, and the role of compositional alloying on those mechanisms.
