<AbstractNarration>When a species reaches an unoccupied area such as a newly formed island, there is an opportunity for that single colonizer to radiate into a large number of species that exploit the multitude of otherwise unoccupied niches. These so-called 'adaptive radiations' are of profound interest to evolutionary biologists because they often dramatically exemplify some of the more important features of the evolutionary process, including rapid diversification of species, the evolution of complex adaptive traits, and the mechanisms by which recently derived species avoid competition with one another  - as well as hybridization. Well-characterized adaptive radiations are relatively rare, and tend to be studied intensively by organismal biologists once they have become established as model systems for study. Examples of classical adaptive radiations include Darwin's Finches, the Hawaiian Silversword alliance of plants, and the cichlid fish radiation endemic to the East African Great Lakes. This project will characterize a newly discovered adaptive radiation involving Southeast Asian frogs, while allowing for a detailed study of biological diversification in an understudied region of the world.  The researchers will promote STEM engagement of underrepresented minorities, especially students and early-career researchers. This award is cofunded by the Office of International Science and Engineering because it will advance data sharing and data interoperability across national boundaries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will characterize in detail the diversification history of an as yet underappreciated putative adaptive radiation the Limnonectes fanged frogs of the large Indonesian island of Sulawesi and the adjacent Philippines Archipelago. This assemblage of ~40 species (most of which have not yet been formally named) exhibits many of the features that often characterize adaptive radiations. For example, Limnonectes exhibit more than 350-fold variation in adult body size, with lineages ranging in size from 2 grams to more than 700 grams, and many independent derivations of small, medium, large, and giant forms. Communities of six or more sympatric species occur throughout Sulawesi and the Philippines, and these species assemblages appear to partition microhabitats, exhibit phenotypes that correlate with microhabitat specializations, and vary dramatically in reproductive mode. This study will first establish a phylogenetic framework for this assemblage using an exome-capture Next-Generation Sequencing approach. In the context of this phylogeny, it will then provide analyses of body size evolution, test for correlations between phenotypic traits (both morphological and physiological) with microhabitat specializations, describe in detail the species by species reproductive diversity exemplified by this group, and provide an analysis of vocalization behavioral diversity. This research will be fully characterizing ecological drivers of this radiation, as well as the morphological, physiological, and life history features associated with the assemblage's remarkable diversification in insular Southeast Asia. This project will expand our breath of knowledge on how organisms take advantage of new ecological opportunities to diversify, and how adaptations of vast physiological differences between closely related species can evolve very quickly due to competition.</AbstractNarration>
