<AbstractNarration>There is much to learn from the recent New Zealand and Japan earthquakes.  These earthquakes produced differing levels of liquefaction-induced ground movements that damaged buildings, bridges, and buried utilities. Along with the often spectacular observations of infrastructure damage, there were also many cases where well-built facilities located in areas of liquefaction-induced ground failure were not damaged.  Researchers are working on characterizing and learning from these observations of both poor and good performance.  The "Liquefaction-Induced Ground Movements Effects" workshop provides an opportunity to take advantage of recent research investments following these events to develop a path forward for an integrated understanding of how infrastructure performs with various levels of liquefaction.  Approximately 50 leading researchers in the field, two-thirds from the US and one-third from New Zealand and Japan, will convene in Berkeley.  The objective of this workshop is to identify which empirical and analytical methods hold the greatest potential for advancing insight on the effects of liquefaction-induced ground movements on structures and therefore should be considered high priority for further research.  The workshop will also advance the development of younger researchers through identifying research approaches that appear to be promising, as well as to promote future collaborations among participants. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Simplified liquefaction-induced ground movement evaluation procedures cannot explain the different levels of liquefaction-induced infrastructure performance during recent earthquakes in New Zealand and Japan.  These earthquakes with their excellent ground motion recordings, comprehensive subsurface investigations, and well-documented performances of structures, provide an exceptional opportunity to advance our understanding of the effects of liquefaction.  There are not well-validated procedures available to evaluate the effects of liquefaction-induced ground movements on infrastructure.  With the limitations inherent in investigating liquefaction effects solely in the laboratory or through numerical simulations, there is a pressing need to use well-documented case histories to gain insights and to develop analytical procedures for evaluating the effects of liquefaction.  The quantity and quality of the ground characterization and ground failure data in the recent earthquakes are unparalleled.  These events provide the opportunity for an integrated study of building and lifeline performance at a degree of detail and level of complexity that has not been realized previously.  The project will support international collaborations between New Zealand, Japan, and US earthquake researchers and help young US researchers develop promising international research contacts.  The interactions and information exchange among the experts will advance liquefaction engineering as well as new collaborations.</AbstractNarration>

Along with the often spectacular observations of infrastructure damage, there were many cases where well-built facilities located in areas of liquefaction-induced ground failure were not damaged. Researchers are working on characterizing and learning from these observations of both poor and good performance.</p> <p>The &ldquo;Liquefaction-Induced Ground Movements Effects&rdquo; workshop provided an opportunity to take advantage of recent research investments following these earthquake events to develop a path forward for an integrated understanding of how infrastructure performs with various levels of liquefaction. Fifty-five researchers, two-thirds from the U.S. and one-third from New Zealand and Japan, convened in Berkeley, California, in November 2016. The objective of the workshop was to identify research thrusts offering the greatest potential for advancing our capabilities for understanding, evaluating, and mitigating the effects of liquefaction-induced ground movements on structures and lifelines. The workshop also advanced the development of younger researchers by identifying promising research opportunities and approaches, and promoting future collaborations among participants.</p> <p>During the workshop, participants identified five cross-cutting research priorities that need to be addressed to advance our scientific understanding of and engineering procedures for soil liquefaction effects during earthquakes. They are: (1) case history data; (2) integrated site characterization; (3) numerical analysis; (4) challenging soils; and (5) effects and mitigation of liquefaction in the built environment and communities. These research themes provide an integrated approach toward transformative advances in addressing liquefaction hazards worldwide.</p> <p>The archival documentation of liquefaction case history datasets in electronic data repositories for use by the broader research community is critical to accelerating advances in liquefaction research. Many of the available liquefaction case history datasets are not fully documented, published, or shared. Developing and sharing well-documented liquefaction datasets reflect significant research efforts.</p> <p>Integrated site characterization procedures that incorporate qualitative geologic information about the soil deposits at a site and the quantitative information from <em>in situ</em> and laboratory engineering tests of these soils are essential for quantifying and minimizing the uncertainties associated site characterization. Such information is vitally important to help identify potential failure modes and guide <em>in situ</em> testing. One potential way to do this is to use proxies for depositional environments. The development of new <em>in situ</em> testing tools and methods that are more sensitive to soil fabric and microstructure should be continued.</p> <p>The development of robust, validated analytical procedures for evaluating the effects of liquefaction on civil infrastructure persists as a critical research topic. Robust validated analytical procedures would translate into more reliable evaluations of critical civil infrastructure performance, support the development of mechanics-based, practice-oriented engineering models, help eliminate suspected biases in our current engineering practices, and facilitate greater integration with structural, hydraulic, and wind engineering analysis capabilities for addressing multi-hazard problems.</p> <p>There are soils that are challenging to characterize, to model, and to evaluate, because their responses differ significantly from those of clean sands. They cannot be sampled and tested effectively using existing procedures, their properties cannot be estimated confidently using existing <em>in situ</em> testing methods, or constitutive models to describe their responses have not yet been developed or validated. Challenging soils include: interbedded soil deposits, intermediate (silty) soils, mine tailings, gravelly soils, crushable soils, aged soils, and cemented soils. New field and laboratory test procedures are required to characterize the responses of these materials to earthquake loadings, physical experiments are required to explore mechanisms, and new soil constitutive models tailored to describe the behavior of such soils are required.</p> <p>Characterizing and mitigating the effects of liquefaction on the built environment requires understanding its components and interactions as a system, including housing, commercial facilities, public buildings, and spatially distributed infrastructure, such as power, telecommunication, transportation, water supply, and flood protection systems. Research to improve the characterization and mitigation of liquefaction effects on the built environment is essential for achieving resiliency. Component-focused and system performance research on lifeline response to liquefaction is required. Research on component behavior can be advanced by numerical simulations in combination with centrifuge and large-scale soil-structure interaction testing. System response requires advanced network analysis that accounts for the propagation of uncertainty in assessing the effects of liquefaction on large, geographically distributed systems. Lastly, research on liquefaction mitigation strategies, including aspects of ground improvement, structural modification, system health monitoring, and rapid recovery planning, is needed to identify the most effective, cost efficient, and sustainable measures to improve the response and resiliency of the built environment.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 01/31/2018<br>      Modified by: Jonathan&nbsp;D&nbsp;Bray</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1640922/1640922_10440147_1517428942488_Fig1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1640922/1640922_10440147_1517428942488_Fig1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 1."><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1640922/1640922_10440147_1517428942488_Fig1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 1."></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">An example of field case history needs in liquefaction effects research: liquefaction-induced ground settlement in Urayasu from the 2011 M9.1 Tohoku, Japan Earthquake</div> <div class="imageCredit">K.
