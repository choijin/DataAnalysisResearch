<AbstractNarration>An overarching goal of volcanology is to characterize eruptive activity and link this to the physical processes governing magma ascent and eruption, which are generally hidden from direct observation. This proposal will develop a modeling framework to image the inner workings of active volcanoes, such as at Kilauea, Hawaii, USA. Kilauea represents a unique natural laboratory: it exhibits frequent eruptions, a dense instrumental monitoring network to record these eruptions, and a long history of scientific study. Recent activity at the Halemaumau vent, from 2008 to the present day, is the primary observational target. Rock falls from the crater walls onto the active lava lake generate oscillations of the magma and gas within the conduit, explosions, and lake height variations, as evidenced through oscillatory ground motion recorded on the local sensor network. Models for this behavior must explicitly consider bubble growth, complex conduit geometry that includes branching cracks, and stratified, multiphase fluid flow to achieve consistency between seismic data, video of lake level fluctuations, chemical data that constrain gas contents, and textural data that constrain near-surface magma density and bubble content. Theoretical understandings of magma flow, gas solubility laws, and bubble growth gained as a result of this study should benefit the study of active volcanoes generally, as well as diverse applications arising in Earth science and industry that involve flow of bubbly fluids through networks of cracks. Both the modeling tools and results could ultimately be used to monitor active volcanoes, understand their dynamics, and inform eruption forecasts. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal describes a framework for the study of volcanic activity and interpretation of seismic observations at active, open vent volcanoes. The primary application is to short term (tens of minutes) unrest episodes at Kilauea volcano, Hawaii, associated with rock falls from the crater walls onto the active lava lake surface, which induce oscillations of the magma and gas within the conduit, explosions, and lake height variations, as evidenced through oscillatory ground motion recorded on nearby seismometers and tilt meters. These natural experiments provide a unique test for unsteady conduit flow models, which depend critically on knowing conduit geometry and fluid properties of magma (rheology, multiphase character, volatile content, solubility law), all of which are generally hidden from direct observation. The project team will develop a numerical modeling framework for multiphase flow, at much shorter timescales than typically studied, with seismic wave propagation through bubbly magma in conduits that include branching dikes and sills at depth, as is expected at many volcanoes. Pressure changes in the conduit-crack system cause elastic deformations of the conduit and crack walls. Coupling to the solid Earth enables prediction of seismic signals associated with waves and resonant oscillations of the magmatic system. Buoyancy, compressibility, viscous drag, and non-equilibrium bubble growth and resorption ? all of which vary with depth ? must be accounted for to predict mode properties. Branching dikes/sills at depth partially control mode periods and ground displacement. Observable periods and decay rates of seismic signals are thus linked directly to the evolving depth distribution of gas, conduit architecture, and viscous drag. Inversion of these signals will provide new constraints on the shallow magmatic system and total volatile content at Kilauea, and a new framework for probing unsteady eruptive processes.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Kilauea Volcano, Hawaii, is one of the most active volcanoes in the United States. It poses hazard to local communities, primarily from lava flows like those created during the eruption in summer 2018. These lava flows come from magma that ascends through the crust and is temporarily stored in a network of shallow reservoirs and fractures. This project focuses on the shallow magmatic system beneath the summit of Kilauea Volcano, the site of an open lava lake for over a decade (2008 to 2018) that drained in the summer 2018 eruption. Networks of seismic instruments around the summit have recorded hundreds of very long period (VLP) events, in which the ground vibrates in an oscillatory manner following rockfalls into the lava lake. The project team developed a mathematical model of VLP events based on the conceptual understanding that the recorded ground vibrations are caused by magma oscillating up and down in a conduit that connects a deeper reservoir to the lava lake. Observable characteristics of the VLP events (such as the oscillation period and decay rate) are quantitatively linked to the geometry of the conduit and reservoir system (for example, radius and length of the conduit, shape and size of the reservoir) as well as magma properties (for example, average density, viscosity). The project team then matched available seismic data for several VLP events by adjusting parameters in the model. The major findings are as follows: The reservoir is located about 1-2 km beneath the northeast corner of the lava lake, consistent with previous geophysical studies. The data cannot distinguish between a spherical chamber and a more crack-like reservoir geometry with any level of confidence. Changes in VLP properties have been recorded over the past decade. When interpreted in the context of the model developed in this study, these changes indicate variations in magma density stratification and viscosity (or to changes in conduit and/or reservoir geometry, though these are arguably less likely over these time scales). Changes in density stratification and viscosity could result from changes in the relative proportion of gas bubbles to liquid melt in the magma, providing evidence for dynamical changes in the magma residing beneath the summit. The constraints placed by this study will help inform other studies that focus on the summer 2018 eruption, which drained magma from the lava lake and summit reservoir system to feed lava flows from a flank eruption along the lower East Rift Zone. The general modeling framework can also be applied to study other active volcanoes, like Mount Erebus in Antarctica, that exhibit similar VLP events.
