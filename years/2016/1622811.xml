<AbstractNarration>Implementation Projects provide support to Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) to design, implement, study, and assess comprehensive institutional efforts to increase the number of students receiving undergraduate degrees in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) and enhance the quality of their preparation by strengthening STEM education and research. The project at the University of the District of Columbia (UDC) seeks to build on previous successful efforts to increase participation of African-American students in STEM disciplines. A STEM Center will be established and focus on the recruitment, retention, and graduation rates of STEM students, as well as provide additional pedagogical training and upgrading of research skills to faculty. The goals of the project are to: provide STEM students with active support designed to highlight learning as an active and ongoing process and with enrichment as a complement to heighten students' academic performance beyond their current level of achievement; and provide faculty with activities that will expand their teaching and research skills so they will be better prepared to impart knowledge and assist in the development of students' skills as they forge successful mentor/mentee relationships and productive collaborations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The following activities and strategies are designed to meet the project's goals: development of a discipline-specific Journal Club; workshops focusing on critical thinking skills to aid students in understanding the principles involved in the theory and practice of reasoned decision-making; STEM career explorations through activities that create opportunities for internships and employment; development of an Individual Development Plan to assist each student in determining educational paths that will eventually lead to her or his long-term career goal; a program for "Near Completers" for STEM students returning to the university requiring thirty or fewer credits to graduate; establishment of Academic Advancement Partnerships to create interactions between students and faculty at UDC and faculty and administrators at PhD granting institutions; utilization of the Advance Research Techniques Corp to teach research techniques; creation of a paradigm shift in pedagogy by utilizing the flipped classroom and collaborative learning; empowerment of faculty through mentor training; and support for faculty to conduct individual and collaborative research. The project strategies supporting these objectives are evidence-based and will be monitored and evaluated for effectiveness.</AbstractNarration>
