<AbstractNarration>The Interdepartmental Hurricane Operations/Research Forum will be held on March 15-17, 2016 at the Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science, in Miami, FL. Topics will include a review of the 2015 tropical cyclone season-performance, progress, and lessons learned; snapshot of recent tropical cyclone research investments by the federal agencies; review of Joint Hurricane Testbed activities and discussion of priorities; forums on observational data acquisition systems/strategies and modeling advancements in the context of operational requirements and priorities; and planning for operations in the 2016 tropical cyclone season. The Interdepartmental Hurricane Operations/Research Forum is sponsored by the National Science Foundation, NOAA Office of Atmospheric and Oceanic Research, and the Office of Naval Research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:&lt;br/&gt;At the Interdepartmental Hurricane Operations/Research Forum, representatives from the academic research community, industry and Federal agencies will have the opportunity to discuss the latest research on tropical cyclone observing, forecasting, and warning such as:&lt;br/&gt;1. Review of the 2015 hurricane/typhoon season to gauge current capabilities, progress toward addressing operational challenges, and priorities for future research.&lt;br/&gt;2. Research priorities of the operational centers&lt;br/&gt;3. Observations and observing strategies&lt;br/&gt;4. Tropical cyclone model development&lt;br/&gt;5. Transitioning research to operations&lt;br/&gt;6. Advances in tropical cyclone forecast and warning products and services, including social science applications&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:&lt;br/&gt;The workshop is important to the Nation because it brings together the academic research community, industry, Federal agencies and other user communities such as emergency management, to prepare for the upcoming hurricane season and make improvements to the Nation's hurricane forecasting and warning program.</AbstractNarration>

The Office of the Federal Coordinator for Meteorological Services and Supporting Research (OFCM) annually hosts this event to bring together the Federal agencies responsible for forecasting tropical cyclones.

Since 2007, when OFCM published the Interagency Strategic Research Plan for Tropical Cyclones: The Way Ahead, this annual event has focused on evaluating the progress made in addressing the priorities identified in the 2007 plan. That community has always tied research efforts closely to operational priorities, and this forum will continue to follow that principle.

This snapshot will contribute to a &ldquo;Final Assessment&rdquo; of actions in response to the 2007 plan, to be completed in 2017.
