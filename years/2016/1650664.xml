<AbstractNarration>This award is designated as a Science Across Virtual Institutes (SAVI) award and is being co-funded by the NSF's Directorate for Geosciences, Directorate of Computer Information Science and Engineering's Advanced Cyberinfrastructure (ACI) Division and Office of International and Integrative Activities.  The aim of this award is to deliver an e-infrastructure and data management roadmap and implementation plan for effective end-to-end (basic research to decision making) global environmental change research by facilitating collaboration among engineers, computer, natural, and social scientists from the United States and many countries across the globe through a Knowledge Hub.  The funds will be used to support the collaboration between 14 US researchers and approximately 120 researchers from the 13 participating Belmont Forum countries and the coordination of the Knowledge Hub activities through a secretariat.  Knowledge Hub activities such as virtual working groups and in-person workshops will focus on two thematic areas: governance and interoperability in architectures.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The resulting e-Infrastructure and Data Management Strategy and Implementation Plan will serve as a clear roadmap to address and prioritize interoperability challenges across the globe and integrate national and international research efforts to promote more holistic environmental decision support systems for global environmental change research. A key outcome of these collaborative efforts will be enhanced interoperability among global environmental data that will help develop beneficial societal products.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The development of this e-infrastructure and data management Knowledge Hub represents an extraordinary opportunity to bring together international leaders in interoperability, standards development, and various aspects of governance to seek a synoptic world vision. This virtual institute will create opportunities for enhancing the career trajectories of a new generation of researchers in the U.S. and across the globe.  The Knowledge Hub will expose US early-career scientists to interdisciplinary, multi-institutional activities focused on environmental data and cyberinfrastructure where they can benefit not only from the US participants but also their counterparts from 13 other countries.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   The Belmont Forum, a partnership of international science research funding agencies, science councils, and regional research consortia, supports international transdisciplinary research with the goal to provide knowledge for decision-makers to understand, mitigate, and adapt to global change. To do this, decision-makers require policy-relevant, decision-focused knowledge that is best generated by transdisciplinary science research. By integrating and analyzing large amounts of diverse data across scientific disciplines, researchers can produce the scientific discoveries and knowledge necessary to remove critical barriers to achieving global environmental sustainability.   The National Science Foundation (NSF), a Belmont Forum member, awarded the Arizona Geological Survey (AZGS) to co-lead an international Scoping effort to delineate a path forward for Belmont member organizations to widen and ensure access to data and promote full-path data use in the global change research they fund. In conjunction with the UK?s Natural Environmental Research Council (NERC), and a 14-member steering committee comprising additional Belmont Forum members, the project assembled 120+ cross-disciplinary experts who provided input in six major areas relating to full-path data management: 1) data integration for multidisciplinary research, 2) improved interface between computation and data infrastructures, 3) harmonization of global data infrastructure for sharing environmental data, 4) data sharing, 5) open data, and 6) capacity building across all areas. Specifically, the major goals of this 3-year project were to:   identify and prioritize actions to address interoperability challenges for the full-path life cycle of research data; and   identify existing national and international initiatives that can be leveraged to promote more holistic environmental support systems globally.     At the conclusion of this project, the following significant results were achieved:   Preparation and publication of A Place to Stand: e-Infrastructures and Data Management for Global Change Research, a publicly-available community strategy and implementation plan (CSIP) for developing sustainable practices within the global change research community for data discovery, management, and curation.      Belmont Forum members (now numbering 26) adopted an Open Data Policy and Principles for environmental change research in November 2015 (one of five recommendations made in the CSIP report issued June 2015) and are supporting the policy and principles with the intent of making them enforceable over time.     A workshop to develop well-defined steps for the next phase, Implementation, was held in December 2015, San Francisco, CA, and resulted in the subsequently funded e-Infrastructures and Data Management Collaborative Research Action (e-I&amp;DM CRA) involving five countries (USA, UK, France, Japan, and Chinese Taipei).   A Knowledge Hub, accessible at bfe-inf.org, publicly hosts all documents and presentations produced during the Scoping phase and explains the project in detail. The Knowledge Hub will grow as a resource throughout the Implementation phase.    Design, execution, analysis, and publication of an Open Data Survey of the global environmental research and data infrastructure community to identify perceptions of the term "open data," expectations of infrastructure functionalities, and barriers and enablers for data sharing.  The survey concluded that stronger mandates will strengthen the case for data sharing.     The Belmont Forum is now internationally recognized as an active promoter of Open Data policies for science research and a leader in coordinating the development and application of such policies towards full-path data lifecycle management, including security, legal, and publication considerations.   By coordinating open data management policies, procedures, and funding mechanisms for the global change research priorities of the Belmont Forum, this project has benefitted the social sciences broadly, as it is one of the Belmont Forum?s focus areas for transdisciplinary research. This benefit will take the shape of increasing recognition and prioritization by international funding agencies of the critical importance of open data in cross-, multi-, and transdisciplinary research to meet global change challenges, with subsequent quantum leaps toward functionally FAIR data (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Re-useable) as funded projects conform to and improve open data standards. This project has also made progress on the Belmont Challenge by fostering international communication, collaboration and coordination, enabling better understanding of the dynamic landscape of data and software interoperability, digital architecture, organizational efforts and expertise across global e-infrastructure efforts. In particular, this project has initiated the development of resources to improve data sharing, preservation, stewardship, and data interoperability throughout the entire data lifecycle. Furthermore, this project has set the stage for continuing multinational efforts to identify exemplars (demonstrators) that test data management recommendations and determine the benefits of cross-disciplinary approaches by the users of harmonized e-infrastructures.
