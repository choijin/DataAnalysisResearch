<AbstractNarration>In many areas of the United States there has been insufficient preparation of high school graduates with the technical skills in manufacturing needed for obtaining available technical jobs. This project by Northcentral Technical College is located in a rural region of Wisconsin with many manufacturing companies desperate for engineers and skilled employees who have a science and engineering background. The need for a scientific workforce has become vital to strengthening Wisconsin's economy, but recruiting qualified personnel has been increasingly challenging. High schools struggle to get students interested in higher education and to think of themselves as potential members of the technical, manufacturing workforce. This project targets rural Wisconsin youth to provide them with learning opportunities and careers pathways associated with computer technology and engineering, both critical occupational areas across numerous industries. Northcentral Technical College, in collaboration with the Science Museum of Minnesota, the University of Wisconsin-Madison, six community-based organizations, and four school districts, will engage and prepare teachers and students to meet this challenge. As computing has become integral to the practice of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM), the STEM + Computing program seeks to address emerging challenges in computational STEM areas through the applied integration of computational thinking and computing within disciplinary STEM teaching and learning from early childhood education through high school (preK-12). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The University of Wisconsin-Madison will lead research efforts to determine to what extent, (1) informal learning environments increase interest and enrollments in formal high-computing technology and engineering courses; (2) how the implementation of near-peer and adult informal teaching and mentoring increases the near-peer mentor and participants' interest in pursuing postsecondary computing technology and engineering career pathways; and (3) how leadership and mentorship training of adults and high school students impacts informal learning opportunities. Further, the research will address three key questions: (1) Will drop-in, open-ended Maker (engineering and technology) experiences impact community perception of, and interest in, computing technology and engineering learning and careers?; (2) What do students who become Maker mentors learn about computing technology and engineering content, learn about themselves as Makers and STEM learners, and how does this participation impact their postsecondary learning or career trajectories?; and (3) What aspects of the community-involved Maker experiences are sustained beyond institutional intervention? This project will provide a model for regions with distributed, rural populations in building capacity for young people to develop skills and self-efficacy for participating in the emerging rural manufacturing STEM+Computing fields of the future.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Exploring Making through Mobile Emergent Technology (EMMET) was a collaborative effort between Northcentral Technical College in Wausau, Wisconsin and the University of Wisconsin-Madison. EMMET sought to take Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics and Computational Thinking (STEM+C) learning out of the classroom into Wisconsin rural communities through a non-traditional learning environment&mdash;a mobile makerspace. Makerspaces are learning environments filled with technological and human resources which create multiple pathways for learners to engage in tinkering (Resnick &amp; Rosenbaum, 2013) and create projects using low tech and high tech tools (Peppler, Halverson, &amp; Kafai, 2016). The EMMET project aimed to develop a near-peer instructional mentoring program to introduce community members to STEM+C content; to design an informal STEM curriculum for grades 6-12; and to understand what people learn about STEM+C through participating in local making experiences.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Value of Making for Rural Communities</strong></p> <p>Many rural communities like Wausau are rethinking how they can both support their local economy and simultaneously provide more opportunities for young people. In rural regions in particular, many manufacturing companies are desperate for engineers and skilled employees who are STEM literate. Recruiting qualified personnel is challenging, and rural communities are experiencing pressure to &ldquo;grow their own&rdquo; STEM workforces. Without some type of intervention, rural students may be less likely to pursue careers in engineering (Elam, Donham, &amp; Solomon, 2012) which can lead to some of the more higher-tech and higher ranking positions in manufacturing companies. The EMMET program sought to disrupt the trajectory from rural high school to factory floor by introducing STEM+C skills through making and mentorship training. Makerspaces allow students to design projects of interest and co-create with peers, which increases intrinsic motivation for learning (Rusk, 2016).</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Maker-Mentor Programming</strong></p> <p>Through the three years of the program, 22 high school students and 4 adults were trained as maker-mentors. NTC faculty delivered bi-monthly trainings which created a supportive learning community and helped maker-mentors gain new skills, learn how to use new technologies, and acquire facilitation techniques. During the second year of the program, educators from the Children&rsquo;s Museum of Pittsburgh delivered additional training on maker-based facilitation techniques. The research team found that maker-mentor programming had the following impacts: maker-mentors learned how to use new tools and repurpose materials; came to understand STEM+C and recognize its importance for society and for themselves; recognized and practiced the art of decomposition in solving problems; improved upon collaborative and interpersonal communication skills; learned how to teach; and engaged in self-discovery finding out more about themselves as learners.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Community Impact</strong></p> <p>Maker-mentors facilitated making experiences throughout the community at partner community-based organizations (CBOs) including Boys &amp; Girls Clubs, 4H programs, libraries, and area high schools and at large-scale community events including parades, county fairs, and a Hmong heritage festival. These designed experiences were divided into three types: exposure events (5-15 minute activities designed to introduce STEM in an interactive format); skill building events (activities designed to be conducted with a group of learners and typically last 90 minutes); and extended making activities (long-term, community-driven emergent projects). The research team found that events were successful in sparking community members&rsquo; curiosity, interest, and excitement of STEM+C activities for community members of all ages, encouraging co-discovery within family units, allowing for interest-driven discovery, and serving as a pathway to scientific thinking. During the second year of the program, maker-mentors offered 56 events for over 1,000 students.

CBO leaders were given a toolkit of making activities, tools, and lesson plans so that they could continue to provide the same type of programming in their learning environment.
