<AbstractNarration>Many-body correlations lie at the heart of complex systems at the microscopic level where the strange rules of quantum physics hold sway. Such systems occur naturally at all scales, ranging from fundamental particles, to atoms, molecules, and solid-state materials.  In addition, such quantum complexity is now understood to be a resource for processing information in ways that are not possible in a world operating under the logic of classical physics. These dual aspects of many-body correlations - defining the richness in the natural world and opening the door to powerful new applications - are currently driving many explorations in atomic, molecular, and optical physics. This project will push the boundaries of this frontier. The research will enable new capabilities in manipulating and understanding quantum many-body systems and their complex dynamics, with potential applications in quantum information processing and precision measurement.  The project will contribute to the knowledge base of quantum information science, and to the training of future scientists in this highly interdisciplinary field. Students will be involved in all aspects of the project, including education, research, and the dissemination of results. The project is an integral part of the NSF-funded Center for Quantum Information and Control.  Activities include weekly group meetings, research seminars, and an annual research retreat that strengthens the connections between junior and senior members. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two key aspects of the problem of many-body complexity; namely, creating and detecting symmetric correlations, will be explored. The specific goals are to develop protocols for implementing general quantum control to optimally and robustly generate quantum correlations. Project personnel will study how a measurement, in conjunction with control, can be used to extract information about the initial correlations present in a many-body system. This builds on the group's expertise in continuous measurement tomography, used previously to reconstruct one-body correlations. They will extended these ideas to study the reconstruction of two-body correlations, and beyond. Project personnel will also explore the intricate relation between information gain, complexity of dynamics, and quantum backaction in the continuous measurement of many-body systems.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Quantum Information Science (QIS) is at the heart of the "Second Quantum Revolution," which promises radically new technologies such as ultrafast quantum computers, unbreakable quantum cryptographic systems, and ultraprecise quantum sensors.  Such new technologies arise from the remarkable properties of light and matter at the microscopic level.  Harnessing this power requires a new ability to manipulate individual quanta of matter, such as atoms and particles of light (photons).  This project extended the boundaries of our understanding of how such manipulation can be carried out, the new physics we can learn with this capability, and the applications we can realize in the arena of quantum technologies.  We explored two paths to achieve our goals.  In one path we studied how we can perform "quantum logic" with individual atoms.  Like the logic performed on a standard computer chip, in quantum logic one quantum bit is affected by the state of another quantum bit.  In this case the quantum bit is encoded into the state of an atom, where logical-0 is the atom in its lowest energy state, and logical-1 is an atom in an excited energy state.  To perform quantum logic, the atoms must physically interact in a precise and controlled way.  We studied how, by shining laser light on the atoms, we can devise just the right kind of interaction to implement the desired logical operation.  This capability can serve as the foundation for a new platform for quantum computers based on arrays of individually trapped atoms.  In a second path we studied how, by passing light through a small gas of atoms and then measuring the light, we can manipulate the atomic ensemble.   With this technique, we can prepare the atoms in a special state so that they are much more sensitive to small magnetic fields.  Such ultraprecise magnetic field sensors can have important applications, such as detecting the small magnetic fields created by brainwaves, which then can then be used for medical diagnosis.  We also studied the fundamental physics of chaos (sometimes knows as the "butterfly effect") that can occur in such systems. Bridging our understanding of how chaos occurs at the microscopic level with the macroscopic world is essential for furthering our knowledge and for new applications in quantum technologies.  All of the research carried out in the projects was done in collaboration with students at the University of New Mexico.  Training students is essential for creating the necessary quantum-workforce as called for in the National Quantum Initiative Act of 2018.
