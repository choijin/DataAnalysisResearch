<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is in the introduction of a new technology that provides a unique and cost-effective solution for the multibillion dollar stem cell industry. Stem cell therapy is a fast growing global market, with an estimated 40% annual growth in the next five years. Cell-based therapy has the vast potential to provide transformative healthcare to many currently incurable diseases, providing broad societal impact. This project will also impact more broadly to other biotechnology sectors, such as antibody production.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project addresses a major current limitation in the production of stem cell-derived technologies, namely cellular aggregation. The technology provides an automated and well-controlled disaggregation of multicellular stem cell spheroid clumps into single cells via gentle mechanical forces. Proof-of-concept of the technology was previously demonstrated using multiple types of adult stem cells. Cell death was minimal and cell quality remained high, providing promise for an economical alternative to current disaggregation methods with reduced operating time and reduced batch-to-batch variations.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>A major current limitation in the production of therapeutic stem cell-derived technologies is the time-consuming and expensive process of cellular disaggregation. Stem cell cultures naturally aggregate, and there exists neither a conventional nor cost-efficient procedure by which to dissociate them. Through the NSF I-Corps Program, we have interviewed 171 people involved in regenerative medicine and found that general managers in charge of manufacturing stem cell therapies are pressured to decrease the cost of single-cell dissociation by 60%. Our main target customers are these general managers who oversee regulatory-compliant therapeutic facilities. Best process features that they are looking for are: (1) high-quality, (2) low-cost, (3) sustainability, and (4) scalability. Therefore, the dissociation of therapeutic stem cells is best done automatically and mechanically. Automated dissociation protocols are cost-efficient and scalable, while mechanical methods are of higher-quality and more sustainable over long culture periods. Therefore, there is a value proposition for creating a single-use and automated mechanical dissociator, which will help general managers save 60% of their costs over existing protocols. Replacing the current manual process with an automated one reduces cell damage and batch variation, increasing the likelihood of a therapy passing clinical trials and leading to more treatments for patients. Thus, the NSF I-Corps funding has allowed us to validate the market need of an automated dissociator. In addition, the funding has enabled training of two young Alabamian entrepreneurs who have now started a company based on the technology that will provide the value proposition stated above. Our team&rsquo;s successful completion of the I-Corps Teams program has thus started to foster more biotechnology innovation in the state of Alabama and is helping the newly found company to tap into the fast growing global stem cell therapy market.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 07/25/2017<br>      Modified by: Yonghyun&nbsp;Kim</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
