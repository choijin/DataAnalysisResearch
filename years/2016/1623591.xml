<AbstractNarration>The Moraine Valley Community College/Chicago State University (MVCC/CSU) partnership establishes a local educational pipeline in the cybersecurity and intelligence (CS&amp;I) in the Chicago metropolitan community. The project addresses the need for both well-trained faculty and students to meet the growing need for CS&amp;I professionals. This project creates pathways between undergraduate and graduate level programs. Students at MVCC, in existing majors like cybersecurity, geospatial information systems, management information systems, computer science, criminal justice and other social and physical sciences programs, can articulate to undergraduate programs at CSU with an academic minor in the security and intelligence (SIS). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This partnership builds upon two recognized centers of academic excellence; the Intelligence Community Center for Academic Excellence at CSU (IC CAE) and the NSA/DHS Center for Academic Excellence in Two-Year Colleges (CAE2Y) at Moraine Valley Community College (MVCC). The project also leverages the resources and academic community established by the NSF ATE funded National Support Center for Systems Security and Information Assurance (CSSIA) at MVCC. This project enriches the SFS program by utilizing and adapting a previously funded NSF project in the area of CS&amp;I at California State University, San Bernardino (CSUSB) in three key areas: 1) incorporate content and courses from the CSUSB Cyber Intelligence curriculum into the CSU's SIS undergraduate minor;  2) create a pathway between students from local community colleges using the CSSIA cybersecurity curriculum to articulate into undergraduate degrees at CSU with a security and intelligence minor; 3) build a pathway between the NSF ATE Cyber Center "CSSIA" and its network of affiliate community colleges and the CSU Cyber Intelligence similar to CyberWatch West and CSUSB. The project also includes a series of summer camps that expose students from two-year institutions to the career opportunities in CS&amp;I. Additionally; the project includes a small-scale research program that explores the methods of teaching and learning CS&amp;I and strategies to develop awareness of careers in CS&amp;I in urban and diverse secondary classrooms. The research program utilizes classroom-based action research (collaborative research), where teachers, working collaboratively with CS&amp;I experts, to develop and deliver instruction in the content area of CS&amp;I. Ultimately, research findings could be used to develop best practices and to generate theory in the area of secondary level cybersecurity and intelligence instruction.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ "SFS: Capacity: A Streamlined Cyber-Security &amp; Intelligence (CS&amp;I) Pathway  This project resulted in new articulation programs between summit between Chicago State University (CSU), Moraine Valley Community College (MVCC) and several other local community colleges. Representatives from five different programs, Chemistry/Physics, Criminal Justice, Information Technology, Management Information System, and Business, in the four institutions attended several meetings that resulted in an articulation agreement and transfer guides for a seamless transfer of students to CSU to major in any one of these five programs and to minor in Cyber Security and Intelligence Studies.  The project incorporated an outreach initiative with local K-12 programs.  Over the last four years, over 150 high school students participated in career awareness programs that emphasize careers with US intelligence agencies.  The research project measured the impact of student knowledge and interest in these careers after attending workshops designed to increase their knowledge and understanding of careers in this field. The results have been published in a toolkit that will be disseminated at national conferences in 2020. The following is a list of the overall impact of this program:  Curriculum and instructional materials for faculty development workshops. Customized and implemented instructional materials including presentation materials, case studies, and group projects for faculty development workshops and conference sessions. Opportunity for participating faculty to earn continuing education credits. A opportunity for community college and high school faculty to enroll and earn graduate credits and credentials in CS&amp;I from CSU. An accelerated summer academy in which students from 2-year college programs earned up to 9 credit hours toward a STEM bachelor’s degree with a minor in CS&amp;I stuidies. This included seven CyberCorp SFS scholars. A new transfer program to attract students from 2-year institutions to earn a bachelor’s degree with a minor concentration in CS&amp;I studies at CSU. Promotion of CS&amp;I academic pathways and career opportunities to minority and female students both in K12 and 2-year college programs.   Completion of a CS&amp;I small-scale research project that focused on dual-credit high school network and MVCC.          Last Modified: 01/28/2021       Submitted by: John L Sands]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
