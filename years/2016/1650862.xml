<AbstractNarration>The Computational Cybersecurity in Compromised Environments (C3E) workshop series identifies recent challenges in the changing cybersecurity landscape and explores different possible courses of research action. The workshops stimulate discussion and awareness among industry, academia and government that cybersecurity challenges are complex problems with many perspectives, competing interests, and possible consequences for society. The C3E workshops also offer challenge problems, encouraging team-oriented multidisciplinary approaches to investigate a challenge by considering socio-economic outcomes, trust, public safety, privacy risks, technology policy, and the larger consequences for society. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research theme for the Cybersecurity Challenge Problem of this, the 8th annual 2016 C3E Workshop, is ransonware, a new form of denial of service on organizations that monetizes the consequences on vulnerable segments of the economy, most recently the health care sector and possibly others in the US critical infrastructure.  The workshop participants will study causes and mitigation strategies, explore vulnerabilities and system architectures, economics, and implications for public health and safety. The workshop reports will be published and widely disseminated to inform the research community and the general public.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This grant was awarded to study ransomware in support of the Computational Cybersecurity in Compromised Environments (C3E) Workshop in 2016 and to further and disseminate the findings at subsequent conferences.  The initial objectives of the research were to develop a research framework for addressing the problem from the perspective of multiple disciplines, begin to develop formal theories about ransomware and identify needs for future research. These objectives are specifically focused on the potential impact of ransomware on critical infrastructure in the U.S.       The researchers identified ransomware as a multidisciplinary problem, involving both technology and human behavior.  The resolution of individual attacks requires interaction between the attacker and the victim.  This research should encourage further research that will result in developing methods and techniques to reduce the threat and assist the victim in avoiding financial or technical harm. The PIs identified areas of scientific merit not only to present at the next C3E Conference, but also to use that material and the conference as a catalyst to spur further research into the threat ransomware poses to critical infrastructure. The concepts coming from academe, former government experts and the private sector can be used as a basis for developing a broader approach to the ransomware problem that could cover a range of topics including, for example, attack detection, mitigation, and prevention; behavioral aspects and patterns; identifying unanticipated consequences or cascading effects; the international legal aspects of ransomware attacks; and others.  This research produced seven presentations and posters at the C3E Workshop in 2017, an additional poster describing the research and findings displayed at the 2018 Hot Topics in the Science of Security (HOTSOS) Conference, initial panel presentations and keynote addresses at the Fall C3E Workshop, 2017, and an update report at C3E Fall Workshop September, 2018.   A forthcoming proposed IEEE Special Issue on Ransomware will include the articles developed in this project and others currently being peer-reviewed.
