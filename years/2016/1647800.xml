<AbstractNarration>The National Science Foundation uses the Early-concept Grants for Exploratory Research (EAGER) funding mechanism to support exploratory work in its early stages on untested, but potentially transformative, research ideas or approaches. This EAGER project was awarded as a result of the invitation in the Dear Colleague Letter NSF 16-080 to proposers from Historically Black Colleges and Universities to submit proposals that would strengthen research capacity of faculty at the institution. The project at Norfolk State University aims use a novel optical non-contact cell stretching method to create a controlled stretch in biological cells. Accordingly, the project outcome can unveil mechanisms governing heart electrical abnormalities via modeling and relate the electrophysiological measurements to mechanical stretching by enabling reproducible stretch conditions in vitro to mechanistically characterize various human disorders including heart failure. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Excitable biological cells, such as heart cells, exhibit mechano-electric sensitivity by which their electrical behavior is modulated by mechanical stimuli or stretch. This is especially critical in chronic diseases such as heart failure where increased stress may induce life-threatening abnormalities, called arrhythmias. Specialized stretch-activated ion channels in cells are thought to be responsible for this phenomenon. However, these channels are not well characterized, partly due to a lack of efficient cell stretching and simultaneous electrical recording techniques. In this project, a novel optical non-contact stretching method, using counter-propagating laser beams, is proposed which is capable of producing a controlled stretch in biological cells in the most realistic condition. A microfluidic platform for performing automated, high throughput electrophysiological recordings from cells will be designed. Tightly focused laser beams will be used to stretch the cells while simultaneously performing the patch clamp recordings. The proposed optofluidic chip will be used to systematically characterize the stretch-activated ion channels in cardiac cells. The experiments combined with advanced computer-based modeling will provide useful insights into the mechanisms of arrhythmias in heart failure conditions. The cell-stretching technique could be extended to study several other diseases such as cancer, brain tumors, Parkinson disease and even plant disorders. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This EAGER project is funded by the Engineering Directorate.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Several diseases such as heart failure and cancer are associated with alterations in mechanoelastic properties of cells. The cell membrane elasticity can be an effective biomarker to detect diseases such as cancer in their early stages. The mechanisms of diseases such as heart failure can be studied by deforming the membrane of heart cells. In this study, an optics-based technique was developed to controllably trap individual cells and stretch them without any mechanical contact which could be useful in both the scenarios described earlier. The major goals of the project were to: (1) Design a microfluidic dual-laser-beam optical tweezer assembly for trapping and stretching biological cells without mechanical contact; (2) Design microfluidic channels for continuous flow cell stretching; and 3) Utilize the optical setup for characterizing the biomechanical and electrophysiological response of the cells. An optofluidic setup was designed in which two counterpropagating divergent laser beams formed an optical trap under a phase-contrast microscope. The suspended cells and micro-sized beads crossing the light path were trapped and stretched by adjusting the optical power in the laser beams. The setup was calibrated with polystyrene and polyethylene microbeads before using it to trap and stretch human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells. It was observed that the HEK cells were stretched as much as 40% using the setup and the extent of deformation was proportional to the optical power of the trap. Moreover, the extent of stretching and stretching pattern in mammalian breast cancer cells were strikingly different as compared to the healthy HEK cells. A theoretical formulation for forces acting on the cell&rsquo;s surface in the optical trap and accurate estimation of refractive index of the trapped particles/cells based on the minimum trapping power of the particles was developed. The theory of refractive index prediction was successfully validated using experiments with micro-sized beads trapped in the dual-beam optical tweezer. The study provided important insights into the light-biological tissue interaction and mechanisms of cytoskeletal elasticity which could be investigated further. The theoretical and experimental outcomes of the experiments will be utilized in the follow up study of identifying cancer cells based on their response in optical tweezer combined with optical characterization using surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 03/11/2021<br>      Modified by: Makarand&nbsp;Deo</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1647800/1647800_10455861_1615474898394_optical_setup--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1647800/1647800_10455861_1615474898394_optical_setup--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Optical Setup"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1647800/1647800_10455861_1615474898394_optical_setup--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Optical Setup"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Dual-beam optical cell-stretching setup used in the study and a schematic of forces acting on the trapped particle.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Graduate Students at Norfolk State University</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Makarand&nbsp;Deo</div> <div class="imageTitle">Optical Setup</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1647800/1647800_10455861_1615475650541_cellstretchingoutcome--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1647800/1647800_10455861_1615475650541_cellstretchingoutcome--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Cell stretching outcome"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1647800/1647800_10455861_1615475650541_cellstretchingoutcome--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Cell stretching outcome"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Deformation of cell under the optical trap</div> <div class="imageCredit">Mr. Aotuo Dong</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Makarand&nbsp;Deo</div> <div class="imageTitle">Cell stretching outcome</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
