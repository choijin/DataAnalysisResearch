<AbstractNarration>Unraveling the mechanisms that govern the movement of individuals is key to understanding a major determinant of the fates of individuals, the structure and dynamics of populations, communities, ecosystems, and the evolution and diversity of life. Insects exhibit remarkable variation in flight and dispersal that are important to investigate because many insects are ecologically and economically important. In addition, studying the genetic to ecological factors that explain variation in flight and dispersal is fundamental because the evolution of flight presaged the most extensive animal radiation in evolutionary history. Selection by predators for enhanced flight performance to escape being eaten by their prey was intense during the evolution of winged animals, such as insects. Yet, a mechanistic understanding by which even contemporary predator-induced selection affects insect flight traits and subsequent dispersal ability, propensity, and the fate of dispersers is lacking. This research project will address this important knowledge gap by investigating how predatory fish affect flight traits and dispersal of insects, such as stoneflies, that live in rivers during one life stage and on land as winged insects during their final life stage. Through four linked objectives, this research will use observations, experiments, and a model to provide one of the first integrative studies of predator effects on flight traits at the biochemical, physiological, and morphological levels, to determine how these traits are ecologically linked to dispersal distance and directionality, and their interaction with landscape-scale habitats in river networks. In so doing, this study will transform understanding of contemporary selective agents on insect flight and dispersal.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Results from this research will benefit society by providing information on factors affecting landscape-scale movements of adult aquatic insects, some of which are human pests or disease vectors, and will have implications for understanding the impacts of introduced predators on traits of prey species. Integrating research and education are key components of this project that will be achieved by training and mentoring at least 10 undergraduates, plus a graduate student, and exposing them to a vibrant research and teaching community at an internationally recognized field station. Public outreach activities informing non-scientists about the biology of freshwater organisms will be coordinated through the Rocky Mountain Biological Laboratory's Kid's Nature Camp, Adult Science Tours, and Citizen Science Geek Week.</AbstractNarration>

Understanding the factors that explain variation in insect flight and dispersal is also fundamental because the evolution of flight presaged the most extensive animal radiation in evolutionary history. Selection by predators for enhanced flight performance to escape being eaten was likely intense during the evolution of winged animals, such as insects. Despite the risk of predation as a leading hypothesis for the evolution of insect flight, we still lack an understanding of how contemporary predators affect insect flight and dispersal ability, the propensity to leave an area with predators, and whether insects that disperse move to areas with no or fewer predators. This research project addressed this important knowledge gap by investigating how predatory fish affect flight traits and dispersal of stream insects, such as stoneflies, that live in streams during one life stage and on land as winged insects during their final, adult life stage.  The research involved collecting data on natural variation in biochemical, physiological, and morphological flight characteristics of stream insects developing in streams with and without predatory fish, data from experiments in which the effects of predatory fish on insect flight characteristics, insect mortality, and insect dispersal distance and directionality were assessed with stable isotopes, and data from simulation models to explore how variation in flight characteristics interacted with the landscape-scale con&#64257;guration of fish in river networks.  The results showed consistent differences between insects developing in streams with versus without predatory fish.  Biochemically, insects developing in streams with fish versus without fish differed in a metabolic enzyme that is linked to intense aerobic activities, such as flying.  In terms of their physiology, insects naturally developing in or experimentally transplanted into streams with fish had larger flight muscles and more a developed breathing system than the same species developing in streams lacking predatory fish.  Morphologically, insects naturally developing in or experimentally transplanted into streams with predatory fish had larger wings than the same species developing in streams with no predatory fish.  The combination of these characteristics enabled adult female stream insects developing in streams with predatory fish to disperse farther upstream and thus lay their eggs in areas of the stream network that typically lack predatory fish because of waterfalls and other barriers to fish upstream movement.  However, enhanced flight and dispersal characteristics had a cost, whereby insects developing in streams with fish produced fewer eggs and did not live as long compared to the same species in streams with no predatory fish.  This tradeoff was further enforced by high consumptive mortality by trout on both aquatic and terrestrial stages of these insects.  Taken together, this research shows that predatory fish are contemporary selective forces that can affect insect flight and dispersal characteristics at the biochemical, physiological, morphological, and landscape levels. The results also provide the first evidence for a role of fish predation in explaining the stream colonization cycle hypothesis, or the upstream biased flight phenomenon exhibited by this species and many other stream insects.  The findings have implications for understanding and predicting impacts of introduced predatory fish on insect flight and dispersal characteristics, some of which can be pests or transmit human and wildlife diseases.    Integrating research, education, and training were key components of this research.  To that end, one postdoctoral scholar, two PhD students one of whom is Native American, and twelve undergraduate students participated in various aspects of this research.  Notably, the postdoctoral scholar obtained data on hyporheic stoneflies that was used in an NSF EAGER proposal that was funded by NSF DEB, and the postdoctoral scholar has been interviewing for faculty positions.  Both PhD students were initially supported by this funding but after their first year in graduate school they were awarded NSF Graduate Research Fellowships.  One PhD student finish in April 2019 and the other in Spring 2021.  One undergraduate, whom is Pacific Islander, was supported by an NSF REU supplement award.  Three of the undergraduate students are now enrolled in STEM graduate degree programs and two others have continued working as research assistants.  Outreach activities each summer included a match-the-hatch event in which members of the public learned about the research and how to match artificial flies used for fly fishing with the living aquatic stages.  Educational activities each summer were coordinated through the Rocky Mountain Biological Laboratory?s Kid?s Nature Camp, Adult Science Tours, and Citizen Science Geek Week and informed non-scientists about the biology of freshwater organisms, how predator-prey interactions are more than just who eats who, and about the value of undisturbed headwater streams in the U.S. Rocky Mountains.
