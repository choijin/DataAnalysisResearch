<AbstractNarration>The past decades have witnessed great progress in the prosthetics field through new materials and technologies such as targeted muscle reinnervation, powered knee, and ankle prosthesis. However, the biomechanical load due to the unnatural mechanical interaction between the soft tissues of the residual limb and the prosthetic socket is still not fully understood and needs to be further investigated. This interdisciplinary research project will create new sensing and computational methods enabling knowledge discovery for better prosthesis fitting quality with the goal of enhancing the design, fit, usability, and interface of prosthetic limbs for individuals with amputation in practice.&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this project is to investigate force distribution between the stump and socket by developing a wireless sensing device and a force visualization system. This proposal explores an accurate force-sensing design using a unique three-dimensional nanowall network structure, which allows the fabrication of a robust sensor array on a flexible platform for quantitative pressure and shear force measurement. This interdisciplinary research project consists of sensor material synthesis, device fabrication, platform and signal processing unit design for the stump-socket interface application, and a machine learning-based solution to analyze the information that affects the sense of comfortable fit. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research is multidisciplinary, bringing together the fields of digital design and test, human machine interface, sensors, and signal processing and extending the impact of mobile sensing and health technology to the prosthetics research. A team of investigators and students from Case Western Reserve University and the Cleveland Veterans Affairs Medical Center with complementary expertise will carry out this collaborative project. The proposed solution is expected to help prosthetists to design better devices and make the fitting procedure convenient and straightforward. Students working on the project will receive training across multiple disciplines.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Amputations, particularly of the lower limb due to vascular disease, infection, tumor, trauma, and/or diabetes, are a worldwide problem. To increase normalcy after lower limb amputation, a patient can use a prosthetic device to replace the amputated leg. The past decades have witnessed great progress in the prosthetics field through new materials and technologies such as targeted muscle reinnervation, powered knee, and ankle prosthesis. Generally, the prosthetic device includes a socket that interfaces with the remaining residual limb. The socket can be fitted to the remaining residual limb, but changes in body weight and the size of the residual limb can result in a socket that no longer fits perfectly. Biomechanical load due to the unnatural mechanical interaction between the soft tissues of the residual limb and the prosthetic socket is still not fully understood and needs to be further investigated. A poorly-fitting socket can lead to chronic skin problems, including pressure ulcers, dermatitis, infections, and pain, which seriously affect a patient&rsquo;s health and quality of life. However, making a socket that fits well over the long term is a complicated and challenging process. Currently, a liner is used to provide a vacuum seal and cushioning materials. Although the liner can help prolong the comfort associated with the socket, the liner does not monitor the occurrence of chronic skin problems associated with a poorly fitting socket.</p> <p>The objective of this project is to create an intelligent socket sensor system for a prosthetic device with an inner-socket sensor array to record real-time pressure and/or shear force data within the socket and to investigate force distribution between the stump and socket by developing a wireless sensing device and a force visualization system. This research project explores an accurate force-sensing design using a unique three-dimensional Nanowall network structure, which allows the fabrication of a robust sensor array on a flexible platform for quantitative pressure and shear force measurement. A sensor array within a socket for a prosthetic device continuously detects pressure and/or shear force experienced by a patient&rsquo;s residual limb inside the socket. A connector associated with the sensor array sends data related to the pressure and/or shear force to a signal processing circuit. The signal processing circuit processes the data related to the pressure and/or shear force and sends the processed data related to the pressure and/or shear force to a computing device. A processor associated with the computing device provides contact force visualization capability. A visualization device associated with the computing device displays the visualization in a user perceivable manner. This interdisciplinary research project created new sensing and computational methods enabling knowledge discovery for better prosthesis fitting quality with the goal of enhancing the design, fit, usability, and interface of prosthetic limbs for individuals with amputation in practice.
