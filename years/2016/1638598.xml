<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;Non-Technical:&lt;br/&gt;Materials and device innovations play crucial roles in maintaining the US leadership in semiconductor industry, which has important economic and societal implications. The proposed research will enable scientific advances in understanding the key factors limiting the performance of an emerging class of electronics materials that is two-dimensional molybdenum disulfide. These materials may find applications in next-generation wearable electronics, which has far reaching applications from health monitoring to security. For these materials to become commercially viable, it is necessary to develop large-area growth techniques. Therefore, there has been an increased research activity to produce device-quality molybdenum disulfide. However, the electronic properties of those materials still need significant improvements. TMD-based technology will be transformative in the development of advanced wearable devices. The broader impacts of this proposal also include training of students in important scientific areas and providing them with expertise in device physics, nanofabrication, and analysis methods.  &lt;br/&gt;Technical :&lt;br/&gt;The overall goal of the proposed research is to enable an in-depth understanding of the interplay between the process parameters and the electrical characteristics of molybdenum disulfide materials and devices. We will systematically explore the origin of device performance degradation in molybdenum disulfide transistors due to the growth process and contacts using advanced material and device characterization techniques. Specifically, this research aims at advancing the field of two-dimensional materials toward their widespread deployment for large-area device applications by pursuing two research goals: (i) in-depth understanding of the effect of various growth parameters on the electronic properties of molybdenum disulfide, and (ii) systematic engineering of contacts in molybdenum disulfide devices to significantly enhance electron injection into the channel from the contacts.</AbstractNarration>

A recent example of such research activities includes exploring the prospects of layered two-dimensional (2-D) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) for device applications. Two prominent examples of TMD materials are MoS2 and WS2. There are two main requirements for implementing a realistic electronic system from these emerging materials. The first requirement is to understand how to synthesize device-quality materials on a large scale, i.e. large-area growth of materials with negligible amounts of structural imperfections. The second critical requirement is to develop necessary knowledge for reliable production of high-performance devices with homogeneous electrical properties. Achieving this goal requires an in-depth understanding of factors that limit the device performance or cause the variability in the characteristics of devices. Our research projects developed new knowledge for improving the performance and consistency of devices made of synthetic monolayer TMDs. Below is the summary of three key technical outcomes.  1-     Synthetic TMD materials usually contain a large number of structural defects. Those defects degrade electronic devices. One strategy to mitigate the detrimental effects of defects on device performance is to heal defects after the material synthesis. In this project, we showed that superacid treatment can improve the key performance metrics of transistors made of synthetic monolayer MoS2.        2-    A major impediment for making fast switches from this family of 2-D materials is the difficulty in making low resistance contacts to TMDs. Inducing excess charge electrons in TMDs using an imperfect oxide overlayer are effective for alleviating this issue. In this research project, we provided an insight into the underlying mechanism by which this method improves the contact resistance. We also experimentally showed that applying this method alone might be inadequate for achieving technologically viable contacts to monolayer TMD materials.    3-    The small thickness of nanomaterials is often the origin of their unique physical properties. However, this structural property of nanomaterials makes them susceptible to the stray charges in their surrounding environment, resulting in the inconsistency in their characteristics. Those stray charges often exist within the substrate, on which nanomaterials reside. In this project, we provided a new insight into how the strength of adhesion between monolayer TMDs and their underlying substrate influence the device performance and its homogeneity across an array of devices. Our findings in this study provides an important practical guide for engineering TMD growth and fabrication processes on oxide substrates.

The project also involved two high school students, where they won the first place in the New York State Science competition in 2017 and 2019.
