<AbstractNarration>This project addresses the challenge of infusing computational thinking (CT) into a wide array of undergraduate courses from many different disciplines. It is addressing NSF calls for "computer science for all students" and also will contribute to the NSF call for infusing computer science into other STEM (and non-STEM) courses [CS+X]. Based on prior work at the precollege as well as post-secondary level, it is building and testing a promising model of change at the institutional level at the University of Delaware. This model has the potential to be a national example for the infusion of computational thinking (CT) into a general undergraduate curriculum. It also introduces and, potentially, tests the effectiveness of four important initiatives designed to further CT in the curriculum: 1) a model for change; 2) effective faculty professional development practices; 3) incorporation of peer mentoring; and 4) formative and summative assessment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This change model builds on significant prior knowledge and experience and uses evidence-based approaches for ongoing faculty professional development, supported by trained undergraduates who act as Learning Assistants to create a functional learning community. It incorporates carefully-designed assessments of changes in faculty practice, general education courses, student learning outcomes and the impact of the structure on the change itself, building on the Association of American Colleges and Universities VALUE Rubrics, particularly the Quantitative Literacy Rubric.</AbstractNarration>
