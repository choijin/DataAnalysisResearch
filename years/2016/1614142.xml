<AbstractNarration>On September 16, 2015, a Mw 8.3 earthquake ruptured a portion of the Peru-Chile trench. This event appears to have a temporally complex rupture and was well recorded by instruments both in the near-field and at teleseismic distances. The proposed project will apply an adaptive non-linear Bayesian inversion method to solve for the fault rupture of the recent Chilean earthquake, using the preponderance of collected data from both on-land measurements and ocean based tide gauge and tsunami recordings. This approach results in a quantification of the earthquake rupture through an explicit treatment of the data and model resolvability along a source region. The benefit of this type of inversion method compared to other conventional methods is that it gives a higher level of focus to the uncertainties in measurements and their spatial and temporal resolvability. This leads to an inversion result that has improved confidence levels without introducing biases in grid placement or problem regularization. This research will be conducted at the Australian National University School of Earth Sciences under the mentorship of Professor Phil Cummins. The Cummins group is noted for specialized expertise in seismology and tsunami wave propagation from a mathematical and geophysical perspective.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On September 16, 2015, a large magnitude earthquake struck of the coast of Central Chile in a region that has been prone to very large and destructive earthquakes over the past decades. An Initial analysis of the spatial and temporal components of the rupture suggests that this event was complex in nature. In conjunction with research scientists at the Australian National University, this project proposes to quantify the slip from the 2015 Chile earthquake through use of a non-linear Bayesian adaptive inversion. This approach gives a higher level of focus on the uncertainties of each measurement used as well as their spatial and temporal resolvability. This results in a better understanding of how the earthquake ruptured while minimizing the amount of analyst led biases, which can greatly alter the model results. Ultimately, the results of this project allows for a better understanding of the seismic hazard of this region of the tectonically active Peru-Chile trench. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award under the East Asia and Pacific Summer Institutes program supports summer research by a U.S. graduate student and is jointly funded by NSF and the Australian Academy of Science.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  Many different instruments and datasets are used to study earthquakes, including seismometers, GPS, InSAR, and tide/tsunami gauges. Each dataset has its own pros and cons and is able to resolve different attributes of an earthquake?s rupture process over various regions. For example, InSAR satellite data can quantify line-of-sight phase changes before and after an earthquake on land, but cannot resolve deformation that occurs underwater. While GPS-acoustic instruments have been developed, allowing for point measurements of seafloor deformation, they are only employed in a few select locations and are very expensive to operate.  Tsunami-based datasets such as wave heights measured in the open ocean, are sensitive to seafloor deformation but no to deformation that occurs on land. Many large earthquakes occur at convergent plate boundaries and rupture primarily on submarine faults, however are primarily quantified through land-based datasets. The main goal of this project was to explore how the inclusion of tsunami data in earthquake source inversions modifies geodetic and seismic earthquake inversion results.   This project studied the 2015 Illapel Chile earthquake and tsunami using data from three nearby open ocean tsunami gauges, 16 continuous GPS stations, and line-of-sight deformation recorded from the Sentinel-1A SAR satellite. Analysis and project set-up benefited from a collaboration with the Australian National University and the Australian Academy of Science including mentoring from P. Cummins. The tsunami propagation model JAGURS, developed by T. Baba and P. Cummins was also employed for tsunami waveform simulations that were critical for the inversion portion of the study.   Key findings from the result include an assessment that the inclusion of tsunami datasets increased the resolution of the spatial domain between the Chilean coastline and the trench, whereas land based datasets alone often did not full resolve this tsunamigenic region.  Additionally, mismatch between forward models of the Illapel earthquake?s tsunami from land-based fault solutions and observed waveforms. However, with the inclusion of tsunami data directly into a source inversion, the shape of the observed waveforms can be resolved, but with a slight change in source geometry.   Results from this project were presented at the 2016 American Geophysical Union fall meeting and published in the Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth ( doi:10.1002/2016JB013883 ). Methods developed from this study are employed in a future study that will be presented at the International Tsunami Symposium in August of 2017.
