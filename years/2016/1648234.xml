<AbstractNarration>This project entails the design and implementation of a low cost World Maker device that lets students code, create game levels, and engage in other maker activities using everyday objects to ensure all young people can develop the creative confidence to invent. The system uses modern technology to avoid digital screens. Throughout this experience, learners tap into their natural proclivities to make and shape ideas in the non-digital world, and develop the ability to fluently construct new ideas in a technical medium. The commercialization of the World Maker (WM) device will address two, nationally important issues.  First, by scaffolding young learners through progressively bringing their ideas into reality, the WM will foster creative confidence: the natural ability to come up with ideas and the courage to act on them. Next, there is a gender gap in innovation and entrepreneurship in the United States.  Women patent at 40% the rate of men, only 9% of information technology related patents have one or more female inventors, and only 8% of the beneficiaries of incubators meant to commercialize innovations were women. The WM will address gender equity issues in the maker community (currently 80% male) and by widening pathways to engage in making.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The key technical challenges that must be solved include: 1) ensuring that the system can be manufactured at a low price point, 2) the industrial design challenge; creating a device that is portable and not breakable 3) developing applications that will support the overall goals of the WM, and 4) further defining and refining a user experience that teachers/parents will find educationally compelling and children love playing with.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[For this Phase I project, JoyLabz, LLC prototyped a system to radically reduce the barriers to learning maker skills through design, coding, and creative problem-solving.

These user studies were conducted with children?s science museums and confirmed that the design of our tool provided ease of entry to begin making. Using everyday objects, participants would try something, remove it, and try something new very fluidly. Next, pairs of students who worked with our tool tended to adopt an interaction where one student would create for the other student. This back and forth co-creating was characteristic of the interactions between pairs of students. Finally, parent and museum employee interviews revealed that they felt our tool was an engaging and creative activity that encouraged children to solve problems, to think strategically, and to think "outside of the box". There was a strong appreciation for those characteristics with an emphasis on the observation that their children could be self-directed, yet still learning important STEM-related skills.  The system will have wide ranging benefits for our target audience including fostering creative confidence, addressing gender equity issues in the maker community, and widening access to tools and providing easier entry into making. After completing the Phase I research, we are confident that we have addressed the answers to our questions, and that we have developed a powerful educational technology that will be competitive in the marketplace for informal learning centers as well as individual customers.
