<AbstractNarration>Proposal Number: 1603414, PI: Guo, Ruilan&lt;br/&gt;Title: Molecularly Porous Non-network Polymer Membranes with Superior Resistance to Physical Aging for Gas Separations&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gas separations are central to many of the technological innovations in clean energy industries (e.g., H2 purification) and environmental remediation (e.g., carbon capture). Membrane technology, which takes advantage of materials selectivity, provides a powerful means to effect separations in complex streams because of its low energy consumption, modularity and reliability. Fast and selective transport combined with scalability and long term durability are key attributes of an ideal separation membrane material. However, currently used polymer membranes are frequently challenged by a tradeoff between gas permeability and selectivity largely due to insufficient microporosity and/or a broad size distribution of micropores that collapse over time (known as physical aging). This project will focus on developing an innovative membrane platform based on a family of super rigid, ladder-like polymers that exploit the novel properties imparted by shape-persistent structural unit to construct configuration-based non-collapsible molecularly porous structure. The new membranes will meet the needs for a broad range of critical gas separations. The separations to be addressed are of enormous significance to more efficiently exploit fossil fuels and to address the challenges in carbon capture. Equally important, the project will also produce exemplary materials and processes that will serve as vivid educational and training tools for students at all levels including graduate and undergraduate students and high school teachers. The efforts via the Research Experiences for Teachers (RET) program and its outreach activities will excite the general public about materials research that carries societal importance through its objectives of clean fuel production and carbon capture for environment remediation via energy efficient membrane technologies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The overarching goal of this project is to identify and to elucidate the key material's structural and functional features that control the molecular transport and physical aging properties of microporous polymers. The major task of this project is to synthesize super rigid ladder polymers via covalently bonding shape-persistent pentiptycene units with bulky bridgehead substitutions into various main polymer chain contour profiles. The novel materials will then be used to fabricate membranes with systematically controlled processing conditions. Characterization work will include physical aging and atomic-level detection of free volume architecture to correlate with structural and processing parameters to evaluate membrane gas transport properties and physical aging properties. The transport and aging behavior will be used to determine the quantitative effect of structural parameters on the separation performance to establish fundamental structure-property relationships to guide new membrane design. Successful execution of this project will deliver transformative membrane materials applicable for a broad range of critical gas separations. The project will provide fundamental understanding of how the polymer's local configurational and conformational variations propagate through intra- and inter-chain and supramolecular interactions to construct molecularly porous membranes with maximized separation productivity and efficiency as well as long term durability.</AbstractNarration>
