<AbstractNarration>The Faculty and Undergraduate Research Student Teams (FURST) program brings together small research groups comprised of undergraduate students and faculty from primarily undergraduate institutions (PUI) in order to provide them with a year-long research experience. The program also provides a one month long intensive summer immersion for its participants at an established summer REU site at Fresno State. FURST students get an opportunity to participate in professional workshops, presentations and academic discussions along with the REU students, whereas FURST faculty can take advantage of an on-site, in-person research collaboration with their peers within the FURST program. The program's main goal is to foster both student and faculty research at PUIs, with the specific goal of producing student and faculty authored publications, as well as presentations. The program is designed to be inclusive and accessible to teams from institutions with varying research focus and support, in order to mitigate cultural changes at institutions which may not consider research a quintessential component of higher education.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;FURST students will be working on open problems in mathematics under the guidance of their faculty mentors. Research topics include community detection problems in networks, expanding the framework and analysis of the cop and robber game, the use of coarse Ricci curvature in data analysis and interpolation problems, the study and solution of the non-linear Riccati-Ermakov equation, as well as other non-linear dispersive partial differential equations. Strengthening their background in the selected research topic through readings and lecture at their home institutions will prepare FURST students to engage in research at the same speed as the REU students during the immersion phase. Students will be expected to submit the end product of their research for publication in a peer reviewed journal. FURST faculty will engage in solving open problems in their area of research while building collaborations with faculty at other institutions. Faculty are also expected to produce publishable work as a result of participating in the program. In accordance with the stated goals, the program will improve access to research for students at PUIs, where such opportunities are typically limited. It will also (re)-energize faculty at PUIs so that they remain active in research. By doing so, FURST will help transform the research culture at the participating institutions, especially since the bulk of the research activities will take place at FURST teams' home institutions. While FURST student participants will learn skills through the program that are invaluable in graduate school and in the scientific workplace, the program will broadly impact the students at the involved PUIs by demonstrating to them (through student talks and presentations) that research can be part of the undergraduate educational experience. Finally, through the immersion in an active REU site, FURST students will gain exposure to the workings of an REU program, and will be able to make better informed choices about applying to REU as a potential next step in their academic development.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Goals of the FURST grant are as follows:   Provide a way for undergraduate students at Youngstown State University to participate in mathematics research through out the academic year Grant these undergraduate students the chance to participate in a summer research experience with other undergradaute students.  Provide the space and time for faculty from a majority undergraduate institution (YSU) to meet with faculty from other majority undergraduate institutions (Williams College) and advance their research agenda Continue to improve the undergraduate research culture at such institutions.   There are two components to the FURST grant. The first component is the collaborative project lead by faculty but executed by undergraduate students. The second component is the collaborative work done by the faculty leaders.   Most of the work done for this grant was done during the first year of funding. However, some of the disimination of results for our work was done during and after January 2018. Marina Pavlichich and Lexi Reager, the two undergraduate students from Youngstown State University (YSU) supported by the FURST grant presented their work at the Joint Mathematics Meeting in San Diego in the form of a poster presentation.  In addition, with the data science knowledge, acquired during the program, Lexi Reager started a new project under the PI suppervisor, utilizing the same techniques to answer the question: Does YSU provide adequate counseling services for students? and, how is the lack of counseling services affecting the retantion and graduation of students? Ms. Reager won the First Place at the National Collegiate Honors Council Conference  Education and Pedagogy Poster Competition in November 2018.  As for the PI, the experience provided by the grant as well as the data science knowledge allowed her to secure private funds to run a small REU program at YSU during the summer of 2018 and financially support a team of three undergraduate students and a master student in investigating different clustering algorithms and learning how to program them.
