<AbstractNarration>Climate science has historically progressed through the interweaving of observation, theory, and experiments/modeling. The discovery of phenomena in observed data, followed by careful and thoughtful analysis, leads to the proposal of mechanisms responsible for these phenomena, which are then tested through experimentation. In turn, the analysis of the observed data must be guided by theory. The modern explosion in the quantity and accessibility of observations of climate represents an unprecedented opportunity for enhancing our understanding of the Earth's climate. This potential will only be realized if we equip young scientists with the toolkits to both process and explain this data: theoretical framework of climate dynamics and application of statistics to various climate data.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is to hold a weeklong workshop in which students will lectures on both climate science and statistical techniques, and work in small groups on research problems of their own choosing. It will provide a group of thirty graduate-level scientists with multi-disciplinary training necessary to analyze and understand climate data.  The workshop will be held from July 25-29, 2016 in the Department of the Geophysical Sciences at the University of Chicago, drawing from the strengths of faculty in Climate Dynamics as well as Statistics. Topics covered will include climate extremes, jet variability, large-scale transport and mixing, monsoons, turbulence, and geospatial time series analysis. This is a pilot program that has a potential to becoming an annual or biennial meeting in the subsequent years.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Rossbypalooza was held July 25-29, 2016, at the University of Chicago.  A workshop aimed at fostering collaborations among graduate students and young scholars in climate science and statistics, it was named after the famous meteorologist Carl Gustav Rossby, who founded the Department of Meteorology at the University in 1940, and the iconic music event Lollapalooza that the city hosts every summer.  Over fifty attended the workshop from around the world.    The workshop had two major goals.  The first was to draw scientists from two distinct backgrounds, climate science and statistics, and encourage them to work together in a hands-on environment.  Although climate scientists routinely use statistics in their research, only a fraction of them receive formal training in statistics and they may not be aware of the tools available for their research.  Meanwhile statisticians seeking to apply their training to climate data often feels ambivalent how to start because they did not have training in climate science.  Instead of attempting to provide formal training in both fields, we decided to encourage the participants to jump start the cross-cutting learning by letting them work together across the disciplinary boundaries.  The other goal was to let the graduate students of the pertinent departments (Geophysical Sciences and Statistics) at the University of Chicago assume leadership in every aspect of the workshop.  They were given a maximum freedom from the naming of the workshop, advertisement, the selection of the applicants (we had 100+ applications for the 40 slots for outside participants), choice of invited lecturers, budgets and finances (working with the University?s financial officer), to program development.  They did an admirable job, and above all, they enjoyed it themselves &mdash; their passion and excitement were palpable throughout the process.  The student organizers polled the accepted participants to find common interests to formulate the program and met with the faculty and invited lectures regularly to make sure that the lectures would be understandable for everyone.  They grouped all participants into 18 groups of 2-3 scientists, each including at least one climate scientist and one statistician.  During the workshop, all the participants met each morning in an upscale lecture hall for two lectures (one in climate science and the other in statistics) given by the faculty and invited speakers.  In the afternoon they would break up for group activities; each group chose a project of its own and used the resources of the University?s Research Computing Center to work on it in a hackathon style.  The afternoon of the last day featured a series of short presentations by the 18 groups on their achievements.  Although four afternoons might have been too short for substantive new results, we saw many interesting collaborative efforts beginning to form, which was very encouraging.  The workshop concluded with a keynote lecture by Prof. Peter Huybers (Harvard) followed by a reception.  The response from the participants was overwhelmingly positive.  Here are typical responses we got in the post-workshop questionnaire:  &bull; "Overall, this is a great workshop. Everything works pretty well for me ... The hackathon part is also a brilliant idea, as we can do some projects using the knowledge we just learned from the morning lectures."   &bull; "Everything was very good. Great faculty, great students. Excellent atmosphere! I am sure participation will have a significant and long lasting impact on careers of many smart people."   &bull; "Overall the conference was immensely enjoyable.The size and diversity of the student body was extremely well chosen."   &bull; "It was a great experience overall. I liked the venue, the lectures, the food provided, and the general idea of having climate scientists interact with statisticians. I learned a lot from the lectures and from the hackathon experience.  The fact that we got funding to attend was crucial. I hope you will keep doing it and I'll recommend it to people."   &bull; "Great to have climate scientists and statisticians together; excellent faculty and students to get to know and work with; lots of great ideas and conversations; was overall very happy with the workshop, especially given that it was the first time it was run."   &bull; "I liked almost everything about it! ... The mix of people was so fantastic. I really liked my team &amp; I think we learned a lot together!"   &bull; "The hackathon part of Rossbypalooza was excellent, especially because of the small teams and the helpfulness of the faculty members regarding the projects."   &bull; "I think the hackathon group projects where great; loved working with my team!"   &bull; "Rossbypalooza is a great idea and in general it worked really well. One great aspect was that it was pretty laid back -- I really didn't feel too much pressure to produce something special during the hackathon.  This encouraged more informal discussion and socializing, which was really beneficial."            Last Modified: 04/02/2017       Submitted by: Noboru Nakamura]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
