<AbstractNarration>Brown University proposes a project to create a flexible, language agnostic software library that makes text and block programming tools accessible to visually-impaired users.  Screen-readers, the most common affordable tool for presenting text to those who can't read it directly, have difficulties presenting source code which is symbol-heavy and navigated best not as a list of words, but as an abstract syntax tree (AST). This project will produce a collection of JavaScript libraries that annotate source code with structural descriptions suitable for presentation by screen readers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;JavaScript was chosen because web-based environments address common technical and logistical challenges in schools. They place fewer demands on IT staff for installation and maintenance, and enable students to work outside of school without manually transferring files. Web-based software is also easier to upgrade and evolve on the developer's end. Being the lingua-franca for cloud-based UIs, the browser's Document Object Model (DOM) is currently receiving significant attention when it comes to accessibility and thus, by using the DOM to display our IDE, we can leverage these investments now and in the future. The libraries created in this project will be used to make two web-based environments--WeScheme and code.pyret.org--accessible, and those environments will be used in conducting usability testing with visually-impaired users.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The project explored creating programming support for students who are visually-impaired. Though there has been a little exploration of this topic for professional programmers, there has been little attention paid to students, whose needs are quite different. The need for this work becomes especially urgent at a time when computing is being made a required subject for all students, which means its tools must take into account the needs of all. Irrespective of that, there is a moral requirement to make sure all students can get access to subjects of both intellectual and occupational value.  This project addressed three parts of the student programmer experience:  the development environment (IDE) that students use to control their programming experience the editor through which students write programs the interaction region (REPL) through which programs interact with their programs   In each case it identified issues that need attention, and either constructed solutions or borrowed solutions from analogous interfaces already familiar to visually-impaired users (e.g., recognizing the similarity between the REPL and chat interfaces).  The intellectual merit lies in constructing new editing forms, in particular recognizing the value in having a two-level language with both well-formedness and validity, and exploiting the former to provide novel and convenient navigation methods. This makes it much possible to conveniently edit programs partial programs, a problem poorly handled by prior work. It also lies in the handling of visual output from programs: making visual output accessible to the visually-impaired is a critical need for media-based computing curricula.  The broader impact arises from the software provided and ideas disseminated through numerous media (not only papers but also book chapters, blog posts, talks, and more).
