<AbstractNarration>This award supports the transition of the National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO) from the current model in which the Green Bank Observatory (GBO) and the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) have been managed and operated as integral components of NRAO. From October 1, 2016 NRAO management and operations principally will encompass the Very Large Array (VLA), the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), and associated support functions and development laboratories. GBO and VLBA will be managed and operated separately from NRAO. Operation of all these state-of-the-art radio telescopes provides important scientific capability to the U.S. community to explore fundamental scientific areas such as the formation of planets in other solar systems and the structure and evolution of the universe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A transition plan outlines the specific steps required within a six month period to revise operations of NRAO.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This award helped AUI move certain equipment and services from Green Bank to the National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO), associated with the redefinition of NRAO to exclude the GBT and the VLBA, and the creation of the new, independent Green Bank and Long Baseline Observatories.  The scope of this project was confined to the purchase and installation of the equipment listed in the baseline budget, the project management to carry out the work, the transfer of knowledge for the digital development and the set-up of the new Chart of Accounts.  All purchased equipment was received, installed as planned and successfully tested.  All training was successfully conducted.  The Chart of Accounts was fully implemented as planned.  This project was executed on budget and on schedule.  A Computer Numeric Control Lathe and Helium Arc Welding Equipment were installed in the technical services building at the Jansky Very Large Array facility to replace this capability at the Green Bank facility.  Laser Metrology Equipment was purchased for the Central Development Laboratory (CDL) to replace the capability at the Green Bank Machine Shop.  The equipment was received and training was conducted.  The cryogenic compressors at the CDL, which had previously been maintained by Green Bank technicians, were replaced with compressors that the CDL could maintain; these were successfully tested.  The Green Bank Low Frequency Antenna Test Range, and Anechoic Chamber capability was relocated to the Socorro facilities.  These systems were purchased, installed and successfully tested.  Green Bank had been the repository of much of the Observatories' digital development knowledge and capabilities. Socorro staff were trained at Green Bank to transfer this knowledge and the required equipment to transfer this capability was purchased and successfully tested.  The primary Management Information Services servers, which were housed in Green Bank, were replicated and installed at the Headquarters facility and successfully tested.  To facilitate the new organizational structure, a new Chart of Accounts was developed, implemented and thoroughly tested with all the interfacing business processes.
