<AbstractNarration>Animals perform a variety of repetitive behaviors, such as breathing and walking, without the need for conscious control. This automation is made possible by particular sets of neurons that are specialized to produce the outputs that drive these behaviors. There are many unanswered questions about how these neurons generate activity with the appropriate features in a way that adapts quickly and automatically to evolving conditions, such as changes in respiratory demand that occur in a switch from a walk to a run.  This project uses mathematical and computational approaches to address several such questions that arise in the context of breathing.  A first set of issues that will be studied relates to the understanding of how processes that evolve on very different timescales contribute to respiratory rhythms.   A second set of issues relates to how neurons involved in a particular phase of respiration, as well as populations of neurons active at different phases, become coordinated to produce effective breathing rhythms.  How these interactions break down to yield respiratory dysfunction, particularly in the context of the severe breathing disruptions arising in Rett syndrome, will also be studied.  The work will be completed in collaboration with experimentalists, and results of the project will lead to improved models of respiratory data and novel ideas on how to counter respiratory disorders.   In addition to enhancing understanding of respiratory function and dysfunction, this project will have broad implications, since rhythmic patterns produced by interacting networks of dynamic components involving multiple timescales are common across a wide range of biological and physical systems.  Trainees contributing to this research will gain experience with using computational methods to address data-driven questions in neuroscience.  Methods and findings developed will contribute to the training of students via local group meetings and courses and will be disseminated more broadly via publications, presentations, and model sharing.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A variety of repetitive behaviors fundamental to animals' interactions with the environment are driven by the rhythmic activity of networks of coupled neurons.  This project will address rhythm generation and control via a focus on neuronal networks in the mammalian brainstem associated with respiration.  In the rhythms that these networks produce, multiple populations of neurons take turns activating at specific relative times within each breathing cycle, and the activity within each population is synchronized when it arises.  This work will analyze how synchronized activity with complex dynamic features, called bursting, arises in a particular brainstem region during the inspiratory phase of breathing.  Doing so will involve novel mathematical analysis of the dynamics of systems with components that evolve on several distinct timescales. This work will lead to new insights into how respiratory processes should be modeled, which will be useful for the study of particular respiratory phenomena such as sighing and which will also generalize to other biological and physical systems with multiple timescale dynamics.  New results will also be attained, using mathematical and computational methods, about how synchronized bursting in neuronal networks depends on how the neurons in the network are interconnected and communicate with each other.   Respiratory rhythms must be robust to changes in environmental and metabolic demands, and these findings will yield predictions about what features provide this robustness.   Finally, this project will use analysis methods that reveal the dynamic effects of particular parameter variations to elucidate how the intrinsic properties of neurons within particular respiratory areas and the patterns of connections between areas contribute to overall respiratory rhythmicity and to disruptions of respiratory dynamics.  These steps will be guided by novel experimental data and will result in advances in basic understanding as well as predictions about effective interventions to counter respiratory dysfunction.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[This project investigated the dynamical mechanisms underlying the generation of breathing rhythms by specialized neurons in the mammalian brain.  It provided new results and predictions about these mechanisms, some of which apply more generally to other brain rhythms.  It also led to the development of new mathematical methods for studying systems with components evolving on different timescales and for analyzing the behavior of solutions of corresponding mathematical models that are consistent with experimental data.  The generation and patterning of respiratory rhythms involves factors on the single-neuron scale, on the level of a population of interconnected neurons, and at the scale of multiple interacting neuronal populations.   In terms of single neurons, this project focused on the key respiratory neurons that drive motor output to the diaphragm so that inspiration can occur.  The funding provided supported careful analyses of how different neuronal components, such as various ion flows that alter neuronal activity levels and can trigger neuronal signaling, conspire to produce multiple activity patterns seen in respiration.  This analysis included consideration of how these interactions change across development.   At the level of the population of these inspiratory neurons, the project supported the development of a simplified network model that can be analyzed to determine how the spread and synchronization of activity within the population depend on the pattern of pathways by which neurons in the network communicate.  It also provided explanations of results obtained experimentally on changes in network activity induced by blocking of certain ionic or signaling currents, with predictions for testing these explanations; these explanations suggest additional information about which network components are important for rhythm generation. Across the full respiratory circuit, this project led to the development of a simplified computational model, consistent with data but also including new predictions, that was applied to study how neurons across two brain stem regions interact to produce respiratory rhythms in various conditions.  This model was used to provide a proof of principle for an existing theory of the respiratory disruptions that occur in Rett syndrome and to test a proposed intervention to restore normal breathing features under Rett conditions.  Moreover, this project shed new light on the question of how the dynamic properties that inspiratory neurons show when isolated experimentally actually contribute to rhythm generation in the full respiratory network.  Specifically, it was shown that the intrinsic dynamic regime of these neurons is masked when they are embedded into the intact respiratory network.  That is, the network dynamics exhibit similar features and responses to perturbation regardless of the bursting neurons' intrinsic tuning, and the bursting neurons' output properties are altered when they are part of the full network interactions. This result highlights the importance of integrative modeling that combines experimental observations into a unified computational framework, to test resulting behaviors. Finally, on the mathematical side, this project led to our development of a new change of coordinates, local orthogonal rectification or LOR, that can be applied to mathematically analyzes behaviors of interest in any dynamical system model.  For example, LOR was applied to efficiently identify periodic orbits that often play key roles in neuronal dynamics, to check their stability, and to study how model solutions become closer to these periodic behaviors over time.  The single-neuron study introduced new ideas about how to analyze generation of activity involving factors evolving on multiple distinct timescales, by piecing together effects on different timescales appropriately. Significant portions of this work proceeded through collaborations with neuroscience labs, which provided direct access to experimental data and testing of model predictions.  The project provided partial support for a postdoc, 6 graduate, and several undergraduate students, many of whom were women and one of whom was a member of another demographic group underrepresented in mathematics and neuroscience, who gained valuable research training and dedicated mentorship from the PI in the course of their participation. The project achieved broader training impacts through the incorporation of novel mathematical and biological results into courses taken by graduate and undergraduate students from multiple departments as well as summer training programs, the presentation of emerging ideas in mathematical biology group meetings at Pitt, the supervision of research rotations by neuroscience students and undergraduates, and participation in local interdisciplinary centers. Multiple models that were developed were shared online via ModelDB and github, while project results were disseminated via interdisciplinary journals and conferences.
