<AbstractNarration>This project is funded by the Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program of the Chemistry Division at the National Science Foundation. Professor R. Kenneth Marcus and collaborators at Clemson University are developing and characterizing capillary-channeled polymer (C-CP) fibers as stationary phases for rapid processing of synthetic and large biological molecules. These stationary phases are amenable to a wide range of instrumentation formats and offer advantages for the separation of mixtures. The goal of the studies is to produce efficient and selective separations in an economical manner. This work is interdisciplinary, involving collaborative efforts between research groups in chemistry, bioengineering, mathematical and materials sciences.  The project includes investigators affiliated with the Clemson University Center for Advanced Engineering of Fibers and Films. There are also collaborations with federal laboratories. If successful, the project may result in new commercial ventures in the textile and biopharmaceutical industries in South Carolina. Enhanced capabilities for large molecule separations have implications across many commercial sectors, including the rapidly expanding area of protein therapeutics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A two-pronged approach is used to better affect macromolecule separations using the C-CP fiber phases. The first area focuses on the novel implementation of the fibers as the stationary phases for dimension two of comprehensive two-dimensional liquid chromatographic separations. C-CP phases of various surface chemistries are evaluated in terms of the cycling times required to affect high quality separations of temporal "cuts" obtained from the first dimension. The second area focuses on modification of surface chemistries to affect high levels of selectivity. There are four classes of reactions: further use of lipid tethered ligands as a general reaction methodology to modify hydrophobic surfaces, high density amination of polyester base fibers, microwave energy to affect covalent coupling of ligands to nylon 6 C-CP materials, and finally the adsorption of macromolecule ligands on polypropylene surface for class-specific separation. These chemistries are used to develop stand-alone columns (on either the analytical or preparative scales) as well as columns for use as dimension two in multidimensional applications.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The ability to effect high quality chemical separations lies at the heart of product efficacy for virtually all materials, nowhere is this more true than in the pharmaceutical industry.  At the heart of most of these separations is the use of the technique of high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC).  The Marcus group at Clemson University has developed a family of polymer fiber materials which are particularly effective at the rapid, high efficiency separation of proteins from a variety of biological matrices, inclusive of body fluids and the cell culture media employed in the production of biopharmaceuticals including monoclonal antibodies (mAbs).  Capillary-channeled polymer (C-CP) fibers are extruded from commodity materials including polypropylene, polyester, and nylon.  Placed into a column format, these fibers allow for these types separations to occur on the analytical scale in time frames of single minutes rather than hours, an important aspect in basic biochemical research, drug development, and process monitoring.  As in the case of simple textiles, the surfaces of the fibers are easily modified (dyed) to affect different levels of specificity.      During the course of this funded project, Marcus and co-workers have applied the C-CP fiber platform towards separations of greater relevance to the biopharmaceutical industry.  Extending the chemistries and applications to include the arena of two-dimensional liquid chromatography (2D-LC).  In this regard, the efforts find use as well in the characterization of mixtures of synthetic polymers.  Collaborationwith a commercial biopharmaceutical manufacturer has provided a level of perspective and relevance not normally seen in academe.  Indeed, the C-CP fibers have found application in the various stages of the separation/purification processes of proteins, enhancing the overall throughput and information content.      An unanticipated outcome of this effort was the realization that the C-CP column format, consisting of many parallel channels, allows for the ready transport and chemically-selective separation of biological and synthetic nanobodies and nanoparticles.  Specifically, great strides and outcomes have been realized in the purification of a class of bio-nanobodies called exosomes.  Exosomes are small (50-120 nm) extracellular vesicles which are produced by virtually all eukaryotic cells.  In the human body, exosomes are now known to be primary vehicles for cell-to-cell communication and in the transport of proteins and genetic material.  As such there is great interest in the potential use of exosomes in both the clinical and therapeutic arenas.  In the former case, surface proteins and genetic cargo reflect the cells of origin and their potential disease states.  In the latter case, their ability to be selectively taken up by diseased cells and to discharge their contents is seen as an attractive means of drug delivery.  Exosomes have been isolated, purified, and quantified using C-CP fibers in column and spin-down tip formats from a variety of matrices, including serum, urine, saliva, cervical mucus, and cell culture media.  Purity levels and throughput far exceeding other processes such as ultracentrifugation and other size-based methods have been realized.  Collaborations with physicians, biochemists, and other analytical chemists are quickly revealing the efficacy of the approach.  Most recently, the same methodologies have been extended to the isolation, purification, and quantification of lentivirus particles.  Lentiruses are similar in size and surface chemistry to exosomes, and are also of high relevance as potential drug delivery vehicles.   During the course of this Division of Chemistry project, NSF funds have contributed substantially in the research described in 3 Ph.D. dissertations, with 4 current Ph.D. candidates receiving support.  In addition, 4 undergraduate students have participated in the project.  In addition, 12 peer-reviewed journal articles have been published, with 6 more in process.  Likewise, over 25 conference presentations have described the funded efforts.  Finally, 1 international patent application (CPT) is pending describing the implementation of the C-CP phases for the separation/isolation/purification of bio-and synthetic nanobodies and nanoparticles.
