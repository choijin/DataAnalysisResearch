<AbstractNarration>The Research at High Pressure Gordon Conference (HP-GRC) is one of the oldest topical conferences held since the emergence of the field of high pressure and has been held uninterrupted for over 60 years. The HP-GRC is a multidisciplinary conference in the field of high pressure research, and this year?s HP-GRC program consists of presentations on breakthrough results obtained using high-pressure methods and new innovations for studying matter under extreme conditions. This conference brings together experts from the dynamic and static pressure communities across the world to present and discuss their new and unpublished results. This proposal will provide support for registration fee and/or travel support for participants, with preference given to post docs and graduate students.</AbstractNarration>
