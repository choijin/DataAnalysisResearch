<AbstractNarration>Usable security and privacy is increasingly recognized as an important aspect of the cybersecurity field. The Symposium On Usable Privacy and Security (SOUPS) brings together an interdisciplinary group of researchers and practitioners in human computer interaction, security, and privacy. The program features technical papers, workshops and tutorials, a poster session, panels and invited talks, and discussion sessions. The 12th SOUPS will be held June 22-24, 2016 in Denver CO. The funds support travel grants for students to attend the conference. SOUPS is the top conference devoted to usable privacy and security. By increasing student participation at the SOUPS conference, it may encourage more students to get involved in usable security research and pursue further graduate education and careers in this area.</AbstractNarration>
