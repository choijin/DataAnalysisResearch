<AbstractNarration>This award supports travel for keynote speakers and young researchers attending the 33rd Ohio State-Denison Mathematics Conference, May 13-15, 2016, at the Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio. The meeting is focused on the theory of groups and rings and will attract top mathematicians from around the world, in addition to graduate students and post-doctoral researchers from all parts of the US. The conference will foster new collaborations, introduce graduate students to established researchers and cutting-edge techniques, provide young mathematicians with opportunities to present their work, and encourage participation by researchers belonging to under-represented groups. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This year the Ohio State-Denison Mathematics Conference features keynote talks devoted to GK-dimension of algebras, universal constructions in rings, and embedding results in groups. There will also be contributed talks on a wide range of other currently active areas of research, including clean rings, Leavitt path algebras, projective and injective modules, and solvable groups.</AbstractNarration>
