<AbstractNarration>With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) and Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities (CRIF) programs, Professor Amanda Hummon from the University of Notre Dame and colleagues Bradley Smith, Marya Lieberman and Michelle Joyce have acquired a matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometer (MALDI-TOF-TOF MS) with collision-induced dissociation (CID) capabilities. In general, mass spectrometry (MS) is one of the key analytical methods used to identify and characterize small quantities of chemical species embedded in complex mixture.  A laser striking the inert mixture embedded with the sample, vaporizes and makes charged particles (ions) from the sample. The ions pass into the mass spectrometer where the masses of the parent ion and its fragment ions are measured. In a time-of-flight instrument the ions are accelerated by an electric field to allow further characterization. MALDI TOF combines gentle ionization (ideal for producing intact ions of peptides, proteins, nucleic acids, carbohydrates, synthetic polymers, and other similarly sized species) with a detection mode that offers an excellent balance between sensitivity and accuracy across a wide mass range. The collision-induced dissociation breaks up the molecular ions in the gas phase. This highly sensitive technique allows identification and determination of the structure of molecules in a complex mixture. The acquisition strengthens the research infrastructure at the University and region. The instrument broadens participation by involving diverse students in research and research training with this modern analytical technique. Because the principal investigator is heavily involved in mentoring students from underrepresented groups and the local Girl Scouts, this instrumentation exposes those students to mass spectrometry techniques and STEM activities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;such The award is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels, especially in: (a) screening of paper substrates and milk; (b) screening for drugs in dried urine spots; (c) characterizing self-assembled supramolecular organic dyes; (d) developing imaging mass spectrometry of platinum compounds; (e) correlating mass spectrometry imaging and confocal Raman microscopy; (f) using plasmon-assisted laser-desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (LDI-MS) with gold nanoparticles for the detection of saccharides; (g) studying xenopus laevis developmental biology and (h) using MALDI for metabolomics.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p><strong>2019 Final Outcomes Report for NSF Award CHE-</strong><strong>1625944</strong>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Summary</strong></p> <p><strong>MRI: Acquisition of a MALDI-TOF-TOF Mass Spectrometer</strong></p> <p>The Bruker UltrafleXtreme MALDI-TOF-TOF instrument has become an indispensable research tool for users of the Mass Spectrometry and Proteomics Facility (MSPF) at the University of Notre Dame. The clearest measure of the extraordinary popularity of this instrument is the actual number of shots fired by the laser. During the instrument?s 3 years of service in MSPF, the laser has fired a total of 1,599,418,000 times and has been active for 2,240.5 hours. That latter number equates to 56 weeks of continuous usage for a 40 hour work week, which amounts to more than an entire year of non-stop operation. The number of laser shots exceeds by nearly 33% Bruker?s expected lifetime for this device. Perhaps it is no surprise that a replacement laser diode will be installed after only 3 years of usage.</p> <p><strong>Intellectual Merit:</strong> <strong></strong></p> <p>Investigators from multiple research groups at Notre Dame and other institutions have benefitted from access to the Bruker UltrafleXtreme mass spectrometer. The list of Notre Dame research groups accessing the instrument includes those of Prof. Patricia Champion, Prof. Shaun Lee, and Prof. Kevin Vaughan from the Department of Biological Sciences; Prof. Brian Baker, Prof. Brian Blagg, Prof. Francis Castellino, Prof. Matthew Champion, Prof. Patricia Clark, Prof. Norm Dovichi, Prof. Haifeng Gao, Prof. Marya Lieberman, Prof. Emeritus Marvin Miller, Prof. Shahriar Mobashery, Prof. Jeffrey Peng, Prof. Bradley Smith, Prof. Sharon Stack, Prof. Rich Taylor and Prof. Rebecca Whelan from the Department of Chemistry &amp; Biochemistry; and Prof. Basar Bilgicer, Prof. Paul Bohn, Prof. Merlin Bruening, Prof. Jennifer Schaefer and Prof. Peter Kilpatrick from the Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering. In addition to researchers at Notre Dame, MSPF staff routinely ran samples for investigators at other academic institutions including Johns Hopkins University and the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. These incredibly productive researchers have generated a total of 51 publications, presentations and invited talks during the three year time period of this award.</p> <p>While more than 50 total publications, presentations and invited talks represent significant intellectual contributions to this nation and the world, we are also extremely proud of three Ph.D. graduates whose dissertations were filled with data acquired using the Bruker UltrafleXtreme mass spectrometer. Dr. Kate Ludwig and Dr. Monica Schroll are recent Notre Dame graduates of Prof. Amanda Hummon?s research group, which relocated to the Ohio State University in 2017. Notre Dame?s most recent graduate student to complete the requirements for the Ph.D. degree is Dr. McKay Rettig who successfully defended his dissertation on December 13, 2019. Dr. Rettig?s advisor was Prof. Peter Kilpatrick, current Provost and Senior Vice President of Academic Affairs at the Illinois Institute of Technology and former Dean of the College of Engineering at the University of Notre Dame.</p> <p><strong>Broader Impacts:</strong></p> <p>Due to its relative ease of use and its highly interactive nature for data acquisition, the Bruker UltrafleXtreme represents a nearly ideal open access instrument. These important operating characteristics allowed MSPF personnel to train several undergraduate students to run this instrument. In fact, MSPF employs a talented ND female undergraduate biochemistry major to perform routine analyses of service samples as part of her on-campus work-study obligation. A current undergraduate senior male student from the laboratory of Prof. Matt Champion was among the most frequent users of the instrument during the past academic year.</p> <p>MSPF personnel provided frequent tours of the facility to visitors to McCourtney Hall throughout the award period. During these tours, the Bruker UltrafleXtreme was prominently featured along with a discussion of the importance of NSF funding to support the acquisition of these critical shared research resources. MSPF currently has several graduate student users that were participants on these tours in previous years, so the presence of this instrument has helped to recruit a future group of scientists and engineers being trained at Notre Dame.</p> <p>Funding provided by NSF Award CHE-1625944 was used by the University of Notre Dame to purchase a Bruker UltrafleXtreme MALDI-TOF-TOF mass spectrometer in 2016. This investment has yielded substantial returns in the form of intellectual contributions to the nation and to the world, advanced training for undergraduate and graduate students at Notre Dame and helped to produce highly educated US citizens with long tenures in well-paying careers ahead of them.
