<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project stems from the critical need for improved point-of-care diagnostic devices particularly those for Zika virus infections.  The new tests developed could allow results to be available within less than one hour, thereby reducing burden on patients and clinicians, and improving treatment and outcomes. The new tests will potentially improve the lives of people suffering from Zika infections and will impact several current clinical treatment regimes and may suggest new treatment options.  Applications for the core technology could also include other types of infectious disease diagnostics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project will be the first step in commercializing a new, innovative and rapid diagnostic test for Zika virus infections.  The core technology is based on molecular imprinting.  This method allows building exact casts of biological molecules that are extremely stable and therefore can be stored without refrigeration.  In this project the core technology is used to create stable casts of antibodies to Zika virus.  The devices will detect binding of the antibodies to the casts and therefore can detect if the antibodies are present in a patient's blood, which would point to an infection. The technology is the first diagnostic test based on imprinting large molecules like the Zika antibody.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Project outcome     The project dealt with customer discovery for a point of care Zika screening tool. The team traveled over 18,000 miles to ten cities in seven weeks to interview stakeholders.  Several important insights were gained.  The armed forces will not be a customer for our minimum viable product There is an excellent product-market fit for our minimum viable product in areas where Zika infection is endemic The products needs to be a screening tool, not a diagnostic      A startup company, MIPTek Inc., was formed as a result of the project.  The company received $50,000 startup funds and is raising funds through venture capital and SBIRs.     The customer discovery process allowed us to get out of the research setting and into locations, where our devices will be used eventually.  Interviewing health care professionals such as doctors and nurses allowed us to hone our product to achieve a better market fit.      MIPTek?s value propositions are to provide on-site screening for Zika, that is same day, increases accurate treatments, is dependable with 95% reproducibility, reduces unnecessary treatment and use of hospital beds, and increases doctor-patient confidence. MIPTek?s products have the following features: The screening can be done at the hospital or clinic with the tools that the labs already have with individual packaging, thus avoiding shipping and long turnarounds. The tests don?t employ any fragile biomolecules such as antibodies; the test are robust, temperature insensitive and highly reproducible.  The third innovation is the implementation of the Zika test as a screening test rather than a diagnostic.  Disease screening is not only less burdensome for MIPTek from a regulatory perspective, but it also provides physicians with the information they urgently want.
