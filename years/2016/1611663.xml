<AbstractNarration>This project's goal is to test an integrated bottom-up/top-down model of institutional reform within a college of liberal art's STEM division. The broad strategy is to provide momentum to fuel a transition from an active "mobilization" stage of this faculty-driven initiative to subsequent stages: "implementation" and then "institutionalization." Initial grassroots efforts have led to base-level support for division-wide engagement of this goal. This model of change is focused on moving the STEM faculty towards significant course transformation reflective of the growing evidence base indicating "what works" while simultaneously developing a productive STEM learning community. This will be accomplished partly through curriculum reform awards that would be made to individuals or faculty teams to redesign their courses or to develop new, team-taught interdisciplinary courses. Linked to the awards are "best practices" pedagogical workshops that also engage interdisciplinary faculty teams from other institutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is building on the work of Ann Austin [Promoting evidence-based change in undergraduate science education. Paper presented at the Fourth Committee Meeting on Status, Contributions, and Future Directions of Discipline-Based Education Research, 2011] and Susan Elrod and Adrianna Kezar [Facilitating interdisciplinary learning: Lessons learned from Project Kaleidoscope. Change: The Magazine of Higher Learning, Jan-Feb 2012]. The institution itself will add additional diversity to the group of institutions supported by EHR grants working to achieve institutional transformation.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The President?s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST; 2012) cites the need for widespread adoption of evidence-based teaching practices. Unfortunately, these pedagogical approaches are often not widely known or adopted by faculty (e.g., National Research Council, 2012), especially STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics)faculty (Handelsman et al., 2004). DePauw University?s NSF-IUSE program was designed to test Henderson, Finkelstein, and Beach?s (2010) model of "developing shared vision" for producing institutional change in one small college?s science and math division, and explore the possibility for diffusing changes beyond one institution. Our application of the model largely supported its value. The proposed combination of approaching change at the structural (rather than individual faculty member) level, and allowing that change to be open or "emergent" (rather than predetermined and "prescribed") helped yield significant movement forward in revising our general education STEM courses and their instruction. Our experience indicates that a "grassroots" reform effort can work, but it is also necessary to have "change agents" to initiate and help organize the movement, and consistent with Austin?s (2011) model, top-down administrative support (both vocally and financially) also benefits the effort. Interactions with faculty at other institutions suggest that they face similar challenges and that this model might be effective for them as well.   Below we outline the "lessons learned" from our project, noting both the successes and challenges to institutional change.   Successes: Our approach utilized multiple entry points for participation. Faculty self-reports indicated that open meetings to which all STEM faculty were invited were the most popular mode of engagement. At meetings we typically shared institutional data (e.g., student success rates in classes, results of university-wide scientific literacy testing, themes from student focus groups), which was attractive to our audience: scientists and mathematicians who value data. Widely disseminating minutes from the meetings and data helped to convey transparency with activities. A crucial addition was the creation of a STEM liaison group with one faculty representative from each of our eight STEM departments, who helped to coordinate work with individual departments. Another valuable component of our project was Curricular Reform Awards, which provided monetary incentives for course revision, with accompanying mandatory attendance at teaching workshops where faculty could learn from experts and share their own insights with colleagues in a supportive community. With a combination of these activities, we were able to achieve large-scale participation, with only a small percentage of faculty totally opting out of any project activities. With regard to disseminating our findings more broadly, 11 peer-reviewed publications/presentations resulted from this project.  Challenges: Some departments showed minimal engagement in reform efforts.
