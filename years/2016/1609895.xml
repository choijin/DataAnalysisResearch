<AbstractNarration>Nontechnical Description: Typical lasers emit streams of single photons - small bundles of light - that are all at the same energy.  In this project, the investigators are studying ways to make lasers simultaneously emit two photons at very different energies. This gives tremendous flexibility in controlling laser outputs, since one of the emitted photons can be at almost any desired energy, as long as the energy of the other is appropriately chosen. This may lead to semiconductor lasers that deliver radiation that is broadly tunable across the infrared spectrum.  The availability of such lasers will impact a wide variety of applications, including sensing of pollutants in the atmosphere, biological imaging, microscopy, telecommunications, art restoration and laser radar.  The research team is focusing on investigating the materials properties that enable lasers to emit light in this way, and on how to mitigate factors that cause light to be absorbed, as absorption of light could hinder laser operation.  In particular, the use of nanometer-thick semiconductor layers for laser emission is being addressed.  This research is largely carried out by graduate and undergraduate students who are members of the University of Central Florida's diverse student body. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Description: The research team aims to study the nondegenerate absorption and emission properties of semiconductors, particularly quantum wells, to verify the team's recent calculations that nondegenerate two-photon absorption or emission of Transverse Magnetic (TM)-polarized light is enhanced in quantum wells compared to bulk semiconductors. At the same time, the research team is characterizing the relevant loss mechanisms for nondegenerate two-photon gain and lasing, namely free-carrier absorption, Urbach-tail absorption and nondegenerate three-photon absorption, especially with a view to finding regimes where two-photon gain overcomes losses.  Of greatest interest is the mid-IR spectral region where multiple semiconductors are appropriate for testing two-photon gain.  Quantum-well systems with TM polarization attract particular interest because, at this polarization the two-photon transitions are calculated to be the most enhanced while free-carrier absorption can vanish.  Additionally, unlike in bulk semiconductors, the enhancement of two-photon emission and three-photon absorption are expected to occur at different photon energies.  However, each one of these processes needs to be carefully measured in order to build a practical picture of the overall losses.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In this project, the investigators studied some of the core scientific foundations required for making semiconductor lasers that simultaneously emit two very different wavelengths of light, where one wavelength is tunable in the elusive mid-infrared region. The availability of such lasers will impact a wide variety of applications, including sensing of pollutants in the atmosphere, biological imaging, microscopy, telecommunications, art restoration and laser radar. The simultaneous emission is enabled by the nondegenerate two-photon absorption (2PA) and two-photon emission 2PE) properties of semiconductors, particularly in layered structures known as multiple quantum wells.  Prior work for bulk semiconductors had predicted that these two-photon processes can become extremely large in the extremely nondegenerate case, meaning that the wavelengths involved are very different.  In this work, the research team was able to show theoretically that nondegenerate two-photon processes in quantum wells are about a factor of 10 larger than in bulk semiconductors.  The requirement for this is that a "transverse magnetic" (TM) light polarization is needed, which for quantum wells, requires a guided-wave geometry.  This is fortunate because it is the geometry needed for laser emission anyway.  However, it adds complexity to the experiments needed to make experimental measurements.  Before measuring 2PE, 2PA was studied.  Theoretically, emission and absorption should be identical in nature, with the only difference being that emission requires a "population inversion", which can be created by an external light source or by an electrical current. The experimental measurements of nondegenerate 2PA were performed on samples fabricated at Sandia National Labs. Initial experiments using two wavelengths in the near infrared showed remarkably strong agreement with theory.  Experiments in the mid-infrared, which are technically more challenging, are underway but are as yet incomplete.   Parasitic losses can negatively affect the viability of a two-photon laser.  One of the most important is three-photon absorption (3PA).  It is important to know the conditions where 2PE can dominate 3PA.  Researchers in this project conducted a thorough study of 3PA in bulk semiconductors, providing a broad understanding of how 3PA scales with wavelength for any semiconductor.  Additionally, 2PA in indirect-gap semiconductors such as the technologically important Silicon, has been studied.  Because for indirect gap semiconductors like Silicon, the 2PA process involves a combination of transitions involving two photons and one phonon, the theory of 2PA in Silicon was not well-established prior to this study. These studies are helping to reveal which are the dominant processes that lead to 2PA in Si. This work has provided valuable data for the field of optoelectronics and optical communications.  The project also two PhD students, including one woman, who successfully defended their doctoral dissertations on this work.
