<AbstractNarration>Loyola University Maryland will acquire a computing cluster with central processing and graphical processing units (CPU and GPU). The computing cluster will be utilized for computationally expensive research projects spanning multiple fields, including computer science, materials engineering, electrical engineering, physics, chemistry, and economics. As a primarily undergraduate institution, Loyola is also committed to training the next generation of researchers via undergraduate research opportunities. Through the acquisition of its first major computing cluster, Loyola will expand opportunities to introduce undergraduate students to modern computationally-intensive tasks and multidisciplinary research, preparing them for graduate school and computational work within their chosen fields. Additionally, it will support projects within the university's new interdisciplinary Data Science M.S. degree program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The initial eleven research projects will impact areas as diverse as software development, medicine, and social policy.  Example impacts include developing techniques leading to drugs to fight SARS; understanding protein-DNA interactions for biotechnology applications; providing policymakers with a better understanding of how job competition and human capital allocation influence the optimal design of unemployment insurance; improving software quality by helping programmers identify and avoid the introduction of dependence clusters; improving techniques for coordination in pursuing a moving target, such as in military operations, autonomous automobile police chases, or surveillance programs; new methods for the creation of fossil fuel alternatives; providing secure communications for mobile devices in the Internet of Things; and improving techniques for nondestructive evaluation of electromagnetic materials, which is of critical importance in agriculture, bio-electromagnetics, aerospace, and the design of integrated circuits. This high performance computing cluster will significantly increase the shared computing resources on campus, thereby expanding opportunities for faculty research, faculty recruitment, and student research.</AbstractNarration>

Considering one of these projects in greater detail, two Loyola undergraduates together with Loyola faculty and researchers at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, considered the movement of carbon nanotubes (CNT) in lipid membranes.

Using the HPC cluster the researchers empirically estimate a mathematical model. The results show that greater product competition reduces both compliance with accounting standards and the demand for high quality audits.  In the second project, Jeremy Schwartz explores the optimal design of unemployment insurance (UI) in the presence of human capital that increases with job specific experience and job competition between workers of differing skill levels.  The research develops a mathematical model where, in an effort to get back to work faster during recessions, high skilled workers may misallocate their labor to positions for which they are over-qualified, leading to a misallocation of human capital.  Given the complexity of the model the HPC cluster is necessary to feasibly simulate the model and run a variety of policy scenarios.  The results indicate that a UI system that becomes more generous during a recession increases welfare and better allocates human capital over the business cycle.  All of the research on the computing cluster has been published or is in the process of being published. Researchers at the university will continue to use this infrastructure beyond the end of the grant period.       Last Modified: 11/27/2019       Submitted by: Megan Olsen]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
