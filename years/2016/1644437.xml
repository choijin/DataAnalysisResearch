<AbstractNarration>1644437 &lt;br/&gt;Cai, Ximing&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Water security faces scientific, technological, socio-economic, and policy and governance challenges that need to be immediately addressed through approaches that integrate across local, national, and international levels. Ensuring water security for present and future generations is becoming a formidable task, which poses tremendous research needs around the world. The U.S. and China, the two largest national economies on the planet, with many interactions, face both different and common challenges, especially those caused by urbanization, global market change, population growth, and global warming. The two countries have distinct but complementary accumulated experiences in managing water security. This workshop is jointly sponsored by NSF and the Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC). The objectives are to 1) explore complementary aspects of research on water security, 2) identify research collaboration potentials for co-benefits for both countries in water resources development and management, and 3) develop joint leadership in common science and technology to enhance water security and environmental sustainability around the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop will be composed of a general session (including keynote speeches), three themes (I: Rising problems and emerging risk; II: Solutions to enhance and improve water security; III: Future collaboration research topics), and an open panel discussion. The three themes will be conveyed by speeches, discussions by group and wrap-up summaries. The deliverables to NSF and NSFC include a comprehensive report that summarizes the workshop results and outcomes, including a carefully reasoned path-forward plan, and a journal/magazine article based on the workshop results.</AbstractNarration>

The attendants included a number of prominent water resources researchers from US (15), China (24), and other countries (2), as well as about 400 researchers and students via a public session. This workshop project achieved the following specific objectives: 1) exploring the complementary aspects of research on water security in the U.S. and China, 2) identifying potential research collaboration opportunities for the co-benefit of both countries in water resources development and management, especially through NSF and NSFC, and 3) developing a joint leadership in common science and technology to enhance water security and environmental sustainability around the world.</p> <p>Important issues related to water security, especially integrated food-energy-water system innovations and water reallocation (e.g., agriculture water transfer and reservoir storage reallocation), were discussed in depth during the workshop. Workshop presentations and discussions focused on both distinct and common issues facing both countries and explored the complementary strengths of both countries. The workshop particularly addressed strategic scientific, technological and institutional development for enhancing water security in the two countries and the rest of the world.</p> <p>Major collaboration potentials are discussed based on the complementary aspects of water resources management of the two countries such as 1) Outstanding water management problems in China, and advanced theory and methodological studies in the U.S.; 2) Research applications to real-world problems in China (e.g., reservoir operations) and academic studies in the U.S.; 3) The role of government administration in China, and the role of market and the democracy mechanism in the U.S. for dealing with water problems; 4) Recently launched large-scale research programs by NSF (e.g., innovation in food-energy-water systems) and NSFC (integrated water quantity-quality-energy systems, integrated river basin studies); 5) Common research directions for dealing with uncertainties, climate change, sustainability, etc.; and 6) Collaboration on advanced education in water resources in U.S. and China. <strong></strong></p> <p>The workshop was held jointly with the International Perspective on Water Resources and the Environment (IPWE-2017), an international conference co-organized by U.S. Environmental and Water Resources Institute (EWRI) (part of American Society of Civil Engineers, ASCE) and Wuhan University, China.
