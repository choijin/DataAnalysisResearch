<AbstractNarration>The electronic devices we use on a daily basis are primarily constructed from materials in which electrons - the negatively charged particles which carry electric current - move around independently inside the material as though the other electrons are not present.  However, certain materials exist in which the electrons behave collectively rather than individually and this collective behavior typically gives rise to exotic and technologically useful electrical or magnetic properties (e.g. superconductivity - the flow of electric current without resistance).  To foster the development of new types of electronic devices, there is significant interest in developing a fundamental understanding of the collective phenomena that can emerge in exotic materials.  Of particular interest are one-dimensional (1D) systems where the motion of electrons is only allowed along one spatial dimension.  In 1D, collective behavior is the rule rather than the exception - arbitrarily weak interactions between the electrons should always give rise to collective phenomena.  In stark contrast to the typical behavior seen in higher-dimensional systems where independent electrons each carry an electric charge together with an intrinsic angular momentum known as spin, the transport of spin and charge in 1D is decoupled.  Remarkably, spin and charge are transported in 1D by waves which propagate at different speeds. Indirect evidence for this has been observed in systems such as carbon nano-tubes and quantum wires.  The goal of this experimental research project is to directly observe spin charge separation and related phenomena in a 1D gas of ultracold atoms.  The atoms are confined to 1D by a waveguide formed from laser light and precisely imitate the behavior of electrons if the mass density of atoms is understood to play the role of the charge density of electrons.  The advantage of studying the atomic rather than electronic system is that parameters such as the density, temperature, and interaction strengths are widely tunable.  Furthermore, the atomic system allows for a direct visualization of the propagation of spin- and mass-density waves in real time.  Thus, atomic systems are amenable to systematic studies which aim to elucidate the role that finite temperature, finite system size, and strong interactions play in 1D electronic systems.  Such studies will aid the development of "spintronic" devices based on carbon nanotubes and quantum wires.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ultracold fermionic atoms confined in a two-dimensional optical lattice will be used to systematically explore the exotic properties of 1D interacting Fermi systems, verify longstanding predictions for their behavior, and test the extent to which spin-charge separation persists at high temperature and with strong interactions. The direct observation of spin-charge separation in real space will be accomplished by two methods. First, low-lying normal modes of the system including spin-dipole, density-dipole and density-quadrupole modes will be excited and their oscillation frequencies measured as a function of interaction strength. Spin-charge separation will manifest itself as a relative insensitivity of the density-dipole and density-quadrupole mode frequencies on interaction strength in contrast to a significant reduction in frequency of the spin-dipole mode with increasing interactions. Alternatively, spin-charge separation in real space can be observed by locally ejecting a small number of atoms from one of the spin states and thereby injecting holes into the system. The injected holes will subsequently break into spin and charge excitations which propagate at different velocities depending on the interaction strength.  A second hallmark feature of interacting 1D Fermi systems - that their correlation functions exhibit non-universal power law decay - will also be observed through quantum noise correlations in the momentum distribution of clouds following expansion along the 1D tubes.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This research program focused on fundamental aspects of the behavior of quantum gases when confined to move in a one dimension.  To accomplish this an ultracold gas of fermionic lithium atoms, cooled to near absolute zero temperature, was confined in a two-dimensional (2D) lattice potential formed from the interference pattern of two pairs of counterpropagating laser beams.  Each site of the lattice provided a one-dimensional (1D) waveguide for the atoms, confining their quantum mechanical motion such that excitations in the transverse direction at each site is forbidden.  Initial experiments focused on attempts to directly observe the separation of spin- and charge-dynamics theoretically predicted for fermionic particles (e.g. electrons) when they are confined to move in 1D and near zero temperature.  Such experiments hoped to provide direct confirmation of this effect and elucidate the theory, particular at higher temperature, which provides a description of any collection of low-temperature fermionic particles moving in 1D (e.g. electrons in nanowires).  Two methods for studying spin- and charge-dynamics of the fermionic atoms in the 1D waveguides were explored.  One technique focused on the excitation of spin- and charge-density collective modes in order to observe predicted modifications to the natural frequencies as the inter-particle interaction strength was adjusted.  A second technique focused on exciting spin- and charge-density wavepackets in the 1D Fermi gases and watching their subsequent evolution.  The observation of spin- and charge-density wavepackets moving at different velocity would demonstrate a direct manifestation of spin-charge separation.  Unfortunately, while each techniques was successfully demonstrated, they both suffered from strong dissipation which made an unambiguous observation of spin-charge separation impossible.  It was concluded that the temperatures attained with the atomic Fermi gases in 1D were too high to observe spin-charge separation which is a prediction derived for a zero-temperature gas.  Future work aimed at further reducing the temperature of the 1D atomic gases and/or extending the Luttinger liquid theory, which describes 1D Fermi gases, to applicability at high temperatures is warranted.  A separate line of experimental research was undertaken in parallel with the spin-charge separation experiments.  This research focused on the study of Fermi gases confined in 1D in a situation where pairs of fermions would strongly interact in cases where the two-particle spatial wavefunction has odd parity (i.e. a 1D Fermi gas with resonant p-wave interactions).  In particular, processes for inelastic decay of the gas resulting from two-body or three-body interactions were investigated and found to be suppressed as a result of the one-dimensional confinement.  In one case, the strong odd-parity interactions in combination with the 1D confinement resulted in a highly correlated gas which had a low probability for two particles to overlap, resulting in a dramatic reduction of two-body loss.  In a separate case where three-body inelastic collisions dominated over two-body inelastic collisions, it was found that the three-body inelastic collision rate was substantially suppressed in 1D relative to what was observed in three dimensions (3D).  This suppression possibly results from the two-body odd-parity spatial wavefunction of the molecular state that serves as an intermediate state in the three-body inelastic process becoming spatially extended when confined in 1D.  The fact that these mechanisms for inelastic decay are suppressed in 1D is of interest from the perspective of understanding few-body quantum mechanics in reduced dimension at a fundamental level.  In addition, however, such suppression might also be leveraged in future experiments to allow for a long lived, ultracold gas of atoms with strong odd-parity interactions to be realized in reduced dimensions.  This would be of interest as it could provide a realization of an unconventional superfluid in a dilute gas.  Among other things, unconventional superfluids are of interest as they may provide a platform for performing quantum computing algorithms that are topologically protected against decoherence.
