<AbstractNarration>The past decade has witnessed tremendous technological advances in the miniaturization, low-cost, and high-performance sensors, actuators, computing and communication modules. These advances have been the primary accelerator for the fields of robotics and Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs), which have gained much progress since its initiation a little more than a decade ago. To date, MAVs have shown increasing applications in a variety of scientific and commercial applications in defense, civil, industrial, and agricultural areas. Compared to fixed or rotary wing MAVs, flapping wing MAVs are unique in its hovering capability, maneuverability, and stability. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this work include the creation and development of the first hardware prototype of autonomous flapping wing MAV capable of hovering, and a foundational framework and methodology for system dynamic models and flight control of flapping wing MAVs. Over the past few years, this I-Corps team has developed several prototypes of flapping wing MAVs inspired by insects and hummingbirds. These working prototypes feature low power, high frequency flapping wing motion, long fatigue life with minimal moving parts (without four bar mechanisms), and the potential of autonomous flight. During the course of the proposed I-Corps project, the team will investigate the market feasibility of the flapping wing MAVs to be applied in various industrial, civil, military, and commercial areas.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Today, drones and MAVs have shown increasing applications in a variety of scientific and commercial applications in defense, civil, industrial, and agricultural areas.  In this project, we explored the potential commercial applications of flapping wing MAVs that possess unique properties such as hovering capability, maneuverability, and stability.  Based on our research results with several prototypes of flapping wing MAVs inspired by insects and hummingbirds, we investigated the market feasibility of the flapping wing MAVs to be applied in various industrial, civil, military, and commercial areas.  We identified potential entry market and interviewed more than 100 potential customers and companies in the Greater Houston area, Indianapolis, and Chicago metropolitan area.  Market research, value proposition, profit estimation, and sales/distribution channels were explored as well.  The outcome of this project provided us with a good on market potential and technology transfer.  Meanwhile, we continued the transformation of the proof-of-concept prototypes autonomous flying vehicles.     The Intellectual merit The proposed commercialization effort of this project provided a potential commercialization solution for a highly maneuverable and stable MAV suitable for navigating small and confined spaces and achieve highly agile motion for certain applications.  This is a solution for a natural looking, user-friendly, safe, and agile flying vehicle.     The Broader impacts of the proposed work lies in the potential employment of such aerial vehicle arrays in various civil, industrial, agricultural, and defense applications such as search and rescue, surveillance, environmental monitoring, crop inspection.  The specific market sectors that has been investigated showed great potential interest in adopting this technology, and the PI and EL has explored collaborative opportunities with closely related industry players to maximize synergistic effort.
