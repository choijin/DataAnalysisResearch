<AbstractNarration>This project aims to study the way in which infinite-dimensional space can be transformed. The various transformations involved are collectively known as operators. There are some well-behaved subcollections of such operators that first came to prominence as a tool introduced by John von Neumann to further his work in quantum mechanics and that are now known as operator algebras. The principal investigator seeks to collect detailed information about these algebras. Within the class of operator algebras are those that can be obtained by simply moving a geometric shape around, such as rotating a circle. These are known as the algebras associated with dynamical systems. The project will concentrate on this class of algebras.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project aims to study the question of whether the seemingly weak technical condition of strict comparison entails the seemingly stronger condition of Jiang-Su absorption for the operator algebras associated with topological dynamical systems. This would complete a conjecture of Winter and the principal investigator for algebras of this type, a conjecture that has been largely confirmed otherwise. In the absence of Jiang-Su absorption the goal is to show that these algebras do at least possess a less stringent property, namely, that the set of invertible elements of such an algebra constitutes a dense subset of the algebra.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In terms of intellectual merit the goal of this project was to better understand collections of transformations of infinite-dimensional space both in the presence and the absence of an important regularizing property, namely, Jiang-Su stability.  It was expected that the information one could hope to extract regarding the structure of these collections would be quite fine in the presence of Jiang-Su stability, and rather coarser but nevertheless interesting in its absence.  In the presence of Jiang-Su stability the PI was able to give a satisfying classification of transformations known as positive operators in terms of data, which, in the case of finite-dimensional transformations, is easily and algorithmically extracted.    With Jiang-Su stability not present we studied collections of transformations related to the time evolution of an underlying space.  These evolving spaces support a notion of dimension that extends our usual understanding of dimension in the world around us, while reflecting important features of the evolution itself.  We asked whether this enhanced notion of dimension could be seen through identifiers (invariants) of the associated collection of transformations, and indeed turned out to be the case in many natural examples.  The broader impacts of the proposal included the dissemination of research and the education of young/beginning researchers, both through several national and international conferences and through the publication of lecture notes for an advanced course related to the intellectual merits discussed above.  The topics addressed in the proposal have provided several projects for graduate students and postdoctoral researchers alike.
