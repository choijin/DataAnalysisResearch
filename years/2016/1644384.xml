<AbstractNarration>PIs: Barnes/Beane &lt;br/&gt;Proposal Numbers: 1644371/1644384 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Controversy over possible health effects of electric and magnetic fields has been raised with respect to radar pulses, power lines, cell phones and other sources of electromagnetic fields such as Wi-Fi, TV and computers. Many isolated experiments have shown that weak fields can modify the function of biological systems but no overarching mechanism(s) linking fields and effects are known. The proposed work aims to investigate the fundamental link--from the physics though the chemistry to the biology--between the fields and the objects they seem to influence. The work will build on theoretical and experimental work that shows weak electric and magnetic fields can modify the recombination times for radical pairs and concentrations of radicals such as reactive oxygen species (ROS) and can modify the growth rate of normal and cancer cells and planarians. Broad impact will be achieved by providing an improved ability to specify exposure conditions that will inhibit or accelerate the growth of cells such as cancers reproducibly so that these fields can be used both experimentally and therapeutically. This project, led by a newly formed collaboration, will result in the cross-training of graduate and undergraduate students at two universities: electrical engineering students at the University of Colorado will gain exposure to biology, chemistry and physics, while biomedical students at Western Michigan University will undertake engineering and physics practical experiences. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual challenge concerning the biological effects of electromagnetic fields has been to build a cause and effect chain of logic from the physics through the chemistry to the biology and on to potential health effects, potential clinical uses, and potential tools to probe other biological questions. Many isolated experiments have shown that weak fields can modify the function of biological systems. Though no overarching mechanism(s) linking fields and effects are known; radicals have been implicated in some instances. This work seeks to provide a series of measurements that more completely characterizes the effects of weak magnetic fields on cell growth. Experimental and theoretical work will be carried out to examine the effects of these fields from less than 1 ìT to 1 mT on a) cell growth rates, b) radical concentrations, and c) membrane potentials in fibrosarcoma HT1080 cells, fibroblast cells and planarian flatworms in a magnetically shielded insert inside standard cell culture incubators. Static magnetic field data will be compared with the theoretical predictions for changes in radical concentrations. Time varying magnetic field measurements will be made as functions of amplitude, frequency, repetition rate and length of exposure. Measurements made at low frequencies (less than 2 kHz) will separate direct magnetic field effects from the effects of induced electric fields and induced currents by use of a ringed dish as well as in a separate electric field exposure system. Measurements from 1 to 10 MHz will look for the effects of hyperfine transitions that are predicted for hydrogen atoms in the earth?s magnetic field near 45 ìT as a function of amplitudes, frequency, exposure times and static magnetic fields. The work will focus on the coupling between nuclear spins to the active electrons within the fragments of radical pairs and with biological cycle times, which can range from fractions of seconds to hours or longer. Radical concentration measurements will be made using fluorescent dyes for O-2 (super oxide), NADPH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate-oxidase) and H2O2 (hydrogen peroxide), and changes in membrane potentials will be examined. The new information gained as a result of the proposed work should help us understand exposure conditions to the fields from radar pulses, power lines, cell phones, Wi-Fi, TV, computers, etc., that may or may not lead to health effects. Broad impact will be achieved by providing an improved ability to specify exposure conditions that will inhibit or accelerate the growth of cells such as cancers reproducibly so that these fields can be used both experimentally and therapeutically. The project will result in the cross-training of graduate and undergraduate students at two universities: electrical engineering students at the University of Colorado will gain exposure to biology, chemistry and physics, while biomedical students at Western Michigan University will undertake engineering and physics practical experiences.</AbstractNarration>
