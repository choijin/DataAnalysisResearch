<AbstractNarration>Understanding the spatial organization of microbial communities at micrometer scales is critical for understanding how individual microbes behave, what their properties are, and how the community as a whole functions. This project will develop tools and protocols for investigating the spatial organization of a range of host-associated microbial communities. Its goal is to develop methods for identifying the bacteria that are present, using fluorescent probes that bind to the RNA of the bacterial ribosome, in a way that preserves the micrometer-scale spatial organization of the bacteria relative to each other and relative to the host organism. These tools will help a broad community of scientists gain a better understanding of how microbial communities are organized and how they work, and how they affect the biology of the host animal. The major goal of this project is to have as a broader impact the development of a set of deliverables that the scientific community can adopt and use for research that will benefit animal agriculture, aquaculture, and health. Additional broader impacts include making the microbial world more understandable to people, by generating striking images of the structures and communities that bacteria build on and in their hosts; providing information about bacterial communities to middle- and high-school students; and helping to train college students from under-represented groups in microbiome science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A critical gap in our understanding of microbiomes is a widespread lack of information about their micron-scale spatial organization, as most work is done on samples that have been homogenized. A microbe's neighbors can dramatically alter its physiology, and micron-scale spatial organization provides clues to the roles and interactions of the taxa, and thus can guide modeling strategies and more detailed studies of biochemical interactions. In addition, spatial structure may reveal commonalities across disparate microbiomes, commonalities that are currently obscured by the complexity and variability of microbiomes and the high-throughput sequence information generated from them. Imaging of spatial organization can cut through the overwhelming complexity of sequence data, and allow common patterns to shine through. This is a project to develop sample preparation protocols and fluorescence in situ hybridization probes applicable to a wide variety of animal-associated microbiomes. The goal is to enable the wider scientific community to make use of fluorescence in situ hybridization and spectral imaging approaches to characterize spatial organization of the microbial community in a broad range of host-associated microbiomes.</AbstractNarration>

Pilot experiments with CLASI-FISH probe sets proved successful on disparate types of samples: plastic marine debris, the surface of kelp, the mouse gut, and the cephalopod gut (see supporting PDF figure).   These methods, probe sets, and pilot findings should prove useful to scientists working with a wide variety of microbiomes.  The project has provided major training for two post-doctoral scientists and four undergraduate students.  Two of the undergraduates participated as part of the Woods Hole Partnership Education Program (PEP), one as part of the MBL?s REU (research experiences for undergraduates) program, and one as part of the MBL?s Semester in Environmental Science.  Two of these students are from historically underrepresented minority groups, one from Howard University and one from the University of Wisconsin at Milwaukee. All received training in biological research methods and in preparing oral and written presentations.   In carrying out the work on this project we regard the postdoctoral scientists as a key participants in the intellectual design of the work as well as in carrying it out.  Woods Hole, particularly during the summertime, is a vibrant hub of teaching and research with experts from around the world coming to MBL for advanced courses and research.  The postdoctoral scientists involved with this project have met with visiting and resident colleagues and participated in informal meetings as well as participating in the Strategies and Techniques for Analyzing Microbial Population Structures (STAMPS) course that took place in the summer of 2017.  These activities begin to incorporate them into the scientific network that links MBL to the national and global biological research community.  We have communicated the results of the project to the scientific community as well as to the general public, to encourage public understanding of the amazing and complex communities of microbes that live on and around us. The principal investigator, Dr. Jessica Mark Welch, and the two post-doctoral scientists presented the work at a total of 10 scientific conferences.
