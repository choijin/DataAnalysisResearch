<AbstractNarration>Thousands of gas-rich exoplanets are now known. None of these are true protoplanets that are rapidly adding gas from the areas surrounding them as they form. The investigators have developed a method of detecting the addition of hydrogen gas into a forming planet. This method can be used to search the empty regions or gaps in dust disks located around stars where planets are expected to be forming. The team has a unique instrumental system that they designed, tested, and now use with a 6.5-m telescope in Chile. They have made the first detection of hydrogen gas being drawn into a forming planet about twice the size of Jupiter in the gap of a dust disk. This project centers on applying their technique to search for protoplanets in 25 disks that are nearby, young, and have known gaps. They plan to learn how gas giant planets form, grow, and affect the dust disks in which they are forming. This project serves the national interest by increasing our understanding of how planets form. The investigators will train and include undergraduate and graduate students, and post-doctoral scientists, in this research project. The principal investigator will give public lectures on results from the protoplanet survey at Tucson area elementary and middle schools, as well as 10 Tucson area retirement communities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While thousands of gas-rich exoplanets are now known, none are true protoplanets that are rapidly accreting gas. The principal investigator's MagAO system on the 6.5-m Magellan Telescope in Chile is the only adaptive optics system that has published &lt;0.03 arcsec resolution images at the strongest visible gas accretion emission line (H-alpha). Transitional disks are disks that have dust-poor gaps. One popular hypothesis is that these gaps could be cleared by multiple (2-3) massive accreting planets in the gap. This team has made the first definite detection of an approximately 2x Jupiter mass accreting protoplanet at H-alpha in the gap of the LkCa 15 transitional disk. The team will expand their observational studies by leveraging all the lessons they have learned about direct imaging of protoplanets to make the first census of nearby accreting protoplanets. They anticipate understanding where low mass gas giant planets form, grow, and how they affect their host disks/gaps. The team will utilize MagAO's unique ability to take simultaneous H-alpha (wavelength = 656nm), continuum (642nm), and Ks (2147nm) images to carry out a survey for protoplanets with the new simultaneous differential imaging optics, named the GAPplanetS+. They will survey all 25 nearest (~150 pc), youngest (~1 Myr), brightest (R&lt;12 mag) large gap (&gt;130mas) transitional disks for the first census of protoplanets. The investigators will train and include undergraduate and graduate students, and post-doctoral scientists, in this research project. The principal investigator will give public lectures on results from the GAPplanetS+ survey at Tucson area elementary and middle schools, as well as 10 Tucson area retirement communities.</AbstractNarration>

This MagAO camera build in 2012 was the first to work so well that it could correct images into the visible spectrum of light on a large (6.5m telescope). MagAO was developed by PI Laird Close at the University of Arizona with support from the NSF's MRI and TSIP programs. MagAO produces the sharpest images of the night sky by use of its very fast (1 kHz) wavefront sensor and very accurate deformable mirror. MagAO can see the difference between a person holding one or 2 dimes as viewed from 120 miles away! To see the ability of MagAO to sharpen stellar images look at image 3.   For more on how this worked please see https://www.space.com/22467-telescope-takes-sharpest-night-sky-images.html  It is this uniquely sharp vision in red light that allowed our team's MagAO to use adaptive optics in the red light of hydrogen gas. This "H-alpha" light at 653.5nm is very important as it is the main emission line that hydrogen gas emits when this gas is falling into a growing star.   This project outcome report is for an NSF grant was born out of the idea that if young stars glowed at H-alpha then maybe young gas planets that were just forming (like our Jupiter --but only a few million years old) might also glow at H-alpha and therefore be detectable for the first time if we used MagAO to look for them (Close et al. 2014 ApJ lett.).   We tested this theory around the young T-Tauri Star LkCa 15. Once MagAO observed this star it found a forming planet inside the disk of gas and dust that the star it self had formed from. This disk of gas and dust had a "gap" in it at about 15 AU (15 times the Earth-Sun distance) from the star. directly in the center of this gap there was the protoplanet LkCa 15b (Sallum et al. 2015 Nature). See image 2 for the real images and image 4 for an artist's illustration of what "gap planets" planets forming in the gap of young star's disk would appear like.  Based on these successes we launched an ambitious survey of all 15 bright, southern (since we observe from Chile) stars that have gaps in their disks (so called Transitional Disk Stars). We called this survey the "GAPplanetS" survey and was the major focus of this grant. This was the first such survey of its type.   During this survey we observed the transitional disk star PDS 70. A team from Europe (M. Keppler et al. 2018 A&amp;A) had already found evidence that there might be a protoplanet in that gap.

This planet was older than LkCa 15 b and almost finished growing. It was only accreting at less than 0.1 Jupiter for every million years. See Image 1 for real images of the disk gap (from Keppler et al. 2018 ApJ Lett.) and the H-alpha images of the protoplanet from MagAO (Wagner et al. 2018 ApJ Lett.).  The accreting nature of this protoplanet was later confirmed by Haffert et al. 2019 Nature Astronomy) .   The exciting intellectual merit of this NSF work on LkCa 15 and PDS 70 b is that clearly forming protoplanets due emit H-alpha light as they grown. This means there must be strong magnetic fields on these protoplanets and that these planets feed from streams of hydrogen gas that pass from the outer disk through the gap to the inner disk around the star.
