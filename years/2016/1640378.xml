<AbstractNarration>This project consists of laboratory experiments that will lead to a better understanding of the physical and chemical properties of atmospheric aerosol and the dynamics of exchange between gas-phase and particle phase species.  This research is important for making future predictions of aerosol behavior and the influence of atmospheric aerosol on global climate and regional air quality.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is to define the role of particle phase, species diffusivity, and species volatility in the dynamic exchange and reactivity of secondary organic aerosol.  Experiments have been designed to address the following objectives: (1) better understand how temperature and relative humidity affect the diffusivity of various organic species; (2) determine how the reactive history, including the volatile organic carbon precursor of the particle, affects the diffusivity of the organic species; and (3) develop structure-function relationships between the diffusivities of organic species and their functional groups/molecular weights.</AbstractNarration>
