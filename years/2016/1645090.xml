<AbstractNarration>1645048/1645070/1645090&lt;br/&gt;Dannemiller/Zhang/Shapiro&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Americans spend 90% of their time indoors where they are exposed to a complex mixture of chemicals, including formaldehyde. Despite established health effects, concerned citizens currently have no method to inexpensively and reliably measure their formaldehyde exposure. Current methods require expensive analytical instruments that are prone to contamination, suffer from interfering compounds, or are difficult to complete. The goal of this work is to develop and launch an accessible, inexpensive and reliable formaldehyde detection technique for use in citizen science. A multidisciplinary collaboration between industry, academia, and a citizen science organization will ensure that the method successfully flows from design to utilization by citizen scientists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research provides a critical tool to allow individuals to measure and understand their indoor formaldehyde exposure. The key novel innovation of this work is the use of a Smartphone App to accurately read the badges and report the concentration. The ease of measurement will produce rigorous and reliable results and prevent measurement error by internalizing calculations for the final reading. This paradigm-shifting technique could potentially be expanded to other chemicals of interest in the future. Additionally, this work will create a broad and unique dataset about formaldehyde concentrations in homes of concerned citizens and citizen scientists. Citizen scientists will feel ownership in the device through the use of a collaborative development approach. The project will create a formaldehyde measurement system to study concentrations in homes in Waycross, GA in conjunction with citizen scientists. The project has three objectives: 1.) To develop a colorimetric formaldehyde detection badge and novel Smartphone-based App to read the badge. During the 24 hour sampling period, a citizen scientist will use their Smartphone to take before and after pictures, and the App will process the pixel colorimetry data to display the formaldehyde concentration. Community feedback will be incorporated in the design throughout development. Independent verification at the Building Energy and Environmental Systems Laboratory (BEESL) will confirm that badges function properly. 2.) To ensure adoption of the new technology by the citizen science community and concerned citizens. This will be done by pairing with Morphix Technologies to manufacture the device at low cost and by reaching out to the base community in contact with Public Lab, a non-profit citizen science organization. 3.) To make the collected data publicly available to citizen scientists for interpretation. Results will be interpreted and published in an open-access manuscript and information will also be summarized in a blog post. An online community forum will allow for continued community feedback, discussions, and information sharing.</AbstractNarration>
