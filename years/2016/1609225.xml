<AbstractNarration>With support from the Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program and the Catalysis Program in the Division of Chemistry, Professor Ning Fang of Georgia State University and Professor Wenyu Huang of Iowa State University are developing a three dimensional super-resolution imaging technique for understanding molecular movement and reactivity in nanopores at the single-molecule level. Highly tunable core-shell structures with well-defined geometry and manageable complexity are designed and synthesized, and then visualized under the optical imaging systems. The in situ 3D imaging capability of the proposed microscopes makes them valuable characterization techniques complementary to other conventional methods, such as electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy. Both teams are also designing single molecule imaging experiments to study multi-step catalytic reactions, in which two or more chemical transformations are catalyzed with a nanoscale-engineered multifunctional catalyst to avoid the need for separation, purification, and transfer of intermediates produced in each step. Graduate and undergraduate students in these two institutions acquire valuable skills in building catalytic nanostructures and in developing new instrumental capabilities to understand molecular transport and catalysis at the single-molecule level. High school students in the Atlanta and Ames area are exposed to the concepts of imaging, nanoscience, and catalysis to enhance STEM education in high schools. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this work well-defined heterogeneous catalytic systems, whereby colloidal nanoparticles are embedded within core-shell mesoporous silica materials of aligned channels, are developed. Single molecule trajectories with nanometer resolution are acquired to elucidate the effects of pore size, length, orientation, and surface ligands on molecular transport and conversion. New experimental insights on transport in nanoscale confinement acquired with the model core-shell porous structures can be generalized to guide the development of porous materials for separation and catalysis. The long-term objective for this research is to use the knowledge acquired using the imaging technique on the platform catalysis system to guide our future catalyst design for a wide range of chemical transformations.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The most common confinement structure in nature, cell, plays critical roles in biological systems, in which cascade enzyme reactions proceed efficiently. Synthetically generated confinement systems, e.g., nanoreactors, could also enhance the performance of encapsulated catalysts. The previous understanding of the confinement effect is qualitative. The increased effective concentration of catalysts/reactants and the reduced molecule diffusion distance are believed to be the primary reasons for the enhanced activity of catalysts confined in nanoreactors. In this research project, we quantitatively answered essential questions and advanced our understanding of the confinement effect in catalysis. The significant outcomes of the project are summarized below.</p> <p>1. We develop a 3D super-resolution imaging system for understanding molecular dynamics in core-shell porous nanocatalysts. This system allowed us to investigate the coupling of molecular transport and catalytic reaction in core-shell porous nanocatalysts.</p> <p>2. We designed and synthesized a well-defined platform with catalytic centers confined at the end of nanopores to study the in situ dynamic behavior of catalytic processes under nanoconfinement at the single-molecule and single-particle level (Figure 1). The well-defined nanocatalysts used in the present study involves a multilayered structure, with which the composition, structure, and surface properties of the solid core, aligned porous shell, and sandwiched metal NPs can be customized independently. Therefore, it provides us with a highly versatile platform to study many aspects of nanoconfinement effects, especially for pathway-dependent chemical processes and tandem reactions.</p> <p>3. With the capability of decoupling mass transport factors from reaction kinetics in the well-defined platform, we uncovered a confinement-induced enhancement quantitatively for the first time in the activity of Pt nanoparticles inside the nanopores (<strong><em>Nat. Catal.</em></strong><em>, </em><strong>2018</strong>, <em>1</em> (2), 135-140. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">10.1038/s41929-017-0021-1)</span>. The combination of the unique model catalyst and the single-molecule super-localization imaging technique paves a new way to understand the nanoconfinement effects in catalysis (Figure 2).<span style="text-decoration: underline;">&nbsp;</span></p> <p>4. Our quantitative single-molecule measurements reveal unusual lower adsorption strength and higher catalytic activity on the confined metal reaction centers within the nanoporous structure (Figure 3). More surprisingly, the nanoconfinement effects on enhanced catalytic activity are stronger for catalysts with longer and narrower nanopores (<strong><em>Nat. Commun.</em></strong><em>, </em><strong>2019</strong>, <em>10</em> (1), 4815. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">10.1038/s41467-019-12799-x)</span>. Experimental pieces of evidence, including molecular orientation, activation energy, and intermediate reactive species, have been gathered to provide a molecular level explanation on how the nanoconfinement effects enhance the catalyst activity, which is essential for the rational design of highly-efficient catalysts.</p> <p>5. Choosing hydrophobicity as an exemplary chemical environmental factor (Figure 4), we compared a range of essential parameters for an oxidation reaction on platinum nanoparticles (NPs) confined in hydrophilic and hydrophobic nanopores. Single-molecule experimental measurements at the single particle level showed higher catalytic activity, stronger adsorption strength, and higher activation energy in hydrophobic nanopores than those in hydrophilic nanopores. Moreover, different dissociation kinetic behaviors of the product molecules in the two types of nanopores were deduced from the single-molecule imaging data (<strong><em>J. Am. Chem.

Through this project, we lay the groundwork for quantitative single-molecule measurements of the effects of nanoconfinement on heterogeneous catalysis. This project exemplifies the potential of our single-molecule approach to systematically study physical and chemical nanoconfinement effects, as well as their interplay at the molecular level. This research also provides guidance for tuning a wide variety of nanopore properties to optimize catalytic reactions kinetics, molecular adsorption strength, reaction activation energy, and product molecule dissociation pathways.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 10/01/2020<br>      Modified by: Ning&nbsp;Fang</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1609225/1609225_10423963_1601527115954_Picture2--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1609225/1609225_10423963_1601527115954_Picture2--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 2"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1609225/1609225_10423963_1601527115954_Picture2--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 2"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Quantitating single-molecule catalysis in nanoconfinement.
