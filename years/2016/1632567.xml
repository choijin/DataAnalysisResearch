<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to promote and improve the use of high quality video in products that the general public works with every day.  From high resolution auto dashboard cameras, to low latency video streams from flying drones, to wireless laptop docking stations, to higher quality coverage of news and sporting events, to better and faster delivery of video over the Internet, every application requires the high quality, low latency, flexible, power efficient video encoders that will be developed in this project.  The uses of video are increasing every day.  Video instruction manuals are replacing printed instruction manuals.  Video is replacing still images in on-line advertising, social media and billboards.  It is predicted that over 90% of all Internet traffic will be video data in the next few years.  Enabling all these applications requires the latest technology in video compression such as the techniques developed in this project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project tackles the problem of creating a real time video encoder, using the latest H.265 compression technology, running in hardware on an FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array).  An FPGA is a type of chip on which the logic is configurable - it can be programmed to implement any function.  It represents a mid-point between a dedicated integrated circuit, which is very expensive to develop, and can never be changed or enhanced once it is fabricated, and a pure software solution which is very flexible but requires bulky and power hungry equipment (i.e. computers) as an underlying platform.  The research conducted under this grant will devise, test, and implement algorithms that are amenable to realization on an FPGA, that operate in real time, and that yield a high quality result in terms of the visual quality of the compressed video with respect to the number of bits used.  The goal, at the conclusion of this research, is the demonstration of a functional HEVC/H.265 encoder running on an FPGA which has cost, flexibility, power and performance advantages over other encoders.</AbstractNarration>

Specifically, NGCodec designs H.265/HEVC and VP9 encoders that compress video streams, a ubiquitous science used in all video storage and delivery systems including DVDs, TV broadcasts, video on the internet, security systems and more.  NGCodec's mission is to reduce the cost of video encoding workloads in data centers around the world.  This is accomplished by providing the ability to offload encoding tasks from software to dedicated hardware (FPGAs), for a 5x (minimum) reduction in power and cooling costs.  Almost all the major data centers, both public and private, have installed FPGA cards for accelerating this and other workloads, or soon plan to do so, providing a large target market for our products.  Aside from the cost savings, NGCodec?s encoders which operate in real time also provide advantages in encoding live video, reducing the latency from source to viewer over software solutions.       NGCodec has been supported by this SBIR Phase II grant from 10/2016 though 5/2019.  As a broad description, the work that the grant has helped to fund covered the evolution of our HEVC video encoder IP from a prototype to a best-in-class product that outperforms available hardware and software solutions.  The attached chart shows a PSNR based comparison between many different codecs.  NGCodec?s HEVC encoder is the blue line near the top of the chart labeled N265.  In addition, part of the grant was devoted to improving our VP9 encoder.       NGCodec?s products can play a significant role in decreasing the energy used in data centers. Recent projections have estimated a staggering growth of power used in data centers worldwide:   "The information and communications technology (ICT) sector predicts to use 20 percent of all the world?s electricity by 2025 and emit up to 5.5 percent of all carbon emissions." (source - https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/opinions/power-consumption-data-centers-global-problem/)          The operation of transcoding video data is one of the heaviest workloads handled by data centers, contributing a major chunk to this energy usage.  By offloading this task to hardware, NGCodec technology can reduce video encoding power usage by a factor of 5 at least. Another article on this subject can be reference here:  https://www.vxchnge.com/blog/power-hungry-the-growing-energy-demands-of-data-centers          With help from the NSF and the SBIR grant, NGCodec looks forward to helping customers deploy this technology in data centers throughout the world while growing our business and improving the quality of our products still further.
