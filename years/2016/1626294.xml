<AbstractNarration>How children learn to produce speech smoothly without stops, restarts, errors, or omissions (known as speech fluency), has received little research attention.  Some children who exhibit fluency difficulties, such as later-talking and bilingual children, are misdiagnosed with speech disorders such as stuttering as a result. However different fluency issues require different types of speech or language therapy.  A better understanding of typical fluency development and of different types of fluency problems can inform the neural, linguistic and motor coordination demands that underlie speech fluency.  The goal of the current project is to develop a comprehensive database archive of audio and video recordings of child speech and their corresponding transcripts that can be used for both basic and clinical research on the development of speech fluency in children.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project examines fluency development during the preschool years in typical, late-talking, and bilingual children, by using existing data contributed to the CHILDES Project (www.childes.psy.cmu.edu), an open access archive of children's speech samples. Additional corpora from late-talking and bilingual children will also be included to establish a new, more comprehensive "Fluency Bank" archive.  All corpora will be reformatted to validate and revise transcripts, index speech rate, characterize disfluencies, and code speech for grammatical features.  Automatic and semi-automatic approaches will be used to link audio recordings and transcripts. The resulting Fluency Bank will become an important and unique research resource for those interested in fluency development in both typically and atypically developing children.</AbstractNarration>

However, about 20% of these early stutterers end up with persistent stuttering continuing into later years. We do not yet understand what it might be that allows some children and not others to recover from early stuttering.   To examine this issue, we have created FluencyBank as an online shared database for data from previous studies of children stuttering. These earlier studies used widely divergent methods for transcription, making the search for generalizations difficult. To address this problem, we reformatted these earlier corpora into the consistent CHAT format used by the TalkBank data exchange system.  We then linked the transcripts to the original audio recordings to allow for direct playback from the transcript and closer phonological analysis. We then applied methods from Computational Linguistics to analyze the productions for their phonological, lexical, morphological, prosodic, temporal, and syntactic features.  Using the computational methods in TalkBank, we are now able to examine in greater detail the differences between persistent and recovered stutterers.  For example, we are testing whether persistent stutterers tend to repeat single-syllable words more than multiple-syllable words in comparison with recovered stutterers.  Currently, most of the data in FluencyBank are from children in the United States learning English.  In future work, we intend to broaden coverage to more ages, more languages, and more participant types, with the goal of understanding basic mechanisms in stuttering.  We are particularly concerned that immigrant children or children from multilingual families may be incorrectly diagnosed as having language delay because of patterns of disfluency and we want to be able to distinguish such cases from actual language delay. We are also interested in comparing patterns of disfluency in first language child learners with patterns of disfluency in adult second language learners.
