<AbstractNarration>Metabolites are the building blocks and energy sources of life.  Metabolomics, the large-scale study of metabolites, is revolutionizing our understanding of plant metabolism and novel gene function, but its full scientific promise has not been realized due to multiple technical challenges.  These challenges include the accurate chemical identification of metabolites and a sophisticated understanding of the spatial/temporal distribution of metabolism.  To address these issues, a synergistic international team of plant metabolomics and metabolism experts will use an integrated approach to push key technical developments.  The project will use these enabling technologies to gain a better understanding of carbon sequestration and allocation in relationship to energy and a low carbon society.  The major biological objective is to discover and elucidate key genes involved in metabolism of cell wall components (especially lignin and phenylpropanoids) and energy dense lipids.  The major technical objective is to develop advanced analytical technologies and use them for the systematic and data directed metabolome annotation of two model plant species, Arabidopsis thaliana and Medicago truncatula (a close relative of alfalfa, Medicago sativa). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will enable the engineering of plants for bioenergy by advancing our understanding of carbon allocation and partitioning and, thus, contribute to a low carbon society.  Novel and sophisticated metabolomics technologies will be developed, resulting in increased metabolomics coverage.  Valuable spectral libraries will be generated and distributed to the metabolomics community.  Collaborative relationships between US and Japanese scientists and institutions will be strengthened through a foreign exchange program.  The project will provide multi-disciplinary training for four USA postdoctoral researchers in plant metabolomics, molecular biology, integrated systems biology, and cutting-edge analytical biochemistry.  Hands-on metabolomics workshops will be conducted each year to provide advanced educational opportunities for the international metabolomics community.  This project will support three summer Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) students each year.</AbstractNarration>

The Nikolau and Saito groups also integrated metabolomics databases developed at each institution, i.e. PMR and MeKO.  The major technical outcomes of this project were the development of advanced analytical technologies and use of these for the systematic and biologically directed annotation of two model plant species metabolomes, namely Arabidopsis thaliana and Medicago truncatula, which is a close relative of alfalfa (Medicago sativa).  Much success was achieved related to these specific objectives.  The Sumner lab produced novel software packages entitled PlantMAT and MetExpert that enabled the automated prediction of metabolite identities based upon orthogonal experimental data, custom and public databases, and literature content. The Sumner lab also assembled a sophisticated analytical ensemble consisting of an ultrahigh pressure liquid chromatograph (UHPLC), quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer (QToF-MS), solid phase extractor (SPE), a liquid sample handler robot, and 600 MHz nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometer with 1.7mm TCI cryoprobe.  This ensemble enabled higher-throughput metabolite identifications.    The identities for approximately 200 specialized metabolites were predicted by the Sumner lab based upon UHPLC-MS/MS experimental data.  From these predictions, many were further proven with NMR data, and our ‘production’ pipeline continues.  In addition, over 100 metabolites were identified by GCMS spectral matching to authentic standards.   Mass spectral libraries were developed and deposited in multiple public databases such as MassBank of North America and the Human Metabolome Database.  The Nikolau lab developed ultra-high resolution, FT-ICR-Mass Spectrometry combined with stable-isotope labeling for metabolite annotations.  This platform was used to identify two previously undetected phospholipids and for the identification of other fatty acid biosynthetic intermediates.   Our cumulative efforts led to over 15 quality publications in high impact journals and an estimated 40-50 presentations.     Broader Impacts:  The overall outcomes of this project provided significant advances in our understanding of carbon allocation and partitioning in plant specialized and lipid metabolism that provide greater opportunities for engineering renewable bioenergy resources resulting in a low carbon society.  Novel and sophisticated metabolomics technologies were developed resulting in increased metabolomics coverage.  Strong, collaborative relationships were built between US and Japanese scientists. These synergistic interactions accelerated progress and provided a deeper knowledge base from which to build success.  This project was also a spring-board for establishing a new Plant, Algae, and Microbial Research Coordination Network (PAMM-NET; NSF IOS Award#1340058).

PAMM-Net further spawned the Metabolomics Association of North America as a sustainable mechanism for supporting the above goals.
