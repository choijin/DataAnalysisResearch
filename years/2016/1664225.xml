<AbstractNarration>The Division of Materials Research, the Division of Physics, and the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities in the Directorate of the Mathematical and Physical Sciences provide support for the Workshop on Midscale Instrumentation for Quantum Materials which will be held on December 5-7 2016 in Arlington Va (http://sites.krieger.jhu.edu/miqm/). The workshop addresses two of the 10 Big ideas of the Director of the National Science Foundation: Quantum Leap and Midscale Instrumentation. The focus is on midscale instrumentation for quantum materials that would support the next quantum revolution, Quantum Leap. The workshop will discuss and describe midscale instrumentation that would advance our understanding and applications of a broad array of quantum materials. These include topological semimetals and insulators, high temperature superconductors, quantum spin liquids, multiferroic materials, nano-structured quantum materials devices, as well as ultra-cold atomic gases realizing novel quantum correlated states of matter. The workshop will focus on midscale instrumentation in the $5M to $60M range that could have transformative impacts on the science and applications of quantum materials. Examples of instrumentation include beam line, sample environment, and detector systems that extend capabilities of existing user facilities, advanced stand-alone instrumentation employing new sources and/or methods to probe quantum materials, new tools for synthesis in bulk or nanostructured forms, quantum simulators based on ultra-cold atoms, and advanced computational platforms, software, and data sharing systems for quantum materials. The outcome of the workshop result in a concise report describing opportunities to stimulate scientific and technological progress in quantum materials through new midscale instrumentation &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As in the solid state research and development work that gave us the transistor, advances in quantum materials and their applications require a multidisciplinary approach that links the basic science of hard condensed-matter physics to chemistry, materials science, and engineering. The Workshop on Midscale Instrumentation for Quantum Materials has correspondingly broad representation from all areas of science and engineering of advanced electronic materials. The resulting workshop report would provide an overview of midscale instrumentation to accelerate a field of research where fundamental scientific progress has great potential for transformative technological impacts. These would result in the next technological revolutions that is captured in the Quantum Leap idea.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ A broad category of "quantum materials" has taken center stage in condensed matter physics. Their exotic physical properties are stimulating fundamental progress in our understanding of electrons in solids and offer opportunities for transformative technological impacts.   At the atomic length scale, matter exhibits wave-like characteristics: electrons tunnel through barriers, pursue multiple trajectories, and form standing waves when bound by nuclei within atoms. But while quantum mechanics ultimately determines materials properties at the macro-scale, matter wave characteristics generally fade from view through de-coherence in a quantum to classical cross-over regime. In quantum materials on the other hand, the veil is lifted on the quantum world and intriguing features of quantum mechanics including entanglement, coherence, and quantum fluctuations directly impact materials properties and thus can be harnessed to create exotic and/or powerful new phenomena.   Essential to progress is the development and availability of powerful new experimental tools to synthesize quantum materials and elucidate their unique behaviors across a wide range of length and time scales and under a wide range of thermodynamic conditions. This project funded a workshop to catalyze the development of new instrumentation to dramatically improve our understanding of quantum materials and help harness their technological potential. The workshop deliberations and findings are summarized in a report soon to be released.   This Report addresses fundamental challenges in our understanding and controlling quantum matter that will lay the foundations of a new quantum revolution.  We note there is not a single quantum materials problem, and as outlined in this report, dozens of unsolved states of matter remain, with, to date, only conventional superconductivity and the quantum Hall / fractionalized quantum Hall effect seemingly at a mature level of understanding.  Let?s compare with the astounding success of LIGO in detecting gravity waves: For the first time, we are able to study the universe with means beyond photons and mass. Will this help us to understand Dark Energy and Dark Matter?  In this report, because of the diversity and breadth of quantum materials, we cannot define one detector, but lay out a suite of midscale instrumentation techniques, that combined with the existing revolution in computation and materials growth, can help to transform our understanding, and ability to design, and control of quantum matter.
