<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project involves a disruptive change to the solar energy industry by potentially doubling the efficiency of the best available solar cells while, at the same time, significantly reducing their cost. Renewable energy sources are critical to energy independence and, importantly, to the long-term viability of human society which is faced with the inevitable depletion of hydrocarbon based energy sources, such as oil, gas, and coal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project leverages known technologies that are used in physics research, specifically in high energy physics accelerators, such as those found in Fermi National Accelerator Lab or at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. The approach is based on using thermo-ionic emission from metals as the source of electric power, in contrast to existing technologies that only use photo-generated currents from more expensive semiconductors. This shift can provide not only higher efficiency, but also a shorter "return-on-energy" which is defined as the time it takes for the device to produce as much energy as was used in its production. The project goal is to demonstrate this new approach by producing a cell that can produce electricity with high efficiency and be measured and evaluated independently by a standards laboratory to validate its result. From this starting point, device optimization and further development will provide a new competing approach to energy independence.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ NSF Grant # 1647693 Phase I SBIR Project Outcome                                 December 15, 2017     nVizix LLC is a startup company dedicated to a new device technology for solar cells.  Currently, solar cells based on semiconductor junctions are a mature technology, but there remain issues of energy efficiency and manufacturing cost, particularly for cells that are very efficient.  nVizix has proposed an alternative approach (patent pending) that will be both more efficient and lower in cost, involving sealed vacuum devices based partly on sensitive detectors for high-energy physics.  But these older detectors are large and bulky, and not optimized for extracting energy from the sun.  In this Phase I project, nVizix has designed, fabricated, modeled, and tested a prototype vacuum photodiode cell, which functioned in full sunlight and maintained its integrity over time.  These preliminary results will lead to the design of an improved cell with more energy-efficient performance during Phase II.  Furthermore, this can be scaled to a large array of microcells, using cost-efficient microelectronic manufacturing techniques similar to those used in flat-panel displays, and can even be made flexible for use with a wider range of systems.  Such efficient microcell arrays will enable energy harvesting in a variety of environments, for use with off-grid and mobile systems, or with edge devices that are part of the Internet-of-Things.  Potential applications include both small and large consumer electronics, solar panels, transportation systems, and military and space applications.  By the end of Phase II, nVizix will consider licensing this potentially disruptive technology or will develop it further in collaboration with a partner in one of these applications.
