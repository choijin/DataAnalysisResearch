<AbstractNarration>Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;This proposal requests funds for the acquisition of a major research instrument that can measure and characterize surfaces, structures, devices and applications having dimensions as small as nanometers. Such small scale features have considerable significance in a wide variety of applications including electronics, biomedicine, and energy, among others. The instrument to be acquired through this proposal will allow for a better understanding of how physical dimensions and profiles of small scale features/structures influence their functionality and other attributes.&lt;br/&gt;When developing small scale structures and devices, it is often required that measurements be made without physically touching or altering the structures. There is currently no instrumentation capable of making such measurements at Tuskegee University and its surrounding areas. The instrumentation to be acquired through this proposal is an optical interferometric surface profilometer. It will provide capabilities on non-contact and non-destructive measurements to researchers at Tuskegee University, and partners at University of Alabama at Tuscaloosa, University of South Alabama, Alabama State University, and Alabama A &amp; M University. The instrument will constitute a definite improvement in metrology infrastructure in Alabama. The proposed scientific studies related to the acquired instrument will eventually contribute to design and manufacturing methodologies that will help the nation become more competitive in the global market. The acquired instrumentation will positively impact educational and student research activities at Tuskegee University, a historically black college and university. A broader impact will be on the training of underrepresented minority undergraduate and graduate students in emerging areas in the advanced technology sector. In view of these various broad impacts, NSF funding for this research instrumentation is justified.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary goal of the acquired instrumentation is non-contact and non-destructive studies on surface texture, surface roughness, film thickness, stress analysis of thin films, wear volume measurement, particle and pore analysis from a topological perspective, grain structure analysis and defect inspection and characterization on a diverse range of material surfaces. The acquired optical interferometric surface profilometer will allow for these studies with a vertical resolution of ยกร 0.1 nanometers, and lateral resolution of &lt; 500 nanometers. These studies will be used to elucidate on basic and advanced mechanisms involved in the micro- and nano-engineering of sensors, thin films, silicon photonics, micro-electromechanical systems, nano-fabrication, and polymer nanocomposites, bioengineered surfaces and structures, energy devices, and failure characterization of medical devices and implants. A key ancillary goal is the training of students belonging to underrepresented community in advanced metrology techniques used in multidisciplinary research. Another goal is to implement hands-on learning modules in undergraduate/graduate level courses in the areas of semiconductor, microelectronics, and nanotechnology.&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual significance of the proposed activity is in the various fundamental studies that would be conducted on the 2D/3D topology, morphology and other aspects of micro- and nano-engineered structures and surfaces, and understanding how these impact the properties exhibited by such small dimension entities</AbstractNarration>
