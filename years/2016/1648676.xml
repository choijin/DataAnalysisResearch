<AbstractNarration>The Cayo Santiago rhesus macaque field site in Puerto Rico has served as an unparalleled source of genetic, behavioral, and anatomical data for over 75 years, and the associated skeletal collection is a valuable resource for developing models to infer aspects of human and primate evolution from the fossil record. This RAPID award supports the most urgent aspects of saving and continuing the Cayo Santiago collection. A substantial portion of the collection will move to New York University (NYU) where it will be available to scientific researchers in biological anthropology and other disciplines for studies linking behavioral, genetic and soft tissue anatomical traits of living organisms to features of their skeletons. In addition to serving as an exemplary research resource, the collection will increase public access to science through on-campus K-12 student programs, classroom site visits, teacher training, public lectures, and virtual resources. The project directly enhances representation of scholars traditionally underrepresented in STEM through undergraduate and graduate student internship opportunities. This project is supported with NSF Public Access funds.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Primate populations of precise known lineage (pedigree) are rare, and the Cayo Santiago macaques are unique in being free-ranging populations with a long documented history and rich behavioral, genetic and anatomical research programs.  This award supports the establishment of a NYU-based branch of the Cayo Santiago skeletal collection, formed from rhesus macaque skeletons (Macaca mulatta) that cannot be accommodated in the existing collection and by skeletonization of cadavers currently in cold storage; both sets of remains are in danger of losing the individual identifiers that make them such important research resources for human evolutionary studies. Preserving their remains and connecting them with the rich database of biological and behavioral attributes collected during their lifetimes is a key foundation for future research. The CPRC-NYU skeletonization process will privilege methods that yield the greatest integrity to bone micro-structure, DNA content, and isotopic values. The collection can be used to address several key research questions in biological anthropology related to how environment and heredity shape aspects of the skeleton, and how preference for particular kinds of mates shapes the skeleton of each sex, as well as allowing unlimited future research opportunities. The results lay the foundation for understanding human evolution.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The skeleton provides clues about an individual?s behavior, and this is important for 'fleshing out' the fossil record or interpreting bones in forensic (legal) and archaeological settings.  However, undertaking these tasks raises significant challenges because we do not currently know as much as we would like about how variation in the skeleton predicts an individual's life history and behavior.  This is because collections of hard (bone) and soft (muscle etc) tissue and genetic data often originate from different sets of individuals.  Few collections provide the opportunity to evaluate all three in the same individual.  The rhesus macaques of Cayo Santiago, Puerto Rico provide an opportunity to evaluate the use of skeletal material to predict common soft tissues across and individual's lifetime as well as their relationship to the behavior and genetics of that individual. The Cayo Santiago field site has served as an unparalleled source of genetic, behavioral, and anatomical (including skeletal) data for over 75 years. The field site is home to free ranging macaques descended from animals brought to the island in the 1930s; animals who have been a rich source for behavioral observations throughout the years.  Since the 1970s, animals who die on the island are collected, skeletonized and included in a research collection in San Juan, Puerto Ric.  The Cayo Santiago skeletal collection is a critical resource for linking behavioral, genetic and soft tissue anatomical traits of living organisms to features of their skeletons; a link that allows the development of models for understanding and 'fleshing out' human and primate evolution from fossil skeletal remains alone. And a collection that has supported some of the foundational work on heritability of skeletal traits.  However, that collection has run out of storage space and this project supported the most urgent aspects of saving and continuing the Cayo Santiago skeletal collection in support of this research and for building research infrastructure for the entire discipline of biological anthropology. The project established a NY-based wing of the skeletal collection that allows many more researchers access to this important resource. The project also has lain the foundation for a set of virtual models that will allow extensive public access to the collection as well.  The curation of the collection and the research relating soft and hard tissue measures in particular individuals has helped to train undergraduate and graduate student researchers in NY and Puerto Rico, most of whom are underrepresented minorities.  In addition, the collection has provided a platform for the research development of a Native American postdoctoral scholar.  The work of these scholars and studies will inform how we model human and primate evolution, understand behavioral and morphological adaptation, and understand the link between genetics, anatomy and behavior.
