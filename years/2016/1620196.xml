<AbstractNarration>The Faculty and Undergraduate Research Student Teams (FURST) program brings together small research groups comprised of undergraduate students and faculty from primarily undergraduate institutions (PUI) in order to provide them with a year-long research experience. The program also provides a one month long intensive summer immersion for its participants at an established summer REU site at Fresno State. FURST students get an opportunity to participate in professional workshops, presentations and academic discussions along with the REU students, whereas FURST faculty can take advantage of an on-site, in-person research collaboration with their peers within the FURST program. The program's main goal is to foster both student and faculty research at PUIs, with the specific goal of producing student and faculty authored publications, as well as presentations. The program is designed to be inclusive and accessible to teams from institutions with varying research focus and support, in order to mitigate cultural changes at institutions which may not consider research a quintessential component of higher education.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;FURST students will be working on open problems in mathematics under the guidance of their faculty mentors. Research topics include community detection problems in networks, expanding the framework and analysis of the cop and robber game, the use of coarse Ricci curvature in data analysis and interpolation problems, the study and solution of the non-linear Riccati-Ermakov equation, as well as other non-linear dispersive partial differential equations. Strengthening their background in the selected research topic through readings and lecture at their home institutions will prepare FURST students to engage in research at the same speed as the REU students during the immersion phase. Students will be expected to submit the end product of their research for publication in a peer reviewed journal. FURST faculty will engage in solving open problems in their area of research while building collaborations with faculty at other institutions. Faculty are also expected to produce publishable work as a result of participating in the program. In accordance with the stated goals, the program will improve access to research for students at PUIs, where such opportunities are typically limited. It will also (re)-energize faculty at PUIs so that they remain active in research. By doing so, FURST will help transform the research culture at the participating institutions, especially since the bulk of the research activities will take place at FURST teams' home institutions. While FURST student participants will learn skills through the program that are invaluable in graduate school and in the scientific workplace, the program will broadly impact the students at the involved PUIs by demonstrating to them (through student talks and presentations) that research can be part of the undergraduate educational experience. Finally, through the immersion in an active REU site, FURST students will gain exposure to the workings of an REU program, and will be able to make better informed choices about applying to REU as a potential next step in their academic development.</AbstractNarration>

For UTRGV the program provided opportunities for 1) collaborative research among junior faculty; 2) a year-long, faculty-mentored undergraduate research experience for students; and 3) a think-tank like summer immersion experience for each member of the FURST team at the Fresno State REU site.</p> <p>The FURST-UTRGV group was comprised by students Jose Palacio and Elijah Hight and faculty members Tamer Oraby and Erwin Suazo. The UTRGV group has worked on solutions of stochastic partial differential equations, and the paper titled <em>Exact and Numerical Solution of Stochastic Burgers Equations with Variable Coefficients</em>, has been accepted for publication at Discrete &amp; Continuous Dynamical Systems: S. Also, we have been able to complete another preprint that has been submitted for publication titled <em>On persistence of superoscillations for the Schrodinger equation with time-dependent quadratic Hamiltonians</em>&nbsp;and which is already available at arXiv: <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.04254.pdf">https://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.04254.pdf</a></p> <p>During the FURST program students received extensive training in partial differential equations (PDEs), probability theory, stochastic process, stochastic analysis, and numerical methods with MATLAB (from algorithms of root finding to simulation of solutions of stochastic differential equations). It was also an opportunity for Drs. Oraby and Suazo to collaborate on a common project. In this work we study the persistence on time of superoscillations for Schrodinger<em> </em>equations with variable coefficients. We generalize results obtained for particular Hamiltonians to more general quadratic Hamiltonians with variable coefficients, including Caldirola-Kanai and degenerate parametric harmonic oscillator Hamiltonians. We also introduced exact and numerical solutions to some stochastic-type Burgers equations with variable coefficients via numerical solutions of a coupled system of a deterministic Burgers equation and a stochastic differential equation.</p> <p>Students increased their interest in graduate programs and careers in mathematics. Mr. Jose Palacio has been admitted to the 4+1 program at UTRGV, meaning he will finish his Masters degree in Mathematics in an extra year after finishing his undergraduate program; Mr. Palacio also participated in a Summer 2019 REU in University of Madison Wisconsin. Also, Mr. Elijah Hight graduated in May 2019 and he has been accepted at UTRGV for a Masters program in Mathematics.</p> <p>Students presented their findings orally and through posters in professional meetings.
