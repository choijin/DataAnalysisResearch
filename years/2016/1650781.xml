<AbstractNarration>This project explores the factors that contribute to and inhibit long-term psychological recovery rates from human-produced disasters. Preliminary data that this research team has gathered on stress symptoms between two different sets of recovering disaster victims contradict widely held assumptions about variation in responses to extreme events. This project provides researchers with the opportunity to assess disaster management longitudinally. The intellectual merit of the project is in the improved scientific understanding of the variance between recovery and psychological wellbeing rates in different extreme settings, and the sociocultural responses to human-made disasters. The broader impacts of the project are that it will strengthen collaboration among research communities internationally, provide professional development opportunities at the research site, broaden the participation of underrepresented groups in the sciences, and train graduate students in methods of scientifically-grounded and empirical data collection. Project findings will also be presented to non-academic audiences, improving efforts to communicate science to the public. Additionally, the brings longitudinal insights on impact and recovery to a broader audience of political scientists, sociologists, psychologists, public health practitioners, and emergency managers interested in governance, hazards and vulnerability, social organization, and community recovery. This award is made under NSF's EAGER funding mechanism, which supports Early-concept Grants for Exploratory Research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Very little comparative longitudinal research has been done on human-caused or technological disasters. This project will produce comparable data for two technological disasters caused by human negligence among geographically and culturally similar populations that have engaged to varying degrees in calls for righting the wrongs of the events. Specifically, the research team will do a second round of interviews with 150-200 people along the Sonora River where the Buenavista mine copper sulfate spill occurred in August, 2014. Two rounds of interviews within the first two years already exist for the 2009 ABC day care fire in Hermosillo on how people were doing after the fire. Analysis of data will involve parametric and non-parametric tests of differences between the two sites in terms of levels of wellbeing, in addition to comparisons between the sites in terms of the associations of network composition variables with levels of wellbeing in both sites. Results on social responses and wellbeing will be relevant to emergency management, political science, anthropology, sociology, psychology, and public health.</AbstractNarration>
