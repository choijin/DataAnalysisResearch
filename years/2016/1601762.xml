<AbstractNarration>Society is increasingly defined by networks - groups of individuals separated by small or large distances. Movement across space to connect groups determines the strength of a network, the rates at which information spreads (social networks) or individuals interact (population networks), and the extent to which events in one group affect events in another group. This project will use a new tool to determine how, when, and why connections among populations determine whether a population persists or goes extinct. Results of the project will improve conservation and management plans for populations that are increasingly isolated by changes in land use. Improved conservation plans will be particularly important for endangered species that persist within weak networks. The project will advance the training and education of a doctoral student, who has developed and will improve a new experimental tool. Investigators will make the design and use of this tool publicly accessible, contributing to a democratic scientific process in which researchers co-design and share equipment. Use of this research approach will be extended to undergraduate and middle school students through programs that provide supervised independent research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will use a newly-developed experimental chamber to test directly both assumptions and predictions of existing metapopulation models; metapopulations are groups of linked populations. Bacterial populations cultured in chambers will be connected by corridors in a homogeneous lattice or a strongly heterogeneous arrangement. Both colonization and extinction rates will be controlled by manipulating corridor configurations and by disturbing populations with tetracycline, causing extinction. These manipulations will compare patch occupancy and metapopulation persistence in homogenous and heterogeneous networks across a gradient of extinction-to-colonization ratios. The researchers will next design network treatments that conform to lattice, random, exponential, and power-law distributions to identify the threshold extinction-to-colonization ratio at which bacterial populations can no longer persist. A final manipulation will create 'lonely' populations that are connected to a single neighbor and compare population persistence to that of counterpart populations connected to diverse nodes in a network. These experiments will improve understanding of the effects of spatial heterogeneity on ecological and evolutionary processes and identify appropriate conservation strategies for metapopulations comprising strong versus weak networks.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Human activities can destroy habitat or reduce it to areas too small to support large populations, leaving species vulnerable to extinction.  Corridors (pathways that allow individuals to move between patches of habitat) can reduce extinction risk by connecting subpopulations across small patches to create larger, more persistent populations.  Helen Kurkjian used this doctoral dissertation improvement grant to investigate how the spatial clustering of corridors affects the recovery ability of populations in connected patches when one or a few patches go extinct.  To perform this work, Kurkjian developed an experimental system, the Metapopulation Microcosm Plate (MMP), in which she conducted experiments using bacteria.  MMPs are palm-sized devices in which there are many wells containing small volumes of liquid.  These wells are connected by liquid-filled corridors, which bacteria can use to swim from well to well.  Kurkjian moved corridors around to test how their arrangement affected the ability of bacteria to re-populate wells that had been deliberately driven extinct.   This project had three main objectives:  1) to make time-saving improvements to the existing MMP technology, 2) to ensure that MMP devices work as desired, and 3) to conduct experiments exploring the effects of corridor spatial arrangement on population growth.  All major project objectives were achieved.  Project funds were spent principally on equipment and materials for experiments and attendance at a scientific meeting to present results.  To accomplish the first project objective, Kurkjian altered the MMP technology to allow the devices to be sterilized in an autoclave, which is a chamber that kills microorganisms with high heat and pressure.  This eliminated the need to sterilize MMPs using more costly and time-consuming methods.  Next, she extensively tested these improved devices to ensure they could remain sterile and watertight for 5-7 days and that bacteria could pass through corridors as desired.  These goals were met, achieving the second project goal.  Next, Kurkjian conducted a series of experiments to examine the relationship between spatial arrangement of corridors and the ability of bacteria to re-populate extinct patches.  First, she compared recovery from small, medium, and large extinction events in MMPs with very evenly (homogeneous) arranged corridors to those with corridors more clustered in space (heterogeneous).  She found that, extinct patches were re-populated more rapidly in the heterogeneous arrangements, but that the total population size recovered faster in heterogeneous arrangements only after larger extinction events.  After smaller extinction events, homogeneous arrangements recovered faster.  Next, she used the same experimental design (small, medium, and large extinction events in MMPs with homogeneous or heterogeneous corridor arrangements), but with the additional complexity that the extinction treatment targeted patches with either many connections or few connections. This experiment tested the hypothesis that MMPs with heterogeneous arrangements would recover more slowly when extinctions were targeted at patches connected by many corridors rather than at patches connected to few corridors.  Instead, she found that, regardless of corridor arrangement, recovery was fastest from small and medium extinction events targeted at patches that were connected to many corridors, while recovery from large extinction events was fastest when extinction was targeted at patches connected to few corridors.  This project provided valuable experimental tests of theories about how the spatial position of corridors can affect population growth.  These results will help us to better understand how populations grow in patchy habitats, which will improve our predictions of the effects of habitat destruction and conservation efforts.  The improved MMP technology is also available for use by other researchers or members of the public and can be used as a tool to test spatial hypotheses in many areas of ecology and evolutionary biology.  This grant supported the production of Helen Kurkjian?s doctoral dissertation, a journal article currently under review, a conference presentation, and the creation of a webpage on which all MMP design files are freely available for download.  This project also provided Kurkjian with the opportunity to expand her skills in using computer-aided design/machining software to design 3D models, machining these models using appropriate tools, and various techniques necessary for the assembly of this equipment.  She also received training and practice in experimental design and execution and scientific writing.  Kurkjian trained two undergraduate students to assist with this project.
