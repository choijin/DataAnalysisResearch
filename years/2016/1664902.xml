<AbstractNarration>This award by the Chemical Synthesis program of the Chemistry Division supports work by Professor Christopher Graves at Swarthmore College to synthesize molecular aluminum compounds that have catalytic potential. Catalysts are substances that cause a chemical reaction to occur and are required in many important laboratory and industrial processes. Since catalysts are often based on rare, expensive metals, the discovery of replacements that contain common, inexpensive metals is important. In this respect, aluminum is among the most abundant and least expensive of the elements. Consequently, it is an attractive candidate for use in catalysis. However, effective catalysts often must be able to easily gain and/or lose electrons and aluminum normally cannot do this. In this project, the problem is circumvented by attaching aluminum to groups that are capable of gaining and/or losing electrons. This results in aluminum based systems that can be developed as catalysts for the conversion of olefins (components in petroleum and natural gas) into high value chemicals. In addition, this project provides research opportunities for undergraduate students, which prepares them to enter the workforce or continue their development in graduate or professional schools. On top of this, the students participate in the Philadelphia Science Festival, and outreach to local and elementary schools with large populations of African American, Hispanic, and economically disadvantaged students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this project aluminum is coordinated to a series of multi-dentate nitroxide-based ligands and the structure and bonding of the resulting complexes is studied. By incorporating multiple N-O moieties into a multi dentate framework robust complexes that exist over a range of ligand oxidation states are obtained. Through variations in ligand substituents the steric and electronic properties of the complexes are modulated and their ability to activate small molecules is evaluated. This knowledge is used to guide the development of aluminum-nitroxide complexes as catalysts for the anti-Markovnikov hydrofunctionalization of alkenes. An educational component centers on the training of undergraduate students and outreach programs targets K-12 students.</AbstractNarration>
