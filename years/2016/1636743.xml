<AbstractNarration>A severely impaired esophagus (organ providing food to the stomach) requires a last resort surgical procedure called an esophagectomy. This surgery involves cutting out a damaged portion of an esophagus (i.e. a tumor) and then replacing the missing esophageal tissue by&lt;br/&gt;pulling up the stomach (i.e. gastric pull-up). This causes a very low quality of life for the patient because the stomach is not a suitable replacement for an esophagus, often requiring patients to rely on feeding tubes for the length of their survival. Furthermore, post-operative complication rates are as high as 80% and the 5-year survival rate is less than 20%. In order to avoid a gastric pull-up surgery and spare the stomach, this I-Corps team aims to implant the proposed absorbable medical device into the excised damaged portion of the esophagus, promoting functional esophageal tissue regeneration within the body. Ultimately, this will improve the quality of life and survival of the patients, while substantially decreasing reimbursable medical costs than compared to a standard esophagectomy procedure. The proposed device will treat patients that suffer from advanced Barrett's Esophagus (chronic regurgitation of stomach acid), esophageal cancer, esophageal birth defects, and injury to the esophagus due to caustic ingestion of poisons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps team is developing an implantable, bioresorbable medical device to functionally regenerate a damaged esophagus.  Overall the device is anti-inflammatory, biocompatible/non-immunogenic, bioresorbable, easily packaged (a minimum one year shelf life), and readily available "off the shelf" to be used in the clinic by the thoracic surgeon. This team plans to conduct customer interviews with thoracic surgeons, anesthesiologists, and gastroenterologists during the I-Corps program.  The team would like to initiate a large pig study, yielding proof-of-concept that the proposed device is capable of regenerating a damaged esophagus in humans. A more pragmatic proof-of-concept study at the end of the I-Corps project is demonstrating biocompatibility, biodegradability, and immune tolerance of the proposed device in mouse models.  This would provide the team significant information to successfully apply for other grants such as the NSF SBIR Phase I.</AbstractNarration>

The team (EL, PI, Mentor), lead by the Entrepreneurial Lead, has been able to conduct over 150 interviews of key opinion leaders in the esophageal healthcare space during the period of the award. Such key opinion leaders include gastroenterologists, thoracic surgeons, pediatric surgeons, anesthesiologists, patients, hospital administrators, healthcare insurance/reimbursement administrators, FDA regulatory administrators, ethics review board administrators, medical distributors, biomedical research scientists and engineers, big Pharma and MedTech, investors (angels and VCs), and esophageal disease funding agency administrators.

This surgery is associated with high morbidity and a 5-year survival rate of less than 20%. Furthermore, stricture (narrowing of the reconstructed esophagus due to inflammation) is a major complication which leads patients to be re-admitted back to the hospital to undergo tube dilations, in which a GI physician implements a tube down the throat of the patient to re-widen their esophagus so that they can ingest food. From this discovery, we learned our esophageal implant not only had to regenerate the damaged esophageal tissue to avoid reconstruction of the esophagus with the stomach, but also had to address the major complication of stricture. Thus, we learned that our product would need to harness not only regenerative properties, but also anti-inflammatory properties as well to eliminate stricture, and ultimately reduce patient re-admittance.

This immediately has an impact of over $4.8 billion dollars saved on the U.S. healthcare system for the 20,000 patients annually who would be considered for a gastric pull up surgery.
