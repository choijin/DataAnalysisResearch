<AbstractNarration>NONTECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Division of Materials Research, the Division of Physics, and the Division of Chemical, Bioengineering, Environmental, and Transport Systems contribute funds to this award that provides support for an Institute of Complex and Adaptive Matter conference on active and smart matter to be held at Syracuse University in June of 2016. This conference brings together a diverse group of scientists from a wide variety of disciplines: physics, chemistry, biology, engineering, and medicine. The focus of the conference is on the merging of science and engineering using active and smart matter platforms. Examples of issues that will be addressed include how active and smart matter can help drive self-assembly to build self-replicating objects, and what physical interactions lead to observed patterns in systems whose constituents can communicate with each other. NSF support will enable the participation of 100 contributors, who might not otherwise be able to attend. Approximately one-third of the participants will be young researchers, graduate students and postdoctoral researchers, who will also benefit from mentorship activities during the conference.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;he Division of Materials Research, the Division of Physics, and the Division of Chemical, Bioengineering, Environmental, and Transport Systems contribute funds to this award that provides support for an Institute of Complex and Adaptive Matter conference on active and smart matter to be held at Syracuse University in June of 2016.

To achieve the above goals, Smactive2016 consisted of six sessions with invited and contributed talks, two poster sessions, and break-out discussion sessions. A detailed scientific program is located at activematter2016.syr.edu.  The topics discussed during the conference ranged from modeling biological tissues to explain how soft cancer cells form rigid tumors to how active agents can help prevent a stampede a panicked crowd to ways of improving and speeding up the self-assembly of nano-particles using activity via self-propulsion.  Biocompatible nano-particle assemblies can have multiple therapeutic objectives, including cellular targeting, imaging, diagnostics and drug delivery. In addition, Smactive2016 was the nexus for several new collaborations between theorists and experimentalists to promote the predictive power of emerging models of smart and active matter.  The conference also sought to convey the intrigue of active and smart matter to the public at large via a public lecture and a string concert featuring a new piece inspired by science [1], as well as to provide professional development support for junior scientists via a career advancement panel.  The public lecture was titled "The rise of the colloidal machines".  Refreshments and discussion with the speaker followed the lecture. The overall turnout was very good with some general public attendees as well as other university attendees.  The career advancement panel addressed career possibilities outside of academia and gave very concrete advice in terms of seeking out a mentor two or three years ahead and asking them for advice, dealing with imposter syndrome and work/life balance. There were 49 junior scientists in the audience.  On one evening there was a special string performance playing a piece inspired by the theme of "order from disorder" that permeates soft matter physics.  This event provided a unique opportunity to display creative elements of both science and music and what can happen when they merge. Given its uniqueness, the event was written up in the Arts and Culture section of aps.physics.org.        [1] This event was sponsored entirely by Syracuse University Funds.
