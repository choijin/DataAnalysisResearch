<AbstractNarration>Each year, tornadoes cause millions to billions of dollars of property damage in the United States.&lt;br/&gt;Since 1990, an average of 78 U.S. citizens were killed annually by tornadoes. In&lt;br/&gt;2011, 553 lost their lives from 59 tornadoes out of 1,690 that occurred that year in 48 states.&lt;br/&gt;Despite advances in observational and modeling/computing technology, the&lt;br/&gt;behavior of tornadoes remains a mystery. We are currently unable to predict whether a&lt;br/&gt;given thunderstorm will produce a tornado, much less whether it will be short-lived and weak, or&lt;br/&gt;long-lived and powerful. The proposed work will use Blue Waters to simulate many different violent tornadoes &lt;br/&gt;at resolutions in which the tornado is resolved from its genesis through its dissipation.&lt;br/&gt;By simulating many storms in different environments, the project hopes to identify the factors involved in&lt;br/&gt;the formation and maintenance of the most devastating tornadoes, as well as learn more about its&lt;br/&gt;structure and evolution. This work has the potential to improve the forecasting of the most devastating&lt;br/&gt;storms, ultimately saving lives. Once specific features related to the genesis and maintenance of&lt;br/&gt;long-lived violent tornadoes are identified in simulations on Blue Waters, field researchers can search for&lt;br/&gt;such features in observed storms. Such features identified on operational weather radar could help&lt;br/&gt;forecasters issue specific, targeted warnings for unusually violent tornadoes. Furthermore, modifications&lt;br/&gt;to the code used in the study, CM1, will be shared with the weather modeling community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In a prior work, the project conducted a breakthrough ultra-high resolution simulation (30 meter grid spacing) on Blue Waters&lt;br/&gt;of a long-lived violent tornado spawned from a supercell that was based upon the observed&lt;br/&gt;24 May 2011 EF5 tornadic supercell in central Oklahoma.  The project proposes to build upon this previous work to explore the&lt;br/&gt;sensitivity of tornado morphology in the 24 May 2011 storm to parameters such as cloud microphysics,&lt;br/&gt;turbulence parameterization and low-level environmental wind shear.  In addition, the project will enable the use&lt;br/&gt;of arbitrarily stretched vertical grids in CM1 in order to focus resolution at key vertical levels, such&lt;br/&gt;as near the ground.  Moreover, the project will apply surface friction in a physically realistic manner, add functionality&lt;br/&gt;to CM1 that enables the centrifuging of rain and hail in regions of intense rotation, and explore&lt;br/&gt;other storm environments in which violent tornadoes occurred.  Finally, the project will add the ability for CM1 to&lt;br/&gt;interpolate restart files from a coarser mesh to a finer mesh, allowing the model to simulate periods&lt;br/&gt;of the storm?s life cycle where extreme resolution is focused on the core of storm.</AbstractNarration>

This horizontal tube is tilted into the vertical and ingested into the lower part of the supercell?s rotating updraft (mesocyclone). The SVC is associated with a significant drop in pressure throughout the bottom 3 kilometers of the mesocyclone which precedes tornado formation, and is often present during the EF4/EF5 phase of the tornado's life cycle. The low pressure associated with the SVC results in a significant increase in the spatial coverage and intensity of updraft winds near the ground. Tornadoes in the simulations develop as a result of the merger and intensification of the pretornadic vortices beneath the strengthening low-level storm updraft.</p> <p>The discovery of the streamwise vorticity current (SVC) has prompted a new look at the process of tornadogenesis, a process that has been the focus of numerous field studies and numerical simulations.
