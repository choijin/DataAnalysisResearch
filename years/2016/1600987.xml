<AbstractNarration>The Historically Black Colleges and Universities-Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP) Research Initiation Awards (RIAs) provide support to STEM junior faculty at HBCUs who are starting to build a research program, as well as for mid-career faculty who may have returned to the faculty ranks after holding an administrative post or who need to redirect and rebuild a research program. Faculty members may pursue research at their home institution, at an NSF-funded Center, at a research intensive institution or at a national laboratory. The RIA projects are expected to help further the faculty member's research capability and effectiveness, to improve research and teaching at his or her home institution, and to involve undergraduate students in research experiences. With support from the National Science Foundation, Winston-Salem State University (WSSU) will conduct research aimed at understanding organic synthesis which is important for therapeutic purposes, agricultural, oil field and other industrial applications and broadening the participation of underrepresented students in the nation's STEM workforce by integrating undergraduate research with education. This project will greatly improve the quality of undergraduate research and education in Organic Chemistry at WSSU. The high-quality research experiences in organic synthesis at WSSU will be extremely valuable for minority students who are interested in careers in STEM. These research experiences will further prepare students to obtain graduate degrees and thus broaden the participation of minorities in the Nation's STEM workforce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the proposed study is to develop carbon-carbon bond formation strategies in the synthesis of highly functionalized heterocycles such as biflavonoids, pyridines and bipyridines. The specific aims of this project are to: 1) develop efficient copper and rhodium catalyzed carbon-carbon bond formation reactions for heterocycle synthesis utilizing inexpensive and readily available aromatic compounds; 2) develop a merged 2 carbon-carbon bond formation catalyzed by copper and rhodium catalyst complex; 3) synthesize bisteppogenin and diphysin from biflavonoid family; and 4) develop a versatile synthetic approach to pyridines, bipyridines and their analogs. This study will result in the first synthesis of these heterocycles and thus advance new knowledge, and tactical approaches in the C-C bond formation arena for the synthesis of heterocycles. This project will be conducted in collaboration with faculty from the department of Chemistry, Biology and the Biomedical Research Infrastructure Center (BRIC) at WSSU.</AbstractNarration>
