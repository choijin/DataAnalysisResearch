<AbstractNarration>This award will support student participation to the Midwest Programming Languages Summit 2016, to be held at the University of Chicago in late Fall 2016. The meeting is an informal regional workshop with the goal of cultivating a regional research network in programming languages and allied topics. The funds will help support students at US universities, focusing on students presenting at the meeting, students from underrepresented minorities, and students who would otherwise not be able to attend due to financial limitations. Supporting student travel to attend professional conferences and workshops is a very important mission of the NSF. Broader impacts include training the next generation of researchers in this important research area and to facilitate their career development in graduate school and subsequently in research, industry, and other sectors.</AbstractNarration>
