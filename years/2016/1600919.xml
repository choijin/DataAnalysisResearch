<AbstractNarration>Research Initiation Awards (RIAs) provide support for junior faculty at Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) who are starting to build a research program, as well as for mid-career faculty who need to re-direct and re-build a research program.  It is expected that the award helps to further the faculty member's research capability and effectiveness, improves research and teaching at the researcher's home institution, and involves undergraduate students in research experiences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Traditionally, biophysics experimental techniques have been used to determine the structures of protein molecules.  The goal of Tennessee State University's (TSU) HBCU-UP RIA project is to computationally predict the structure of proteins that are difficult to determine experimentally.  The project's objectives are to 1) develop efficient algorithms to extract features from, process, and analyze the 3D cryo-EM images of protein macromolecules and 2) model protein macromolecules using their cryo-EM images.  The educational goal of the project is to expose students to multidisciplinary research using a hands-on approach to prepare them to compete with their peers in industry or academia in various areas of bioinformatics.  The educational approach and assessment will strongly support the curriculum modulation at Tennessee State University (TSU) and serve as a model for other HBCU institutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The outcome of the research has the potential for contributions to the fields of medicine and health.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Proteins are involved in every process within cells. Therefore, their biological roles/functions are vital to all living organisms. The biological functions of proteins are tightly connected to their tertiary structure. Therefore, understanding the biological role of either individual protein molecule or a complex of proteins requires knowledge of their tertiary structures.</p> <p>The major biophysical techniques to determine protein tertiary structures are X-ray Crystallography and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR). These techniques are expensive, time-consuming and not suitable for all types of proteins. On the contrary, the sequencing of proteins is fast, simple, and less expensive. Therefore, the gap between the number of know sequences to known proteins is huge. Consequently, the need of computational methods that help in modeling protein?s structure and interpret its biological function are become crucially essential.</p> <p>In contrast to traditional techniques, Cryo-Electron Microscopy (Cryo-EM) doesn?t undergo the same aforementioned problems. It produces a 3D volumetric image to the specimen. The resolution of the produced images can be classified into three categories: near-atomic &lt;5?, sub-nanometer 5-10?, and nanometer &gt;10? resolutions. The structure of the protein can?t be constructed directly from the image at resolutions worse than 5?. Therefore, computational methods are used. Such methods are called de novo modeling techniques.</p> <p>Any de novo modeling technique can be divided into three main steps: preprocessing and data extraction, finding the correspondence between the sequence of protein molecule and its image, and model the protein. The focus of this project was to overcome the problem of sequence-image correspondence and explore the possibility of using image skeletons and other features extracted from the image in solving it. The problem of finding the image-sequence correspondence is called protein topology determination problem. The problem is proven to be NP-hard.</p> <p>This project used a graph-based framework to solve the topology problem. The framework is based on a directed layered graph where each vertex represents a possible correspondence between one sequence segment and one image segment. The methodology was able to eliminate the n! term from the total number of possible topologies (i.e., n!2<sup>n</sup>). Among all possible topologies, only one is the correct. In this project, we used skeleton traces to update the graph and discover the connection between image segments. The connection between image segments was calculated using the skeleton and matched with the estimated connection between sequence segments. A score was calculated to reflect the fit and the graph was updated. More recast was applied to the graph and its scores. The potential energy calculations between the pairwise image segments were used to refine the score of the correspondence. This update was applied after our analytical study work on the preferable arrangements of image segments. When the correspondence is found the actual 3D structure of the secondary structures segments is constructed first. We developed a computational method based on inverse kinematics in robotics to build bent secondary structures. This was not possible before. This has improved the accuracy of the final models. After the top topologies are generated by the graph framework and secondary structures are built, we developed a method to model the entire structure of the protein based on its image skeleton and topology. On the other hand, we studied the problem of parallelizing the generation of topologies from the graph, we found that the process is complicated and would not speed up the process if the added overhead is considered. In order to speed up the process of de novo modeling, we developed a coarse-grained method to evaluate the candidate models to choose the viable ones for further energy evaluation.</p> <p>This project has helped Tennessee State University (TSU) to educate, prepare, and train the participating students. A group of collaborating students were supported during the time of this project. Four undergraduate and three graduate students participated in this project. Among the students were three females and two underrepresented minority (URM). The work of this project has inspired at three undergraduate students (two female students) to continue their graduate studies. One is currently enrolled in the PhD program at TSU. Some of the work in this project led to publications by participating undergraduate students. Therefore, this project contributed to prepare a unique workforce from a minority community that is ready for multidisciplinary global medical-related challenges. Additionally, some of the work of this project were integrated into the education process through class- and capstone-projects.</p> <p>The team worked in this project has presented their research findings among the research community at many national/international venues and journals. Further, this projects helped in the vision to encourage high school student to STEM education. Therefore, some of high-school students were hosted during summer camps to be exposed to STEM education, in general, and to the multidisciplinary problems being addressed in this project. Finally, the project helped the PI to move forward to achieve his long-term career goal.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 12/17/2019<br>      Modified by: Kamal&nbsp;Al Nasr</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1600919/1600919_10414570_1576618366116_topologyDeterminationProblem--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1600919/1600919_10414570_1576618366116_topologyDeterminationProblem--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Topology Determination Problem"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1600919/1600919_10414570_1576618366116_topologyDeterminationProblem--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Topology Determination Problem"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">The figure shows the idea of topology determination problem where secondary structures detected from cryo-EM are assigned to secondary structure segments from protein sequence.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Kamal Al Nasr</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Kamal&nbsp;Al Nasr</div> <div class="imageTitle">Topology Determination Problem</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1600919/1600919_10414570_1576618568932_Analysis--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1600919/1600919_10414570_1576618568932_Analysis--rgov-800width.jpg" title="The geometry of consecutive secondary structures"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1600919/1600919_10414570_1576618568932_Analysis--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="The geometry of consecutive secondary structures"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">(a) The three vectors describe the geometry of the secondary structures and the loop.
