<AbstractNarration>Collecting and analyzing data with covariates such as temperature, humidity, and radiation level are everyday activities in science and engineering. An important example is accelerated life testing data used in the design of products such as lithium-ion batteries. Such data are collected by exposing test units to harsher-than-normal conditions to expedite the failure process. The resulting failure times are modeled by a probability distribution and a life-stress relationship. However, if the probability distribution and/or the life-stress relationship selected cannot adequately describe the underlying failure process, the resulting reliability prediction may be misleading. A similar example is also encountered in healthcare systems, where it is crucial to quantify probability distributions of important measures such as the length-of-stay, waiting time, and disease progression, and the effects of influential covariates on these measures. This award supports fundamental research on automated knowledge discovery from complex data in reliability and healthcare with potential impacts in the areas of manufacturing, healthcare, energy, transportation, and aerospace industries. The research team will strive to broaden participation of underrepresented groups and minorities, and positively impact engineering education.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The objective of this project is to investigate a new methodology for automated knowledge discovery from complex data with covariates using matrix-analytic models. Statistical tools and optimization algorithms will be developed for efficiently collecting such data or selecting the useful subsets from massive data for quick implementation. The research findings will help create a new avenue for modeling and interpreting such data in situations in which the data-generating mechanisms are unknown or difficult to analyze using existing statistical tools. To this end, an automated modeling methodology to construct general phase-type distributions incorporating covariates will be explored via mathematical optimization. To improve the statistical efficiency of data collection, an optimal experimental design methodology will be investigated, and viable computational tools for planning accelerated testing experiment with phase-type models will be studied. In addition, a data-selection approach based on the optimal experimental design methodology will be developed to maximize the utilization of healthcare data. The research findings will be validated by conducting accelerated tests of lithium-ion battery in the laboratory and collaborating with biomedical informatics services on targeted healthcare applications.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The healthcare industries generate large amounts of data daily and the data is massive and complex. For better healthcare delivery, especially for improving the efficiency and effective of patient care, the patient flow information (for example, the length-of-stay (LOS) within different units of a hospital and patient transfers among departments or hospitals) can be studied to quantify the important measures and to identify the effects of influential factors or covariates.  This research develops an automated modeling methodology to construct phase-type (PH) distributions via optimization, and also general PH-based models incorporating covariates. With designed algorithms, the patient flow information, especially the LOS of patients with distinct diseases, are analyzed in terms of the complete hospital stay or the visit in each department. The patients clustering and the influences of each covariate are obtained. Comparisons and evaluations among different diseases, different LOS groups, distinct transfer routes and impacts of covariates are implemented.   By fitting the PH distributions to the LOS data, the patients can be divided into different groups, and the sharing common characteristics, readmission rates, and discharge destinations of each group are evaluated and compared among different disease.    By fitting the PH distributions with covariates on the patient flow information of both geriatric patients and alcohol use disorder patients collected in a hospital, the influences of the covariates of age, gender, admission type, admit source, and financial class on LOS are assessed and compared. The estimated distributions can also classify those patients into different LOS groups, and the estimated coefficients and the statistical significance of covariate effects are also achieved and analyzed.    Additionally, the PH distributions are integrated in an aggregated Markov chain to model the sequences of LOS in each department that patients visit during their hospital stay.
