<AbstractNarration>With funding from the National Science Foundation's Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship program, the University of South Carolina Science and Mathematics Teachers Initiative Phase 2 (USC-SMTI 2) will recruit undergraduate majors in science (biology, physics, chemistry) and mathematics disciplines and prepare them to become grade 9-12 science or mathematics teachers. The project will fund 18 scholarships and 13 stipends over five years. In this project, the University of South Carolina will collaborate with Central Carolina Technical College (CCTC) as well as the University's Project Lead the Way program. Through our collaboration with CCTC, our Scholars will gain experience and training in basic 3-D printing and graphic design, and will use these skills to design project-based units that they can implement in high-needs secondary classrooms. In addition, our Scholars will have access to engineering and biomedical summer training opportunities through our collaboration with Project Lead the Way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The USC-SMTI 2 project will recruit and retain high-quality science and mathematics teachers through several successful data-proven activities including: 1) a seminar class encouraging new STEM majors to consider teaching science and mathematics; 2) monthly meetings to support Scholars interning and teaching in high-needs districts; 3) a two-year induction program for Scholars; 3) a focused research study of Noyce graduates to assess their instruction, leadership, and retention, and 4) training in STEM skills through collaborations with CCTC and Project Lead the Way.  Using research-based experience from its past USC-SMTI Phase 1 project, this program will leverage established partnerships with high-needs districts to recruit, prepare, and ensure success during induction years for high school science and mathematics teachers. USC will also expand on the USC-SMTI Phase 1 project findings by following and researching Noyce graduates who are now teaching in high-needs districts. This study will further investigate the impact of the research-based USC Noyce program on Scholars' development as teachers and leaders and ultimately, on their decisions to remain in the teaching profession. The project will also impact the national and international teacher education communities by continued research and development of an innovative tiered-approach that includes STEM underclassmen recruitment, preparation in accredited programs, development of project-based, technology-rich instruction, and retention of high-quality mathematics and science teachers who will teach in high-needs districts. Empirical evidence, validated through the project evaluation, will result in improved teacher education and retention for high school science and mathematics teachers for diverse populations within challenging settings. This knowledge will also address a deep and enduring need in South Carolina and the greater United States for high quality mathematics and science teachers. The leadership team and partners will disseminate results as part of USC's participation in the Association of Public Land-grant Universities imperative as well as through professional organizations and journal articles.</AbstractNarration>
