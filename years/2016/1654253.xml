<AbstractNarration>The study of human language unlocks the deepest mysteries of the working of the human mind and the most important aspects of societal interaction.  Yet high school students are typically unaware of the field of linguistics as the scientific study of human language, and while they may study a foreign language, they may not be aware of the structure and diversity of human languages in general.   In addition, language technologies play an increasing role in daily life in the form of speech-based technologies and text mining of information from unstructured data.  High school students are typically unaware of how to pursue careers in these important industries.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The North American Computational Linguistics Olympiad (NACLO) is targeted at high school students with an interest in human language, mathematics, and analytical reasoning.  It introduces aspects of human language and computation via puzzles that do not require background knowledge.  NACLO has been operating since 2007 and is available to all high school students in the US and Canada, without registration fees or academic prerequisites.  Each year the eight top-scoring students from NACLO in the US meet to train together and then travel to the International Linguistics Olympiad (IOL).  In 2017, after a training session at MIT, the US team will travel to Dublin, Ireland to compete with teams from 30 other countries.   The IOL serves as a capstone international experience for the winners of NACLO, allowing the team members to compete and interact with other students who share their talents and interests.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>On July 30, eight USA students and eight Canadian students traveled to Dublin City University in Dublin, Ireland. 176 students from 44 teams from 28 countries and territories participated in the 15th International Linguistics Olympiad (IOL). The two US teams and the Canada Anglophone team were selected by the North American Computational Linguistics Olympiad (NACLO), along with the Canada Francophone team, who qualified throughOlympiade Linguistique Canadienne-Canadian Linguistics Olympiad (OLC-CLO) on the contest field. The IOL is one of twelve International Science Olympiads for secondary school students. The contest consists of two events: the individual and the team contest. The individual contest is a six-hour exam with five problems. This year, the individual round featured the following languages: Birom, Abui, Kimbundu, Laven in Khom script, and Madak. In the team contest, team members collaborate to solve one particularly challenging problem. This year, teams were tasked with matching 87 emoji symbols with their Indonesian descriptions within three hours. Problem solving at the IOL stresses the ability of contestants to decipher the mechanisms of languages by using logic and reasoning to explore a wide range of hypotheses. The US team took home six medals. Brian Xiao of USA Red won a gold medal. Silver medals went to Andrew Tockman of USA Red, Joseph Feffer of USA Blue, and Ziyan &ldquo;Heidi&rdquo; Lei of USA Red.
