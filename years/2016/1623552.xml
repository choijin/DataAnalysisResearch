<AbstractNarration>Formal verification covers a wide range of technologies that are widely studied in academia and routinely used in industry. Any acceleration in the diffusion of knowledge about these techniques will lead to superior technology, better users, and exciting and far-reaching applications. This grant will organize the Summer School on Formal Techniques for students to learn about cutting-edge techniques in formal modeling and verification. The lectures are rigorous and will cover the spectrum of formal techniques including static analysis, model checking, theorem proving, invariant generation, compositional verification, security and systems biology. The lectures will be supported by hands-on laboratories. Attendees at the school discuss their own research ideas and interact closely with both the lecturers and other students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The previous summer schools have had a significant broad impact in terms of imparting theoretical knowledge as well as practical skills to the students from many different research areas. These summer schools have been received enthusiastically by the participants, and helped develop a well-knit community of young researchers. The lectures, software tools, and other course material are available from the previous summer school web sites.</AbstractNarration>

It primarily targeted graduate students and young researchers who are interested in developing and using formal techniques in their research.   The 2016 Summer School on Formal Techniques was held during May 22 - May 27, 2016. The lecturers/topics included:   * Clark Barrett (NYU/Stanford): Satisfiability Modulo Theories  * Stefano Tonetta&dagger; (FBK Italy):    Advanced model checking for verification and safety assessment  * Jean-Christophe Filliatre (Paris-Sud, CNRS):    An Introduction to Deductive Program Verification  * Carolyn Talcott (SRI International Computer Science Laboratory): Pathway Logic: Using Formal Techniques to Understand How Cells Work  * Sam Owre and Natarajan Shankar (SRI International Computer Science Laboratory):    Specification, Verification, and Interactive Proof  It also included invited talks from  * Johan van Benthem&Dagger; (Stanford/CWI):    Logic, Games, and Computation  * Cindy Rubio Gonzalez (UC Davis):    Floating-Point Precision Tuning Using Blame Analysis  * Maria Paola Bonacina (Universita&#768; degli Studi di Verona):    Ordering-based Strategies for Theorem Proving  The school was attended by around 75 students from over fifty institutions mostly from the United States.  The students participated enthusiastically in the lectures and laboratories, and were awarded certificates for their performance.  The students also provided detailed feedback that has been compiled into a report.              Last Modified: 07/29/2019       Submitted by: Natarajan Shankar]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
