<AbstractNarration>This AIR Technology Translation project focuses on translating highly efficient ultraviolet light emitters into compact, ultraviolet (UV) light emitting diodes (LEDs). There is a strong market and societal need for efficient UV LEDs for air and water purification, food sterilization, and biomedical and security applications that require compact ultra-violet sources, both in the developed and developing world. These UV LEDs can enable compact, low-cost, and environmentally safe water and air disinfection systems for a variety of applications.  This project will result in a prototype of a highly efficient ultraviolet LED with a unique feature, tunneling injected diode structure, that enables significantly higher efficiency, higher power, and lower cost, when compared to leading competitors in this market space.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project addresses the following technology gap(s) as it translates from research discovery toward commercial application. The main challenges to realizing highly efficient tunneling injected ultraviolet light emitters are the low internal quantum efficiency and the low light extraction efficiency. The project will address both of these. Firstly, investigators will study optimization of the light emitters through rigorous experiments studies to improve internal quantum efficiency. Secondly, a careful study of methods to improve the light extraction efficiency will be carried out. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition, personnel involved in this project, graduate and undergraduate students, will receive innovation and technology translation experiences through their work in developing the high efficiency prototype, and being involved in patenting of intellectual property.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Compact ultraviolet light sources could have a range of applications, including water purification, air disinfection, and sensing.  The objective of this project was to engineer semiconductor-based light sources that can provide emission in the ultraviolet region of the light spectrum using a novel concept based on quantum tunneling. The use of tunneling within the device could help to overcome the main challenges that have prevented high-efficiency solid state sources.  Several significant results were demonstrated under this project including the demonstration of tunnel-injected sub 290 nm ultra-violet light emitting diodes with 2.8% external quantum efficiency, the design of a new class of reflective metal/semiconductor tunnel junctions for hole injection in AlGaN UV LEDs, and nanofabrication technology for realizing 3-dimensional UV LED structures with submicron scale features for enhanced light extraction.  Two graduate students were involved in the research work, which enabled them to receive training in advanced techniques from various disciplines including materials science, physics, and electrical engineering. In addition, they learn valuable experimental skills associated with the design and development of semiconductor materials and solid state quantum devices.  The results from this research also led to the development of device prototypes, as well as intellectual property. During the course of this project, two patents were filed by the investigators in the area of ultraviolet emitters.
