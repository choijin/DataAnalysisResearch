<AbstractNarration>This grant encourages the careers of new researchers by providing travel support for student authors of accepted papers at the Financial Cryptography 2016 conference. The FC conference, now in its 20th year, is prestigious, and the students' work will stand alongside some of the most impactful research in the field. FC's research agenda includes SaTC's Trustworthy Computing System Perspective and Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences Perspective. The nature and inspiration of the field encompasses at its foundations the invention of cryptographic means to support social protocols such as contracts, exchange, and information intimacy. A new workshop this year on privacy for ubiquitous devices ("1st Workshop on Wearable Security and Privacy") will draw researchers involved in the emerging area of Internet of Things.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The effect of the proposed activity is to sustain and expand the vibrancy of Financial Cryptography research, and research of allied fields, by connecting promising young students of the field to the research community. Their presence at the Financial Cryptography conference will establish relationships that will continue for decades, and guide the young researchers' careers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The purpose of this grant is to sustain and expand the vibrancy of Financial Cryptography research  by connecting promising young students of the field to the research community, through helping fund the presentation of their work at the annual Financial Cryptography conference.  The nature and inspiration of the field encompasses at its foundations the invention of cryptographic means to support social protocols such as contracts, exchange, and information intimacy. The field of cryptography is subtle and requires the careful and consistent nurture of new expertise. The research agenda of FC includes both the Trustworthy Computing System Perspective and the Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences Perspective. As such, the field has significant impact on the productivity, security, and happiness in our future society.  During the period of this and past grants, all under the mission, the improtance of supporting young researchers in the field is demonstrated by the co-located workshops that were instituted and expanded. These give a forum for fast moving developments in the field, notably voting and cryptocurrencies. As of the last year of grant coverage, FC hosted its third successful workshop on secure electronic voting and its fifth successful workshop on Bitcoin and Blockchain reserach, among other workshops.  These areas are of particular excitement for new researchers, and the grant was therefore well positioned to support quality research by new researchers who will long contribute to the broarder impacts of technologies in these important fields.  Some researchers supported by this grant will remain in academia and some will continue on to industry as innovators and implementors. Hence, this grant serves both the internal health of the academic community and the bold outreach of research results for the benefit of all participants in cyberspace.  To that end, this grant successful brought in students that have worked with top researchers in the field to present the work they undertook with the researcher. They met and discussed their work with leaders from around the world, and became a working participant in the community the expertise needed to sustain a beneficial vision of a future cybersociety.
