<AbstractNarration>In light of the increasingly urban future of our planet, a thorough understanding of the biological processes at work in urban areas is necessary for the continued survival of Earth's inhabitants, including humans. The first step in that understanding is to know what thrives, survives, or perishes in cities, now and in the past. The Mid-Atlantic Megalopolis (MAM) Project begins this study by looking at vascular plants, with the digitization of roughly 700,000 herbarium specimens from eleven institutions, including public and private universities, state agencies, arboreta, museums, and botanic gardens, in the urban corridor from New York City to Washington, D.C. As the largest, oldest, and most populated urban corridor in the U.S., this area and its flora present a unique opportunity for the study of urbanization, particularly given its rich herbarium collections, containing specimens collected over the last 400 years. The data mobilized in this effort will help us achieve a better scientific understanding of living urban systems, a critical need for urban planners, restoration ecologists, environmental engineers, (landscape) architects, and conservationists engaged in creating more sustainable and better designed cities, including the constructed and restored natural environments of our urban areas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Digitization of each specimen in the MAM Project will result in a high resolution image, a databased record of collection metadata, and a georeferenced point, all of which will be made publicly available online. Building on already successful regional programs, the MAM Project will partner with schools, universities, botanical clubs, and the general public to crowd source databasing efforts and to recruit citizen scientists to help build urban floras online, enabling not only increased digitization efficiency, but educational and research opportunities as well. The MAM Project also includes new developments for data cleaning and standardization in Symbiota, which will expedite the use of digitized specimen data for research, and new reporting features which will advance digitization workflow and project management. This award is made as part of the National Resource for Digitization of Biological Collections through the Advancing Digitization of Biological Collections program, and all data resulting from this award will be available through the national resource (iDigBio.org).</AbstractNarration>

The primary product of the MAM Project was the Mid-Atlantic Virtual Herbarium Consortium, or the MAM portal (midatlanticherbaria.org).  This report focuses on the contributions from the Chrysler Herbarium at Rutgers University to the larger MAM project.   For the MAM Project over 42,000 flowering plant specimens from the Mid-Atlantic states have been digitized at Chrysler Herbarium, which together with legacy data and images to be processed, provides 50,000+ new specimens for scientific research and outreach.  The two largest broader impacts of this grant are: 1) increased availability of digitized specimens to scientists, and 2) enhanced mentoring and engagement methods for undergraduates in natural history collections. They are described in more detail below.  The digitization makes data associated with natural history collections available to researchers and the interested public in fields such as biodiversity, history, art and social sciences, geography, climate change, geology and earth sciences, policy making, and resource conservation. It is also a goldmine for local naturalists, educators at a variety of levels, local governments, and conservation efforts.  The digital format of date, collector, location, and species information over the last 150+ years makes this data suitable for a broader field of comparative research for past, current, and future patterns and effects on biodiversity and landscapes. We have developed new methods for assembling research data, from software-aided methods for machine learning using digitized specimens, to protocols to take quantitative measurements on digital photos, scoring of herbivory data on leaves of herbarium plants, and assembling datasets to track the changing flora over the last 150 years, especially when it comes to the arrival of non-native plants in the state of New Jersey.  About 7 undergraduate students have been immersed in these research efforts.  The personal and positive impact have been large and long-lasting on our 97 undergraduate student interns that have participated in the ?Herbarium Army? and worked with the MAM Project specimens.  They have developed skills and knowledge about natural history collections, and a general appreciation and understanding of science and its connection to all other fields in society.  These students, from a wide variety of backgrounds and ethnicities, have now spread out into large variety of careers and jobs.  Testimonials from our students show that even if they will not continue to work in biological research, their herbarium intern experiences has often shaped their outlook on science, interest in nature and plants, and provided them with a broad set of new life skills useful in a wide variety of career choices. The mentoring policies and protocols we have developed can be implemented in many types of places, from libraries to art museums.  Through the development of new in-class and online assignments we have engaged about 800 students with herbarium data (4 classes per year). We have dispersed information through a variety of outlets to educators worldwide, from talks at conferences, organized workshops, sharing modules on teaching and mentoring using herbaria on social media (blogs, Facebook, and Twitter).  This grant provided Rutgers University with expertise and skills in image and database management that will have a long-lasting effect on our ability to continue and expand our efforts to digitize and serve biodiversity data to the global research community.  We have gained an imaging station, a new server for serving images online, and worked with the IT support staff for the continuation of our digitization efforts.
