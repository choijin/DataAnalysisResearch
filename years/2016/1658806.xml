<AbstractNarration>This award supports the Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) site in Imaging Science at the Rochester Institute of Technology.   "To see with a keener eye" has been a human obsession for centuries. This science seeks to see more clearly what was far away or what was very small or even hidden - to magnify and sharpen. The reliance of modern scientific and engineering research on imaging techniques has created the need for a new generation of scientists who not only design and develop the optical systems, electronics, sensors, image processing algorithms, and integrated imaging systems of the future, but who apply those systems to answer fundamental questions about ourselves and our universe, monitor and protect our environment, help keep our nation secure, and improve our health.  This site will support eight undergraduates per summer in research projects that address some of these important questions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The REU students will spend ten weeks during the summer participating in research in one of a variety of topics that comprise the field of imaging science, including physics, optics, radiation sources, mathematics of statistics and topology, chemistry of materials, sensor engineering, computer science, data mining, brain science of vision, and the psychophysics of perception. By the end of the program, every student will have: practiced a one minute "elevator pitch"; given a formal presentation about their work; and prepared and presented a conference style poster and a four page paper.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The REU program "Imaging in the Physical Sciences" was housed in the Chester F. Carlson Center for Imaging Science. This was a successful program based on interdisciplinary research investigating novel imaging systems and applications across a wide range of problems and fields. The interdisciplinary nature of Imaging Science, requiring knowledge and skills in physics, mathematics, engineering, and computer science, made for a particularly welcoming environment for students from traditionally underrepresented populations. Here, traditional barriers to entry are lower, and the need for diverse thinking is paramount, and rewarded. Our program used outreach and recruiting activities within Native American communities, targeting these students to engage in STEM-based, interdisciplinary research.  This REU placed emphasis on increasing the engagement of Native Americans in STEM disciplines, leveraging our location in Western New York State and our proximity to the Iroquois Six Nations Confederacy. However, we successfully expanded that focus nationally engaging 14 students from 9 tribes around the US (including Hawaii).   Additionally, we have achieved on average approximately 50% participation by women.  Interdisciplinary research provides a unique platform for students from underrepresented groups. The barriers of entry are lower than for "traditional" disciplines, and we see this effect in our current graduate student population which is, historically, almost 40% female. While that number needs to be higher, it is already significantly higher than the percentage of women achieving a Ph.D. in Physics, for example (statistics taken from the American Physical Science website, 2019). We believe that this is due to the interdisciplinary, and applied research nature of the field of Imaging Science. Students in Imaging Science are comfortable working across traditional disciplines, and learn to understand "imaging systems", from capture of energy through optics and detectors, to image processing, computer vision, and an understanding of the human visual system which ultimately "looks" at the images.  This REU aimed to build and enhance relationships with Native American communities by engaging them in interdisciplinary research in Imaging Science.  We achieved this by providing impactful, 10 week research programs during the summers.  These experiences developed strong cohort experiences, fostering collaboration and communication skills across disciplines, providing both a strong skillset and a network of like-minded students.  Student participants in this REU worked with faculty and graduate students in the Chester F. Carlson Center for Imaging Science on research projects spanning a wide range of imaging systems and their application to problems in science and engineering. This REU also sought to include a diverse pool applicants and participants.  Over the course of the program, we averaged approximately 200 applicants per year, with women making up approximately 50% of the applicant pool.  Over the entire course of this REU, 29 publications or presentations in scholarly venues were produced.  Many of these are peer-reviewed publications or submissions, while others are presentations at local, national, and international conferences.  Additionally, our REU site had strong professional mentoring for students engaged in the program.  In addition to the faculty overseeing the research, the PI held weekly meetings with the students in a seminar fashion.  These seminars included technical talks related to Imaging Science from faculty, research staff, and graduate students, but also included presentations on professional development.  Speakers typically provided not just a technical talk, but also presented briefly on their career path and how they developed as a scientist.  Additionally, the seminar provided a chance to mentor students on professional development skillsets such as delivering an ``elevator speech'' on their research project, ethical conduct of research, writing a resume / CV, communicating with potential employers, and other topics of interest to the students.
