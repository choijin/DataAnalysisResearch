<AbstractNarration>One of the challenges toward achieving the vision of smart cities is improving the state of the underground infrastructure. For example, large US cities have thousands of miles of aging water mains, resulting in hundreds of breaks every year, and a large percentage of water consumption that is unaccounted for. The goal of this project is to develop models and methods to generate, analyze, and share data on underground infrastructure systems, such as water, gas, electricity , and sewer networks. The interdisciplinary team of investigators from the University of Illinois at Chicago, Brown University, and Northwestern University will leverage partnerships with the cities of Chicago and Evanston, Illinois, to make the approach and findings relevant to their stakeholders. Research results will be incorporated in courses at the three institutions. Outreach efforts include events for K-12 students to develop awareness about underground infrastructure from a data and computational perspective. The results of the project will ultimately help municipalities maintain and renovate civil infrastructure in a more effective manner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cities are cyber-physical systems on a grand scale, and developing a precise knowledge of their infrastructure is critical to building a foundation for the future smart city. This proposal takes an information centric approach based on the complex interaction among thematic data layers to developing, visualizing, querying, analyzing, and providing access to a comprehensive representation of the urban underground infrastructure starting from incomplete and imprecise data. Specifically, the project has the following main technical components: (1) Generation of accurate GIS-based representations of underground infrastructure systems from paper maps, CAD drawings, and other legacy data sources; (2) Visualization of multi-layer networks combining schematic overview diagrams with detailed geometric representations; (3) Query processing algorithms for integrating spatial, temporal, and network data about underground infrastructure systems; (4) Data analytics spanning heterogeneous geospatial data sources and incorporating uncertainty and constraints; (5) Selective access to stakeholders on a need-to-know basis and facilitating data sharing; and (6) Evaluation in collaboration with the cities of Chicago and Evanston.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ As the underground infrastructure systems of cities age, maintenance and repair become an increasing concern. The project has investigated a smart data management framework for underground infrastructure systems that addresses the dimensions of map construction, data integration, data analytics, security, and visualization.   The project is part of an NSF-funded collaborative effort by investigators working at Brown University, Iowa State University, Northwestern University, and University of Illinois at Chicago (Lead).  Selected project results are summarized below:  We have contributed the development of GUIDES, a new data conversion and management framework for urban underground infrastructure systems that enables city administrators, workers, and contractors along with the general public and other users to query digitized and integrated data to make smarter decisions. Within the GUIDES framework, we have focused on the design of algorithms that identify and correct errors and infer missing elements in AutoCAD drawings for urban infrastructure systems by means of context aware preprocessing and data integration techniques across data layers.  Regarding qualitative and quantitative analysis the team conducted qualitative interviews and field work. This was a four-stage process that began with pilot interviews on the UIC campus, extended to the greater Chicago Region, and eventually a national survey of Public Works Directors and GIS Analysts. All the interviews have been transcribed and coded. Data integration is a major component of the project, as the (invisible) underground infrastructure is discovered, in part, by considering (visible) ground information. We also integrated other datasets such as land use data, and in query processing we took into account uncertainty.   The project provided multiple opportunities for faculty and students in the various universities and departments to work collaboratively and publish their work jointly. Thus, the project provided interdisciplinary training to the students involved.       Last Modified: 01/05/2021       Submitted by: Maria I Cruz]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
