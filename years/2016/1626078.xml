<AbstractNarration>This award provides support for the Georgia Institute of Technology (Georgia Tech) to acquire a 3D Direct Laser Writing (3D-DLW) Lithography System with sub-micrometer resolution, which will be installed in the shared-user, open-access cleanroom facilities of the Marcus Nanotechnology Building (MNB). Using two-photon polymerization, the proposed 3D-DLW system can write arbitrarily-shaped, three-dimensional patterns into light-sensitive polymer films with a lateral resolution down to 150 nm. The tools, thus, complements optical and e-beam lithography tools available at Georgia Tech, which can only write two-dimensional patterns with feature sizes down to 1Âµm and 10nm, respectively. The cleanroom in the MNB is part of Georgia Tech's Institute for Electronics and Nanotechnology (IEN) and open not only to Georgia Tech researchers, but also outside users from academia and industry, as part of the NSF-funded National Nanotechnology Coordinated Infrastructure (NNCI) program. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Installing this 3D Direct Laser Writing Lithography System in a major, open-access cleanroom facility in the US, enables access to state-of-the-art 3D patterning capability with sub-micrometer resolution not only for researchers from Georgia Tech, but also external users from academia, industry, and government labs. Together with the existing cleanroom tool set, the 3D-DLW system will enable fabrication of a wide variety of 3D micro- and nanostructures and their integration into devices and systems. Georgia Tech's Institute for Electronics and Nanotechnology will offer workshops on the applications and capabilities of the 3D lithography tool to promote the system to undergraduate and graduate students, postdocs, faculty and researchers from industry. The PI and his Co-PIs will embed modules using the 3D-DLW system into courses taught at Georgia Tech. Finally, education modules based on 3D lithography will be developed for elementary, middle, and high schools. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With the 3D Direct Laser Writing Lithography System's unique ability to write true 3D patterns with sub-micrometer resolution, the goal is to catalyze a broad spectrum of research activities in areas such as photonics and micro-optics, microelectromechanical systems (MEMS), microsystems and microfluidic components for regenerative medicine, cell biology and tissue engineering, multifunctional nanomaterials, as well as optical and mechanical metamaterials. Thereby, the material choice for the 3D structures is not only limited to an increasing number of (light-sensitive) polymers, but can be extended using templating and thin-film coating techniques to include, e.g., metals and inorganic dielectrics. Fifteen faculty members spanning six schools across Georgia Tech's College of Engineering and College of Sciences, as well as from neighboring Emory University have identified research and training uses for this 3D-DLW system.</AbstractNarration>

Together with the existing cleanroomtool set, the 3D-DLW system will enable fabrication of a wide variety of 3D micro- and nano structures and their integration into devices and systems.  In just over 2 and half years of operation, the Nanoscribe has enabled over 22 different novel research projects.  It has had over 5,000 hours of utilized operation by 42 different users.  All users were trained by IEN staff over a course of 104 different training sessions.   One example research project is a "micro-bristle-bot" (Figure 1), created by researchers DeaGyu Kim, Zhijian Hao, Jun Ueda and Azadeh Ansari.  A bristle-bot or vibrobot is a multi-legged robot made of bristles and an oscillating actuator that generates vibrations.  The miniaturized bristle-bot has a weight of only 5 mg, which is about the weight of five paperclips.  The bristle-bot has a size of 2 mm x 1.87 mm x 0.8 mm and can achieve a speed up to 4 times it's body length per second.  The locomotion of micro-bristle-bots is controlled with various leg designs that use small excitation voltages applied by an external piezoelectric shaker.  The micro-bristle-bots show a resonant frequency around 6.3 kHz, which can be tailored based on their geometry.  This allows for addressing individual micro-bristle-bots with various geometries based on their unique resonance frequency.  The researchers of this project envision a day, perhaps a decade in the future, when precisely controlled microbots find use in a variety of industrial and environmental settings.  Biomedical applications might take another decade, where the tiny robots might serve medical purposes and be swallowed or injected.  A second example project is a self-aligned optical fiber interconnect to silicon chiplets (Figures 2, 3), created by researchers Congshan Wan, Joe L. Gonzalez, Tianren Fan, Ali Adibi, Thomas K. Gaylord, and Muhannad S. Bakir.  A passive self-alignment and assembly approach for optical fibers was demonstrated using a combination of silicon micromachining and 3D printing with the Nanoscribe to achieve efficient and accurate near-vertical coupling to a silicon-on-insulator (SOI) substrate with monolithic ridge waveguides and grating couplers.The alignment process is repeatable and the peak efficiency is comparable to the active fiber alignment efficiency (86% or &minus;0.67 dB of that obtained from active alignment). The overall alignment accuracy is in the submicron range due to the formation of mechanical self-aligning structures. The overall approach is compatible with numerous applications, including fiber-to-chip and fiber-to-package assemblies as well as in the testing of photonic devices.  Optical interconnects have shown their potential to satisfy the ever-growing need for largebandwidth, low energy, and high data rate.  This research could enable faster computing networks and improved connectivity in the ever expanding use of data and internet worldwide.  The acquistion and installation of the Nanoscribe 3D direct write laser system in the MNB at Georgia Tech has enabled cutting edge research and thereby improving scientific and technology knowledge base.  Many of these activities have promise to be commercialized and made available for public use for the betterment of society.
