<AbstractNarration>The chief importance of this project is its impact on increasing the number of Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) degrees awarded at U.S. universities. The nation needs a sufficient number of STEM-degree holders, who possess technical skills that are crucially important for the nation's economic health and growth. Unfortunately, too many potential STEM majors are currently lost because of poor experiences in introductory university STEM courses. This project aims to improve dramatically the retention of students in STEM majors by propagating widely (by means of a national workshop) "best practices" for preparing high-quality instructors of key introductory STEM courses.     &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Graduate Teaching Assistants (GTAs) are the primary instructors in laboratories and recitations in large lecture STEM courses; however, GTAs are often inadequately prepared to apply cutting-edge, evidence-based pedagogies necessary for excellent STEM instruction and, thereby, enhanced STEM-major retention. The goal of this project is widespread improvements to GTA preparation in introductory physics and chemistry courses via propagating GTA professional development programs. In a workshop, planning teams from Ph.D.-granting physics and chemistry departments will devise customized, realistic GTA professional development plans by interacting with each other and with world-class experts on best practices for GTA support. Twenty STEM departments will develop plans; each implemented plan will benefit 15 new GTAs annually, who then interact with 900 new undergraduates. Thus, the propagation of best practices by this workshop should impact positively approximately 13,500 new undergraduates each year.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The ultimate goal of this project was to help equip graduate teaching assistants with knowledge of and skills in effective instructional methods for Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) Education, thereby advancing undergraduate education.  The project aimed to achieve this goal via two workshops to propagate best practices for graduate student professional development; the workshops were held in Spring 2017 and Spring 2019 on the campus of the Georgia Institute of Technology.   Intellectual Merit : The workshop aimed to improve undergraduate STEM learning by propagating professional development programs for Graduate Teaching Assistants (GTAs), who typically oversee the labs and recitations that are an essential part of most undergraduate gateway STEM courses.   Participant planning teams were selected from competing Ph.D.-granting physics and chemistry departments at universities across the nation.  At the workshop, each team devised realistic GTA professional development plans customized for their department by interacting with each other and with world-class experts on best practices for GTA support.  Broader Impacts : The United States leads the world in science and technology; however, this leadership position is at-risk due to a substantial, chronic national shortage of trained professionals needed to fill 21st century high skill, high wage jobs in numerous STEM fields. Eliminating this shortage depends on increasing the retention of students in STEM majors; introductory STEM courses play a central role in retention efforts because many students leave STEM majors while taking introductory STEM courses early in their collegiate careers. The proposed work addresses one major factor in the loss of STEM majors from introductory courses: poor lab-science experiences in part due to ineffective instruction by GTAs who are insufficiently prepared to facilitate meaningful STEM experiences for undergraduates.  Chief Outcomes:  A total of 35 teams from physics and chemistry departments at 33 universities across the nation participated in the workshops.   Post-workshop surveys indicate the participating teams found the workshops to be very helpful.   Anecdotal evidence suggests that most teams implement the GTA professional development plans; moreover, it is reasonable to assume that in each department every year, on average, the implemented GTA-PD program will benefit 15 new GTAs  interacting with 900 new undergraduates. Thus, we estimate, that, at most,  approximately 31,500 new undergraduates will be impacted each year by approximately 525 new GTAs who will have received professional development on STEM- Education best practices. The project focused only on physics and chemistry departments; however, the results of this project readily adaptable for advance the professional development of graduate students in other STEM disciplines.
