<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will be derived from the novel catalyst developed of the project. The project will, if successful, dramatically improve the efficiency and scope of a specific class of industrially significant chemical reactions which are indispensable for the manufacture of many useful products such as pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, and electronics. The improvements, for example, will provide access to newer materials for the production of newer and improved related products to address unmet biological and engineering needs. The catalyst discoveries will also enhance the scientific knowledge base of both fundamental and applied catalysis science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The technical objectives in this Phase I research project are to develop a collection of novel and improved organometallic catalysts for industrially relevant cross-coupling reactions; and to address current unmet industrial needs for higher catalyst efficiency, selectivity and scope of these reactions. The Phase I research will involve detailed and innovative investigations of the current state-of-the-art catalysts; systematic and iterative design, synthesis, and testing of the new organometallic catalysts; and demonstration of improved performance of the new catalysts in relevant cross-coupling reactions. The catalysis knowledge gained from this Phase I research will enable catalyst design and development efforts in the current project for specific industrial applications. The development and commercialization of a collection of new and improved catalysts in this Phase I project will significantly expand the efficiency and industrial utility of cross- coupling reactions towards creating new products based on this chemistry.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This NSF award supported work aimed at the development of new and improved catalysts technologies for specific applications in the fine and specialty chemical industries.  Catalysts play a critical role in industrial production of nearly all chemicals.  Catalyst accelerate chemical reactions, facilitate reactions to occur at lower temperatures, facilitate higher desired product selectivity and yields, reduce chemical wastes, and provide opportunities for use of alternative more readily available, inexpensive, and less toxic starting materials.  Thus new and improved catalysts technologies are of significant economic and societal benefit because they facilitate the development of efficient industrial processes which not only reduce energy costs and chemical wastes, but also allow for the use of alternative sustainable feedstock and provide access to newer and improved products.  The work explored state-of-the-art catalysts using experimental and spectroscopic studies to understand and identify new catalyst concepts and technologies of potential industrial significance.  New catalysts concepts and technologies were developed and validated.  The new technologies are of potential commercial value because they offer opportunities to improve industrial workflows and chemical processes, particularly for R&amp;D and manufacturing applications in the specialty chemical industries including the pharmaceutical industry.  The new technologies enable utility of new catalysts, offer improvements in catalysts efficiency in terms of higher catalysts turnover numbers and selectivity, and also provide opportunities for utilization of newer starting materials to potentially provide access to newer products.  The work has had a variety of broader impacts. The work was partly published in an article in a peer-reviewed journal to share the knowledge gained with scientists around the world. The new technologies were protected by filing of provisional patent applications with USPTO to enable future commercial opportunities and industrial utility. The new technologies were partly utilized to facilitate the successful execution of actual R&amp;D projects of pharmaceutical industry clients.  The new technologies show potential in improving the efficiency of specific industrial chemical processes and providing access to newer products leading to both economic and societal benefits.
