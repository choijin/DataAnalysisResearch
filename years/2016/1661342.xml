<AbstractNarration>This project will create a comprehensive, open-access database of plant and animal demographic information that will be useful to researchers, educators, and conservation managers. No such centralized repository currently exists, although biologists have been collecting data on the rates with which individuals survive, grow, and reproduce for many decades, and from tens of thousands of populations around the world. These fundamental biological data can inform a range of scientific research within and outside of the field of biology, including understanding why certain populations go extinct or become invasive, and predicting how species may respond to anthropogenic pressures and global change. By developing a single, standardized platform for storing and analyzing these demographic data, this project will yield an important resource for a range of users. For example, researchers will be able to directly contribute their datasets into the repository, as well as to link these demographic data with other databases (e.g. on species distributions, genetic sequences, climate projections) to conduct large-scale comparative studies. Teachers and students will be able to explore variations in life cycles and carry out basic analyses by following the exercises and tutorials that will accompany the database. Finally, managers of threatened species can use these demographic data to better understand the needs of their populations and compare the impacts of different management strategies (e.g., increasing breeding compared to increasing offspring survival). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The demographic rates of survival, growth, and reproduction are the basic units for measuring how populations change in size and structure through time and space. As such, these demographic data serve as key resources for a range of biological research, from understanding the evolution of life histories to predicting species responses to global change. Moreover, demographic studies tend to follow a standardized protocol for data collection and presentation in the form of matrix population models (MPMs). This standardization provides a rare opportunity to conduct large-scale comparative analyses across the tree of life. The scientific literature currently contains MPMs for &gt;1,500 plant species and &gt;2,000 animal species worldwide, often with several populations for each species. The distinctive data structure and standardized analyses for MPMs necessitate a uniform, centralized repository to maximize the utility of these valuable data. This project aims to develop an open-access repository of MPMs, which will allow researchers to leverage decades of demographic monitoring to conduct comparative analyses at global, regional, and local scales. The proposed work involves developing a robust relational database management system for MPMs, building upon existing efforts by an international team of demographic experts and data users on the COMPADRE Plant Matrix Database and COMADRE Animal Matrix Database. The team will create a publicly accessible interface to facilitate data usage and enable researchers to directly contribute their MPM datasets through a standardized data entry portal. Additionally, the project's senior personnel will develop tutorials and teaching materials, and conduct a series of workshops to engage current and potential users of the repository including researchers, educators, and conservation managers. The results of this project can be found at http://www.compadre-db.org/.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p><span>We developed a centralized repository for a rich collection of life history data in the form of matrix population models for plants and animal species around the world. Building upon a decades-long international effort, we combined the COMPADRE Plant Matrix Database and the COMADRE Animal Matrix Database into a single relational database with a multi-functional interface to facilitate data access by a broad range of users including researchers, students, and conservation managers (Image 1). New features include querying the database by taxonomic or publication information (Image 2), visualizing data by geographic location, and downloading either single matrices in .csv format or the full dataset in a format compatible with the R software for further analysis. The database will now publish quarterly releases of the full dataset as we continue to update and error-check the matrix values and associated metadata. We built a standardized data entry portal, so that our international team of students and scientists can work together to systematically compile new data (Image 3). The data digitization portal also allows other researchers to directly contribute their own matrix models into the database via a dashboard (Image 4), and the website provides a permanent link to archive data from their publication(s). We also developed a suite of education materials aimed at the high school and college levels to teach about species life histories as well as the use and construction of matrix populations models. Finally, we presented a series of 7 workshops at scientific conferences, and published blogs and newsletters to engage and expand our user base. Overall, our project has greatly improved the consistency, accessibility, and function of our global demographic dataset, creating a valuable resource for a variety of users and forming the foundation for novel research from understanding the evolution of life histories to predicting species responses to global change.</span></p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 08/09/2021<br>      Modified by: Judy&nbsp;P&nbsp;Che-Castaldo</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1661342/1661342_10510889_1628041472769_homepage--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1661342/1661342_10510889_1628041472769_homepage--rgov-800width.jpg" title="1.Home page"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1661342/1661342_10510889_1628041472769_homepage--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="1.Home page"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Home page for newly developed COMPADRE Matrix Database</div> <div class="imageCredit">Judy Che-Castaldo</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Public Domain</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Judy&nbsp;P&nbsp;Che-Castaldo</div> <div class="imageTitle">1.Home page</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1661342/1661342_10510889_1628044701500_database_interface--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1661342/1661342_10510889_1628044701500_database_interface--rgov-800width.jpg" title="2.Query database"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1661342/1661342_10510889_1628044701500_database_interface--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="2.Query database"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Interface for querying database</div> <div class="imageCredit">Judy Che-Castaldo</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Public Domain</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Judy&nbsp;P&nbsp;Che-Castaldo</div> <div class="imageTitle">2.Query database</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1661342/1661342_10510889_1628044881573_data_entry--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1661342/1661342_10510889_1628044881573_data_entry--rgov-800width.jpg" title="3.Data entry"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1661342/1661342_10510889_1628044881573_data_entry--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="3.Data entry"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Example data entry form from the data entry portal</div> <div class="imageCredit">Judy Che-Castaldo</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Public Domain</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Judy&nbsp;P&nbsp;Che-Castaldo</div> <div class="imageTitle">3.Data entry</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1661342/1661342_10510889_1628045340074_public_dashboard--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1661342/1661342_10510889_1628045340074_public_dashboard--rgov-800width.jpg" title="4.Public dashboard"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1661342/1661342_10510889_1628045340074_public_dashboard--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="4.Public dashboard"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Public user digitization interface dashboard</div> <div class="imageCredit">Judy Che-Castaldo</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Public Domain</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Judy&nbsp;P&nbsp;Che-Castaldo</div> <div class="imageTitle">4.Public dashboard</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
