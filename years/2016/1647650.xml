<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project aims to provide an affordable sealant for sealing expansion joints and cracks in concrete pavement, bridge deck, etc. In transportation infrastructure, expansion joints are intentionally constructed in order to allow movement of the structural elements due to linear thermal expansion when temperature rises. In addition, cracks are a common failure mode in pavement. If they are not properly sealed, water penetration will damage the surface layer and the layers beneath, and entrapped debris will cause rupture of the concrete wall. Therefore, sealing cracks and joints is a common practice to maintain or extend the structure service life. Various types of sealants have been used with an annual market value about $6.1 billion. Unfortunately, many sealants cannot properly seal cracks and joints, and/or last long, requiring frequent replacement or resealing. In this project, a smart sealant that expands upon cooling and contracts upon heating, which is thermally opposite to concrete, will be developed to counteract thermal movement of the joined structural elements. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this project lies in the feasibility of a smart sealant technology. The primary reason for joint failure is that most sealants behave similar to concrete, i.e., they contract upon cooling and expand upon heating. This thermal behavior is contrary to the requirement for sealants. The objective of this project is to design, synthesize, characterize, and evaluate a cost-effective two-way shape memory polymer based sealant for sealing expansion joints or cracks in concrete pavement or bridge deck, which will expand upon cooling and contract upon heating. It will have the required mechanical properties and durability to survive the repeated traffic load and outdoor environment. The success of the project can have beneficial impact not only on the transportation infrastructure but also other structures such as driveways, parking lots, dams, harbors, buildings, swimming pools, etc.</AbstractNarration>

In addition, cracks are a common failure mode in pavement. If they are not properly sealed, water penetration will damage the surface layer and the layers beneath, and entrapped debris will cause rupture of the concrete wall. While various types of sealants have been used, many sealants cannot properly seal cracks and joints, and/or last long, requiring frequent replacement or resealing. The objective of this project is to synthesize, characterize, and test a new generation of sealant which behaves thermally opposite to conventional construction materials, and at a competitive cost. In this project, a two-way shape memory polymer sealant that expands upon cooling and contracts upon heating, which is thermally opposite to cement concrete or asphalt concrete, has been developed to counteract thermal movement of the jointed structural elements. Through a series of synthesizing and testing, we have pinned down a chemically cross-linked semi-crystalline two-way shape memory polymer as a potential candidate for sealant. We have found that our sealant expands by 106% when the temperature drops from 65 to -45 degree Celsius and contracts by 101% when the temperature rises from -45 to 60 degree Celsius, which is sufficient for sealing expansion joints, contraction joints, and construction joints in cement concrete pavement, and for sealing cracks in both cement concrete pavement and asphalt concrete pavement. The temperature range is also adequate to cover the environmental temperature that is encountered in this nation or around the world. In addition, our product is self-adhesive and has self-healing capabilities, which makes installation very convenient at a lower cost, regardless of the geometry of the joins/cracks. The estimated retail price is about $3.5/lb if applied as sealant in joints and about $3.0 if applied as sealer in crack sealing. The price is comparable to polymer modified asphalt sealant (about $1.9/lb), but much lower than that of silicon rubber sealant (about $10/lb). As compared to polymer modified asphalt sealant, which usually lasts for a couple of years, or have to be replaced annually,&nbsp; our sealant has a design life of 10 years as determined by traffic loading (fatigue test) and environmental attack tests (moisture and ultraviolet radiation tests). Therefore, the economic impact of our product on customers will be significant.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 10/17/2017<br>      Modified by: Lu&nbsp;Lu</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
