<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be seen in the adoption of solar energy as a cost-competitive alternative to non-renewable energy sources. While solar energy costs have been dramatically reduced, the use of the most efficient cells is limited by manufacturing costs. The need for efficient cells - solar cells that deliver more watts per area - can be seen when considering system costs. Higher efficiency reduces all costs related to area: module components, support structures, labor, land, etc. Silicon Heterojunctions (SHJ) cells deliver leading conversion efficiencies but are manufactured with processes that require multiple passes through very expensive machines to deposit required semiconductor layers. The manufacturing cost issue has hindered adoption of the high efficiency SHJ cell technology. The project's innovation dramatically reduces the cost of the most expensive steps in SHJ cell manufacture while maintaining or improving cell performance. Potentially, the innovation could find application in other markets such as organic light emitting diodes (LEDs). The cost reduction of the SHJ cell will significantly shift the photovoltaic industry's energy conversion efficiency upward and the cost per watt downward.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project addresses two shortcomings of the established manufacturing methods for SHJ solar cells. The first challenge is the deposition of the cell's transparent conductive layer, typically an alloy called indium tin oxide (ITO). Standard sputter processes used for this deposition cause damage to the underlying layers of the cell. The damage can reduce the cell performance or require additional process steps. Also, next generation concepts for SHJ cell design are even more sensitive to damage and less able to tolerate "repair" steps. The project will develop a novel low damage sputter source for the ITO deposition. The second challenge is that the semiconductor layers of the SHJ cell use costly plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) systems developed for the high value display industry. The project will direct use of the novel sputter source for deposition of the semiconductor layers as well as the ITO. Sputter is lower cost than PECVD and easily allows sequential layers of different materials to be deposited in a single, continuous flow, in-line machine. The project will demonstrate the sputter source for each of the layers as separate materials and for an SHJ cell with a fully sputtered stack of the three critical layers.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This project set out to demonstrate a coating technology capable of depositing atomically thin material layers for use in the high volume manufacturing of photovoltaic devices. A key aspect of the source technology is that it must deposit thin film materials of high quality (typically high transparency, low resistivity, high density) while also minimizing or eliminating the damaging processing effects present in common production techniques used today. Our research primarily focused on the deposition of indium tin oxide (ITO) and amorphous silicon (a-Si) onto silicon heterojunction (SHJ) solar cells. By marketing our technology at industrial trade shows, we have directed our application work to also include diamond-like carbon with out substrate bias, phase change memory, and perovskite based solar cells. We have already received paid development contracts to continue studying these specific technology areas with our source designs.&nbsp;</p> <p>SHJ solar cells have been shown to be one of the best performing solar cell designs for the single sun, terrestrial based solar market. SHJs rely on high purity, low defect silicon wafers to produce highly efficient (&gt;22%) devices. While SHJs are dominant in performance, they do not yet meet the economical demands to compelte in the marketplace of a maturing industry. Lower efficiency solar cell architectures have dominated the industry as their lower costs of production outweigh the efficiency improvements promised by the SHJ design.</p> <p>ITO is utilized in many applications including architectural glass, flat panel displays, aerospace, and of course, photovoltaics. When applied using a PVD technique known as magnetron sputtering, the oxygen contained within the ITO target material is accelerated at high voltages, causing damage to underlying films and substrates. For the SHJ cells we worked with, the generation of these energetic oxygen species result in the formation of defects within the highly ordered silicon substrate. During this program, we developed two source designs which approached the problem of these detrimental oxygen species in two ways; (1) preventing species that are generated from ever reaching the substrate and (2) by preventing the generation of these species from the outset.</p> <p>The 1<sup>st</sup> design sought to prevent energetic oxygen from reaching the substrate, by utilizing a design similar in form to a facing target sputter (FTS) source. This design orients two sputter targets parallel to each other, but perpendicular to the substrate. A schematic of this arrangement and an image of the as-built source is provided in the attached images. With this method, highly energetic species are captured between the opposing faces of the two targets.</p> <p>The 2<sup>nd</sup> design sought to prevent the formation of energetic oxygen species from the outset. This was accomplished by using a method known as ion beam sputter deposition (IBSD). The ion beam source generates the sputter plasma remotely from the target surface. With this design, oxygen species are still ejected from the target surface, but because there is no applied target voltage, the oxygen is not accelerated and therefore does not have the energy necessary to damage the underlayers or substrates. Circular ion beams themselves are relatively commonplace in the coating industry, but our source design is unique in that it is scalable in size (&gt;1m in length) enabling its use for large scale industrial coating equipment. A linear ion beam of this type does not otherwise exist today. We believe this source technology has many applications beyond coatings for photovoltaics and have already received multiple paid development contracts for its continued use. The linear ion source is protected by a fundamental technology patent and we've received commercial interest from several companies. Pictures of the source are included in the attached images.</p> <p>Both of these designs have found commercial interest from industrial equipment providers, and the end-users of thin film coating equipment. We have ongoing discussions with a major supplier of industrial coating equipment and they are interested in integrating our source designs into their systems. We also have development contracts underway with a perovskite solar cell manufacturer, a supplier of phase-change memory materials, and a supplier looking to improve the performance of razor blades. &nbsp;</p> <p>By the end of this project, we have shown the development of <em>two</em> deposition source designs and have expanded the scope of potential coating applications to include not only SHJ solar cells, but also perovskite solar cells, non-hydrogenated diamond-like carbon, and chalcogenide materials for phase-change memory devices. As a result of this project we now have three ongoing customer partnerships to continue developing the technology into a viable commercial product. Along with funding this project, the Phase I SBIR has facilitated the expansion of our business into a 6000 sqft laboratory/office and enabled the addition of several engineers and support staff to our team. As a result of this expansion, we are on track to realize revenues of &gt;$1M for 2018.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 08/27/2018<br>      Modified by: Robert&nbsp;Weiss</p>
