<AbstractNarration>This project is funded by the Advancing Informal STEM Learning program, which seeks to advance new approaches to, and evidence-based understandings of, the design and development of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) learning in informal environments.  Roughly one million refugees resettled in the United States in the past decade, many of whom are school-aged youth. During secondary school, resettled refugee youth are often still developing English language literacy and STEM skills needed for successful postsecondary experiences in the United States. At the same time, these youth bring rich cultural and linguistic resources that they can use as an asset as they grow their STEM skill sets, prepare for future success, and make positive impacts on U.S. society. To promote these assets and engage youth in developing STEM literacy, this after-school program engages these youth in critical STEM literacy development.  The project focuses on STEM learning, specifically the relationship between human life and climate, as well as developing youths' STEM identities and agency. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will develop and implement a community-based afterschool program that provides resettled Burmese refugee youth with STEM learning experiences. By drawing upon youths' experiences, the program will engage youth in learning about climate science and developing digital stories to communicate with broader audiences. To do so, the team will implement a program that builds on principles of responsive teaching, funds of knowledge, and English literacy development in authentic meaning-making contexts. The project will examine how youth expand their STEM knowledge, develop STEM identities and agency, and develop their expertise in communicating about STEM within and beyond their participation in the after-school program. The research team will explore existing and innovative data collection and analysis methods by drawing on principles of ethnography, video ethnography, mediated discourse analysis, and phenomenological and ethnomethodological analysis of interviews. These analyses will document learning over time in informal STEM learning settings. As there is very little prior research on STEM learning in this population, this project will generate knowledge about how to support STEM sense-making and critical STEM literacy. Furthermore, by testing the designed curriculum and building a partnership with a local community organization, the project will build capacity for broadening participation in informal STEM learning practices.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Project RESET (Refugee Youth Engaging in Critical STEM Literacy and Learning) developed and implemented an afterschool STEM program to engage and advance resettled refugee youth in critical STEM literacy. The afterschool STEM program was provided for resettled Burmese refugee youth, mostly Chin. Chin is one of the ethnic nationalities in Myanmar (also known as Burma) living in the northwestern mountainous region of the country. Many Chins are resettled in the United States as refugees on the grounds of their ethnicity and religion (Christianity). Chins are made up of over 20 ethnic groups that speak their own languages and practice their cultural traditions. A large number of Chins have established their communities in the Midwest U.S. city around ethnic churches and businesses. Many school-aged youths have interrupted schooling experiences and speak three or more languages, including English with varying levels of proficiency.&nbsp;</p> <p>The after-school program took place as part of an academic enrichment program for secondary school youth at a non-profit organization, Burmese Center (Pseudonym). Burmese Center has provided educational and vocational support for these youths with a mission to &ldquo;build a thriving, self-sufficient and sustainable, and integrated Burmese community.&rdquo; On one day each week during the academic year, RESET facilitated youth learning using a curriculum <em>Weather and Our Life </em>developed by RESET team. Participants (high school sophomores and juniors) learned about weather phenomena, climate change, and its impacts on human lives. Toward the end of the program, the participants produced short videos to communicate their learned knowledge with friends, family, and community members. The program was intentionally designed to utilize the teens&rsquo; experiences, knowledge, and linguistic resources, such as their diverse experiences of weather, ethnic practices related to weather phenomena, and proficiency in multiple different languages. The goal of the program was to improve critical STEM literacy which empower the teens to use their STEM knowledge for the transformation of communities and societies toward becoming more democratic, inclusive, and just.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>The findings of this project demonstrate, 1) how resettled refugee youth utilized multilingual and multimodal means to engage in STEM learning and expand opportunities to participate in STEM learning, 2) how they contributed to making the learning environment safe and inviting to all learners, including peers who had recently arrived in the United States, and 3) how they integrated STEM learning and desire for social changes that support underprivileged people. These findings contribute intellectually to the field of STEM education given that prior research on resettled refugees sometimes positions these youth as needing support without attending to how they contribute to learning environments. While it is important to supplement learning for refugees with attention to their unique needs, such deficit-oriented perspectives pose a risk of failing to recognize the rich resources that youth can bring to contribute to their own and peers&rsquo; learning. Moving beyond deficit-oriented perspectives, RESET sheds light on resettled refugee youth&rsquo;s knowledge and dispositions they had developed from the home country, migration experience, and experiences in the United States as valuable assets for new learning. Thus, our study provides implications as to how to build on resettled refugee youths&rsquo; resources in designing STEM learning environments to broaden STEM participation among these underserved youths. The research team disseminated these findings through 22 peer-reviewed international, national, and regional conference presentations, a peer-reviewed journal article and a conference proceeding, a book chapter, and a Master&rsquo;s thesis and Doctoral dissertation. The project was awarded a Public Choice Award in NSF 2017 STEM Video Showcase presentation entitled &ldquo;Creating Spaces with Resettled Refugee Youth&rdquo;&nbsp; (<a href="http://stemforall2017.videohall.com/presentations/994%20">http://stemforall2017.videohall.com/presentations/994%20</a>).&nbsp;</p> <p>Our project also had broader impacts in the area of improving educational equity in STEM education. The project implementation and findings suggested a model for engaging resettled refugee youths in an informal learning setting. While there are a number of organizations that offer resettlement and academic support for school-aged resettled refugees, such programs typically do not provide STEM learning experiences. Burmese Center was one of those organizations that did not prioritize STEM education. Thus, RESET was an initial step for collaboration between university researchers and refugee-serving community organizations to provide STEM education. Since the onset of the project, Burmese Center has become more interested and proactive in providing STEM-related learning opportunities for the youths. One example of the support for STEM education is that Burmese Center launched a STEM Club that aims to inform its youths about various STEM-related career paths. The research team has also built capacity to design and pursue a larger scale project that engages former refugee youths in STEM learning. Our project and its findings showcased how university-based scholars and refugee-serving organizations can collaborate to offer STEM-oriented afterschool programs to enhance these youths&rsquo; STEM learning and broaden their STEM participation. This collaboration contributes to supporting culturally and linguistically non-dominant students&rsquo; STEM learning, thus improving equitable educational opportunities for all youth.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 12/06/2019<br>      Modified by: Minjung&nbsp;Ryu</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
