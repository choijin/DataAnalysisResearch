<AbstractNarration>COMPRES is a community-based consortium, comprised of and governed by 57 US member institutions, that supports research in the properties of materials that comprise the interiors of Earth and other planetary bodies, with particular emphasis on highpressure science and technology and related fields. It is charged with the oversight and guidance of specialized high-pressure laboratories at several national synchrotron facilities. COMPRES supports the operation of beam lines, the development of new technologies for high-pressure research, and advocates for science and educational programs to the various funding agencies. In addition to the US membership, 39 foreign institutions are non-voting affiliates of COMPRES. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The member institutions guide the direction of the consortium and define its missions. The intellectual and scientific goals of COMPRES are described in the report "Understanding the Building Blocks of the Planet: The Materials Science of Earth Processes", which came out of a 2009 planning workshop (www.compres.us). Through its support of advanced tools for Earth science experimentation, COMPRES enables research on the compositional and thermal structure of Earths interior, its evolution through time, and the dynamical behavior of the crust, mantle and core. There is an intimate relationship between the scientific goals of COMPRES and other geophysical disciplines. The results of mineral physics measurements carried out at COMPRES-supported facilities are critical for interpreting seismological and other geophysical observations in terms of the physical, chemical, and dynamical state of Earths interior. Many of the scientific objectives of the seismological community require investigations of the material properties of Earth materials at extreme pressures and temperatures, as pursued by the COMPRES community. Research done at COMPRES-supported facilities also addresses questions of direct societal impact, such as the causes of earthquakes, carbon sequestration, natural resources, and basic research into new advanced materials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;COMPRES supports the operations and equipment needs of three synchrotron beamlines at the National Synchrotron Light Source (NSLS, Brookhaven National Laboratory), and one at the Advanced Light Source (ALS, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory). X-ray beam line X17B2 at NSLS is a center for rheology and equations of state measurements on materials at high pressures and temperatures, using the Large-Volume Multi-Anvil Press (LVP) and a Drickamer deformation apparatus. Beam lines X17B3 and X17C at NSLS are for high-energy X-ray studies of materials using the diamond-anvil cell (DAC) high-pressure apparatus, with resistance and laser heating. Beam line U2A is the worldleading facility for high-pressure infrared spectroscopy. Beam line 12.2.2 at the ALS is the COMPRES West-Coast facility for high-pressure high-temperature research using the diamond cell, and is developing into a center for resistance heating for DAC applications, as well as for laser-heating experiments. COMPRES also supports nuclear resonant inelastic X-ray scattering and synchrotron MÃ¶ssbauer research at Sector 3 of the Advanced Photon Source (APS). Under the new 5-year cooperative agreement, COMPRES will establish a COMPRES Technology Center (COMPTECH) at the APS to develop high-pressure capabilities utilizing other advanced synchrotron techniques, such as single-crystal micro-diffraction, and momentum resolved inelastic scattering. With the planned completion of the NSLS-II - the newest US synchrotron ? in 2015, COMPRES will support high-pressure experimentation at the Project beam line XPD. In addition to providing facilities for large volume and diamond cell experiments upon startup of NSLS-II, a COMPTECH office at NSLS-II will help to exploit the unique capabilities of this new world-leading facility for a new generation of experiments at extreme pressure-temperature conditions.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>COMPRES, the <strong><em>Co</em></strong><em>nsortium for <strong>M</strong>aterials <strong>P</strong>roperties <strong>R</strong>esearch in <strong>E</strong>arth <strong>S</strong>ciences</em>, is a community-based consortium whose goal is to enable Earth Science researchers to conduct the next generation of high-pressure science on world-class equipment and facilities. COMPRES facilitates the operation of synchrotron beamlines, the development of new technologies for high-pressure research, and both supports and advocates for science and educational programs.</p> <p>The facilities that COMPRES supports are specialized for high-pressure research using a variety of instruments. The goal is to provide facilities that are needed for cutting-edge innovative research that can only be performed at specialized central facilities. In education, COMPRES aims to train the next generation of scientists as well as more advanced researchers in highly specialized and complex experimental methods of research. Many of the latest research tools have only recently become available with the advent of third-generation synchrotron sources. COMPRES also provides, through the Annual Meeting, a forum for students to present and discuss their research, to network with each other, and to become introduced to new research possibilities.</p> <p><strong>Major Activities</strong></p> <p>COMPRES activities fall into the categories of 1) Facilities, 2) Education &amp; Outreach, and 3) Infrastructure Development, all specifically in support of research and education for the high-pressure Earth sciences community.</p> <p><strong>1) Facilities</strong></p> <p>COMPRES provided support for synchrotron facilities that accommodated numerous community users during the span of this award. In recent years, synchrotron-based techniques have played an ever-increasing role in experimental efforts to measure properties of geological materials at high pressures and temperatures. The new generation of synchrotrons at national facilities offers great promise for the coming five years and beyond. At Brookhaven National Laboratory, the NSLS-II (recently completed, $900 million facility) produces X-rays over 10,000 times brighter than the original National Synchrotron Light Source (NSLS) while providing improved spatial and energy resolution as well as a world-leading synchrotron-infrared (IR) radiation source. At the same time, plans are underway to provide a major upgrade to the Advanced Photon Source (APS) at Argonne National Laboratory. Upgrades are also planned for the Advanced Light Source (ALS) synchrotron at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. These new or upgraded synchrotrons augmented by improvements in x-ray optics and detectors will lead to dramatic advances in measurements at high pressure.</p> <p><strong>Education, Outreach, and Infrastructure Development (EOID) Program</strong></p> <p>COMPRES?s Education, Outreach, and Infrastructure Development (EOID) Program is our investment in the future?charged with technological development and cultivation of human resources. Our EOID program fosters the development of new methods and approaches for high-pressure research, shepherding new capabilities at synchrotrons and ensuring that offline user facilities are accessible to the entire COMPRES community. By combining infrastructure development with education and outreach, COMPRES can provide broad and cost-effective training to inform our community of emerging opportunities, and to help our existing research be more efficient, productive, and accurate. This program is structured to be a nimble responder to COMPRES community initiatives and needs. When COMPRES invests in a new technology or facility, the consortium follows through with education and outreach to inform the community and to build the user base. In some cases, EOID projects evolve into long-term activities that can become COMPRES facilities. Examples of EOID projects maturing into sustainable facilities are the Multi-anvil Project at ASU, the APS Gas Loading Facility, and the APS IXS Facility at Sector 3. In other cases, the scope of the EOID project might be shorter term?for example either a one-time workshop, or a project designed to be supported for 1-3 years and then spun-off to other support structures (or shared support).</p> <p><strong>2) Education and Outreach</strong></p> <p>This activity includes instructional workshops aimed at graduate students, advanced undergraduates and post-docs in the area of high-pressure science. Also supported is instruction through workshops on emerging experimental techniques that offer new research opportunities for mineral physics research.</p> <p><strong>3) Infrastructure Development</strong></p> <p>This activity aims to develop new instrumentation and methodology that is of interest to a significant fraction of the COMPRES community.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 08/20/2019<br>      Modified by: Carl&nbsp;B&nbsp;Agee</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1606856/1606856_10174811_1566339850953_AnnualMeetingTamaya--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1606856/1606856_10174811_1566339850953_AnnualMeetingTamaya--rgov-800width.jpg" title="COMPRES Annual Meeting"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1606856/1606856_10174811_1566339850953_AnnualMeetingTamaya--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="COMPRES Annual Meeting"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">There were approximately 110 participants at this year?s COMPRES Annual Meeting (group photo above).
