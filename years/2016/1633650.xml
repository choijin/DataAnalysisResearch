<AbstractNarration>Heart failure is a significant public health problem. Currently there are over five million Americans, predominantly older adults, suffering from heart failure. These patients are expected to follow complex medication regimen and self-management practices at home to stay healthy and prevent getting admitted to hospitals. A mobile application (HeartMapp) is proposed to act as a health coach by reminding patients to follow health care providers' recommendations at home. Decision making on heart failure symptoms are often confusing and challenging for patients. The HeartMapp offers automated feedback to patients based on the patients' weight, heart rate, and symptoms entered in HeartMapp. Thus, patients are alerted when symptoms are mild to take the next step and prevent worsening and readmissions. Under new regulations, if these patients are readmitted within 30-days after discharge from hospital, the hospitals are not reimbursed, as well as penalized if the readmission rates are higher than a government set limit. Reducing readmission penalty for heart failure will provide financial benefit for health care organizations by generating revenue. Therefore, hospitals are also interested in finding ways to keep patients engaged in their self-management. In order to make HeartMapp available, this project needs to better understand the complex health care ecosystem, i.e., all the players in this market, the customers and the value that HeartMapp provides to them, the users and buyers and the approval process, and the revenue streams and resources needed to make it happen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;HeartMapp is an easy to use non-pharmacological, non-invasive application developed with five main features as intervention options: 1) assessment of daily weight, blood pressure, and chronic heart failure (CHF) symptoms with automated feedback to enhance decision making for management of symptoms; 2) exercise including physical activity (walking) and deep breathing to improve physical health and well-being; 3) real time vital signs monitoring utilizing a wearable Bluetooth device; 4) CHF info that includes audio enabled interactive CHF education to improve knowledge; and 5) Stats, a graphical module that displays trends on patient performance. From the technical standpoint, HeartMapp is currently available in the Android platform but it needs to be updated and enhanced to include the features coming out of this I-Corps project and translated into other software platforms (iOS and Windows) to expand the customer base.  The current vision is to create a startup company or collaborate with an existing company to host the software and market the technology and license it to be included as part of existing solutions. The final report of I-Corps project will serve as a guiding document to: 1) submit a Phase I SBIR proposal in order to update the technology and test the HeartMapp for its efficacy in improving self-management of patients with CHF and thus potentially curb costly readmissions; 2) submit a Phase II SBIR proposal to take the technology to the market place; 3) Create a startup company or join an existing company interested in the commercialization of HeartMapp; and/or 4) find investors to provide the necessary funding to achieve our goals.</AbstractNarration>

We interviewed 125 potential customers. Our customer discovery process indicated that hospitals and home care agencies are exploring the use of novel technology, because current telemonitoring systems to track patient at home care are bulky, costly to maintain, and gives false hope to patients as being monitored and lack self-confidence in caring for themselves. The proof of concept was completed and results published (Athilingam, Jenkins, Zumpano, &amp; Labrador, 2017). Our team used an iterative process and completed a minimum viable product of the HeartMapp with seven key components to impact self-care of heart failure patients at home. The features of HeartMapp include: 1) assessment, 2) pill management, 3) exercises, 4) vital signs monitoring weight and blood pressure; 5) heart failure education (CHF info), 6) performance tracker (Stats), and 7) communications. The built-in algorithm in HeartMapp serve as a point of care system and provides alerts, automated feedback and cues for action to manage HF symptoms at home, follow provider recommendation on medication, diet and exercises, and thus improve quality of life and reduce costly readmissions. HeartMapp is copyrighted by USF and the two investigator (Drs. Athilingam and Labrador) who have developed HeartMapp. The next step is to submit proposal to NSF for a Partnership for Innovation Technology Transfer (PFI-TT) award to evaluate the feasibility and functional limitation of our innovative mobile health system &ldquo;HeartMapp&rdquo; and our identified market opportunity for commercialization.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 12/13/2017<br>      Modified by: Ponrathi&nbsp;R&nbsp;Athilingam</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Image         </div> <div class="galControls onePhoto" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation onePhoto" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1633650/1633650_10413510_1513179279440_Figure1HeartMappfeatures--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1633650/1633650_10413510_1513179279440_Figure1HeartMappfeatures--rgov-800width.jpg" title="HeartMapp features"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1633650/1633650_10413510_1513179279440_Figure1HeartMappfeatures--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="HeartMapp features"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Figure showing the seven components included in HeartMapp</div> <div class="imageCredit">Our team</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Ponrathi&nbsp;R&nbsp;Athilingam</div> <div class="imageTitle">HeartMapp features</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
