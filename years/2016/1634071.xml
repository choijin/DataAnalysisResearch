<AbstractNarration>This important project supports participants to attend a Gordon Research Conference (GRC) on relativity and gravitation at the intersection of both research and education. The conference topic is timely as it will take advantage of the tremendous enthusiasm that currently exists due to the announcement in February 2016 of the first ever detection of gravitational waves. It also occurs at a time when physicists are placing a concentrated effort on increasing the number of contemporary concepts that is taught to all undergraduates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The scope of this conference is uniquely ambitious due to the connections among the education focus, cutting edge physics research, and a commitment to make contemporary physics topics accessible to a broad spectrum of undergraduate students at diverse institutions. It will have over 20 speakers who are leaders in gravitation, relativity, the teaching of these topics, and/or physics education research. New avenues of cutting edge research will evolve as a result of bringing together leading researchers who work at the intersection of gravitation and education. The GRC provides an opportunity for others exploring issues relating to education in gravitation and relativity to contribute to the dialogue through evening poster sessions and informal. The plenary talks and the poster sessions ensure that a diverse set of perspectives are represented at the conference and that the entire community has a voice in the future teaching of relativity and gravitation. There is great potential for increased awareness of these issues, for new curriculum development efforts, and for new techniques for learning abstract concepts and assessment of learning.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Operational Summary  The Gordon Research Conference (GRC) on Physics Research &amp; Education was held at the Salve Regina in Newport, Rhode Island from June 5-10, 2016.   The meeting covered a variety of scientific topics and the content presented was highly rated by participants.    Conference Participants  The Conference had 69 participants. Scientists from academia represented 97% of the participants while attendees from government accounted for 3%. The meeting also attracted a strong mix of young investigators and senior scientists.  Students and post-docs accounted for 10% of all attendees. Approximately 28% of the participants at the 2016 meeting were women.   Conference Program  Albert Einstein published his first paper on gravitation and general relativity 100 years ago. Ten years earlier he had introduced special relativity. Physics, teaching and educational research related to these topics continue to expand both our understanding of nature and our knowledge about how we can teach them to a broad spectrum of students and the general public. Applications and technologies, such as the GPS, have shown that concepts which were thought to be only of academic interest have far reaching consequences that affect and influence the science community, the education of future scientists and engineers, and the general population. Relativity is about to be confronted by new experimental tests as the Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) explores the physics of black holes and neutron stars. As a result, Physics Education Researchers have focused some attention on the teaching and learning of relativity (special and general) and gravitation.    The presentations and posters at this conference described advances in the fields of relativity, gravitation and educational research on the teaching and learning of these topics.

Conference Feedback  Participants had an opportunity to provide feedback at the end of the Conference. The feedback collected from the meeting was extremely positive. Evaluations included numerous positive remarks regarding the well-chosen talks, the in-depth discussions, and that the students felt comfortable expressing their views with more experienced scientists.   GRC would like to thank the National Science Foundation for its continued support of the meetings.  The contributions received from the National Science Foundation have been critical to the success of the conferences and are having a measurable impact in advancing the frontiers of science worldwide.
