<AbstractNarration>The Research Experiences in Computational Science, Engineering, and Mathematics (RECSEM) REU site program at the University of Tennessee (UTK) directs a group of ten undergraduate students to explore the emergent interdisciplinary computational science models and techniques via a number of cohesive compute and data intensive applications. The RECSEM program complements the growing importance of computational sciences in many advanced degree programs and provides scientific understanding and discovery to undergraduates with an intellectual focus on research projects using high performance computing (HPC).  This program aims to deliver a real-world research experience to the students by partnering with teams of scientists engaged in scientific computing research at the National Institutes of Computational Sciences (NICS), the Innovative Computing Laboratory (ICL), and the Joint Institute for Computational Sciences (JICS) at UTK and Oak Ridge National Laboratory.   Additional international students supported by PI's partner universities in Hong Kong also participate in this program. Together the students of RECSEM work collaboratively to achieve their research tasks, and at the same time share a unique opportunity for trading academic experiences, scientific ideas, and cultural social activities in this ten week long program.  Thus, this REU site program supports the NSF's mission to promote the progress of science and to advance the national prosperity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This program is organized around a synergetic theme of ideas and practices those are common to many scientific applications.  The research projects are categorized in three interrelated areas of research interests: engineering applications, numerical mathematics, and linear algebraic software and tools.  The scope of work for these projects put emphasis on conducting software development, model implementation, and design and evaluation of numerical experiments under the guidance of a team of experts in each scientific domain.  Projects include computation in multi-scale materials science and biomechanics applications, simulation of traffic flow phenomena, implementation of high order parallel numerical schemes, and processing of images with different techniques and algorithms of machine learning and data analytics.  The students would have opportunities to perform large-scale scientific simulations on HPC clusters as well as world-class state-of-the-art supercomputers equipped with the latest hardware technologies provided by the Extreme Science and Engineering Discovery Environment (XSEDE) organization.  These latest computing units include graphical processing units (GPUs), multicore processors and the Intel Xeon Phi processors (MIC). This program is organized in four major stages: HPC training, research formulation, project action, and scientific reporting.  These stages aim to gradually assist the students towards finishing their research projects in time with appropriate level of motivation and guidance.</AbstractNarration>

In particular, the highlights of the program have been summarized in the followings:  A      well-defined step-by-step timeline leading to the end of the program was      in place in early February. The      participants were selected based on three major factors: the nature of      their home colleges, their interests and background, and their letters of      intent and references.  The      project assignments were sent to students ahead of time.  The      first deliverable which comprised of a preliminary presentation and the      approaches of the research topic was the most important cornerstone of the      10-week program.   Housing      for students had to be prepared in the early stage of the program. The      entire group stayed together in the arranged housing to get them to blend      together socially. The PI,      Kwai Wong, had a short meeting with the entire group of students for 15      minutes at the start of a day. Co-locating      all students, graduate students, and the PI in the same floor greatly      enhanced the cohesiveness of the program A list      of safety reminders, health concerns, and emergency contact information      was discussed in detail in the first day. A local      student was assigned to serve as the site lead to the group, particularly      for social activities. Each      student began drafting a research plan under the direction of his/her      mentor and kept a weekly research summary log.   A      detailed checkout list for each student and a meeting with each student      before the program closure. Surveys      for the students were performed at the start of the program and at the end      of the program.           Last Modified: 05/18/2021       Submitted by: Kwai L Wong]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
