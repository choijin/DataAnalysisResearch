<AbstractNarration>CBET 1653054 - (Zhu)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a grant in partial support of a two-day workshop focusing on defining a vision and roadmap for the next generation building design environment for sustainability and to foster a community of academic researchers and industry practitioners for realizing the vision. Researchers and practitioners in architectural design, engineering, construction, computer sciences, psychology, physiology and cognitive science will be identified and invited to attend the workshop. Three topics will be covered by the workshop:  design for sustainability, human sensations and behavior, and computing and mediation. Keynote presentations, topical presentations, panel discussions and breakout sessions will be organized for the workshop. A project website will be developed and maintained to share the workshop information before and after the workshop.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The questions to be addressed at the workshop include: What can be learned from the evolution of building design environments or tools, from manual drafting, CAD, to now integrated design environments such as building information modeling (BIM)? If CAD is disruptive to manual drafting technologies because of its efficiency and accuracy just like interoperability and integration are the reasons for BIM to be disruptive to CAD, what are the features that the next generation of disruptive building design technologies should have? Answers to these questions will potentially bring about significant changes to future building designs for sustainability. Currently, although elements of technologies have already existed such as immersive virtual environments, lighting simulation, acoustic simulation, energy simulation, and climate control technologies, there are still technical and knowledge gaps that prevent researchers and practitioners from realizing the vision. Therefore, the workshop will provide a unique opportunity for researchers and practitioners to conceptualize a novel framework and develop a practical roadmap for future building design environments.</AbstractNarration>
