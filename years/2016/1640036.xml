<AbstractNarration>The underrepresentation of women of color in computing is an acute challenge in the spectrum of underrepresentation in computing in the United States. The study, Integrating Computing Education into a National Girls Empowerment Program, offers pedagogical innovation in computing while leveraging emphasis on the cultural grounding of young women of color. Educational innovation alone - in modes of instruction and curricular innovation - has proven insufficient in increasing the number of women in computing fields and earning undergraduate degrees in computer science.  The study is an effort to further develop understanding of the interplay between gender empowerment and computing education to increase the participation and success of girls of color in computing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Infusing music as the cornerstone of computing education is an effective learning tool. Doing so in a manner that is embedded in a girls empowerment program is a novel experiential exercise. Establishing the intellectual framework for integrating computing education and gender empowerment is a significant contribution to the computing education community.  The pre-existence of a national empowerment program in which to conduct the learning experiment presents significant potential for broader impact and increased participation of young women of color in computing.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In an era of declining women's participation in computer science and acutely low participation of women of color, there is increasing awareness of stereotype threats and the barriers to gender and racial equity in computer science. Mitigating those threats and lowering those barriers are two of the primary challenges faced by the research, education and advocacy communities. Encouraging, building, and nurturing positive identities, growth mindset, and solid knowledge and skills are key aspects of combating stereotype threat and supporting a lasting interest in STEM. Studies have shown that providing girls with a unique educational environment that does not align with the stereotype fit, or feelings of exclusion, allows them to shift from a "fixed mindset" to a "growth mindset: (Dweck, 2007). The GIRLS ROCK TECH (GRT) program is an innovative experiential approach to learning computer science principles of programming and creativity in the context of music education and strong culturally resonant structures.  Through GRT, we investigated how combining computer science principles with an existing powerful model of cultural awareness and empowerment might drive technical skill-building and mentorship among black women and girls.  The bedrock of the GRT curriculum incorporated girls? ideas about empowerment and identity around cultural markers such as "black girl magic" and intersectionality.  An additional feature of the GRT curriculum is inclusion of black women mentors (students and professionals) to help build a community of support for the girls.  This program included four instructors: two who led the computer science component and two who led the leadership development component.  The GRT curriculum also served as a foundation for the subsequent and ongoing BRIGHT-CS Project (NSF #1752436) project, which is building a CS ecosystem for black girls, with programming in NYC and Northern Virginia school systems.    Best Practices  Two outcomes of note are that: 1) who is teaching students and matters (and the quality of those interactions is important), and 2) encourage a co-planning &amp; co-teaching instructor model.  GRT program instructors were black women, which helped the girls to see what thriving in leadership and tech could look like.  That does not mean that black girls do not learn from instructors who do not look like them.  Rather, this experience underscores the importance of role models for students who look like them.  GRT instructors enjoyed lunch with campers, taught content that matters but is often unexplored for girls of color (like colorism and mindfulness), provided safe spaces for self-expression and reflection, and connected the in-class work to real-world experiences.  This format was rich in experiential learning and created bonds that supported strong tie development, showing the girls that instructors were invested in their success.   GRT provided a learning experience for two groups of students: middle school were in one section and high school students were in another.  Each section had two instructors (1 leadership and 1 CS), and they could attend the other's section.  This helped instructors connect on content, and it provided a longer-term touchpoint with students that lasted throughout the day, not just during an instructor's particular section.  This created a sense of genuine interest with the girls and also helped to set the tone for expected behavior and mutual respect.  Intellectual Merit  The contributions of this project stem from integrating computer science education into an existing, robust community of support for black women and girls.  More specifically, the contributions of this work are two-fold: 1) a model of culturally-relevant computer science education that is tailored to black girls; 2) an executed pilot that informs follow-up work with a broader community of students and professionals.    Broader Impacts  For this project, we sought to combine principles of leadership development with computer science education to gain insights and best practices into approaches specifically designed to support black girls.  While GRT has ended, we continue to add to the scholarly work of culturally-relevant models for CS learning.  We have also advanced, begun, or continued our partnerships with organizations like blackcomputeHER (blackcomputeHER.org), Black Girls ROCK! (blackgirlsrock.com), UNCG, and VT's Thinkabit Lab, as well as NYC and Arlington schools.       Last Modified: 05/26/2019       Submitted by: Jamika D Burge]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
