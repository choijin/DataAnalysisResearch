<AbstractNarration>This project aims at determining the impact of providing temporary financial assistance to those at risk of homelessness on several important outcomes: homelessness, housing stability, and crime. The investigators will evaluate a Homelessness Prevention Call Center (HPCC) in a major U.S. city to determine how this assistance impacts these outcomes. This project will test whether those receiving temporary financial assistance are less likely to become homeless, move, or be arrested. The investigators will further examine whether the cost of reducing homelessness and improving other outcomes through financial assistance is outweighed by the benefits. Therefore, this research will allow policymakers to make more informed decisions when allocating limited resources to reduce homelessness, putting resources towards the most effective programs. Moreover, this project will examine how this prevention service impacts different types of recipients, so the results will importantly inform service providers who run these call centers. Providers can also make more informed choices, targeting emergency funding to those most likely to benefit from them, which will improve the cost effectiveness of homelessness prevention programs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is the first quasi-experimental study to examine the impact of temporary financial assistance on homelessness, housing stability, and crime. While the gold standard in impact evaluation is a randomized controlled trial study, this is challenging in homeless policy studies because the population being served is both extremely vulnerable and highly mobile. These factors make keeping track of recipients of programming difficult and costly.  Consequently,  there  is  only  limited  information  about  the  impact  of  homelessness prevention  programs.  Thus,  this research  fills  an  important  gap  in  the  literature  on  the  effect  of homelessness prevention programs. This project is possible because of the unique way in which the HPCC connects eligible callers with financial assistance, and because of a rich set of outcomes available through several different administrative data sources. This research will be informative not only to scholars who study housing programs, but also to policymakers and program managers who struggle to decide how best to distribute limited resources among prevention and treatment services to address the  issue  of  homelessness.</AbstractNarration>

This study evaluated a homelessness prevention call center in a major U.S. city to determine how this assistance impacts these outcomes. The results (pre-grant phase) indicate that temporary financial assistance significantly decreases the incidence of homeless shelter entry. In this current phase of the study, the PIs extended this analysis and examined the impact of financial assistance on other key outcomes for this vulnerable population. The PIs tested the hypothesis that those receiving temporary financial assistance are less likely to be arrested. The call center connects families and individuals who are at risk of homelessness with assistance, but the availability of funding varies unpredictably. Consequently, the PIs can determine the impact of temporary assistance on crime by comparing outcomes for those who call when funds are available to those who call when no funds are available. The PIs found that the availability of financial assistance led to a decline in overall crime. For violent crime, those who call when funds are available are 55 percent less likely to be arrested by police, with single individuals driving this decrease. The decline in crime appears to be related, in part, to greater housing stability&mdash;access to financial assistance significantly decreases arrests for homelessness-related, outdoor crimes such as trespassing. However, the study also shows that financial assistance leads to an increase in property crime arrests. This increase is evident for family heads, but not single individuals; the increase is mostly due to shoplifting; and the timing of this increase suggests that financial assistance enables some families to take on financial obligations that they are subsequently unable to meet.
