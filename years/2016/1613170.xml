<AbstractNarration>Roughly speaking, game theory aims to determine the best that two parties can do, separately or together, in contests in which each attempts to achieve an objective that may be at least partially contradictory to that of the other. Games (contests) involving more than two parties are more complicated, but the analysis of large-population games improves our understanding of complex systems in finance, economics, and engineering that are otherwise difficult to analyze. On the other hand, improved understanding of model uncertainty in finance leads to a better management of risk. This research project explores mathematical questions in these areas and aims to develop new mathematical tools, inspired by applications in mathematical finance.  Graduate students and post-doctoral researchers are directly involved in the work. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There have been some exciting developments in stochastic control inspired by finance and economics in recent years: Financial modeling with model uncertainty led to some new problems in optimal transport theory (namely the martingale optimal transport). The super-hedging problems led to the geometric dynamic programming principle, and the analysis of Nash equilibria of games with a large number of players each having a very little influence on the overall system led to the theory of mean field games. This research project aims to contribute to these developments by providing some new mathematical tools and studying some new questions motivated by applications. The project aims to further advance understanding of financial mathematics with model uncertainty, the geometric dynamic programming principle, randomization approaches to stochastic control, and mean field type control problems and mean field games.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    This research contributes mainly to the burgeoning field of mathematical finance, which is mainly interested in quantifying and managing risk. There has been an intense research effort in order to develop rigorous mathematical tools to analyze these real world problems which takes its roots in stochastic analysis and also frequently interacts with other fields of mathematics such as the theory of partial differential equations and functional analysis. The  principal investigator tackled some of the fundamental questions concerning the important models of the field that remain unanswered: in particular in analyzing games (especially many player games) as well as developing tools for problems with model uncertainty, and considering the stability of models and developing numerical tools.   Analyzing large population games improves our understanding of complex systems in economics, which are otherwise very difficult to analyze. On the other hand, improved understanding model uncertainty in finance leads to a better management of unknown unknowns. These effort here lead to some technical advances statistics, games, stochastic control and martingale optimal theory.  The problems analyzed here helped the career development of several young researchers: Ph.D. students and post-doctoral associates, who either went on to succesful industry careers in finance or stayed in academia and ended up in top universities.
