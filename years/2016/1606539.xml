<AbstractNarration>This three-year project is to enable the participation of distinguished U.S. scientists at the VarSITI (Variability of the Sun and Its Terrestrial Impact) Meetings during 2016-2018.  The VarSITI program is sponsored by the SCOSTEP (Scientific Committee on Solar-Terrestrial Physics) and it promotes international collaboration of solar-terrestrial researchers in data analysis, modeling, and theory to improve our understanding of how the solar variability affects the Earth.  The related Meetings during 2016-2018 will serve as venues to discuss recent results on VarSITI-related projects, exchange ideas, and educate the next generation of solar-terrestrial researchers on integrated system's science.  This three-year project supports the Strategic Goals of the AGS Division in discovery, learning, diversity, and interdisciplinary research.</AbstractNarration>
