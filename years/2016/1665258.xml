<AbstractNarration>Nature often encapsulates highly reactive molecules within an environment that offers protection from unwanted reactions. The goal of this research is to prepare similar encapsulation devices (micelles) that are made from plastics and are capable of protecting their pharmaceutical drug "cargoes" until they reach their destination in the human body.  This project is funded by the Chemical Synthesis Program of the Chemistry Division. Professors Marcetta Y. Darensbourg and Donald J. Darensbourg of Texas A&amp;M University are preparing the plastic micelles from the abundant gas, carbon dioxide. Since the micelles are biodegradable, they fall apart in living organisms and slowly release their drug cargo. One of the specific systems to be investigated involves entrapping nitric oxide (NO)-releasing drugs. Nitric oxide is implicated in vasoregulation and immune function. The broader impact of this work is to heighten students' awareness of the roles chemists play in issues of societal importance, like medicine. Professor Marcetta Darensbourg and her group are leaders in programs such as Women in Science and Engineering, Broadening Horizons for 6th Grade Girls, and the Chemistry Olympiad.  These activities reach out to school children in the Bryan/College Station communities. Professor Donald Darensbourg focuses on carbon dioxide utilization and its impacts on carbon management. He develops courses and education materials on Green Chemistry for advanced undergraduates in chemistry and chemical engineering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project focuses on the preparation of triblock, "ABA", polycarbonates that, on addition of water, self-assemble into micelles as the A blocks are hydrophilic and the B blocks are hydrophobic. The hydrophobic interiors of the micelles are loaded with molecular payloads of pharmaceutical potential, binding either by non-covalent van der Waals interactions or by covalent attachment. Syntheses and full characterization of the polymers are conducted. The protection of reactive NO-release drugs within the hydrophobic region of a biodegradable micelle may tune and control NO delivery in biological/pharmaceutical applications. Chemical assays and cell studies (cytotoxicity and cell uptake) test this assumption and compare dinitrosyl iron complexes of NO release ability in solution and imbedded within the micelles. Further, the synthesis of polymer immobilized diiron complexes, linked by cyanide to metallo-porphyrin photosensitizers are oriented towards development as hydrogen production catalysts, initially in the absence of water. The research team looks for the stabilization of the fragile diiron or nickel-iron complexes by attachment to (organic solvent) soluble polymers, generating base metal, organometallic catalysts protected from oxygen degradation and aggregation.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Broader Impact and Intellectual Merit:  The main attributes of a scientist are a curious nature, an honest and deep search for the truth, and a desire to place observations within a knowledge base in a manner that builds and expands, or perhaps in cases, even disrupts that base.  The National Science Foundation has funded projects in which D.J. Darensbourg searched for ways to advance the molecular chemistry of carbon dioxide as a renewable direct feedstock for the synthesis of polymers.  His research has addressed the curious possibility that carbon dioxide, the most oxidized form of carbon that is greatly over produced by mankind, might actually be fed into a synthetic chemical loop for the production of useful materials. During the granting period he published 17 manuscripts in scientific journals that chronicled advances in design and in properties of the new polymers, enlarging the knowledge base in this area.   Curious that those polymers might be engineered to have capability to bind metal-containing ?payloads?, the M.Y. Darensbourg targeted two areas related to her expertise in bioinorganic chemistry: a) iron complexes of nitric oxide as NO-releasing agents, mimicking natural storage units in human physiology; and b) bimetallic complexes of iron and nickel that serve as models of hydrogen-producing or hydrogen-uptake catalysts in nature.  While fundamental principles could be teased out of the small molecules, both of these applications have drawbacks.  While the nitric oxide releasing molecules present a safer alternative than NO gas as a therapeutic of importance for vascular relaxation malfunction, the release rate must be controlled, either chemically or by some packaging process because excess NO has extremely deleterious effects.  Nature manages it within proteins.  Likewise, the small molecules of the hydrogenase enzyme active sites need protection from a competing reagent, oxygen.  In both of these areas, the MYD group has identified the molecules that perform, readying them for control by the polymer matrix.  ?  Dinitrosyl iron complexes tethered to sulfur-containing biomolecules were isolated, chemically characterized and explored for their toxicity to smooth muscle cells and for their ability to serve as precursors for release NO into smooth muscle cells.  The strategies for development of the Nitric Oxide Release Molecules or NORM?s were defined so as to identify toxicity, degradation, and conditions under which the small molecules had best responses.    Biological assays addressed the influence of the dinitrosyl iron complexes on immune response, and a fluorometric assay addressed whether NO from such sources were carried into the cells.  The connection of such DNICs to polymers involves synthesis that places comparable binding sites to those of the small molecules so that a transfer of the Fe(NO)2 unit may take place.  These were produced in the DJD laboratory. The foundation has been laid for the next steps which involve extensive in vitro and in vivo characterizations, which must be performed by biological experts.  ?  The hydrogen processing electrocatalysts synthesized by the MYD coworkers are clearly of relevance to the replacement of the resource-limited platinum that is currently used in fuel cells.  Small molecule models were designed to lead into synthetic catalysts for hydrogen production from protons and electrons.  The guidance of metal and base internal sites for proton shuttling as electrons are added in specific step by step ways was worked out in a way that chemists do best:  systematic modifications.    ?  Tackling the problem of oxygen sensitivity in molecular electrocatalysts, this group found inspiration in nature where it is well known that the replacement of a single sulfur in one of the cysteines that bind to nickel and iron with selenocysteine improves oxygen tolerance; i.e., the oxygen damaged biocatalysts can be naturally repaired.  While well-known from biological studies, small molecule mimics of the hydrogenase active had not been known until the MYD graduate student and three undergraduates produced small molecule NiFeS and NiFeSe and clearly showed that it was the chalcogens themselves that prevented degradation of these molecules in the presence of oxygen.  The Chalcogens themselves took on the oxygen rather than allowing the metals to be irreversibly damaged.  Three manuscripts recorded the intricate syntheses and characterization of the oxygen-uptake products, which could influence design of hydrogen producing molecular catalysts to include the ?anti-oxidant? element, selenium.
