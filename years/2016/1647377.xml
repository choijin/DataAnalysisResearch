<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is the development of a first-in-class patient education tool. The project aims to develop a method to customize and personalize the delivery of medical content with the goal of influencing medication compliance and health outcomes. Imagine patients are discharged from the hospital and understand their discharge instructions. Imagine patients fill a list of ten medications but understand what they are for and why they need to take them. Imagine patients recently diagnosed with cancer that do not feel embarrassed to ask their doctor questions. Imagine parents caring for sick children or older children caring for elderly parents that feel assured of their ability to get the best care for loved ones. Imagine a reduction in sick days, hospital readmission rates, and morbidity and mortality rates. Imagine an overall improvement in the quality of care and health of the nation all due to the simple ingredients of patient understanding and patient empowerment. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project will produce a novel tool to deliver medical content to patients based of an assessment of their limiting beliefs and perceptions. It has long been established that the effectiveness of medical interventions aimed at changing behavior are limited by patient's perceptions and beliefs. The proposed project will result in the development of novel algorithms that use machine-learning (ML) based techniques to determine limiting beliefs. The goal is to customize patient education and medical content to the beliefs, perception, and language of the patients.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Healthcare systems operate under the assumption that all patients have adequate health literacy skills and can function as vigilant advocates of their health. The reality stands in stark contrast.   As a result of the NSF Phase I SBIR proposal we have developed a semi-automated method to extract medical content and present it to patients at multiple vocabulary levels.  This method allows a reader to make connections between multiple difficult words in a sentence at an expert reading level with those same words presented at a basic reading level. Being able to see, make connections, and understand words over time can help improve literacy and comprehension.  How does this work? A patient will be presented with a question 'What are the parts of the heart?' and answer 'The heart is divided into four chambers: upper left and right atria, and lower left and right ventricles.' The answer is at a high technical level with words like 'ventricles' and 'atria'. The patient is presented with the option to adjust the reading level of the sentence to basic or moderate reading levels and now 'ventricles' becomes 'lower chamber of the heart' and 'atria' becomes 'upper chamber of the heart'.  The work accomplished in this proposal enables additional content to be generated at multiple vocabulary levels. This means that we can expand the content to other medical specialties while reducing the amount of human effort that is required.   This technology has the potential to serve as a public good by making highly technical fields understandable, reducing communication barriers, and empowering patients and all readers alike.  This technology has the potential to help society at large and has even more potential to the serve poor and disadvantaged communities.
