<AbstractNarration>This award provides partial travel support for US based participants of the workshop on Symplectic Homology to be held on August 8 - 12, 2016, at the Humboldt University, Berlin. Symplectic geometry is the fundamental geometry underlying classical mechanics and dynamics. The set of possible states of a macroscopic physical system is described by a symplectic manifold, and the geometry of this symplectic manifold is essential for understanding how the physical system evolves over time. Symplectic field theory (SFT), initiated in 2000 by Eliashberg-Givental-Hofer, is a major program for understanding symplectic geometry by counting pseudoholomorphic curves (a kind of area-minimizing surfaces) in symplectic manifolds, and performing these counts by cutting symplectic manifolds into simpler pieces. Since 2005, a series of workshops on particular aspects of SFT has been held at various locations in Germany, and these workshops have played a key role in the development of the subject. Each such workshop consists of a week of mini-courses, research lectures, and discussions, preceded by a weekend of introductory courses reviewing necessary background material. In August 2016, the eighth SFT workshop will be held in Berlin, and this grant will provide travel support to enable junior US-based participants to participate in the workshop.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The specific topic of the workshop is symplectic homology. In the past decade, symplectic homology has emerged as a central tool in symplectic and contact geometry and topology, with a number of spectacular applications. The uses of symplectic homology include distinguishing exotic Stein structures and contact structures, detecting Reeb orbits of vector fields, and obstructing Lagrangian cobordisms. In addition, a closely related invariant, the wrapped Fukaya category, plays an essential role in recent developments in mirror symmetry. This workshop will bring together the major recent advances in the structure and applications of symplectic homology, in an in-depth and coordinated manner, in order to form this vital subject into a coherent whole and make it accessible to a wider audience. The centerpiece of the workshop will consist of mini-courses by Tobias Ekholm on the Legendrian surgery formula and its applications, Alexandru Oancea on the symplectic Eilenberg-Steenrod axioms, and Mark McLean on wrapped Floer cohomology and affine varieties. In addition there will be five research lectures and a weekend precourse with six background talks. Sending US participants to this workshop will enable US mathematicians to keep up with the latest developments in symplectic geometry and contribute to the future of the subject.

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Symplectic geometry is the fundamental geometry underlying classical mechanics. It is related to physical questions such as: Is the solar system stable? How can one send a space mission to Mars most efficiently?   A very important tool for proving results in symplectic geometry is called "symplectic homology". Symplectic homology was originally introduced in the 1990s, but has only in the last decade emerged as a central topic and essential tool in symplectic geometry. A number of different versions of symplectic homology have been developed, with numerous applications, for example to detecting periodic behavior in various dynamical systems.   In August 2016, a workshop was held in Berlin, called "Symplectic Field Theory VIII" (the eighth in a series of workshops in Germany on different aspects of symplectic geometry), in order to consolidate the recent developments in symplectic homology and to make the tools and results accessible to as wide an audience as possible. The workshop brought together an international group of 119 participants, including the leading experts in the subject. There was a week of minicourses and research lectures, preceded by a weekend precourse reviewing essential background material. This grant provided full or partial funding for 22 early-career US-based mathematicians to participate in the workshop, of whom 7 were women or members of underrepresented groups.   As a result of this grant, these 22 early-career US mathematicians were able to keep up with the latest developments in symplectic geometry, and to bring their acquired knowledge back to a broad swathe of US universities.
