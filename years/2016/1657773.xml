<AbstractNarration>This doctoral dissertation research project will analyze how, where, and to what degree clandestine activities influence urban expansion.  The doctoral student will develop and test methods that can be used to identify actions associated with urban development for actions not in the common interest, such as urban expansion within environmentally sensitive areas that increases flooding, decreases water supplies, and has other adverse impacts.  The project will enhance understanding of the outcomes of urban conditions that disadvantage some segments of the population, and project findings will provide new information and insights that can be used by governmental officials, non-governmental organizations, community groups, and urban residents to better understand and respond to environmental threats posed by clandestine activities.  The project will facilitate meaningful interactions among academic, governmental, and community-based organizations.  As a Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement award, this award also will provide support to enable a promising student to establish a strong independent research career.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Clandestine activities profoundly influence urbanization worldwide, often with significant adverse environmental consequences.  Such forms of urbanization have proven difficult to measure and observe, however, and processes though which they have functioned have been ignored in land-system analysis.  As a result, clandestine, informal urbanization remains largely invisible in urban planning and is difficult for formal government to regulate.  To conduct this project, the doctoral student will employ advanced computing and satellite imagery analyses and will conduct intensive ethnographic work to make explicit the links between detectable landscape patterns and the clandestine processes creating them.  She will examine the clandestine land transactions that influence urbanization at a parcel or community level and test hypotheses to determine if such activity can be detected on a landscape scale.  The student will gather and assess socio-environmental data from a range of sources, including interviews with key actors, remote sensing of urban change, digitized and geo-referenced land-use records where local government has incorporated informal urbanization into legal property registries, and ancillary data regarding voting and urban service provision.  She will employ three different kinds of modeling approaches to test for the significance of clandestine variables on urbanization patterns.  Although this doctoral dissertation research project will focus on development in Mexico City, the research will provide new insights and approaches for dealing with informal development related to clandestine activity in many other nations, including the United States.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>My Doctoral Dissertation Research Award explores the dynamics of informal urbanization in Mexico City. I conducted extensive ethnographic data by interviewing people who are selling, buying, and building on conservation land. I also interviewed government officials who are supposed to regulate the process of preventing urbanization, and others who provide access to services or give out formal land titles. I found that all informal urban communities I visited in field work were supported by a powerful actor who was gaining either politically or economically by providing land or services to residents. In some cases, this person was a politician or involved in a political party, and in others, this person was an intermediary who was taking advantage of marginalized informal settlers who did not know their rights and felt unable to defend themselves. This intermediary often was providing illegal access to electricity or water, and would threaten informal settlers with eviction or violence if they did not pay fees for their services.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>This award enabled me to digitize and georeference over 6,000 land titles where informal land has become formalized by the Mexico City government on private land form 1997-2012 as well as electoral voting data over that same period. I found that 25% of land titles were granted in conservation land. &nbsp;I also found that on average 175 more land titles were given out right before the election (within 2&nbsp; months) in election years, and even more titles during presidential election years and during the period when Andres Manual Lopez Obrador (the current Mexico President) was mayor from 2000-2006. Land titles were also distributed to the electoral districts that voted for the mayoral party in power. This indicates that politics plays a significant role in who gets access to land titles, and when these titles are given.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>I also analyzed urbanization in conservation land from 2000-2015 using data from the Mexico City Ministry of the Environment. I found that 3,300 hectares of land had been urbanized during that time period. When comparing urbanization growth rates to electoral voting patterns across 4 elections, I found that urban growth accelerated in more competitive electoral districts in some parts of the city where a high percentage of the population lives in informal settlements. This indicates that political parties may be influencing urban growth by giving away construction materials, blocking evictions, providing access to services, and other activities to attract votes from residents and thereby encourage urban growth.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Through this project, I also trained 5 Mexican undergraduate students in data digitization and geolocation. They gained new geographic information skills, and two of these students are now using these skills in their current job. Student commented that this project helped them build skills to make them more competitive candidates.</p> <p>I shared these preliminary results in a seminar at the National Autonomous University of Mexico in March 2018. I plan to translate a summary of my results into Spanish, and am planning a trip to Mexico City in May 2019 to share results in a forum with residents of informal settlements and government ministries.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>I am preparing these results for publication, and will make available the land titling and election data I digitized for other researchers to use. These publications will contribute to land use and urban planning by showing a novel analysis of the different types of informal urban growth and the actors that reinforce the subsequent land patterns created. It will also contribute to land use change science and geography by showing how illegal behavior and corruption patterns can be analyzed by combining land use with electoral data. This project contributes to sustainability science by showing how data can be used to understand and better regulate hidden behavior that influences how and where cities grow.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 12/06/2018<br>      Modified by: Beth&nbsp;Tellman</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1657773/1657773_10479454_1544105705344_xochihome--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1657773/1657773_10479454_1544105705344_xochihome--rgov-800width.jpg" title="House in the Chinampas"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1657773/1657773_10479454_1544105705344_xochihome--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="House in the Chinampas"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Home illegally built on the chinampas, a UNESCO wetland world heritage site where ancient Aztec agricultural practice still occur in Southern Mexico City</div> <div class="imageCredit">Beth Tellman</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Royalty-free (unrestricted use)</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Beth&nbsp;Tellman</div> <div class="imageTitle">House in the Chinampas</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1657773/1657773_10479454_1544105616117_salesign--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1657773/1657773_10479454_1544105616117_salesign--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Land for Sale Sign"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1657773/1657773_10479454_1544105616117_salesign--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Land for Sale Sign"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">A sign of land for sale in conservation land with the location and the size of the plot and phone number of the seller.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Beth Tellman</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Beth&nbsp;Tellman</div> <div class="imageTitle">Land for Sale Sign</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1657773/1657773_10479454_1544106033873_electoraldynamics--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1657773/1657773_10479454_1544106033873_electoraldynamics--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Time series of Land Titling (Regularization)"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1657773/1657773_10479454_1544106033873_electoraldynamics--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Time series of Land Titling (Regularization)"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Regularization of area and number of lots over time.
