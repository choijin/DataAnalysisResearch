<AbstractNarration>Marco Caricato, of the University of Kansas is supported by an award from the Chemical Theory, Models and Computational Methods program in the Division of Chemistry to develop new theoretical models and corresponding computer software to simulate the interaction between light and matter in chiral solids.   The proposal is jointly funded by the NSF EPSCoR Office and the Office of Advanced Cyberinfrastructure.  Chiral objects are non-superimposable mirror images of each other (e.g., left and right hands).   Chiral molecules are ubiquitous in nature and chirality has profound implications in chemistry and biology.    Chiral molecules have the ability to rotate plane-polarized light and are said to be "optically active". Despite two hundred years of research from the first discovery of optical activity, we are still not able to understand the correlation between the molecular structure of a chiral crystal and its response to light. Dr. Caricato's research provides such deeper understanding through theoretical simulations.  The theoretical methods are being implemented in computer codes that will be available to the community as an open source computational module.  The methods will also be integrated into Gaussian, a very widely-used and well-maintained quantum chemistry software package.  This research may also lead to technological breakthroughs in materials science, as chiral materials are becoming increasingly popular for applications in catalysis, molecular recognition, and electronics.   Dr. Caricato's outreach program aims to bring computational chemistry into the high school classroom in Kansas.  Computer simulations have enormous educational potential in this technological age, and the modules created by Dr. Caricato in collaboration with local high school teachers provide students with an active learning experience aimed at stimulating their enthusiasm for science and their interest in pursuing further training in STEM disciplines.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The main goals of Dr. Caricato's project are: 1) to develop truly first principles quantum mechanical methods for the calculation of optical rotation (OR) in extended systems; 2) to investigate structure-property relations in ordered optically active materials. Measurements of the optical rotation tensor in solids are missing a physical interpretation based on theoretical simulations. This is a significant drawback as these measurements can explicitly provide the entire optical rotation tensor, and thus lend themselves to a direct comparison with calculations. This project aims to extend the predictive power of OR calculations with density functional theory from the molecular to the supramolecular scale. New approaches for qualitative analysis are being developed that will help reveal the elusive structure-property relations in optically active materials, both in terms of intra- and inter-molecular interactions. Moreover, Dr. Caricato's methods allow interpreting and predicting ECD spectra, which are a primary tool for the characterization of chiral self-assembled materials. Therefore, this project has the potential to significantly impact the characterization and design of such materials. Dr. Caricato's efforts may open new avenues for technological advances due to the increasing importance of supramolecular self-assembled chiral materials in electronics, molecular recognition, sensing, and chi optical switching.</AbstractNarration>
