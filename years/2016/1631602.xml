<AbstractNarration>Increasingly, nonprofits and corporations have created partnerships to address a variety of social issues. The partnerships can take many forms including philanthropy, cause marketing, brand certification, and collective impact arrangements. Through communication, the contours of the partnership are made known to different stakeholder groups thereby influencing attitudes, intention to purchase, intention to donate, and intention to engage in activism. The research examines both activists and consumers' reactions to a variety of messages about corporate-NGO partnerships by using a series of three on-line experiments to map both consumers and activists' mental models of corporations and NGOs. This project fulfills three important objectives: (1) to further our understanding of the impact of communicated NGO-corporate partnerships on consumers and activists' attitudes, intention to purchase, intention to donate, and intention to engage in activism, (2) to understand the ways that such messages might overcome initially incongruent pairings through the inclusion of or exclusion of certain message characteristics, and (3) to understand how the different forms of NGO-corporate partnership may moderate these relationships.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The intellectual merit of this project is three-fold. First, it contributes to the study of semantic networks by investigating factors that shape how individuals' mental models evolve to incorporate new information. Second, this project extends previous marketing research on brand pairings to include a broader spectrum of social issues, stakeholders beyond consumers (i.e., activists), and multiple types of NGO-corporate partnerships. Third, it contributes to a broad-based understanding of the network of NGO-corporate partnerships through its testing of theoretically driven propositions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: This research offers three broader impacts for educational, policy and industry sectors. First, the project advances social science and computer science interdisciplinary collaboration and innovation by bringing together undergraduate and graduate student researchers. As such, it aims to train a new generation of students in scientific methods. Second, the findings will illuminate why some nonprofits are less likely to be supported by public funding thus allowing policymakers to make informed decisions about which social issues could be turned over to private funding sources and which will continue to need taxpayer support. Third, as companies seek to improve relationships with consumers and limit risk exposure from activists, the findings will offer industry leaders information regarding how communication influences stakeholders support of partnerships.</AbstractNarration>

Finally, we find that activists are more persuaded by rationales for the partnership than individuals who are less likely to engage in corporate activism. This grant makes five contributions to current scholarship by addressing gaps in corporate social responsibility communication, nonprofit research, and semantic network analysis research.   Semantic network analysis has most often examined the proximity of words in a text (see Shumate et al. 2013), and has found application in the study of big data and online communities. We incorporated semantic networks into each of the experimental design. In doing so, this research creates new insights into factors that shape semantic networks.     In contrast to previous research on brand pairings, this research builds on Shumate and O?Connor?s (2010a) work examining companies in varied economic industries and nonprofits that address a variety of social issues. Such research is important because it enhances the generalizability of the work.   This research expands the empirical tests of the PIs Symbiotic Sustainability Model (see Shumate &amp; O?Connor, 2010b). Previous research has verified several of the propositions of this theory (Shumate &amp; O?Connor, 2010a). However, this grant provided the first empirical support for the outcomes of various types of communicative constructions of these partnerships by examining two previously untested propositions.   The research examined how both consumers and activists react to messages about NGO-corporate partnerships. Previously, only consumers have been empirically examined. Through the inclusion of activists, this research examines an important, yet unstudied, external stakeholders group and assesses how stakeholders differ in their reaction to messages about the partnerships and what explains these differences.
