<AbstractNarration>The extraordinary successes achieved in the last years by bioinformatics, structural biology,&lt;br/&gt;and functional studies of proteins have produced an unprecedented amount of data that holds&lt;br/&gt;promise to shed light on the workings of these molecular machines. Paradoxically these successes&lt;br/&gt;highlighted the fact that sequence, structure and function are linked together in a more subtle&lt;br/&gt;and complex way than previously thought. Specifically, protein families with recognizable&lt;br/&gt;sequence homology and strictly conserved architecture can show a huge functional heterogeneity,&lt;br/&gt;as in the case of voltage-gated-like ion channels (VGLCs).  The project's goal is to define a coherent theoretical framework to analyse both&lt;br/&gt;ensembles of structures and sequences and apply it to the study of ion channel communications. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project proposes to use the Blue Waters system to address this problem using a combination of  accurate free-energy&lt;br/&gt;MD calculations and statistical inference analysis of both trajectories and large multiple&lt;br/&gt;sequence alignment. The microscopic determinants of mechanical coupling will be identified&lt;br/&gt;with the set of residue-residue interactions that are conserved along evolution and are responsible&lt;br/&gt;for a specific, functionally oriented structural dynamics. The study will focus on two specific&lt;br/&gt;ion channels families gated by different stimuli: transient receptor potential channels and&lt;br/&gt;voltage gated cation channels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project, if successful, will bridge the gap in our understanding of molecular processes and neuronal responses, with the potential of significantly advancing large-scale initiatives like the BRAIN in the US and the HUMAN BRAIN in EU.  Additionally, the project provides opportunity to involve graduate and undergraduate students in a research&lt;br/&gt;activity lying at the interface between the fields of data analytics and bio-molecular physical&lt;br/&gt;chemistry. Given the increased relevance of Big Data approaches to drug discovery and the&lt;br/&gt;emergence of precision medicine, the skillset and expertise acquired are expected to match&lt;br/&gt;the future needs of industry and academia. Furthermore, student recruitment in the project will take advantage of two&lt;br/&gt;initiatives. The first is a Professional Masters in Bioinformatics, where the PI is involved in&lt;br/&gt;all organizational aspects, from the steering committee to the design of Structural Bioinformatics&lt;br/&gt;classes. The second is the MARC U-STAR program designed to mentor underrepresented groups&lt;br/&gt;in research, providing financial assistance to prepare students for competitive graduate programs.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The project was focused on the mechanism of activation of the transient receptor potential (TRP) channels, key players of the nociceptive system. TRP channels transduce diverse sensory stimuli in eukaryotes.

This makes them attractive pharmacological targets to silence pain pathways.

During this funding cycle, we used molecular dynamics simulations, free energy calculations and statistical inference to make novel predictions about the microscopic mechanism of TRP channels and test them experimentally.
