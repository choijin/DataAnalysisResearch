<AbstractNarration>The National Science Foundation's (NSF)Inclusion across the Nation of Communities of Learners of Underrepresented Discoverers in Engineering and Science (NSF INCLUDES) program supports models, networks, partnerships and research to ensure the broadening participation in STEM of women, members of racial and ethnic groups that have been historically underrepresented, persons of low socio-economic status, and people with disabilities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The University of Akron will convene a two-day conference to develop a backbone organization to support the preparation and advancement of underrepresented minorities K-12 through careers in the biosciences, a high growth area for engineering (biomechanics, biometrics and biomaterials).  This conference draws on the expertise of a wide range of organizations, professional associations, K-20+, community based organizations, industry and museums.  The intent is to strengthen the network among participants and leverage learning on how to engage youth in the biosciences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results of this first conference will be a white paper that will be disseminated to several professional societies that outlines a backbone infrastructure for addressing both short-term and longer-term aspects of an NSF INCLUDES alliance centered on bioengineering, biomechanics, biomedical engineering and biomaterials.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[Overview The NSF INCLUDES conference hosted at the University of Akron focused on ?Bridging Engineering Science and Technology? (BEST).  The goals were to address barriers that include (i) the gap between under-represented K-12 individuals and their transition to college and careers in the bioscience sector, and (ii) silos that often exist between fields within the biosciences and engineering.  Conference Theme BEST focused on biomedical engineering, biomechanics, and biomaterials ? areas chosen because they represent significant growth areas within STEM fields in the U.S.  The project addressed the broader participation challenges of (i) raising awareness of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) careers and (ii) improving the preparation and motivation for STEM careers of girls and underrepresented racial and ethnic groups. Long-term, this increased career awareness and improved preparation and motivation will result in increased representation of these groups in STEM fields. Conference Objectives The BEST Conference brought together leaders from the fields of Biomedical Engineering, Biomechanics and Biomaterials with the objectives of:  Determining the scope of under-representation and issues limiting the inclusion of certain communities within these fields. Reviewing past approaches used by national societies, universities, state and federal organizations, not-for-profit organizations and the business community. Scaling up approaches that have showed success.   Significant Results This conference succeeded in bringing together a diverse group of stakeholders, ranging from federal agencies (NSF, NASA) to national groups focusing on biomimicry and/or materials (Great Lakes Biomimicry, ASM International), national professional societies (American Society of Biomechanics, Biomedical Engineering Society and Society for Biomechanics, Bioengineering and Biotransport), large companies (e.g., Boston Scientific, THEVAX Genetics Vaccine Co), representation from the non-profit sector (Summit Educational Initiative, Center for Intellectual Property, Technology and Telecommunications) and academia (USC, Tuskegee University, the University of Akron, Ohio State University and many others).  The common theme amongst these groups was that they are all dedicated to reaching out to under-represented communities in one of more of the areas of biomedical engineering, biomechanics and biomaterials. The key outcome from the BEST Conference is a white paper that is available at:  https://nsfincludes.uakron.edu/files/2018/11/BEST_White_Paper.pdf .
