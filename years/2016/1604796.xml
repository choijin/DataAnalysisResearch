<AbstractNarration>This award is made as part of the FY 2016 Mathematical Sciences Postdoctoral Research Fellowships Program. Each of the fellowships supports a research and training project at a host institution in the mathematical sciences, including applications to other disciplines, under the mentorship of a sponsoring scientist. The title of the project for this fellowship to Kurt W. Vinhage is "Rigidity Phenomena in Smooth Group Actions." The host institution for the fellowship is the University of Chicago, and the sponsoring scientist is Alex Eskin.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project provided the PI with funding to work on classification problems in certain ideal group actions called homogeneous actions. Throught collaborations, the PI was able to obtain results which make major progress in smooth classification questions posed by the the Katok-Spatzier conjecture and Zimmer program for actions of abelian groups and lattices, respectively.  Abelian group actions can be thought of as commuting flows and diffeomorphisms. By taking product spaces, one can construct commuting actions by acting on each space separately. Conjecturally, if one cannot associate a flow to a higher rank action as a factor, the action must come from an extremely restrictive class of algebraic actions.  For the first time, the Katok-Spatzier conjecture was proved for a special class of abelian actions which satisfy dynamical assumptions that do not relate it to an algebraic model, and do not impose additional transitivity assumptions on subactions.  The PI also made progress in understanding classification problems for actions with intermediate complexity, where the relevant notion of equivalence is that of Kakutani equivalence. Two flows are Kakutani equivalent if one can find an absolutely continuous change of coordinates such that orbits of one flow are taken to orbits of another such that the orientation on orbits is preserved.  The study of parabolic flows up to stronger notions of conjugacy has been known to reduce to an algebraic question thanks to works of Ratner. Kakutani equivalence appears to be the natural notion of equivalence for unipotent actions, as it is known to distinguish some actions, but not reduce to the simpler algebraic question.  Through collaborative work, the PI computed an invariant of Kakutani equivalence for some unipotent flows on homogeneous spaces. The results show that the invariant is computable, and distinguishes many flows whose Kakutani equivalence class was previously unknown.     After making these accomplishments, PI participated in summer programs to discuss his work at seminars and conferences. The PI also participated in a summer program for high school students where the certain classical, chaotic dynamical systems which inspired the ongoing research, and their connections to digit expansions, was explained at a non-technical level.
