<AbstractNarration>When one considers science writing in undergraduate classrooms, the formal lab report is generally the first thing that comes to mind. However, mastering this genre is of little benefit to non-majors, who are unlikely ever to encounter, read, or write a scientific research report beyond the confines of a science course. In addition, most undergraduates are completely unaware that a scientist's research report is the product of a range of informal writing that happened along the way (scribbles in a notebook, notes in the margins of papers, presentations at lab meetings and conferences, e-mails to colleagues, etc.). Therefore, this project asks: How can science instructors engage undergraduates in authentic writing and literacy practices that offer skills that can be leveraged in settings beyond the science classroom? Can students eventually develop the academic language, precision, inscriptions, and argumentation patterns common to communication in professional scientific research and science writing communities without relying on the lab report as the only model? How can science instructors, who rarely receive any training in writing instruction, be better prepared to teach students to write well in science?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Building on prior work done under a CCLI Type 1 grant (NSF Award No. 0837058, "Student-Generated Scientific Inquiry"), this project is addressing the above-mentioned questions and challenges by partnering science and English faculty to improve instruction in an inquiry course for future K-8 teachers and to develop an instructor's guide, "Writing in the Inquiry Classroom: A Facilitator's Guide to Scientific Writing," for use by science faculty. The instructor's guide will provide concrete pedagogical strategies for implementing best practices in writing instruction within the context of any undergraduate course where students engage in scientific inquiry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition, the project is analyzing the authenticity of students' discourse patterns compared with those found in professional communities of scientists. For example, do students use notebooks and diagrams like scientists do? Do they develop precision in their use of language? Do they use writing as a tool for learning, not just as a demonstration of what was learned?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigators are employing a mixed-methods evaluation, drawing from data sources including videotapes of class sessions, copies of students' written work, lesson plans, teaching logs, students' online discussions, surveys, and student interviews.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The theme that has emerged from our work on teaching writing in the sciences is that we should be engaging students in writing assignments that replicate the roles that writing plays in scientific disciplines, rather than replicating the particular structures characteristic of that writing. That is, in all fields, we use writing to have, remember, share, vet, challenge, and stabilize ideas. Over time, stylistic conventions have emerged that serve to facilitate this work: bound and paginated lab notebooks, abstracts, ways of referring to and including others? work, choices to use first or third person, discussion of methods, embedding figures, 3? x 4? posters, and so on. But much of the focus of writing instruction&mdash;particularly within the scientific disciplines&mdash;prioritizes the reproduction of these conventions rather than writing that generates, shares, challenges, or builds on the ideas of a community of scholars. And so while we believe that explicit attention to academic writing is a critical part of science teaching, our writing assignments perhaps are not what first come to mind when faculty think of a "writing intensive" course in science. Students? writing does not, at first glance, look like a journal article or conference proceeding, but instead does the work that science writing does&mdash;developing and disseminating ideas. We find that, over time, it is an emphasis on developing these disciplinary literacy practices that builds better writers. They become writers who draw on a range of practices - drawing on lab notebooks, whiteboard conversations and peer feedback as they develop increasingly precise and public writing, who consider their claims and evidence as they construct a text, who understand the role of experiment in scientific theory, who can flexibly adjust their writing in response to their audience, and who engage in and benefit from increasing levels of peer feedback and review.   This project has intellectual merit by contributing to the research base on composition and writing instruction, aligning this field with the field of science education research.   The project has broad impact through its connection to improving education at all levels; this work has been used with undergraduate students and preservice teachers with potential to impact the communication skills of future scientists and have impact on K-12 classrooms, as teachers work to engage their students in more writing instruction in the context of scientific inquiry.
