<AbstractNarration>All visual animals face the problem of distinguishing relevant from distracting stimuli quickly and efficiently. One way that visual systems accomplish this task is through selective attention, where an animal attends to a portion of the available visual stimuli at a time. Tiny jumping spiders have microminiature eyes that are nearly as acute as a human's and, like humans, pays attention and discriminates among visual targets. This project investigates how jumping spiders pay attention to and identify moving visual objects.  The simplicity of the jumping spider eye and brain makes it easier to learn how the brain's neural networks "compute" visual movement and object identification, than in humans.  In humans AND jumping spiders, selective visual attention is measured by rapid movements of their eyes to focus on targets of interest. This study employs an innovative eyetracker to measure the direction of a spider's gaze as it views video images. In addition, neural techniques are used to measure the activity of the spider's brain while its gaze is being monitored: specific parts of the brain respond differentially to particular images and sounds. Thus, it is possible to see both what engages a spider's visual attention as well as how different stimuli are interpreted. Understanding this elegant, miniaturized and extremely effective visual system will be of interest to roboticists and engineers, for whom micro-miniaturization of biosensors is a premium in small, self-autonomous robots. In addition, the PI will train a graduate student, a postdoc, and undergraduates, and will create videos for a project called "Faces and Voices of Science" that highlight the personal stories of researchers from different backgrounds. The videos will be made available online for teachers and professors to incorporate in lectures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Visual animals face the problem of distinguishing relevant from distracting stimuli quickly and efficiently.  One way to do this is through selective attention, where the animal attends to only part of the visual field at a time, through a process of saccadic eye movements and selective target scan.  This is true for humans and at the behavioral level seems true for jumping spiders.  These spiders are highly visual and are among the rare invertebrate animals that have moveable eyes.  The PIs have developed two novel technologies that allow a comprehensive study of selective visual attention.  These include an innovative spider eyetracker can monitor with precision a spider's eye movements in real time as they scan a stimulus image and the first electrophysiological recordings in the brain of a living spider as it observes visual stimuli. The eyetracker will be deployed to monitor eye movements while simultaneously recordings from single units in the brain are recorded.  The PIs will thus test explicit hypotheses about visual attention, eye movements, and correlated brain activity.  These include "bottom-up" stimulus-driven attentional processes by testing how different visual stimuli influence eye movements and neural processes in the brain, as well as "top-down" processes by presenting cross-modal cues and measuring eye movements and neural processes as the spider searches for relevant stimuli among distractors.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Just how "intelligent" are animals compared to humans?  This is an important question because just as all aspects the genetics, embryology, physiology, behavior, and social ecology of humans have precursors or analogs in animals.  What about cognitive abilities&mdash;the ability to make rapid and adaptive decisions in the face of environmental changes or situations?  It is not hard to believe that chimpanzees and other primates possess cognitive abilities and even dogs and cats, seem to respond adaptively in relation their human caretakers.  But what about the myriad invertebrate animals that are outwardly almost alien and unhuman-like?  Recent studies claim that octopuses possess keen problem-solving abilities and studies on tiny jumping spiders have shown they possess decision-making abilities that rival the octopus when analyzed in terms of cognitive building blocks based on human behavior.  These building blocks include perceptual (sensory processing) and brain-based capacity for selective attention and memory, including working memory, short and long-term memory.  Our project focused on dissecting the neurophysiological-behavioral components of selective visual attention and decision making in spider species that have remarkably human-like eyes that are acutely sensitive to visual target detail and movement of visual targets, that they track by active eye movements, analogous to the saccadic scanning movements of humans and other primates.  We have discovered that jumping spiders have high-order visual processing that affects decision-making.  Spiders can discriminate between inanimate shapes and images of prey species like flies and crickets; they make saccadic eye movements to prey images which hold their attention while they are being scanned with their eyes, during visual fixation.  Target movement in the visual field activates whole body, as well as retinal movements measurable as saccadic movements to orient toward and then scan the visual target.  These are the building blocks of visual cognition, i.e., selective attention, typical of mammalian behavior perceptual behavior.  Moreover, we have discovered that in spiders, selective visual attention is a limited cognitive resource&mdash;it can be overloaded such that the spider becomes "blind" to other objects in the visual field once it has fixated on a specific target.  This is analogous to the well-known human counterpart known as "inattentional blindness" due to perceptual overload and selective attention (and its limits).  This is characteristic of mammalian visual cognition and to find its counterpart in jumping spiders is of special relevance for the field of Animal Comparative Cognition&mdash;no two animals seem more different than a tiny jumping spider and a human being.  Yet, both possess structurally and functionally similar eyes for motion and object detection&mdash;and both perform saccadic eye movements, selective visual attention,              Our project also has implications for how animals hear, especially very small animals, like mosquitoes and spiders.  Nearly all animals that possess a sense of hearing have "ears" based on eardrums that "capture" oscillations in air pressure generated by a distant sound source.  All animals that hear sound and we are familiar with, all mammals and cold-blooded vertebrates, as well as insects such as cicadas, crickets, katydids, and grasshoppers, in addition to moths and beetles possess hearing organs with eardrums to capture sound.  However, our work has focused on very small animals, fruit flies, mosquitoes, and especially, spiders.  These minute creatures possess even smaller ears that sense the velocity of the movements of invisible particle and molecules of which the air around us is composed.  These nanoscale ears present novel design features for engineers and biophysicists to invent microsize microphones that can be deployed in hearing aids, cellphones, and fluid detectors in biomedical monitors.
