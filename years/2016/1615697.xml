<AbstractNarration>Accurately assessing the risks of contaminants requires knowledge of complex ecological interactions, elemental cycling, and the interactive effects of natural stressors, such as resource limitations and contaminant stressors.  The development of ecotoxicological models have contributed significantly to our understanding of how contaminants impact organisms and cycle through aquatic food webs. However current models do not incorporate dynamical interactive effects of contaminant stressors and elemental constraints, such as nutrient/light availability and food quality.  Investigators will design and conduct laboratory experiments in conjunction with mathematical models that account for both nutritional value of diet and toxicant load.  The results will generate knowledge and enhance understandings of the environment and global change.  The project will shed light on nutrient and chemical contaminant cycling and ultimately improve toxicological risk assessment protocols, which will be beneficial to environmental managers and policy decision makers.  User-friendly versions of the models will be disseminated on the project's webpage.  Graduate students will receive interdisciplinary training in the fields of mathematics and ecotoxicology to gain a broad understanding of scientific problems, necessary to communicate effectively across disciplines.  Investigators and graduate students will be involved in K-12 outreach initiatives organized by the STEM Center for Outreach, Research, and Education at Texas Tech University.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The theory of ecological stoichiometry emphasizes the balance of multiple chemical elements and the relative abundance of essential elements in organisms that shape ecological dynamics.  Investigators will develop and analyze a series of empirically testable and robust mathematical models of population dynamics structured under the framework of ecological stoichiometry.  In parallel to model development, investigators will integrate data from the literature and from new experiments designed in this research, in order to parameterize, test, and improve the models. Dynamical systems theory and tools will be used to interpret and analyze the models including analytical, computational and numerical, as well as bifurcation analysis.  The synthesis of the models and experiments will result in the development of a robust theoretical framework appropriate for improved risk assessment applications in ecotoxicology that incorporate the effects of stoichiometric constraints on concurrent ecological and toxicological processes.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Major outcomes include the development of a robust theoretical framework appropriate for improved risk assessment applications in ecotoxicology that incorporate the effects of nutrient constraints on concurrent ecological and toxicological processes. Throughout the duration of this project researchers collected empirical eco-toxicological data and developed mathematical models to gain insight of the dynamics of interactive effects of contaminant stressors and stoichiometric constraints, such as nutrient/light availability and food quality.     Empirically data was collected to investigate the toxicities of cadmium (Cd), arsenic (As), and their binary mixture (Cd/Asmix) at two-trophic levels in algae, Scenedesmus acutus (a primary producer) and Daphnia pulex (a primary consumer), under varied media and dietary phosphorus conditions.   Alongside the laboratory experiments, a suite of dynamical systems models of stoichiometric aquatic food chains was developed. Data from existing and new experiments was integrated into the models in order to parameterize, test, and improve them.  Altogether the laboratory experiments and developed models explore concurrent nutrient and toxic stressors and have improved our understanding of the processes governing the trophic transfer for nutrients, energy, and toxicants.     Alongside the scientific accomplishments, the project provided undergraduate and graduate students with first hand experience in collaborations across the fields of mathematics and biology as they learned how to participate and contribute to cross-disciplinary research. Students obtained a broad understanding of scientific problems and gained the skills to communicate their expertise effectively and identify collaborative solutions.  The project also enabled collaborations across the Department of Mathematics and Statistics and The Institute of Environmental and Human Health at Texas Tech University (TTU) while actively promoting the collaborative field of mathematical biology through K-12 outreach initiatives.
