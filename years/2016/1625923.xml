<AbstractNarration>With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation Program (MRI) and support from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program (CRIF) as well as the Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR), Professor Justin Douglas from the University of Kansas and colleagues Bala Subramaniam, Mikhail Barybin, Jon Tunge and Ryan Altman have acquired a cryogenically-cooled probe for a nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometer (NMR). In general, Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is one of the most powerful tools available to chemists for determining the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution or in the solid state. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. The results from these NMR studies have an impact in synthetic organic/inorganic chemistry, materials chemistry and biochemistry. To be able to obtain data NMR spectrometers require a probe where the sample to be analyzed is placed. In a cryogenically cooled probe, a very cold liquid or gas is used to chill the environment. This chilling results in a significant increase in sensitivity and speeds up data collection while using smaller samples. This instrument to be located in a general user facility managed by highly qualified scientists.  It is an integral part of research, research training and teaching at the University. The improved research infrastructure further enriches and facilitates the innovative efforts presently underway at this institution to broaden participation in science and engineering, especially by individuals from underrepresented groups (e. g., gender, ethnicity, disability, geography, etc.) through its integration into outreach at the pre-college level. Coursework at the undergraduate and postgraduate level is enriched.  Both KU students and students from other colleges and universities participating in undergraduate and graduate research training programs are able to access the new facilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The award is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels, especially in: (a) exploring strategies for fluorination of common functional groups; (b) preparing azulene-bridged organometallics as a platform fo charge delocalization and transport at the nanoscale; (c) focusing on catalysis and reaction engineering for resource-efficient chemical and fuel production from biomass and (d) synthesizing catalyts via carbon-carbon bond cleavage.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) program with support from the Chemical Research Instrumentation (CRIF) program and the Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR) provided funds to acquire a cryogenically-cooled broadband probe (aka a "cryoprobe") to upgrade a Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectrometer at the University of Kansas in Lawrence (KU-L).  NMR spectroscopy is an essential tool in modern scientific research in diverse fields such as Chemistry, Biology and Engineering.  NMR suffers from one deficiency vis-a-vis its fellow analytical techniques (e.g. mass spectrometry and optical spectroscopy): sensitivity.  The technological breakthrough of the cryogenically-cooled probe represents a great leap forward for NMR spectroscopy and the chemical sciences.  These probes increase the sensitivity by a factor of four, which leads to a subsequent decrease in spectral acquisition time by a factor of sixteen.  To put it another way, an experiment that would require 8 hours with a conventional room-temperature probe, would require only 30 minutes with a cryoprobe!  By 2016 it was clear that this dramatic increase in sensitivity was no longer a luxury reserved for the few, but an essential resource for scientists and engineers working in a competitive research environment.  This need motivated our multidisciplinary team to collaborate to prepare a proposal with a single aim - to acquire a multinuclear broadband cryoprobe for the campus NMR facility at KU-L, which could serve the needs of the research community at its parent institution, as well as throughout the region.  The cryoprobe acquired from the funds provided by NSF award # 1625923 has produced numerous positive outcomes with a broad impact on society as a whole.  Since the instrument was installed in May 2017, at least 27 peer-reviewed publications from the labs of 15 individual Principle Investigators include data recorded on the cryoprobe.  These publications range in topics from the development of novel catalysts for resource-efficient fuel and chemical production from biomass to the development of novel compounds for the treatment of drug abuse and pain.  Nearly 350 undergraduate, graduate students and post-doctoral researchers have collected data on this instrument during that time, for both research and coursework.  Furthermore, this impact will continue into the foreseeable future thanks to the well-designed management plan that will provide sustainable support for the maintenance of the instrument over its expected lifetime.   In summary, the outstanding accomplishment achieved during the reporting period, as well as the continuation of this activity into foreseeable future, will place this project into the top tier of activities enabled by the National Science Foundation in terms of broad impacts and intellectual merits.   This project is an excellent example of the multiplicative impact across multiple field that is possible from the NSF Major Research Instrumentation program.
