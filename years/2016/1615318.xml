<AbstractNarration>The goal of this project is to better understand how plants respond to environmental stress through the study of proteasomes and proteasome inhibition. Proteasomes are protein complexes inside all plant and animal cells that degrade damaged proteins to prevent their toxic aggregation. Such damage can arise from physical stress; however, such stressors may also inhibit proteasome activity. Thus, the focus of the research will be to understand how plants reprogram their cellular activities during proteasome inhibition. A better understanding of plant responses to environmental stress may ultimately improve crop yield and food security. The project will allow the training of twelve undergraduate students at Coastal Carolina University.  Students with physical disabilities will participate in the research, and will strengthen the ties between the College of Science and Office of Accessibility and Disability Services; this collaboration may serve as a model to other universities seeking to increase this group?s participation in STEM disciplines.  As this project integrates both research and teaching, it will also facilitate the revision of a laboratory-based class that will serve to strengthen the curriculum. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; This research investigates plant proteasomes, which avert cytotoxicity by safely removing damaged proteins that result from stress.  However, severe oxidative stress decreases proteasome activity in plants, and this project aims to identify mechanisms that contribute to its impairment. In contrast to yeast and mammalian models, the effects of proteasome inhibition in plants are not understood.  This project intends to address this gap in plant biology by examining how cellular processes are altered in response to proteasome inhibition.  Respirometry, biochemical, and -omic approaches will be used to reveal if proteasome inhibition coordinates metabolism to restore amino acid levels or adjust antioxidant metabolism.  The outcomes of the study will describe differences in how plants respond to proteasome inhibition compared to mammalian and yeast cells.</AbstractNarration>
