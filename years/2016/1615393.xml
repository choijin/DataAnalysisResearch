<AbstractNarration>Plants have evolved an RNA editing mechanism to prevent the detrimental effects of mutations that have occurred in genes located in chloroplast and mitochondria, which are subcellular organelles necessary for photosynthesis and respiration.  Recent studies indicate that there are diverse molecular machines, RNA editosomes,that carry out this important process.  Not every RNA editing apparatus contains the same proteins.  In order to understand how the RNA editing mechanism works, the protein composition of RNA editosomes will be further characterized using genetic and biochemical methods.  By identifying all of the proteins needed for changing the RNA sequence, editing could be used in the future for deliberate modification of the RNA product and protein produced from a gene.  Such technology could benefit the biotechnology industry and society through application in many different fields.  The project will provide training opportunities for both graduate and undergraduate students, including students participating in NSF REU program that involves a high proportion of underrepresented minorities and women from other colleges. In addition to scientific approaches, trainees will be mentored in both oral and written presentation of their experimental data.  Both the PI and coPI will continue to perform administrative service for the scientific community. The co-PI will continue her efforts to promote participation of women in STEM fields.  The PI will distribute a new multiplexed mass spectrometric protocol that can be used for individuals studying RNA editing in any organism.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recent progress has resulted in much increased knowledge of the composition of the plant RNA editing apparatus, but the precise protein composition of any particular editosome has not been identified.  In addition to a PPR protein, an editosome contains one or more members of three additional protein families, the RIP, ORRM, and OZ families and perhaps additional proteins.  Proposed experiments will lead to detailed characterization of particular types of RNA editosomes.  Functional epitope-tagged versions of OZ1 and a PPR protein will be used for affinity purification to determine the proteins comprising editosomes that contain either OZ1 or the PPR protein.  Genes encoding candidate proteins identified by mass spectrometry analysis will be subjected to genetic analysis to determine whether they are required for chloroplast RNA editing. The feasibility of transfer of an editing event to a heterologous system will be explored. The information that will be gained is essential for exploiting the phenomenon of RNA editing for genetic engineering at the post-transcriptional level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is funded by the Genetic Mechanisms Program in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Plant RNA editing occurs in organelle, mitochondria and chloroplasts, and results in a C-to-U modification on certain transcripts at particular positions. This process corrects deleterious mutations that would hamper the proper function of organelle proteins. Depending on where the edited C occurs in a transcript, the absence of C-to U modification in editing mutants can result in very severe phenotype, even embryo lethality. Therefore RNA editing is a fundamental process critical for plant development. Investigation of this phenomenon has allowed clear advances in our understanding how editing of particular nucleotides is specified i.e., why some Cs are modified to Us while others are not. A class of protein containing pentatricopeptide repeats (PPRs) is responsible for the specificity by recognizing a cis element upstream of the targeted C for editing. Certain PPR proteins contain at their C terminus a DYW motif that carries the deaminase activity, the chemical reaction allowing the transformation of a cytidine to a uridine. In lower plants such as moss, the molecular apparatus responsible for editing, the editosome, is very simple and requires only the PPR-DYW protein. In angiosperms such as Arabidopsis, the model plant with which we study editing, the editosome is more complex and possesses other proteins.</p> <p>Our lab has been instrumental in identifying, by biochemical and genetic means, other protein components of the editosome, the so-called RIPs (RNA-editing factor interacting proteins), ORRM (Organelle RNA recognition motif-containing) proteins, and more recently OZ (Organelle Zinc finger containing) proteins. Even though the function of these extra proteins is not clearly understood, their presence is absolutely required in the plants as mutants in these proteins show a lack of editing at various editing sites. We have studied in detail the OZ1 plastid editing factor and dissected the functions of its different domains in the editing process. The C-terminal part of the OZ1 protein contain domains not found in the three other OZ proteins. This C-terminal portion of OZ1 functions in the binding of OZ1 to PPR recognition factors, thus explaining the selection of the particular editing sites that are under the control of OZ1. Complementation studies with a series of truncated and mutated OZ1 demonstrated that the second of two tandem zinc finger domains is essential for OZ1 to carry out its editing function.</p> <p>We also studied OZ2, a mitochondrial protein that belongs to the same small protein family as OZ1. The <em>OZ2</em> gene is essential, as one cannot obtain homozygous <em>oz2</em> mutant plants. We used a molecular trickery that bypassed the embryo lethality by expressing the <em>OZ2</em> gene under the control of the ABI3 promoter in an <em>oz2</em> mutant background. The ABI3 promoter allows the expression of the <em>OZ2</em> gene during critical embryo development and then is turned off, allowing any molecular or morphological defect to be observed at the seedling stage. We were able to obtain several independent <em>oz2</em> rescued homozygous plants; these plants showed a marked slow growth phenotype with curly and dark green leaves. Molecular characterization of the <em>oz2</em> mutant plants demonstrated that OZ2, unlike OZ1 is not an editing factor, but surprisingly, a splicing factor. In addition to the splicing of <em>rps3</em>, the gene encoding the ribosomal protein S3, OZ2 controls the splicing of all the mitochondrially encoded subunits of the NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase complex (Complex I). A defect in complex I activity is likely the cause of the stunted morphology of <em>oz2</em> mutant plants as very similar phenotypes with dark green and curly leaves have been reported for other complex I mutants. The embryo lethality caused by the <em>oz2</em> mutation certainly arises from the defect in <em>rps3</em> splicing as the protein encoded by the spliced gene is an essential component of the mitochondrial ribosome.</p> <p>During this project, four undergraduates and one high school student obtained research experience as either summer interns or in academic year research courses.
