<AbstractNarration>NONTECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;This award made on a Research at an Undergraduate Institute (RUI)proposal supports computational and theoretical research and education to study transformations in the size and shape assumed by long chain-like molecules, polymers, as they respond to changes in their environment, such as changes in temperature and pressure.  The PI will use advanced computer simulation techniques and models to advance understanding of this important problem.  Changes in the size and shape of the polymers in biological cells are often necessary to carry out functions at the biomolecular level to sustain life.  A better understanding of this process contributes to developing design principles for smart materials that change their properties in response to changes in their environment in a way that is reversible.  Smart materials have many applications, including actuators, sensors, and a wide range of medical devices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research program has been designed to allow for maximum student participation by dovetailing into the physics curriculum at Hiram College. Computation and simulation methods taught in the core courses establish a direct link between classroom learning and this research program and provide students with the tools needed to make meaningful contributions to this work. The undergraduate students who participate in this research will benefit by learning state of the art computer simulation techniques and will have opportunities to present at scientific meetings. Many students who have worked with the PI at Hiram, have, or will be, pursuing advanced study in physics, materials science, engineering, or medicine.  The PI aims to continue to provide successful educational experiences for students, and to help recruit more under-represented students into the sciences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;This award made on an Research at an Undergraduate Institution (RUI) proposal supports computational and theoretical research and education that addresses conformational phase transitions of single polymer molecules in response to variations in environmental variables such as temperature, pressure, or solution pH.  This topic is of broad importance since both the bulk properties of polymer containing materials and the functionality of biopolymers and many polymer-based "smart" materials are directly linked to the underlying microscopic conformation of individual polymer molecules.  Many smart or biologically active materials utilize polymer chains tethered to surfaces while biopolymers typically operate in very crowded macromolecular environments. In this geometrically constrained environment polymers can behave differently and a focus of this research is on the basic physics of polymer confinement with specific applications to materials design. This research continues and extends recent work by the PI with significant contributions from undergraduate collaborators in the areas of solvent effects on polymer conformation and phase transitions of isolated homopolymer chains.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research objectives of this project are to:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; (i) elucidate the effects of local environment on the conformational phase transitions of a single polymer chain as relevant, for example, to the design and function of polymer-based environmentally responsive smart materials;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; (ii) study single-polymer phase transitions, in particular, polymer all-or-none "folding", which can provide an on/off switch in smart materials applications, in crowded or geometrically confined environments; and&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; (iii) develop rigorous analysis tools such as partition function zeros and free energy landscapes to study phase transitions and transition pathways in polymer systems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work will make use of both a solvation potential approach, recently developed by the PI to reduce computational complexity in modeling polymer-solvent systems, and advanced simulation techniques that allow for direct computation of the density of states of classical many-body systems.  The latter methods provide complete thermodynamic information and can be used to carry out subsequent multi-canonical simulations to determine structural information.  &lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;This research contributes to the understanding of single-macromolecule behavior through the development of rigorous solvation potentials, density of states simulation methods, and new analysis techniques.  It will contribute to efforts to develop rational design principles for functional polymer-based and biomimetic materials.  This research program has been designed to allow for maximum undergraduate student participation by dovetailing into the physics curriculum at Hiram College.  Computation and simulation methods taught in the core physics courses establish a direct link between classroom learning and this research program, and provide students with the tools needed to make meaningful contributions to this work.  The undergraduate students who participate in this research will benefit by learning state of the art computer simulation techniques and will have opportunities to present at scientific meetings. Many students who have worked with the PI at Hiram, have, or will be, pursuing advanced study in physics, materials science, engineering, or medicine.

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Polymers, which are long chain molecules, are the building blocks of life (proteins, cellulose, DNA) and are the primary component in a vast array of materials commonly referred to as plastics.   The fact that polymer molecules can assume a wide variety of shapes is one of the keys to their versatility.  For example, polymers can produce strong lightweight materials due to the interweaving or entanglement of the long flexible chains throughout the material.  In many biological applications, these large molecules spontaneously fold into well-defined three-dimensional shapes that allow them to carry out specific chemical and mechanical operations.  In the design of modern so called smart materials (used for sensors, actuators, and drug delivery systems), one attempts to make use of this molecular functionality in a way that can be turned on or off by changing external variables such as temperature, pH, or an applied electric field.  The focus of this research program has been basic theoretical and computer simulation studies of these conformational transitions exhibited by polymer molecules in response to changes in the local environment.  Our primary goal has been to understand how geometric confinement or macromolecular crowding of a polymer chain affects these conformational transitions with applications both to biological systems and the rational design of functional smart materials.  We use advanced computer simulation methods to directly compute the entropy reduction, and associated thermodynamic effects, associated with these spatial restrictions.  An important part of this research program has been the significant involvement of undergraduate students, including several from under-represented groups.  Regarding scientific outcomes, this research had produced the following results:  1) Geometric Confinement: For a polymer that can fold into a compact state, geometric confinement (e.g., a slit-like or cylindrical nano-pore or a 3D nano-enclosure) stabilizes the folded state with respect to the unfolded state, thus shifting the location of the folding transition and allowing for confinement driven transitions.  In particular, our work has quantified the entropic driving force behind confinement-induced stabilization.  Extreme confinement in a nano-pore can radically alter the structure of the folded state.  These model results may help guide the rational design of smart materials whose operation is based on such "switchable" shape transitions.   [See Figs. 1&amp;2; Results reported in Macromolecules 50, 6967 (2017) and J. Chem. Phys. 152, 094901 (2020)]  2) Macromolecular Crowding: The interior of a biological cell is an extremely crowded solvent environment and this macromolecular crowding will strongly reduce the configurational entropy of an unfolded polymer chain.  For a chain that undergoes a folding transition, the entropy loss will stabilize the compact folded state with respect to the expanded unfolded state. We have quantified this entropy reduction and demonstrate that it increases with increasing crowder density and with decreasing crowder size.  [See Fig. 3; Results reported in J. Chem. Phys. 147, 166101 (2017) and J. Chem. Phys. 153, 174901 (2020)]  3) Crowding Effects for Tethered Polymers and DNA:  In many applications polymers are tethered to a surface and strongly modify surface properties.  For a polymer tethered within an array of other chains (a polymer brush) chain folding will be affected by the locally crowded environment.  We find that a dense polymer brush acts to stabilize the folded chain thus shifting the location of the folding transition.  Such chain folding transitions are the basis for a class of chemical sensors built from tethered arrays of single-stranded DNA aptamers.  We have constructed a simple but thermodynamically accurate coarse-grained model for ssDNA and used it to investigate crowding effects in such devices.  We find that an array of unfolded chains stabilizes the folded state while an array of folded chains provides weak stabilization at low crowder density but a strong destabilization at high crowder densities.  Theses results may inform the design of such sensors.  [See Fig. 4; publication in preparation]  4) Confinement induced suppression of polymer desorption: A polymer chain tethered to an attractive surface can undergo a reversible adsorption/desorption transition.  We have examined the effects of confinement on this phase transition using a partition-function-zero analysis. We find that in a slit environment the polymer-desorption transition is completely suppressed for a sufficiently long chain.  Thus, rather than simply shifting the location of a phase transition, here confinement eliminates the transition.  [See Fig. 5; publication in preparation]     In terms of broader impacts, this work has significantly affected the nine undergraduate students (including three women) who have participated (see Fig. 6).  This type of experiential learning is considered a high-impact practice and has given these students direct exposure to the world of professional science.  Most of these students have presented their work at professional scientific meetings and several are, or will be, coauthors on publications.  Many of the students who participated in this research work are, or will be, pursuing advanced study on physics, materials science, computer science, or engineering.
