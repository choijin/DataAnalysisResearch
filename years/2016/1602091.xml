<AbstractNarration>Professor Jared L. Anderson of the University of Toledo is supported by the Chemical Measurement and Imaging (CMI) Program in the Division of Chemistry to explore the application of ionic liquids as separation media in chromatography and microextractions.  The project will provide new knowledge on how ionic liquids effect the differential extraction of analytes and their separation and analysis by various chromatographic techniques, and will expand the scope of applicability of ionic liquids in the analysis of real chemical and biological samples.  A major impact across fields other than analytical chemistry is in the development of techniques for the analysis of complex fluids such as oils and fuels derived from biomass. &lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;Professor Anderson and his research team will conduct three separate initiatives under the umbrella of ionic liquids in separation science.  Magnetic ionic liquids will be studied in the selective extraction and long term storage of deoxyribonucleic acid; polymeric ionic liquids, incorporating single-walled carbon nanotubes, will be developed and used as sorbent coatings for solid-phase microextraction; and ionic liquids will be developed and used as selective stationary phases for multidimensional gas chromatography.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;In the course of conducting this research, graduate and undergraduate students will acquire valuable skills in separation science and chromatography, and Facebook-based social networking outreach programs will be developed to present scientific concepts to young children and the general public.</AbstractNarration>

Ion-tagged oligonucleotides (ITOs) were synthesized in high yield using thiolene ?click? chemistry and were coupled with MILs. The ITOs were capable of annealing to target DNA and could be subsequently captured by the MIL solvent to facilitate downstream analysis. This approach constitutes the first particle-free method for the analysis of DNA and could have widespread utility in microfluidic applications. Hydrophobic MILs based on nickel(II) and cobalt(II) metals were shown to be selective in the extraction of <em>E.

In the third objective, new ionic liquid-based stationary phases were developed and tested in comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography. For dicationic ionic liquids, the length of linker chain and free alkyl groups were shown to produce stationary phase materials that exhibited lower melting points and provided better separation of aliphatic molecules from kerosene and diesel samples compared to smaller dicationic liquids. Lipidic ionic liquids were examined as stationary phases and it was revealed that the enhanced dispersive-type interactions provided better separation of aliphatic hydrocarbons. A new class of silver-based ionic liquids were synthesized and used as one-dimensional stationary phases for the separation of alkenes and alkynes from paraffins. It was shown that the complexation behavior of the silver-based ionic liquid permitted its stable coating on the wall of the capillary column, with thermal stabilities up to approximately 160 degrees C. The silver-alkyne interactions were shown to be very strong as evidenced by these analytes not eluting from the capillary column. These materials were shown to exhibit high selectivity in the separation of alkenes from alkanes.
