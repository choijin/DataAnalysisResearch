<AbstractNarration>General Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Spatial inequality is the heart of the development crises in many low income countries. The lack of spatial inclusion represents not only a significant barrier to economic growth and integration but is increasingly linked to civil war and state failure. The PI analyzes the historical origins of within-country inequality, focusing on the rise of global demand for cash crops and minerals in the 19th century, European colonization and the spatial consequences of economic specialization in primary commodity production (e.g., cocoa, copper, coffee, diamonds, etc.). The highly localized nature of colonial investments in primary commodity production sowed the seeds of regional inequality and societal divisions that are still felt today. This analysis not only enables us to better understand the underlying causes of spatial inequality and its effects on political instability and civil war, but to determine the degree to which policy interventions, such as democratization, economic liberalization, and foreign aid, are reversing this historical legacy and building more inclusive and integrated economies and states. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Technical Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will produce a comprehensive geospatial dataset of primary commodity production at the end of colonialism across 40 countries in sub-Saharan Africa. The aim of the project is to better understand (1) the origins and consequences of spatial inequality in Africa; (2) the effect of primary commodity production on ethno-political bargaining and conflict; and (3) the impact policy interventions on reducing the colonial legacy of uneven development. The PIs systematically geo-reference and digitize maps, atlases, census records and economic reports produced by the colonial governments in the late colonial period as well as contemporaneous academic sources. This highly granular data on areas of cash crop production, mining, and other primary economic production will be generated at a spatial resolution of 5x5 km as well as aggregated up to 25x25 km and current second-level administrative units. The PIs will combine this data on primary commodity production with contemporary geospatial data on electrification, access to public services, conflict events and violence, ethnic inclusion, survey data on perceptions of state capacity and legitimacy, and agricultural production to unravel the path dependent effects of colonial economic extraction and change over time. They anticipate that the data and visualization of the data will serve as valuable resource for students, scholars and policy-makers alike, who are interested in better understanding the link between economic geography, state-building and long-run development.</AbstractNarration>

The historical starting point is the agricultural revolution that swept across the continent with the end of the Atlantic slave trades in the 1800s. Led by smallholder farmers, the cash crop revolution stimulated agricultural innovation, boosted farmers' incomes, spurred migration, and propelled investments in transportation infrastructure. Areas suitable for oil palm, groundnuts, cocoa, coffee, and cotton displaced old economic hubs and emerged as the loci of the region's new economic geography (see the attached figure). Africa was being remade. But how so would be profoundly affected by another historical change that the cash crop revolution impelled&mdash;the spread of European imperialism beyond coastal Africa.&nbsp;</p> <p>Africa's agricultural revolution was directly tied to European industrialization and growing external demand for vegetable oils for manufacturing and industrial processing as well as cocoa and coffee to meet the tastes of a growing middle class. Thus, as it lifted up smallholder farmers in West Africa, it also pulled European merchants deeper into the region. Occurring at the height of imperialism, European traders leveraged mercantilist practices and institutions&mdash;such as gunboat commerce, trading oligopolies, foreign-financed infrastructural investments, and colonialism&mdash;to dominate Africa's agricultural markets. The upshot is that cash crop cultivation zones across the continent became vertically-integrated with export markets, but with forward production linkages dislocated to Europe. This thwarted local manufacturing and stymied the domestic economic differentiation that otherwise might have resulted. Beyond the prized cultivation zones and trading hubs, other areas were either neglected or relegated as a labor reserve and intentionally underdeveloped to create a cheap supply of labor to work in cash crop and mining enclaves. The result was deep and enduring spatial inequalities between what colonizers conceived of as <em>l'Afrique utile et l'Afrique inutile</em>.</p> <p>The NSF award enabled us to systematically test this hypothesis. To do so, during the course of the award we built a comprehensive dataset of historical African economic geography, including detailed geospatial information on sites of cash crop production and mining at the end of colonialism across most states in Sub-Saharan Africa. We drew on two sources of data. We collected administrative data from colonial records and other historical sources on the volume and value of the most important agricultural commodities and minerals produced by each state (i.e., those that make up at least 10 percent of total exports at the end of colonialism) standardized in 1960 US$ and aggregated at the second-administrative level. In the course of this research, we discovered a historical map depicting the source location of more than 95 percent of all exports across 38 African states, standardized in 1957 U.S. dollars ($). Constructed by a team led by renowned geographer of Africa, William Hance, the map draws on "hundreds of sources...including maps, articles, agricultural yearbooks, reports of commodity boards, and product and regional studies." As far as we know, the Hance dataset is the most exhaustive and granular representation of the spatial diffusion of the cash crop revolution across Africa, but has never been systematically analyzed until now.</p> <p>Combining this historical data with contemporary data on subnational development (as measured by nighttime lights as a proxy for economic activity), we demonstrate just how much the transition to commercial export agriculture and economic imperialism entrenched spatial inequality in sub-Saharan Africa. (See again the attached figure.) Consistent with the visualization, our statistical analysis shows that whereas the colonial cash crop revolution caused a spatial shift in long-run development to areas highly-suitable for cash crop agriculture, these agglomerating effects came at the expense of surrounding areas, which ended up significantly worse off than otherwise would be expected based on their underlying characteristics.
