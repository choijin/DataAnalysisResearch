<AbstractNarration>There is a common perception in higher education that engineering-centered co-curricular activities are beneficial in building confidence, improving academic performance, and developing social and professional networks among engineering students. While there are many published studies that link participation in various types of extra-curricular activities, such as social clubs and volunteerism, on academic and social development, little is written about the effect of participation in more engineering-based organizations.  This project seeks to study: (1) why students participate in co-curricular engineering activities, such as engineering honors and professional societies and design teams, (2) whether such participation confers benefits to the participants and helps them develop into professional engineers, and (3) how we might leverage those benefits to attract and retain students who are underrepresented in the science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) fields, including women, African American, Hispanic, and first generation students.  Findings from this project will lay the groundwork for future efforts that will include the design of engineering-based activities that benefit a diverse student body based on concrete data and evidence rather than on intuition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is widely presumed that as long as programs such as engineering honors and professional societies, and design teams are rationally designed, they are beneficial in building social capital, enforcing self-efficacy, and establishing a solid engineering identity.  However, there is very little in the literature specifically in engineering education to support such claims. This project seeks to answer three major research questions:&lt;br/&gt;1. What are the characteristics of the students who currently participate in engineering-centered co-curricular activities?&lt;br/&gt;2. What are the outcomes of participation on academic performance and persistence, and on psychosocial factors such as motivation, social capital, and engineering identity?&lt;br/&gt;3. How can these benefits be transferred to students who are underrepresented in who that are underrepresented in the science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) fields, including women, African American, Hispanic, and first generation students?&lt;br/&gt;The professional development portion of this project will be accomplished by leveraging the expertise of scholars who have a combination of technical content knowledge, practical experience in student organizations, a grounding in theoretical frameworks, and quantitative and qualitative data collection and analysis expertise. A direct outcome of this research will be the thoughtful and efficacious design of programs that attract and retain more students into science and engineering disciplines, especially those coming from underrepresented and underserved populations.   In addition, this work will pilot an engineering education research development plan and thus build capacity for engineering faculty to conduct engineering education research and scholarship.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Over the course of the project, we found that socialization, specifically with regard to a previous published scale regarding Proactive Behaviors, is related to participation and subsequent social, academic, and professional outcomes.  Developed a survey instrument based on Weidman’s model of Undergraduate Socialization that examined the relationships between background characteristics (demographics and college knowledge), socialization processes (institutional tactics and proactive behaviors), normative contexts (participation in co-curricular activities), and outcomes (grade point average, major satisfaction, engineering identity, bridging social capital, bonding social capital, intent to persist) Administered the instrument to 3,618 domestic third- and fourth-year undergraduate engineering students at a large, R1, public, Midwestern university. Adapted and validated several existing scales for out context.  Found that the   Institutional Tactic and Intent to Persist scales do not hold up for a variety of reasons Proactive Behaviors, Bridging Social Capital, Bonding Social Capital, Engineering Identity, and Major Satisfaction scales perform very well Found that international students tend to respond to the Proactive Behaviors and College Knowledge scales differently that domestic students for a variety of reasons, and were thus excluded from subsequent analysis Determined that co-curricular activities in which students participate can be grouped into five different types: identity-based student organizations, competition and design teams, professional societies, college run organizations, and research with a faculty member. Determined that participation in co-curricular activities in which students participate can be grouped into five clusters based on the number of joined organizations and the frequencies with which they participate: non, occasional, regular, super, and selective participants. Studied the relationship between demographics, college knowledge, proactive behaviors, and participation in different types of activities and found that all types of co-curricular activities were better modeled using factors beyond demographics, except for identity-based organizations which were best modeled using demographics alone.      Studied the relationship between types of participation, clusters of participation, Bridging Social Capital, Bonding Social Capital, Engineering Identity, and Major Satisfaction and found that student who participate in any type of organization and at any level gave higher gains in all outcomes.
