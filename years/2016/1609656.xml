<AbstractNarration>In this project funded by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Delia Milliron of the University of Texas at Austin is developing doped metal oxide nanocrystals that can exchange energy with nearby molecules. These new nanoscale building blocks can be widely applied by chemists, materials scientists, and engineers to create functional materials and devices. Professor Milliron is mentoring graduate student, postdoctoral, and undergraduate researchers who are receiving a unique interdisciplinary educational experience, gaining expertise in topics including nanocrystal synthesis, spectroscopy, and simulation of light-matter interactions. Furthermore, Professor Milliron is developing a new educational module for use in pre-college outreach programs that introduce students to plasmonic phenomena and nanochemistry in general.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nanocrystals under development in this project have resonant frequencies in the infrared spectral regime, different from the visible light resonance of classical metal nanoparticles such as gold or silver. Synthetic methods to tune dopant chemistry and dopant distribution are being developed to maximize the potential for near field coupling. Characterization of plasmon-vibrational coupling by Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy complements the synthetic developments underway and lays the foundation for directing energy flow to tune catalytic pathways and to develop advanced sensors and spectroscopic probes.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Plasmonic metal oxide nanocrystals (NCs) efficiently confine light into nanoscopic volumes at the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) frequency. The concentration of electromagnetic energy strengthens the electric field at the NC surface, powering nearby processes. However, this "near-field enhancement" (NFE) only occurs around the LSPR frequency, so the nearby process must have a resonant frequency near that of the LSPR to encounter the enhanced field. This resonant interaction is called "coupling." Plasmonic metal oxide NCs have LSPR tunable throughout infrared frequencies, which overlaps with the majority of molecular vibrational frequencies. Our goals are (1) to develop plasmonic metal oxide NCs with high NFE and (2) to demonstrate these NCs can efficiently couple to molecular vibrations. To achieve these goals we first leveraged colloidal synthetic techniques to make NCs of various composition, size, and shape. Then we directly demonstrated LSPR-vibration coupling by detecting optical signatures indicative of coupled oscillators. Lastly, we probed the intra-NC electron concentration profile to understand how depletion of electrons near the NC surface hinders NFE and what can be done to mitigate it.&nbsp;</p> <p style="text-align: left;">NCs with reduced electron scattering and sharp facets are known to have high NFE.

Indeed the LSPR response showed less electron scattering for cerium-doped indium oxide (Ce:In<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>) than the more common dopant, tin (Sn:In<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>). Moreover, we proved that fluorine can be used as a surface passivating agent to making large, cubic fluorine-doped indium oxide (F:In<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>) NCs (Figure 1b).
