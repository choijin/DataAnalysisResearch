<AbstractNarration>This award will support the travel and housing expenses of students selected to participate in the AAAI Spring Symposium on Intelligent Systems for Supporting Distributed Human Teamwork, which will be held on March 21-23, 2016, in Palo Alto, California. The symposium is part of the annual AAAI Spring Symposia series. The symposium will bring together researchers studying teamwork in different fields, including artificial intelligence, human-computer interaction, and the social sciences. For student participants, this experience will provide a unique opportunity to interact with researchers from multiple disciplines and learn about research in different fields. Students will receive feedback on their own research and will work closely with senior researchers and other students to shape a new research agenda for the development of intelligent systems for supporting human teamwork. The symposium will be a starting point for forming a new cross-disciplinary community of researchers who are interested in the development of intelligent systems for supporting teamwork. New approaches and systems for supporting teamwork are needed for supporting increasingly more complex distributed teamwork in such areas as healthcare, education and disaster relief.</AbstractNarration>

The participation of students was aimed at providing students with a unique opportunity to interact with more senior researchers from different fields and to be exposed to different research perspectives as well as at fostering increased cross-disciplinary interactions across the different communities (as the participation of students would enhance the building of a new community of researchers).  During the symposium, participants engaged in several working group sessions, which had the goal of identifying key teamwork problems and opportunities to integrate insights and methods from AI and HCI to address these problems.

Several overarching challenges to the development of effective intelligent systems emerged in these discussions. One such challenge is the need to evaluate such systems not simply in terms of accuracy or efficiency, but also in terms of their effects on people?s activities. A related challenge is the importance of ensuring that intelligent systems empower people, rather than diminish people?s sense of control or abilities.  For this to be the case will require we develop transparent systems that can clearly communicate and explain their reasoning to the people they aim to support.
