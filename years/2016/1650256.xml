<AbstractNarration>This award supports participation in six AGNES (Algebraic Geometry Northeastern Series) conferences which will be held at Stony Brook University on April 21-23, 2017, at Northeastern University in Fall 2017, at Rutgers University in Spring 2018, at Brown University in Fall 2018, at University of Massachusetts Amherst in Spring 2019, and at Boston College in Fall 2019. AGNES is a semi-annual algebraic geometry meeting organized at a rotating location by an association of northeastern universities. A guiding goal of AGNES is to introduce graduate students to a broad spectrum of current research in algebraic geometry. While meeting this goal, AGNES has become an important center for algebraic geometry in the US. The conference has an extensive record of promoting collaboration and has developed new tools for training and mentoring future leaders in algebraic geometry. These consist of graduate mini-schools, career panels, poster presentations for junior participants (including undergraduate students), and events specifically targeting members of groups that are under-represented in the mathematical sciences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Algebraic geometry is a sub-field of mathematical sciences that studies solution sets of polynomial equations. It has deep connections to many other areas of pure mathematics, such as topology, arithmetic, number theory, differential geometry, dynamical systems, and homological algebra. At the same time algebraic geometry has found important applications in applied mathematics and computer science (computer vision, geometric complexity theory, numerical methods in algebraic statistics, etc). The centerpiece research activity of each AGNES meeting will be 7-8 invited lectures given by speakers showcasing different facets of algebraic geometry. The scientific scope of AGNES will be further expanded by lectures from neighboring mathematical subjects (such as arithmetic geometry, dynamics, complex geometry, and computational geometry) and by the various supporting activities described above.
