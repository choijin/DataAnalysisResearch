<AbstractNarration>This award supports participation in the second Temple University Graduate Student Conference in Algebra, Geometry, and Topology, taking place in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on May 14-15, 2016. This conference will involve more than 90 graduate students from the East Coast and beyond, with a variety of backgrounds and research levels. The conference provides an opportunity for graduate students to develop their academic careers at an early stage by presenting mathematics in front of their peers. With thirty graduate student talks on a wide range of topics and a diversity of research interests among the plenary speakers, the conference also provides opportunities for graduate students to learn about areas of mathematical research that are not prevalent at their home universities. The conference provides unique opportunities for young mathematicians to initiate collaborative research projects and to make connections between their fields of study.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main topics of this conference are algebra, geometry, and topology broadly construed, with emphasis on interactions between these areas, including: knot theory, geometric group theory, geometric structures on manifolds, differential geometry, homotopy theory, representation theory, homological algebra, quantum invariants of manifolds, quantum groups, and algebraic geometry. The conference will feature over thirty talks by graduate students, both original research talks and expository presentations. It will also include four plenary speakers renowned for both their presentation skills and research work: Zajj Daugherty (City College of New York) in combinatorial representation theory, Jordan Ellenberg (Univeristy of Wisconsin) in arithmetic algebraic geometry, Elisenda Grigsby (Boston College) in low-dimensional topology and knot theory, and Alan Reid (University of Texas) in hyperbolic geometry and group theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Web site: https://math.temple.edu/events/gscagt</AbstractNarration>

This conference brought together 92 graduate students and 9 faculty members from universities throughout North America. The purpose of this conference was to provide graduate students from a variety of institutions and backgrounds opportunities to present their research, interact with other young mathematicians and develop new research projects, and learn about connections between different fields of mathematics.  The conference featured four faculty plenary speakers that have established successful research programs: Zajj Daughterty, Jordan Ellenberg, Elisenda Grigsby, and Alan Reid. These speakers not only delivered talks that highlighted a variety of connections between algebra, geometry, and topology, but also spent a significant amount of time interacting with graduate students beyond their talks. To help disseminate ideas beyond the participants that weekend, videotapes of the four plenary lectuers have been published on YouTube and on the conference site:  https://math.temple.edu/events/conferences/gscagt/archive-2016/index.html  In addition, to the plenary lectuers, 32 graduate students spoke about their work throughout the weekend. This gave the graduate student participants an opportunity to share their research and to practice their presentation skills.  To encourage research interaction, this conference included a number of social activities, including multiple coffee &amp; tea breaks and a conference dinner. These activities helped the student participants to form extensive mathematical connections with other students researching similar topics.
