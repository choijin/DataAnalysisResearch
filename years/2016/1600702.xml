<AbstractNarration>This project concerns the study of the set of solutions to certain systems of polynomials over the rational numbers. Polynomials are among the most basic and important functions in pure and applied mathematics, and come from iterating the basic functions of addition and multiplication on a set of variables.  The set of solutions to polynomial equations can be interpreted geometrically, and many of the shapes appearing in nature such as spheres and ellipses, can be described using them.  Polynomials and the geometric objects they describe are ubiquitous, both in pure and applied mathematics, as well as in statistics, engineering, and computer science.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An important theme in this proposal is to study polynomial equations defined over the rational numbers via reduction to positive characteristic. Much of our approach involves the use of the Frobenius morphism, but also relies on basic notions from convex geometry (e.g., cones and polytopes).  More precisely, we propose to 1) use Frobenius and convexity to study Bernstein-Sato polynomials; 2) use convexity and integration to investigate certain multiplicities in positive characteristic (e.g. F-signature and Hilbert-Kunz multiplicity); and 3) study the generalized Frobenius powers of an ideal, and relate them to test and multiplier ideals.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project was in commutative algebra, which, roughly speaking, is the study of systems of polynomial equations in a finite number of variables.  Such systems of equations are rich enough to describe and model many interesting objects, both in mathematics and the "real world", yet are also concrete enough to lend themselves well to explicit computation, say, with computers.  For this reason, commutative algebra has many applications within mathematics, and also to areas such as physics, cryptography, statistics, and biology, to name a few.  This grant was used to directly support my research in commutative algebra, and also to support visiting researchers.  Within commutative algebra, the projects completed under this grant aimed to study the precise ways in which the solutions to a system of polynomial equations in a finite number of variables can fail to be smooth.  Noteworthy results include the development of a new theory of Frobenius powers in prime characteristic, a realization of various multiplicities and limits in prime characteristic in terms of volumes of fractal-like bodies, the development of certain fundamental objects from the theory of differential operators in the non-smooth setting, and a study of local cohomology in mixed characteristic that settles a long-standing open problem in that area.  The PI also developed algorithms for the effective computations of numerical invariants measuring singularity in prime characteristic, and implemented some of these algorithms in the free and open-source computer software Macaulay2.  This new functionality has already been used by researchers in the field to test various conjectures, and to gain an overall better understanding of singularities in prime characteristic.  The broader impacts of this proposal include applications to other areas of mathematics.  Apart from this, this project supported the mentoring of undergraduate students, graduate students, and postdocs.  The PI co-organized the 2017 Cryptography and Number Theory Bootcamp REU, which served undergraduate students from underrepresented groups, gave a week-long lecture series as part of the 2017 Escuela de Onto&ntilde;o de &Aacute;lgebra Conmutativa (Fall School in Commutative Algebra), and also spoke at the 2017 SACNAS National Conference.  The PI was also a mentor with the Math Alliance, especially through their F-GAP program.  Locally, the PI co-organized the KUMUNU 2016 conference in commutative algebra, hosted by the University of Kansas.  The PI also actively mentored undergraduates at the University of Kansas throughout the period of this award, and his work in this direction was recognized with a university-wide award.  Finally, the PI also began advising a Ph.D. student during the period of this award.       Last Modified: 10/20/2020       Submitted by: Daniel J Hernandez]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
