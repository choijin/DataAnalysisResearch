<AbstractNarration>This project concerns probability models evolving and coalescing in one dimension.  Such models arise in diverse areas of application; the models in this project are taken from materials science, social science, genetics, and distributed computing.  Specific examples are: an interface between regions of liquid in a pipe; candidates sequentially dropping out of a primary election; tree-search for approximate evaluation of a Boolean function. Common to all these models is an underlying mathematical structure in which initial conditions are random, after which the evolution is governed by a non-random mechanism.  Analyses of evolutions without randomness is often considerably more difficult than analysis of those with randomness.  The focus in this project is on creating tools to circumvent this problem.  In most cases the PI seeks qualitative answers to questions such as: what does the system look like after a long time, how long does it take to reach this state, and how robust is the description to changes in the initial conditions? The project's broader impacts beyond the potential applications to the aforementioned areas, include the training of graduate students in the mathematical sciences at the University of Pennsylvania who will have opportunities to engage in research on highly non-trivial topics in probability theory. The PI will also devote some effort to improving STEM education at a broader level through the development of innovative techniques for calculus instruction and curriculum development. The PI will investigate the systematic mathematical study of certain common practices which have suffered from a lack of methodological validation, as a further broader impact.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The mathematical techniques to be used in this project involve the introduction of time reversals.  In a time reversal, randomness of initial conditions becomes randomness of the time-reversed path.  Once there is randomness in the evolution, it is possible to use techniques from Markov chains, statistical mechanics, and other applications of probability theory. There are a number of Markov chains that describe time reversals of a given system.  Suppose one's concern is to describe the time-zero distribution of a system evolving deterministically from random conditions at time minus infinity.  Among possible Markovian time-reversals, the one that describes this is the one with the maximum entropy.  The PI then plans to compute this using a variational principle.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The proposed research covered two main areas: discrete probability and analytic combinatorics.  The goals in analytic combinatorics were more than met: it turned out that we solved two problems that had been major obstacles to a systematization of work in this area dating back to 2004.  In discrete probability, our ability to solve the problems we set out was mixed.  However, as is usual in this area, we identified and solved a number of different problems, of equal value, which superseded some of the intended work.  For example, we were not able to unify a theory of deterministically evolving systems with random initial conditions; however were were able to produce some very precise results in classical percolation theory (the theory of connectivitiy properties of random graphs) that were of broad interest to people working in probability theory and statistical physics.   The volume of refereed publications emerging from the project is likely to meet our expectations.  Three papers have been accepted so far, with another four under review and several in preparation.    Another important outcome was the success of our graduate student training mission.  Four Ph.D. students were trained under this project over three years.  Two of these were successful at the highest level, going forward into research postdocs.  This is well above the recent average for us and our peer institutions.  A third got a job with a hedge fund.       Last Modified: 09/02/2019       Submitted by: Robin A Pemantle]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
