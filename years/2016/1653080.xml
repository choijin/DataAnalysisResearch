<AbstractNarration>PI: Bruns, Timothy&lt;br/&gt;Proposal #: 1653080&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is to study and develop a computer model for dorsal root ganglia (DRG). DRG are part of the nervous system next to the spinal cord. Recently, DRG are being looked at as a place to stimulate to help people with different medical conditions such as chronic pain, spinal cord injury, and amputation. Current electrodes that stimulate DRG can be improved. This would allow for increases in patient care. We believe that a greater understanding of DRG function will help lead to electrode improvements.  Two main research studies will be performed. First, small electrodes will be used in and near the DRG in animal studies. These studies will improve understanding of the signals made by DRG nerves. Second, the cell types in DRG will be studied and a computer model of the DRG will be created and validated.  This model will improve our understanding of how the DRG functions and allow for the development of treatments that can be directed towards the DRG, such as to improve pain control or impact bowel and bladder function in individuals with paralysis.  Outreach activities are planned that will expose middle school through college students to the exciting world of bioelectricity. Workshops will be held for local youths on how the nervous system works. In addition, a computer game will be created that teaches the basics of the nervous system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this project is to electrophysiologically and anatomically characterize end model dorsal root ganglia (DRG). DRG are unique nervous system structures where cell bodies for sensory neurons are concentrated next to the spinal cord. DRG have become an attractive location for therapeutic intervention, with applications ranging from chronic pain modulation to bladder control after spinal cord injury; however current electrode interfaces with DRG for clinical care and preclinical studies lack efficacy. While individual DRG neurons have been well characterized and utilized in in vitro neuroscience applications, the arrangement and electrical characteristics  f in vivo whole DRG is not understood. This project will measure in vivo electrophysiology characterization of DRG-electrode interactions&lt;br/&gt;as well as developing an in silico prediction of DRG-electrode interactions.  The model will provide the ability to predict partial- and whole-DRG activation and neural signals for electrical and sensory stimuli.  The educational objective of this proposal is to develop new and expand upon existing bioelectricity educational materials within and outside the University of Michigan by focusing on students from middle school through university level.  In addition, a mobile game will be developed that can be used to interest and education K12 students as well as the general public about neuroscience.</AbstractNarration>
