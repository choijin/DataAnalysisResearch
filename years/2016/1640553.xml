<AbstractNarration>This project is motivated by the need to develop practical strategies for broadening the participation of African American students in engineering. While inadequate college preparation is a contributing factor in the low enrollment and poor retention and graduation rates among underrepresented students in engineering programs, there is evidence that professional persistence is directly linked to identity development and social and academic interactions. For students from underrepresented groups in STEM at both Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and Predominantly White Institutions (PWIs), it is generally recognized that social capital in the form of familial, peer and mentor support is critical to persistence in their major field of study. However, the role that embedded networks within student groups in general and minority engineering affinity groups in particular play in engineering students' identity formation and academic success is not well understood. It is also not clear how other factors including institutional support and the attitudes and beliefs of faculty and staff toward underrepresented minority students affect the ability of these students to integrate into the social and academic systems at their institutions and how these factors influence the formation and development of their identities as engineers. The influence of these factors will be investigated in this project. The insight gained into the factors affecting the social and academic survival of students at PWIs and HBCUs from the psychological and anthropological perspective proposed will potentially lead to new approaches and pathways to broadening participation and improving the success of underrepresented minority students in engineering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The central objective of this interdisciplinary, interinstitutional research initiation project is to conduct a comparative study of the factors affecting the success and pathways to engineering careers of underrepresented minority students at the University of Toledo (a Predominantly White Institution (PWI)) and Alabama Agricultural and Mechanical University (a Historically Black University). Specifically, the comparative investigation will focus on three areas: 1. The attitudes and beliefs of faculty and staff toward underrepresented students and how these attitudes influence their classroom, and advising interactions and expectations, and the impact they have on the students' sense of belonging and academic success; 2. The existing institutional support mechanisms at both institutions and students' perceptions of their efficacy and the role they perceive these mechanisms play in their academic success; and 3. The influence of student organizations - specifically underrepresented Minority engineering affinity groups and the embedded networks therein on the social and academic integration of African American students at the two types of institutions. The study will be embedded in the existing literature on faculty/teacher expectations of their students, the dual process model of attitude-to-behavior processes, and achievement goal motivation theory to examine faculty implicit attitudes, students perceptions of and feelings about the institution and program, and their academic and social outcomes. Multiple sources and multiple methodologies will be used to capture the experiences of engineering students in PWI and HBCU universities, including focus-group interviews, structured and open- ended surveys, social network analysis, as well as the Implicit Association Test (IAT). The IAT will be used to assess biases that faculty may be unwilling to explicitly express because of normative pressure or because they are repressed as they conflict with an egalitarian self-image. The IAT, which uses response competition designed to measure attitudes indirectly, has been widely applied to study implicit biases against a variety of outgroups (e.g., race and gender), but has not previously been applied in the engineering education context. The results will be used to identify areas where existing practices might be improved, and to inform the design of programs and intervention strategies to improve the success of underrepresented students in engineering at both types of institutions.</AbstractNarration>

Intellectual Merit: The intellectual merit of the project was the contribution to the existing knowledge of the factors that influence the recruitment, retention and success of African American students in engineering. The insight gained into the factors affecting the social and academic survival of students at PWI and HBCUs from the psychological and anthropological perspective can be used to effect change in existing practices and can lead to new approaches and pathways to broadening participation and improving the success of underrepresented minority students in engineering.  Broader Impact: The broader impact of this project is that it addresses the national need to diversify the engineering workforce by providing insight into the broadening of participation of African Americans in engineering.  Social network analysis revealed that minority student affinity groups like the National Society of Black Engineers (NSBE) are very important to the connectedness of black engineering students in general, and those at the PWI in particular. At the PWI students also found community in other minority student groups across campus, rather than other engineering organizations which appeared to be less welcoming.

In their discussions, unlike the majority of PWI students, student narratives from the HBCU oftentimes compared their experiences to their firsthand knowledge or perceptions of what happens at PWIs versus HBCUs.  The results also demonstrate that faculty at HBCU were cognizant of societal stereotypes regarding African American engineers and therefore made explicit efforts to help students integrate their collective and professional identity. More importantly, African American faculty were role models for these students, demonstrating that African American students can develop a "relevant black personality" that allows them to "choose academic excellence yet still identify with African American culture".
