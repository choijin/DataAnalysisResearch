<AbstractNarration>This research project concerns questions at the interface between number theory and physics, in a topic called geometric representation theory.  The research uses techniques from algebra and number theory to investigate conjectures in the Langlands program, which is building bridges connecting number theory, analysis, and theoretical physics.  The project involves arc spaces, mathematical structures originally designed to study spaces with singularities and recently discovered to have fruitful applications in the Langlands program. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recent work of the investigator provides a new way to apply techniques of infinite dimensional geometry in geometric representation theory. This project aims to employ these results in a sheaf-theoretic approach to objects with representation theoretic significance that are known to be difficult to analyze on the level of functions. In a related project, these new tools will be used to construct a p-adic function-sheaf dictionary. In another direction, the research project explores a geometric approach to Lafforgue's "kernel of functoriality." Such a construction will have applications both to the classical and the geometric Langlands programs.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    The focus of my research in this period was on connections between the geometric Langlands Program and quantum physics. Here are the key outcomes:      (1) "Quantum q-Langlands Correspondence" (with Mina Aganagic and Andrei Okounkov).   In this paper, we proposed a q-deformation of the known quantum Langlands correspondence. This is a two-parameter deformation of the original geometric Langlands correspondence. We have shown that it is manifested in an explicit identification between the spaces of q-deformed conformal blocks for the deformed W-algebra Wq,t(g) and quantum affine algebra of the Langland dual Lie algebra to g. Our proof relies on expressing the q-deformed conformal blocks for both algebras in terms of the quantum K-theory of the Nakajima quiver varieties.  (2) "Spectra of quantum KdV Hamiltonians, Langlands duality, and affine opers" (with David Hernandez).      It turns out that in addition to the above two-parameter deformation, one can also define an "affinization" of the Langlands correspondence, in which the finite-dimensional Lie algebra g of the original Langlands correspondence is replaced by the corresponding affine Kac-Moody algebra g^. This affine Langlands correspondence manifests itself in the study of quantum integrable systems of KdV type, as David Hernandez and I showed in this paper.  As a bonus, we obtained a direct and uniform proof of the Bethe Ansatz equations for a large class of quantum integrable models associated to arbitrary untwisted quantum affine algebras, under a mild genericity condition.       (3) "Quantum Langlands dualities of boundary conditions, D-modules, and conformal blocks" (with Davide Gaiotto)      In this paper, we elucidated and generalized the quantum Langlands duality using the theory of boundary conditions and line operators in 4d quantum gauge theories. We explained how to associate to junctions of two boundary conditions in a 4d gauge theory a vertex algebra and how to construct these vertex algebra explicitly from the basic ones by following certain standard procedures. We also showed how modules over these vertex algebras give rise to twisted D-modules on BunG which have applications to the geometric Langlands Program. This enabled us to observe new phenomena and develop more powerful tools for future research.  (4) "Quantum Langlands Duality of Representations of W-algebras" (with Tomoyuki Arakawa)      In this joint paper, Tomoyuki Arakawa and I proved isomorphisms between two dual families of modules over the W-algebras associated to two Langlands dual groups. These isomorphisms are a crucial ingredient in the study of quantum geometric Langlands duality.                The broader impact of this project stems from its interdisciplinary nature. Indeed, it aims to advance discovery and understanding of representation theory of infinite-dimensional algebras and quantum groups, 4d quantum gauge theory and 2d conformal field theory, quantum integrable models -- diverse areas of math and quanrtum physics that are unfied by connecting the patterms of Langlands duality observed in each of these areas. One can also expect this research to stimulate the development of the Langlands Program itself by bringing in new insights from these areas.
