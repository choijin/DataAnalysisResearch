<AbstractNarration>Axial seamount is an active submarine volcano located off the west coast of the US on the Juan de Fuca midocean ridge spreading center. Axial has recently been instrumented for continuous real-time data monitoring as part of the cabled ocean observatory network of the NSF-sponsored Ocean Observatory Initiative (OOI) that includes high-quality ocean bottom seismic data, as well as an unrivaled set of seafloor geodetic and hydrothermal measurements. The seamount has erupted periodically in the past but the most recent eruption in April/May 2015 was captured by the local seismic network and provides a unique dataset with which to investigate the eruption and magmatic mechanisms associated with submarine volcanoes. The project will analyze the evolution of earthquake properties and statistical patterns in space and time, as well as how these changes are correlated with deformation and hydrothermal outputs throughout the eruption cycle. These data will be used to track changes in stress and the movement of magma within the volcanic edifice, leading to a better understanding of the mechanics of submarine volcanoes and the dynamics of eruptions on the seafloor. This project takes advantage of the recently enabled OOI Axial seamount cabled array data portal and will contribute to scientific infrastructure for undersea monitoring. The project provides research experience for community college students, undergraduates and graduate students, and training for middle-school science teachers in the areas of earthquake physics and submarine volcanic processes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will utilize the compiled Axial Seamount seismic catalog and carry out waveform analysis to assess the evolution of the volcanic system before, during and after the April and May 2015 eruption including the many linkages between earthquakes, seafloor deformation and hydrothermal activity. Stress states will be inferred by monitoring changes in seismicity rate and variations in earthquake statistical patterns. The strength of the faults and/or the movement of fluids will be constrained through earthquake source parameter studies. This project will advance three technical goals: 1) Study the evolution of stress within the volcanic crust through the 2015 eruption at Axial Seamount using a novel combination of techniques, including seismicity/stressing rate changes, earthquake stress drop measurements and seismic b-value studies. 2) Investigate the response of fault systems within the caldera to dynamic stresses in the context of their local stressing history, and by incorporating hydrothermal time series observations that provide new constraints on the role of fluids in dynamic triggering. 3) Explore the exceptional record of explosive acoustic events associated with the 2015 eruption. Although there is increasing evidence that explosive volcanism is common in the deep-sea, there are few direct observations. Understanding the distribution and scaling of these signals may transform our views on eruption dynamics in mid-ocean ridge environments.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The cabled ocean observatory network within the caldera of Axial Seamount on Juan de Fuca Ridge has provided a set of high-quality ocean bottom seismic data, as well as an unrivaled set of seafloor geodetic and hydrothermal measurements. In this project we studied the earthquake activity before, during and after the volcanic eruption that occurred in April 2015.  We used these data to investigate changes in stress and the movement of volcanic fluids to better understand the mechanics of submarine volcanoes and slip on ring faults. Our analysis focused on the evolution of earthquake processes in space and time, and how they correlated with deformation and hydrothermal outputs throughout the eruption cycle.  Specifically, our study of 423 ring-fault earthquakes of magnitude Mw &ge; 1.6 show that stress drops at Axial Seamount vary with the stage of the volcanic cycle.  We found that stress drops were on average twice as high during the inflation period (~6 MPa), compared to those during the deflation period (~3 MPa) that started at the time of the eruption.  Slightly lower stress drops were found in the northern caldera, where lower shear wave speeds have also been identified.  Additionally, we calculated changes in Coulomb Failure Stress from the approximately seventy thousand recorded microearthquakes in the magnitude range -1 &le; Mw &le; 3.6.  Through this statistical analysis, we found a peak stress change just before deflation, which was focused on the eastern and southwestern caldera walls.  An initial stress change in the north was found months prior to the eruption, while a stress decrease in the south followed the eruption.  The temporal and spatial heterogeneity we observed in stress drop and stressing rate changes indicate that the movement of magma through the volcanic cycle affects ring fault properties and the strength of the surrounding crust.  This project also provided valuable research experiences in the areas of earthquake physics and submarine volcanic processes for a graduate student at the University of New Hampshire.  It also provided a multi-day workshop for 10 middle-school science teachers in New England, which was focused on earthquakes, volcanos, and plate tectonics, with special focus on simple earthquake experiments and evidence of past earthquakes at a local field site.
