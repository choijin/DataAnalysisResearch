<AbstractNarration>Nontechnical Description: This project investigates fundamental materials issues of a new class of complex materials containing two or more metal nitrides. These materials are interesting because of their potential use in novel optoelectronic devices of importance for technological applications beneficial to society (sensing, imaging, and telecommunications). Due to their widely dissimilar physical and chemical properties, these complex compounds form a variety of unique nanostructures when grown together in thick stacks of many layers. This project aims to understand, control, and tailor the local atomic arrangement of the materials at the nanoscale to maximize light absorption in the invisible infrared range. The project also explores the effect of nanostructure on local transfer of free electrical charge. Of particular interest is the impact of the crystal orientation on optical and electrical properties. The principal investigators, students and high-school teachers involved in this project participate in outreach activities organized either in-house or at local schools to increase exposure of K-12 students and the general public to modern scientific topics at the border between physics, material science, and engineering. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Description: The main objective of this project is to establish the relationship between growth, atomic structure and infrared optical properties of AlIn(Ga)N/(In)GaN multi-quantum well structures grown by plasma-assisted molecular beam epitaxy on c- and m-plane GaN. The project particularly focuses on unraveling the impact of nanostructure on infrared intersubband absorption, a property that is essential for the application of these materials in novel infrared optoelectronics (emitters and detectors). The research effort involves material design and growth, as well as structural and optical material characterization of AlIn(Ga)N/(In)GaN heterostructures. The growth of nitride heterostructures advances the state-of-the-art in nitride epitaxy. In order to correlate the nanostructure with optical properties, the atomic structure of the semiconductor materials is characterized in detail using high-resolution x-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy, while the infrared optical properties of the materials are examined experimentally using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. A secondary goal is  developing of predictive material modeling capabilities that enable conduction-band engineering for light emission. The research project also increases the learning opportunities for students, inside and outside the traditional classroom by integrating interdisciplinary research with broader physics and engineering education and training. The students involved in this project have the opportunity to acquire experience with the latest nanomaterials fabrication and characterization tools and techniques. A special thrust of the proposed outreach plan is enhancement the participation of underrepresented groups, in particular of females, in physical sciences and engineering.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This project investigated fundamental materials issues of a new class of complex materials containing two or more metal nitrides. These semiconducting materials are interesting because of their potential use in novel optoelectronic devices of importance for technological applications beneficial to society (sensing, imaging, and telecommunications). Due to the widely dissimilar physical and chemical properties of the constituent metals (gallium, indium, and aluminum), these complex compounds form a variety of unique nanostructures when grown together in thick stacks of many layers. This project aimed to understand, control, and tailor the local atomic arrangement of the materials at the nanoscale to maximize light absorption in the invisible infrared range. The project also explored the effect of nanostructure on local transfer of free electrical charge. Of particular interest was the impact of the crystal orientation on optical and electrical properties.</p> <p>This project established the relationship between growth, atomic structure and infrared optical properties of novel (In)AlGaN/(In)GaN semiconductor materials on two drastically different crystal orientations (c-plane and m-plane). The materials consisted in stacks of extremely thin (nanometer thick) layers with different electronic properties that confine the electrons to a set of desirable discrete energy levels. The structures were assembled using an ultra-high vacuum growth technique called plasma-assisted Molecular Beam Epitaxy (MBE). We primarily focused on understanding and controlling the impact of atomic structure on infrared optical absorption, the property most relevant for the use of these materials in novel infrared optoelectronics (emitters and detectors). To this end, the structure of the materials was characterized with a variety of techniques including high-resolution electron microscopy and x-ray diffraction.</p> <p>Our research first contributed to the fundamental understanding of MBE growth of c-plane lattice-matched nitrides, their band structure design for infrared optoelectronics, and infrared optical properties. The indium incorporation dynamics in bulk AlInN and AlInN/GaN superlattices, and the evolution of phase separation in c-plane AlInN were explored in detail and elucidated. Then, the research effort focused on the relatively unknown m-plane crystal orientation. We discovered a kinetic instability of AlGaN alloys during MBE growth on m-plane GaN under metal-rich conditions. The impact of growth conditions and strain on indium incorporation in non-polar m-plane InGaN grown by MBE was also systematically investigated. Most surprisingly, indium surfactant was found to considerably alter the composition and morphology of low-temperature non-polar m-plane AlGaN, and of silicon-doped AlGaN/InGaN multiple quantum wells grown by MBE. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of m-plane AlGaN/InGaN structures with high indium composition, and the first demonstration of m-plane AlGaN/InGaN structures grown with an indium surfactant.</p> <p>The structural studies were complemented by optical characterization with photoluminescence and infrared absorption. We performed the first in-depth photoluminescence study of non-polar m-plane InGaN and nearly strain-balanced InGaN/AlGaN superlattices grown by MBE.</p> <p>The program contributed to the education and training of four science and engineering graduate students and three undergraduate students at Purdue. The research results were disseminated to the science community through 17 invited and/or contributed talks, and 7 refereed papers. The project memebers also participated in outreach activities that bring science and engineering to elementary school children.</p> <p>The investigators and graduate students developed and performed outreach activities for the summer camp for middle-school students ?Physics Inside Out? that took place in the Department of Physics and Astronomy at Purdue University in July 2017, 2018, and 2019 (West Lafayette, IN). The middle-school students used diffraction glasses (i.e. diffraction gratings) to visualize the spectral content of white light and different color laser pointers. They also used long-wavelength infrared (FLIR) cameras to actually see the world in a different light, the infrared light. The students learned about the dual nature of light, particle and wave, and discussed applications of light diffraction in nature and technology.</p> <p>The researchers also organized and conducted outreach activities at Imagination Station, a local children?s museum in West Lafayette, IN. The activities introduced children age 4-12 to hands-on optics experiments involving light reflection, refraction, color formation, optical illusions and other physical phenomena. The children used visible and ?invisible? ultraviolet and infrared light. Specifically, the children were able to view the world through and take pictures with two commercial (FLIR) infrared cameras.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 08/13/2020<br>      Modified by: Oana&nbsp;Malis</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1610893/1610893_10435809_1597326824683_InAlN_honeycomb--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1610893/1610893_10435809_1597326824683_InAlN_honeycomb--rgov-800width.jpg" title="InAlN honeycomb structure"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1610893/1610893_10435809_1597326824683_InAlN_honeycomb--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="InAlN honeycomb structure"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Plan-view STEM images taken of AlInN films grown at a series different growth conditions</div> <div class="imageCredit">Oana Malis</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Creative Commons</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Oana&nbsp;Malis</div> <div class="imageTitle">InAlN honeycomb structure</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1610893/1610893_10435809_1597326934384_AlGaN_kinetic_instability--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1610893/1610893_10435809_1597326934384_AlGaN_kinetic_instability--rgov-800width.jpg" title="AlGaN kinetic instability"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1610893/1610893_10435809_1597326934384_AlGaN_kinetic_instability--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="AlGaN kinetic instability"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Experimental evidence and modeling of novel m-plane AlGaN growth instability</div> <div class="imageCredit">Oana Malis</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Oana&nbsp;Malis</div> <div class="imageTitle">AlGaN kinetic instability</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1610893/1610893_10435809_1597327058188_Outreach1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1610893/1610893_10435809_1597327058188_Outreach1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Public outreach at Imagination station"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1610893/1610893_10435809_1597327058188_Outreach1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Public outreach at Imagination station"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Outreach at Imagination Station, Lafayette, IN: children performing experiments involving color mixing and �invisible� light.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Oana Malis</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Oana&nbsp;Malis</div> <div class="imageTitle">Public outreach at Imagination station</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1610893/1610893_10435809_1597327136750_Outreach2--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1610893/1610893_10435809_1597327136750_Outreach2--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Public outreach at Purdue University"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1610893/1610893_10435809_1597327136750_Outreach2--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Public outreach at Purdue University"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Students at the middle-school summer camp �Physics Inside Out� (July 2018) performing experiments with an infrared camera.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Oana Malis</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Oana&nbsp;Malis</div> <div class="imageTitle">Public outreach at Purdue University</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
