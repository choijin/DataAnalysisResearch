<AbstractNarration>The FIELD Project will examine and address factors of geoscience field activity that limit participation by groups underrepresented in STEM fields.  Field activity, including activity conducted outdoors, in remote locations, or away from a student or scientist's home institution, is an integral part of both education and research on the geosciences.  However, many underrepresented groups find field activity fraught with excessive barriers limiting their participation in this essential aspect of the geosciences.  Geoscience fieldwork remains dominated by white males. Individuals who are underrepresented in STEM (e.g. people with disabilities, minorities, women, LGBTQ individuals), face barriers with field activity including economic exclusion, anxiety about outdoor experiences, attitudes of ableism, sexual harassment/assault, and reduced accessibility in unfamiliar environments.  Our team will systematically examine the field activity experience and identify specific factors contributing to the exclusionary nature of field work in the geosciences.  Our findings will be beneficial across educational levels and disciplines as individuals in any field setting, from pre-college to senior faculty, can encounter similar barriers.  Additionally, the results of this study will be applicable to any discipline with a field component, such as biology, ecology, archaeology, anthropology, or military science.  &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The FIELD Project centers on the "FIELD Institute", a five day gathering of experienced geoscientists, in a field setting, to examine why field activity is exclusionary.  The FIELD Project team foresees development of three significant outcomes during the course of study.  The first will be an assessment of the barriers associated with field activity conducted before the FIELD Institute. The results of this assessment will reveal the nature and extent of exclusion that can then be disseminated. These results will guide planning of the FIELD Institute's professional development program. The second outcome will be the opportunity for leaders from 10 institutions to develop and implement new practices developed during the FIELD Institute for making the field activity more accessible and welcoming to women, underrepresented groups, LGBTQ individuals, people with disabilities, low-income students, and individuals representing more than one of these identities. The third outcome will be a guide developed during the FIELD Institute documenting these best practices for widespread dissemination. Although intended for the geosciences, this guide will undoubtedly be applicable to additional STEM disciplines with a similar field component.</AbstractNarration>

More than 400 hours of participant-observation and 40 interviews were conducted. Collaborative qualitative analysis of this data revealed cultural qualities of fieldwork that could be wielded for engagement and inclusion or for marginalization and exclusion: the erosion of usual temporal, spatial, and interactional boundaries in the field; the challenging conditions and physicality of field science; and the prominent role of alcohol. These qualities reinforced expectations of informality, toughness, and togetherness in the field, and such expectations in turn reinforced a narrow, gendered prototype of a good geoscientist. Even in courses where women were well represented, these expectations combined with everyday communication patterns led to men dominating the learning environment. Mental health, physical disabilities, physical fitness, and prior outdoor experience intersected with gender to shape a sense of belonging in the field. Due to the mostly white composition of many field courses, including the ones that we studied, research studies to document racialized aspects of conventional fieldwork will require methods other than ethnography or a focus on field settings that purposefully engage students from minoritized groups. Results of this work are presented in two journal manuscripts (forthcoming in geoscience and education journals), one book chapter, and a blog post for the AGU Career Center.</span></p> <p dir="ltr"><strong>The FIELD Institute and its Outcomes</strong></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>The FIELD pilot builds on years of work by individuals and small groups, including within the project leadership team, to effect improvements in the geosciences toward equity and inclusion.

To foster experiential learning, the institute was designed to elicit some of the same cultural qualities that might occur in the field, such as scheduling it at a high-altitude field station. Participants were led through skill and perspective building activities, as well as collaborative action planning exercises, to implement specific changes on their own campuses. External evaluation found that participants made progress in adopting inclusive practices for field courses, though challenges included resistance from some faculty colleagues and need for additional resources. These outcomes indicate a need for further work that thinks about changes to field courses within a broader agenda of institutional or systemic change. The institute attracted many more applications than our site could accommodate, indicating broad awareness and interest in remediating inequitable field-based learning opportunities.</span></p> <p dir="ltr"><strong>Theoretical Developments Toward Equity in Science</strong></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>Research outcomes and lessons from the FIELD Institute contributed to the development of a new theory of organizational change toward equity in science that was published by Stanford University Press in 2020. This theory brings principles from quantum physics to mainstream theories of organizational change, which have long been implicitly dominated by ideas from classical physics. FIELD's evidence about the immersive nature of field science makes plain that scientists are part of the systems they study, and this insight aligns with the quantum physics principle that scientists are not separate, objective observers of the reality they study. Applied to the study of equity efforts in scientific organizations like field courses, scientists must similarly be recognized as embedded in and entangled with the communities and cultures they are trying to change. This embeddedness means that, without care, problematic norms and practices within scientific communities may also be present within change efforts themselves. Teams working toward change require diverse perspectives, individuals with the capacity for translating across differences to enable understanding, an attitude of cultural humility, and ongoing attention to the ways that power and identity are shaping organizational change efforts.</span></p> <div><span><br /></span></div> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 07/29/2020<br>      Modified by: Julie&nbsp;Posselt</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1645456/1645456_10475384_1596044286843_Report2--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1645456/1645456_10475384_1596044286843_Report2--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Fieldwork on Fieldwork"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1645456/1645456_10475384_1596044286843_Report2--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Fieldwork on Fieldwork"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">An important aspect of this project's intellectual merit is the development of rigorous empirical research about everyday interactions in the field that can impede or encourage student engagement and a sense of belonging.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Julie Posselt</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Julie&nbsp;Posselt</div> <div class="imageTitle">Fieldwork on Fieldwork</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1645456/1645456_10475384_1596044757314_2017-06-2011.34.52--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1645456/1645456_10475384_1596044757314_2017-06-2011.34.52--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Becoming Part of the Landscape"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1645456/1645456_10475384_1596044757314_2017-06-2011.34.52--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Becoming Part of the Landscape"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">A new theory of organizational change toward equity in the sciences was inspired in part by the FIELD project.
