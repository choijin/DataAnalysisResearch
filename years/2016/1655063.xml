<AbstractNarration>The goal of National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) is to advance the ability of scientists to examine and understand the environment at a continental scale. Specimens and samples that complement automated measurements and observations on the ground will be collected at 34 aquatic and 47 terrestrial sites across the U.S. and Puerto Rico. The vast majority of samples and specimens collected by NEON will be held at external facilities that will be responsible for their long-term curation and accessibility for research. Following best practices for collections maximizes the long-term value of the samples, specimens, and data for research, including for addressing questions beyond those presently envisioned. So, it is critical that community efforts leverage best-practices.  With support from this award, A two-day workshop will be held in mid-November 2016, at the NEON offices in Boulder, Colorado, to bring together staff of NEON, other representatives of the ecological community, and biodiversity collections experts to address management of samples and data from the time they are collected in the field to curation, digitization, and research use. These guidelines will be broadly applicable to other ecologists planning on providing specimens and digitized data to institutions holding biodiversity collections.  The workshop will bring together the ecology and biodiversity collections communities to engender a better understanding by biodiversity collections staff of the goals and scientific value of NEON and a better understanding by NEON of the goals and scientific value of biodiversity collections.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Presentations by NEON staff and others selected by NEON will explain the field-collection protocols and methods, strategies and methods for transferring samples and data to Bioarchive institutions, and anticipated use of samples and data. Presentations by collections experts will cover protocols for receiving samples, storing, databasing (to include, as a minimum, taxonomy, locality, date, collectors, habitat and other data provided by ecologists; assignment of unique identifiers), mobilization of data to iDigBio or other data aggregators, making samples and data available from the Bioarchive institutions (including referencing across institutions), attribution, and estimates of the costs of managing samples and data by institutional collections. From the workshop, guidelines and recommended practices for managing samples, specimens, and data in preparation for submission to repositories will be developed and shared across NEON.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) provides open, continental-scale data that characterize and quantify complex, rapidly changing ecological processes. Specimens and samples that complement automated measurements and observations on the ground are collected and may be requested by researchers for further analysis. Specimens and samples collected by NEON are archived and curated at NEON and external facilities. External archival and curation facilities, such as museums, are essential for validation processes and continued research purposes. The vast majority of these specimens and samples will be held at external facilities that will curate and administer loans of NEON samples and specimens.  The NSF-funded workshop, "NEON Bioarchive&mdash;Bridging the Ecological and Collections Communities," brought together ecologists and other staff from NEON/Battelle with biodiversity collections experts to suggest NEON-specific guidelines for managing physical samples and associated data to be deposited in institutional repositories and to develop information and guidelines to be considered by NEON in developing RFPs or contracts with collections-holding institutions.  At the workshop, NEON/Battelle staff presented information on the rationale and protocols -- including preservation techniques for samples to be collected, and biodiversity collections staff described accepted methods for management of samples from the time they are collected in the field to curation, digitization, and use. Presentations included information on assignment of field identifiers, handling and shipping specimens to institutions, curation (including sorting, identifying or checking identifications, cataloguing, labeling, storage), digitization (databasing, georeferencing, imaging), use of samples (making and tracking loans; destructive sampling), providing data associated with samples to users and estimates of institutional costs of managing samples and data.  On the second day of the workshop breakout groups addressed NEON-specific issues for managing physical samples and associated data in preparation for submission to repositories. These topics were addressed for six categories of sample types and topics: small mammals; insects and mites; plants, soil, and leaf litter; aquatic samples; cryo/frozen archives; and identifiers and data management. Some estimated costs related to permanent storage of samples were provided; however, costs are likely to vary greatly depending on the architecture of the bioarchive (a single institution vs. a consortium of institutions, vs. several independently contracted institutions), as well as variations in local costs and methods, institutional policies, interests of institutions in the samples, and inherent abilities of institutions to meet expectations of NEON.
