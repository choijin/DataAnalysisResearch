<AbstractNarration>The low capacitance density of electrolytic capacitors is becoming a limiting factor on circuit board profile and circuit performance. The capacitance density of the current generation of electric double layer supercapacitors is several orders of magnitude higher, but they are limited to a charge-discharge rate of about 1 second, or a characteristic frequency of 1 hertz, and thus not suitable for those circuit applications requiring capacitors that must run in the hundreds of hertz to kilohertz range. In other words, there exists a significant performance gap, in terms of capacitance/frequency, between currently available supercapacitor and traditional circuit capacitor technologies. The proposed research addresses this performance gap through studies aimed at developing ultrafast supercapacitors with novel nanostructured electrodes and a high capacitance density that run in the hundreds of hertz to kilohertz range and are suitable for circuit applications. This research, if successful, will bring about disruptive change in capacitor design and ground-breaking applications in crucial circuit functions like decoupling, timing, filtering, and power supply and conditioning. The proposed nanostructured electrodes can additionally be utilized in battery and electrocatalyst applications. Education and outreach activities are integrated in this project for the training of undergraduate and graduate students. In addition to supported Research Experiences for Undergraduates program students, several undergraduate students will be involved in the project through their Project Lab course work, to inspire their interest in advanced studies. Attention will be paid to recruiting female and minority students, particularly first-generation college students, to secure diversity and broad participation. An outreach component on nanomaterials for energy technologies will be developed to educate students who will serve as ambassadors in subsequent outreach efforts coordinated by the T-STEM Center of Texas Tech University.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research will characterize and demonstrate high-density capacitors running in the hundreds of hertz to kilohertz frequency range. This represents a disruptive advance in capacitor technology for compact and efficient ultrafast electric double layer capacitors as discrete components, for line-frequency alternating current filtering, and on-chip integrated high-density micro-capacitor needs. The proposed electrode is based on perpendicularly edge-oriented multilayer graphene grown on a cellulose nanofiber scaffold. This novel material has a shallow, straight forward, wide-open pore structure that ensures high frequency response while its large specific surface area and especially high density of fully exposed graphene edges offer the possibility of large capacitance. Edge-oriented multilayer graphene growth and cellulose fiber carbonization into carbon nanofiber are implemented in a process that requires only a few minutes' time. The ultrafast electric double layer capacitors based on this new material could allow at least two orders of volume reduction compared to low-voltage aluminum electrolytic capacitors for filtering. The resulting freestanding electrodes can also be transferred to a substrate or an integrated circuit chip for in-package or on-chip capacitor integration. This project comprises comprehensive nanomaterial and charge storage studies, device modeling, fabrication and performance testing. If successful, it will ultimately bridge the frequency/capacitance gap between existing circuit capacitors and supercapacitors. The outcomes of this study will in addition enhance understanding in the areas of related materials and devices.</AbstractNarration>

The currently available electrochemical capacitors, or supercapacitors, although have a capacitance density several orders of magnitude larger than AECs, but can only run up to a characteristic frequency of 1 hertz (Hz), above which, they behaves more like a resistor, not a capacitor.

To meet the demanding requirements of both high capacitance density and high response frequency, the project was focused on designing and investigating several nanostructures that provide both high specific surface area for high capacitance density and high electric conductivity for high frequency response. Electrolyte, both aqueous and organic based, were also studied since it is another key component in determining the frequency response.

In the following, we list a few key outcomes of this project.  By fabricating intrinsically interconnected carbon nanofiber-based carbon nanoweb structure, which was converted from biopolymer nanofibers with a diameter 20-50 nm through our rapid plasma carbonization process to control the porous structure, we achieved high-performance HF-ECs in terms of capacitance density, characteristic frequency, and phase angle at 120 Hz. By studying vertical graphene deposition in carbonized metal organic structure (MOF) in a less than 10 minutes rapid process, we demonstrated HF-ECs exhibiting very low equivalent ESR of 40 &#8203;m&Omega; &#8203;cm&minus;2 and attractive cell capacitance of 1.02 &#8203;mF &#8203;cm&minus;2 and phase angle of &minus;85.9? or 2.34 &#8203;mF &#8203;cm&minus;2 and -80.6? at 120 &#8203;Hz, which are the best reported overall performances thus far. The proof-of-concept HF-EC devices were incorporated into circuits to demonstrate their alternative current (AC) filtering capability and pulse power (energy) storage capability, suggesting the potential of these HF-ECs in substitution of AECs in practical circuits. Four Ph.D students (including one female) and one Master student were trained in this project. Four undergraduate students, including female and minority, were also involved in the study.  Eleven papers were published and multiple conference or invited presentations were made to disseminate the findings of this research. A U.S. patent application ?High Frequency Supercapacitors and Methods of Making Same? was filed and was very recently allowed.  The technology developed in this project was licensed to a small business for commercialization.              Last Modified: 10/10/2020       Submitted by: Zhaoyang Fan]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
