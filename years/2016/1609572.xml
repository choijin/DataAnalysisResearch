<AbstractNarration>The Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program of the Division of Chemistry supports Dr. Benjamin Lear from the Pennsylvania State University, University Park.  Dr. Lear's project characterizes the interactions between metallic nanoparticles and their surrounding environment. Metallic nanoparticles are extremely small particles of metal where at least one of the structural dimensions (length, width or thickness) is in the nanometer size range (1 to 100 nm).  Metallic nanoparticles have a wide range of applications including chemical manufacturing, electronics design, and cancer treatment.  In these applications, the environment near the nanoparticle surface can be quite diverse. Little is known about how these changes in environment affect the desirable electronic properties of the nanoparticles. This project develops and applies a new technique to understand the effects of the surrounding environment on the electronic properties of metal nanoparticles. The results of this research will lead to the development of new advanced technologies where the nanoparticle and surrounding environment interactions are optimized. As part of this project, Dr. Lear has multiple high school students working in his lab as part of a Pennsylvania State University outreach program that provides training to students from "at risk" schools.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project examines the influence of surface chemistry and chemical environments on the electronic structure of small (diameters of about 2 nm) gold nanoparticles (AuNPs). A large set of surface chemistries are examined, and the properties of the nanoparticles are studied using x-ray powder diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), electrochemistry, and conduction electron spin resonance (CESR). CESR provides a sensitive and selective probe of the electronic environment experienced by electrons near the Fermi energy within the metallic core. This project establishes the mechanism for the CESR response to changes in surface chemistry. Furthermore, this project explores the sensitivity of AuNPs to changes in their local environment by exploring the effects of changes in solvent, electrochemical potential, and ligands. A detailed understanding of the synergistic relationship between the electronics and surface chemistry of metals are critical for advances in device design and development. The project funding also support the involvement of high school students from "at risk" schools in cutting edge science aimed at understanding how surface chemistry affect electronic properties of metals.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ To a large extent, it is the behavior of electrons in a metal that determines their utility and value. For instance, electron mobility determines as electrical conductivity and electron energy can be linked to function as a catalyst. In this project, we sought to develop a new tool for probing the properties of electrons in nanoscale metals, and then to determine how the chemical environment around nanoscale metals could be used to tune them.  With regards to the new tool, we developed conduction electron spin resonance as a tool for looking at those electrons most closely tied to the electronic behaviors of interest. This tool is based upon isolating the subset of most mobile electrons and then probing them via a property known as ‘spin.’  This property is what lends materials their magnetism, and our tool exploits this magnetism for our measurement. In the course of the project, we were able to show that (i) our probe is sensitive and selective for the most mobile electrons in metals and (ii) it is generally applicable across a wide range of metallic systems.  Thus, the first scientific outcome of this project was a new and useful tool for investigating the behavior of nanoscale metals.  Regarding the ability of chemical environment to tune electronic behaviors of nanoscale materials, we were able to show that the behavior of the mobile electrons is extremely sensitive to chemical environment.  Indeed, the electrons in metals respond to changes in chemical environment that are often too subtle to impact the behavior molecular systems.  In addition, we were able to generate a mathematical model that predicts these chemical effects.  Thus, the second scientific outcome our work produced a rational framework that can be used to design new systems.  In total, the scientific outcomes were the demonstration that chemical environment is a parameter of importance in designing nanotechnology and the production of a model that can be used to aid in future designs.  Beyond scientific outcomes, this project also functioned to aid in the scientific education of high school students across Pennsylvania.  During the course of this project, we welcomed nearly two dozen students into our laboratory, having them actively participate for weeks at a time in the cutting edge research described above.  Thus, one outcome of this work was the early exposure of potential scientists and engineers to modern science---with the hope that they might be inspired to pursue a career in science, technology, engineering, or math.
