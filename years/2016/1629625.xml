<AbstractNarration>Today's datacenters enable a wide range of applications with diverse service-level &lt;br/&gt;objectives (SLOs), e.g., user-facing applications such as web searches and disaster &lt;br/&gt;recoveries that require real-time or near-real-time responses, calling for stringent job &lt;br/&gt;latency and throughput guarantees. However, due to the lack of a proper abstraction, &lt;br/&gt;the existing SLO-aware job resource provisioning approaches are platform dependent &lt;br/&gt;and trial-and-error by design. The proposed solution presents a new abstraction that &lt;br/&gt;provides an effective separation of concerns and thus makes it possible to develop &lt;br/&gt;platform-independent, portable algorithms that translate diverse job SLOs into exact &lt;br/&gt;performance objectives (a.k.a. budgets) for constituent tasks, resulting in &lt;br/&gt;SLO-guaranteed job resource provisioning. The approach proposed can be proven &lt;br/&gt;by design and is expected to provide (a) important insights into computer systems &lt;br/&gt;and architecture designs with high performance guarantees and cost-effectiveness; &lt;br/&gt;and  (b) significant improvements in performance guarantees and resource utilization, &lt;br/&gt;and the reduction of operating cost for the increasingly popular cloud computing &lt;br/&gt;environment. It is also expected to encourage academia-and-industry,interdisciplinary &lt;br/&gt;and cross-layer collaborations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research develops a sound theoretical foundation to enable &lt;br/&gt;SLO-guaranteed job resource provisioning. It explores fundamental design principles &lt;br/&gt;and is cross-layer by design, involving a two-layer design, from applications to runtime &lt;br/&gt;system and system architecture. At the upper, application layer, with any given job &lt;br/&gt;workflow represented in the form of Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs), the job SLOs are &lt;br/&gt;translated into precise latency budgets for individual task nodes in the DAG, independent &lt;br/&gt;of the underlying system to be used to run the job. At the lower, runtime system layer, the &lt;br/&gt;subsystems for individual task nodes are selected and the resources are allocated to meet &lt;br/&gt;all the task performance budgets and hence the job SLOs. This proposed research will &lt;br/&gt;enable us to develop job resource provisioning algorithms with SLO guarantee, while &lt;br/&gt;allowing for service consolidation and achieving high datacenter resource utilization.</AbstractNarration>
