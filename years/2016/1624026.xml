<AbstractNarration>This project aims to help organizations and individuals save time and money by providing training, support, and feedback to "unexpected writers." Unexpected writers are those scientists, IT specialists, engineers and others whose primary activity involves a technical specialty but who spend disproportionate amounts of their time writing, sometimes ineffectively. Organizations often categorize the writing problem in terms of correctness. Through initial customer discovery, this I-Corps team learned that potential customers would be interested in a software solution that provides just-in-time help with mission-critical documents; this software would address pain points and save significant resources for many organizations, whether they be for-profit, non-profit, governmental, or academic. In particular, writers could spend less time writing and provide better results if given help in making good structural choices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed product will significantly mitigate, if not eliminate, the many pain points identified among potential customers. Technical specialists who are not trained professional writers take longer to perform writing tasks and frequently produce documents of low and/or erratic quality, costing their organizations and themselves significant time and money. This project's system, built in close consultation with potential customers, allows technical specialists to spend less time on their writing tasks (by just-in-time guidance and other tools that will bind their texts to organizational guidelines) and thus spend more time on their scientific work. This will improve productivity and efficiency, help organizations better fulfill their mission, and increase organizations' useful, structurally meaningful and reusable content.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This NSF I-Corps project was funded to test the viability of our hypotheses related to the development of software tools to assist with the writing of technical documents.  At the beginning of the project, we had a vague idea that some sort of software support would help our existing clients (primarily engineers and scientists) who have taken our in-person workshops.  Scientists and engineers are frequently not the strongest writers, and as a result we have had a thriving practice offering workshops to regional companies.  But we feared that any writing improvements driven by the workshops were lost soon after the workshop was over.  But we weren?t sure if 1) this kind of support could be provided in a scalable fashion that would be purchased by workshop attendees and other writers at large, and 2) what form the software support should take in terms of features, platforms, etc.   Through the 100+ interviews we conducted as part of the I-Corps process (along with the additional 100 interviews we conducted before starting I-Corps) we were able to verify our central hypothesis: "Engineers and scientists, regardless of whether they have taken our training, will purchase inexpensive software plugins that will help them produce higher quality writing with less effort."  We were also able to drill down significantly on a Minimum Viable Product, a Google Chrome plugin that will assist writers of technical documents in promoting clarity, conciseness, and simplicity, thus better serving their readers.  We found the I-Corps process immensely valuable to the creation of our product, and we feel certain that our product, as it iterates in response to customer demand, can have a significant impact on the quality of the technical writing produced by the scientists and engineers who write them.
