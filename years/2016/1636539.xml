<AbstractNarration>This workshop will bring together researchers from around the world to discuss recent progress in the study of Quantum Turbulence and to explore future directions.  The development of new imaging techniques, such as the use of tracer particles or metastable He, coupled with more powerful visualization techniques has lead to much recent progress.  Accompanying this, the development of more powerful computational resources have lead to comparable advances in modeling.  This workshop will allow researchers in both quantum and classical turbulence to share ideas and explore new research directions.  A significant fraction of the attendees will be young researchers (graduate students, postdocs and new faculty) and the workshop will provide an opportunity for them to interact with more seasoned researchers.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The major goal of the project is to organize a three-day international workshop on Quantum Turbulence at the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory (NHMFL) in Tallahassee at Florida State University. The plan is to bring together researchers involved in various aspects of quantum turbulence as well as some leading experts from classical turbulence research field to discuss recent&nbsp;progresses in quantum turbulence and its connections to classical turbulence, to exchange ideas on future research directions, and to develop collaborations. It is proposed that the workshop will attract about 50 participants worldwide and will be by invitation only. It is expected that about 50% of the participants will be junior researchers, such as interested graduate students and post-docs so that these junior researchers can have the opportunity to interact with eminent scientists in quantum and classical fluid fields.&nbsp;An important merit of this small invited-attendee workshop is that it provides an environment for more focused exchanges in quantum turbulence and related fields than normally occur at major national and international conferences. Furthermore, meeting the challenges associated with quantum turbulence calls for effective collaboration between experimental low-temperature physicists and experimental and theoretical experts in fluid mechanics, and such collaboration is best developed in a workshop.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>This Quantum Turbulence Workshop was successfully organized at the NHMFL conference room on&nbsp;April 10-12, 2017 by the PI Dr. Guo with the help from the co-organizer Dr. Vinen from Birmingham University in United Kingdom. Besides the conference grant support from the NSF Condensed Matter Physics program, financial and administrative resources from Florida State University, the NHMFL, and the&nbsp;Florida Center for Advanced Aero-Propulsion&nbsp;(FCAAP) were also received. 49 participants (including 19 junior researchers) from eight different countries attended the workshop. We received 46 abstracts for presentations and posters, from which the oral presentations were selected.&nbsp;The complete workshop agenda is included as a supporting image. The major outcomes of the workshop include: 1) We have accommodated 27 selected oral presentations (30 minute each) presented by senior researchers and postdocs, and 3 oral presentations on selected posters (20 minutes each) presented by graduate students. 2) An one-hour poster session was held following the lunch time every day. 3) We have arranged 8 discussion sessions (30 minute each) led by selected scientists, each focusing on a specific topic in quantum turbulence. 4) A special discussion session about funding opportunities, involving Dr. Matthew Munson the Fluid Dynamics Program Manager at the U.S. Army Research Office, was arranged. 5) A dinner talk, titled "Astronomy in Homer's Odyssey", was presented by Prof. Itamar Procaccia from the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel. 6) We have also arranged tours for the workshop participants at the NHMFL and the&nbsp;FCAAP facilities on April 11th. 7) In order to share the presentations, posters, and the photos taken during the workshop, a webpage has been created to post the relevant files. The link of the webpage is: <a href="https://eng.fsu.edu/~wguo/QT-workshop/" target="_blank">https://eng.fsu.edu/~wguo/QT-workshop/</a></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Regarding the broader impacts of the workshop, it has successfully attracted researchers from different fields and provided a platform for their interactions and for developing collaborations. For instance, we have participants who work actively in quantum turbulence field such as&nbsp;A. Golov (Manchester Univ.),&nbsp;W.F. Vinen (Univ. Birmingham),&nbsp;D. Lathrop (Univ. Maryland). We also have researchers from related quantum fluid&nbsp;field&nbsp;such as&nbsp;P. Taborek&nbsp;(UC Irvine) and&nbsp;Y. Lee (Univ. Florida) as well as classical fluid researchers such as&nbsp;W. Irvine (Univ. Chichago),&nbsp;D. W. Sumners (Florida State Univ.), and&nbsp;Y. Tsuji (Nagoya Univ.). This workshop has provided junior researchers a platform to interact with eminent scientists of quantum and classical fluids. These interactions will stimulate their interests in these fields.
