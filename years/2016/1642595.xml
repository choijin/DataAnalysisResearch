<AbstractNarration>This award provides support for the CBMS conference "Dyson-Schwinger Equations, Topological Expansions, and Random Matrices," which will run from August 28 to September 1, 2017 at Columbia University in New York City.  The conference features a series of ten lectures by mathematician Alice Guionnet. Probability, as a field, seeks to understand how large, complex random systems manifest deterministic behaviors, and universal fluctuations around them. Matrices are fundamental objects in mathematics and all of science -- they encode transformations of space, descriptions of atoms in physics, chains of chemical reactions and probabilities in chemistry, and series of observations in experimental sciences, and they are vital in signal processing. In many applications, there is noise present in the system under study, and the associated matrices end up having structured but random entries. The fundamental challenge becomes to understand the effect of noise on these structures. How does it change the key properties of these objects, and how can statistical methods be developed to separate the signal from the noise? The principal lecture series will report on some of the most exciting new advances in tackling these types of questions. The meeting also will include presentations by other experts in the subject area.  There will also be daily tutorials and problem sessions, with lecture notes provided in advance to help students prepare adequately.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Understanding the large-dimension asymptotics of random matrices or related models such as random tilings has been of great interest for the last twenty years within probability, mathematical physics, and statistical mechanics. Because such models are highly correlated, classical methods based on independent variables fail. Special cases have been studied in detail thanks to specific forms of the laws, such as determinantal laws. These lectures will discuss a general class of models using the so-called Dyson-Schwinger equations and generalizations. The ten lectures cover the following subjects: law of large numbers in random matrices and concentration of measure; central limit theorem in the one-cut case; generalization to the discrete setting of tiling models; topological expansions for large-N asymptotics of partition functions; and generalization to several-cut models.  Additional talks will be presented by Charles Bordenave (University of Toulouse), Gaetan Borot (Max Planck Institute for Mathematics, Bonn), Paul Bourgade (New York University), Vadim Gorin (Massachusetts Institute of Technology), and Antti Knowles (ETH Zurich).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The website for this conference is: http://www.math.columbia.edu/department/probability/seminar/Guionnet.html</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  This conference brought together over 80 researchers and students from the US and Europe with the purpose of understanding the new technique of Dyson-Schwinger equations as applied to mathematics and physics.  The NSF grant funded lodging and travel for 34 junior participants (graduate students and postdocs) as well as catered breakfast, coffee, and lunch for participants to stimulate deeper collaborations and discussions.  Five of the junior participants were female (Yu, Kim, Nguyen, Tatarko, Healey), and 3 were from an under-represented minority (George, Saenz, Medlin).  Among other (non-NSF funded) participants, there were many more women, including the main lecturer Guionnet, a senior speaker (Serfaty), and a TA (Knizel).   The school lasted for one week and involved 10 main lectures by Alice Guionnet, 4 supplementary lectures by senior speakers, problem sessions and tutorials led by TA's chosen from among the participants, 13 short contributed talks by junior participants, and a poster session with 2 contributed posters by participants.   Intellectually, the school aimed to educate a new generation of researchers on the recent technique of "Dyson-Schwinger equations" and its applications to the study of random matrices and statistical mechanics.  In particular, the events of this school were organized to provide junior researchers with a main course on this method taught by Guionnet as well as more recent results in this direction through the research talks.     The study of random matrices and related statistical mechanics models are important and widely applicable to domains outside of mathematics (e.g. statistics, machine learning, physics, communications, etc). This school addressed fundamental questions involving understanding how randomness if large dimensional objects give rise to quantifiable and universal limiting behaviors. The school focused on an exciting set of tools used to study this question, and introduced participants to a number of recent advances using these tools.
