<AbstractNarration>In this project funded by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular, and Nanoscience program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Catherine Murphy of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign addresses the conformation (three-dimensional shape) of proteins on nanoparticle surfaces as a function of nanoparticle size, shape, and surface chemistry. Insights from these experiments may lead to improved prediction of biological effects at the molecular and potentially cellular levels.  Metallic nanoparticles in the 10-100 nm size range exhibit unusual properties that enable applications in biology, ranging from diagnostics to therapeutics.  The details of the chemistry at the surface of these nanoparticles matter.  Some surface chemistries promote protein binding.  Others discourage protein binding, and some even control how proteins bind to the surface.  The position of molecules such as proteins on the surface of nanoparticles can influence the fate and function of these nanoparticles in biological systems. The project also contributes to the education and training of undergraduate and graduate students in the areas of nanotechnology, bionanotechnology, and analytical measurements.  This training provides a pipeline of well-rounded scientists who contribute to the innovation economy.  Classroom modules on surface chemistry are created and broadly disseminated to enable students to learn about these scientific topics. Outreach to non-science students helps educate non-scientists about bionanotechnology as well as improve the communication skills of the science students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A wide-ranging set of experiments are designed to examine the phenomenon of "conformational proteomics on nanoparticles."  This research group is developing the ability to measure protein conformations and then rationally alter the conformation/orientation of proteins on nanoparticle surfaces.  The systems include gold cores with various organic ligand shells or new porous, constraining shells.  The proteins include a small, carefully selected set of molecules with intrinsically interesting bioactivity.  The methods used include adaptive control of protein behavior that comes from "plasmonic refreshing" of the surface or capturing protein conformers in designed pores near the metal surface. The measurement of bound protein conformation and orientation comes from a combination of NMR methods, footprinting mass spectrometry, and vibrational spectroscopy.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Gold nanoparticles exhibit size- and shape-dependent optical properties in the 5-200 nm size range: this range matches the dimensions of individual protein molecules at the low end and individual viruses at the high end.  Due to their biocompatibility, optical properties, and tunable surface chemistry, gold nanoparticles are used in biological diagnostics, as cellular imaging agents, and as photothermal therapy agents (the latter taking advantage of the light-to-heat conversion abilities of these particles).   This project focused on the new nanoparticle surface chemistry and state-of-the-art sub-nanometer measurements of nanoparticle-bound molecules for the purposes of controlling protein conformation/orientation on nanoparticle surfaces.  The overarching hypothesis is that control at the molecular level at the nanoparticle surface leads to predictable outcomes at the protein-cell-tissue level.  New modular surface coatings based on porous metal-organic frameworks were developed, leading to sub-nanometer control of coating thickness.  These porous coatings show a surprising ability to sequester proteins from solution.  Anisotropic porous coatings on gold nanorods were developed, leading to end- and side-selective chemistry suitable for chemical sensors based on surface-enhanced Raman scattering.   Alpha-synuclein, a protein whose aggregates are implicated as the neurotoxic agent in Parkinsons Disease, undergoes conformational changes when bound to 25-nm soft lipid vesicles.  Studies under this project have shown that hard nanospheres of gold in this size range, coated with lipid-like molecules, promote different conformations than that of the soft lipid vesicles, leading to new hypotheses of how the mechanical nature of the nanoscale substrate affects protein shape.  Photothermal heating efficiencies were measured in detail for absolute different sizes of gold nanoparticles that scatter light to different extent, leading to a collaboration to measure photoelectron ejection efficiencies of such nanoparticles under high laser fluence.  Photothermal heating of protein-gold nanoparticle solutions is generally believed to pop molecules off the nanoparticle surface, useful for drug delivery; but under the auspices of this project, it was shown that the fundamental thermodynamics of the protein-nanoparticle interface controls this process.  In accord with LeChateliers Principle, photothermal heating of an exothermic protein-nanoparticle pair will indeed lead to proteins popping off the surface, but an analogous endothermic protein-nanoparticle pair will lead to proteins popping onto the surface of the nanoparticle.  State-of-the-art quantitative imaging measurements of the density of molecules bound to gold nanorods showed for the first time that the density of molecules can differ by up to 30% when comparing the ends to the sides of the rods, the most direct proof to date covering twenty years of hypotheses in the literature.  The training and educational outcomes of this project include direct support for the thesis work of both graduate and undergraduate students, a chance for an independent undergraduate to start a new small project involving hydrogel nanoparticle composites, collaboration between art students and science students to enrich the worldviews of each other, and an infusion of nanotechnology and surface chemistry into the undergraduate and graduate chemistry curricula.
