<AbstractNarration>The proposed study takes a longitudinal view of how engineers make the transition from undergraduate to workplace environments, navigate the early career job market, and experience their first professional positions. As part of this investigation, the proposed study will explore such areas as: How students seek out and sift through various career options, and how they finally settle on a particular job offer or course of action; how graduates' early career paths include varying degrees of innovation, entrepreneurship, leadership, business, and/or technical work, in different organizational settings and roles; and how graduates' experience "pushes and pulls" towards and away from engineering in these early post-graduation years.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A major element of this work is to develop a set of recommendations that can be immediately applied to academic and industry practice around preparing, supporting, recruiting, and retaining engineering graduates. These recommendations will address how to integrate new insights into career pathways into: Engineering curricula and co-curricula; campus career development centers' resources and processes; and industry/firm-based recruitment and on-boarding practices for new engineering hires. An advisory group composed of academic and industry representatives will be convened to refine these recommendations and consult on how to deliver them to the public with maximum impact. Findings on the details and dynamics of pathways from school to work have the following broad implications for engineering education and the engineering workforce: (1) Engineering students can make better decisions with more clearly mapped post-graduation options; (2) Engineering graduates can be better prepared for the transition to the workplace; and (3) Organizations can better retain their engineering employees and build diversity in their ranks.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In this project we deployed the third and final wave of a longitudinal survey (Engineering Majors Survey, EMS) that began in 2015 at 27 nationally representative U.S. engineering schools.  Our aim was to better understand engineers’ career goals and their early-career professional pathways. Because of engineering's vital role in shaping how modern societies operate and evolve, understanding how greater diversity can be promoted in who is doing this engineering is critical to maximizing the creativity, innovation and forethought brought into engineering endeavors. A more diverse engineering workforce also contributes to greater economic prosperity for all social groups, as engineering jobs pay well and have relatively low unemployment rates.   Our findings are grouped into the three themes that we identified in our Summer 2019 "meta-review" of EMS-related papers thus far.  Salient findings include:  Theme 1: Innovation and Entrepreneurship (I&amp;E)  --Confidence in being innovative and doing innovative things can be measured. Innovation Self-Efficacy (ISE), one of our study constructs, measures one’s confidence in their ability to engage in specific behaviors that characterize innovative people.  --Particular course topics and experiences are linked to students’ ISE, including designing and prototyping things, exposure to leadership and business topics, and coursework that involves engineering and non-engineering students interacting with each other.  --Extra- and co-curricular experiences also are linked to ISE, including internships, leading a student organization, and attending presentations on entrepreneurship or new engineering technologies. Some of experiences are engaged in by only a small number of students.  --A number of curricular experiences seem to be "dual service": they are positively associated with both ISE and confidence in one’s ability to conduct engineering tasks.  Among these are exposure to leadership topics in courses, as well as participating in research and making use of a makerspace.   --Nearly 1 in 5 engineering students express interest in founding either a for-profit or not-for-profit organization within 5 years of graduation. Students from underrepresented racial/ethnic minority (URM) backgrounds are more likely than non-URM students to have interest in entrepreneurial career options (compared with working in existing organizations); women engineering students report lower entrepreneurial intent than do men engineering students.  Theme 2: Career Development and Supports   --Internships provide critical developmental and pre-professional experiences for engineering students. Participating in an internship may be associated with: higher levels of confidence in doing engineering-related tasks, especially among engineering women from underrepresented racial/ethnic backgrounds; deeper knowledge about career possibilities and direction after graduation; persistence into engineering career pathways; and job offers.  --The work experiences of interns vary widely in terms of the types of assignments, interactions with supervisors, network connections interns can make, and degree of challenge/creativity.  --In terms of job searches, engineering students consider a number of factors in their searches, including: perceptions and characteristics of prospective employers; industry; position benefits; the characteristics of the work itself; the required qualifications for the job; college loan repayments; and compensation packages.  --Most engineering students intend to stay in engineering roles for a while although some students have an "engineering for a short while and then leave" attitude. Women are slightly more likely to be leaning toward non-engineering career options after graduation.  Theme 3: Diversity, Inclusion, and Equity in Engineering Education  --Our work has examined at least four dimensions of student diversity: gender, race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and first-generation college student status. To date, our work has mostly treated these dimensions as separate dimensions of experience and identity. More intersectional approaches are needed.  --The gender difference in entrepreneurial intent among engineering students is not explained by contextual factors such as major or participation in entrepreneurship activities, or individual factors such as innovation orientation. Educational environments under study, in their current design and configuration, do not appear to correct for entrepreneurship paradigms favoring men.  --Gender differences are small and few in number among our measures of innovation, including participation in innovation- (and entrepreneurship-) related extra-curricular activities and innovative behaviors such as "asking a lot of questions".
