<AbstractNarration>The PI will conduct new research to advance the field of harmonic analysis of Boolean functions.  At a high level, harmonic analysis can be described as the theory of using a particular mathematical tool, the Fourier transform, for detecting, analyzing, and representing patterns in large data sets.  Applying it in the context of Boolean functions refers to the case where the data comes from 0s and 1s, the basic building blocks in computer science.  Harmonic analysis of Boolean functions has proven to be a powerful tool in computer science, with application to theories of machine learning, error-correcting codes, cryptography, privacy, optimization algorithms, and distributed computing.  Part of the aim of this project is to further develop the mathematical and computer science foundations of harmonic analysis of Boolean functions.  Another aim of the project is to expand its scope to include further applications in the field of quantum computation.  If and when quantum computers are built, it is known that they will be able to break cryptographic codes that are secure today; this is fundamentally due to their ability to efficiently perform Fourier transforms on huge data sets.  However the full potential power of quantum computation is not well understood, and building quantum computers remains a major engineering challenge.  The project will investigate these issues, analyzing the advantages of quantum computers over classical ones, and understanding how to more efficiently test components of quantum computers. A final key outcome of the project will be scientific and educational training for computer science graduate students at Carnegie Mellon University, as well as wide dissemination of the research produced.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;            At a more technical level, the project has several major-stretch-goals that will be used to guide the research in harmonic analysis of Boolean functions.  Included among these are conjectures of Aaronson and Ambainis concerning the influence of variables on low-degree Boolean functions, and on the decision tree complexity of checking correlation of a function with its Fourier transform.  Proofs of these conjectures would yield new complexity results delimiting the power of quantum computation versus classical computation.  Another major technical goal of the project is to develop the theory of learning and testing an unknown quantum state.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The project title, "Harmonic Analysis for Quantum Complexity", refers to several components.  The overall subject is "Complexity" theory, which is the mathematical study of how efficiently various tasks/problems can be solved by algorithms or computing devices.  The "Quantum" part of the title refers to the fact that a major portion of the research was concerned with tasks related to quantum computers.  Finally, the "Harmonic Analysis" portion of the title refers to a major family of mathematical techniques used in the project, namely "Harmonic Analysis" or "Fourier Analysis" for Boolean functions (the kinds of 0’s-and-1’s functions computed by digital devices).  The project’s outcomes can be divided into four categories.   Quantum state learning and testing:  New, more efficient methods were discovered for learning and validating quantum states and quantum entanglement.  These results may in the future lead to more efficient quantum computing technologies.  (5 research papers published in this category.) New mathematical tools were developed for Fourier analysis of Boolean functions.  These tools will help in further study of quantum computing, efficient statistical methods, and optimization algorithms.  (3 research papers published in this category.) Tools from Fourier analysis of Boolean functions were deployed to obtain new, more efficient algorithms for certain learning problems: trace reconstruction, noisy population recovery, and learning noisy mixtures of rankings.  (3 research papers published in this category.) Tools from Fourier analysis of Boolean functions were deployed in the study of one of the foundational topics in Complexity theory: the extent to which randomness is necessary for efficient computation.  It was shown that randomness is essentially not necessary for certain limited classes of computation involving threshold gates. (2 research papers published in this category.)   In addition to these research outcomes, the project achieved broader impacts in a number of ways.  First, it provided significant training in research and technical communication to half a dozen graduate and undergraduate students at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU).  Second, the research informed the Principal Investigator’s teaching &ndash; especially the graduate course on Quantum Computation offered at CMU.  Over 80 of the lectures delivered are freely available on YouTube, and have collectively been viewed over 40,000 times.
