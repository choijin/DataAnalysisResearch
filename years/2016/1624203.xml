<AbstractNarration>Weather systems in middle latitudes, such as cyclones and high pressure systems that move along jet streams, could still exist even without clouds and precipitation. These individual cyclones and high pressure systems do not just passively loop along westerly jet streams that meander around the globe. Instead they play important roles in determining the time mean intensity of the mid-latitude westerly jet stream as well as its mean latitudinal position and span. The interplay between the jet stream and weather systems that move along it is referred to as "wave-mean flow interaction" in the literature. Nevertheless, the hydrological cycle is an integral component of atmospheric circulations. Besides its by-product, rainfall, that provides the main source of water for all human uses and ecosystems, the hydrological cycle helps to cool tropical ocean surface via evaporation and keep Polar Regions much warmer than what would be by just considering the solar energy available there via poleward latent heat transport. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project explores how latent heat release associated with rainfall produced by individual storms also contributes collectively to the time mean intensity of mid-latitude westerly jet, as well as its temporal and spatial variations. It also concerns how the strengthening of hydrological cycle in a warmer climate would alter the intensity, mean latitudinal position and span of mid-latitude westerly jet. The PI developed a new diagnostic tool for studying moist wave-mean flow interactions in his dissertation research. Here he uses this newly developed tool to diagnose moist wave-mean flow interactions and contract them against the counterparts without considering latent heat release using both observational data and atmospheric general circulation model outputs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since the future global warming projection uncertainties are highly related to future projections of hydrological cycle strength, a better understanding of the underlying dynamics of moist wave-mean interactions may help to reduce the global warming projection uncertainties. In addition, the project supports a postdoctoral researcher who is at the beginning of his scientific career, thereby providing for the future scientific workforce in this area.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Earth's climate state strongly depends on the atmospheric circulation, which is important for distributing heat, moisture, and other chemicals around the globe.  While it is easiest to think of the Earth's circulation by its more  "permanent" features, for example the tropical trade winds or midlatitude jet stream, the dominant transfer of components like heat, water vapor, and momentum in the north-south direction is carried out by midlatitude storms or "eddies", transient features that often occur in the same regions.   Because of the important role eddies play in transport, it turns out that they are important for understanding the larger and more permanent features, such as the midlatitude jet stream.  The interactions between the eddies and larger coherent features like the jet (often referred to as "wave-mean flow interactions") have largely been studied on a dry Earth both theoretically and numerically.  A dry atmosphere is easier to understand as it simplifies the dynamical equations, but moisture plays an important role, since when water vapor condenses, such as during precipitation, it releases heat due to its phase transformation which can then drive circulation.  In fact, about half of the poleward energy transport by the atmospheric circulation is carried in this form of latent heat.

Following this work, the PI ran an idealized set of experiments simulating eddy life cycles with varying levels of available moisture and showed that the moisture acted to redistribute the momentum in the jet stream downward towards the surface and further equatorward [4].  To validate these results in a more realistic setting, the PI and collaborator ran another experiment using a more realistic climate model and tracked cyclones and found similar results.    In a parallel line of work, the PI and collaborator also investigated how the strength of waves affects its interaction with coherent structures.
