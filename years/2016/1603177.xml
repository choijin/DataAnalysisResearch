<AbstractNarration>PI:  Sailor, Michael J.&lt;br/&gt;Proposal #:  1603177&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nanofiber scaffolds have been used extensively in nerve regeneration strategies; however, current nanofiber technologies lack the ability to fully repair the injured nervous system, often due to difficulty in incorporating sensitive therapeutics into nanofibers caused by the volatile solvents that are used in their fabrication.  The proposing group was the first to demonstrate the degradation of porous silicon nanoparticles to non-toxic silicic acid byproducts in-vivo and the first to demonstrate the ability of nanoparticles to be visualized in vivo using gated luminescence imaging.  The goal of the proposed research is to build on these results by combining the advantages of porous silicon nanoparticles with polycaprolactone nanofibers, thus developing drug releasing composite nanofibers that can assist in increasing neurite outgrowth and improving nervous system repair.  The nanoparticles provide protection of the therapeutics, enhance imaging potential and can be used to alter the degradation process.  The nanofibers, whose alignment can be carefully controlled, provide a regenerative substrate that serves to enhance/direct the growth of extending neurites.  In summary, if successful, the biodegradable nanofiber scaffolds, which can be easily tuned to alter scaffold degradation rate, photoluminescent intensity, therapeutic delivery, and substrate alignment, will provide an innovative and straightforward model for developing the next-generation of nanofiber scaffolds. Students involved in the research will be provided with a highly interdisciplinary education in materials chemistry, nanoscience, biomedical engineering, and biology. A capstone activity will be a 6-week summer school for silicon nanotechnology, involving high school, undergraduate, and graduate student mentors and mentees. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nanofiber scaffolds have been used extensively in nerve regeneration strategies; however, current nanofiber technologies lack the ability to fully repair the injured nervous system, often due to difficulty in incorporating sensitive therapeutics (such as proteins, siRNA, etc) into nanofibers caused by the volatile solvents that are used in their fabrication.  The goal of this three year project is to develop composite nanofibers, in which bioactive therapeutics can be incorporated, with the aim of creating customizable tissue engineering scaffolds for nervous system repair. The proposing group was the first to demonstrate the degradation of porous silicon nanoparticles to non-toxic silicic acid byproducts in-vivo, and the first to demonstrate the ability of nanoparticles to be visualized in vivo using gated luminescence imaging. The aim of this proposal will be accomplished by developing and systematically studying biodegradable porous Si/polycaprolactone composite fibers with a focus on engineering scaffolds for nervous system repair. The research is pursued under 4 main thrusts: 1) fabricate aligned or randomly oriented porous Si nanoparticle/polycaprolactone composite nanofiber scaffolds and determine photoluminescent properties and degradation of the scaffolds; 2) functionalize the surface of the porous Si/polycarpolactone nanofiber composites to improve cellular attachment and growth (including -OH and peptide functionalization) 3) incorporate and monitor release of bioactive therapeutics from the nanofiber composites that target the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway to enhance neurite extension (i.e. nerve growth factor, PTEN siRNA, and PTEN inhibitor) and 4) determine ability of nanofibers to enhance neurite extension (dosal root ganglion neurons)in vitro.  Three key innovations of this research are the use of an airbrush method to fabricate nanofiber composites, utilizing photolumiscent properties of porous Si nanoparticles to monitor degradation of the composite scaffolds, and incorporating sensitive therapeutics into nanofiber composites to enhance neurite extension.  If successful, the approach will have applications in medical therapeutics, tissue engineering, and implantable scaffold imaging and broadly impact research areas of implantable biomaterials, MEMS, and controlled drug release.  Students involved in the research will be provided with a highly interdisciplinary education in materials chemistry, nanoscience, biomedical engineering, and biology, in preparation for a variety of challenging research positions in the biotech sectors of industry, government, and academia. A capstone activity will be a 6-week summer school for silicon nanotechnology, involving high school, undergraduate, and graduate student mentors and mentees.</AbstractNarration>
