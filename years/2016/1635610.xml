<AbstractNarration>The El Ni√±o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is the largest source of global climate variability and has a profound influence on surface temperatures and precipitation around the world. This project seeks to test preliminary results that suggest that ENSO did not respond to past changes in greenhouse gas concentrations during the last geological period (the Pliocene) when carbon dioxide levels are thought to have been similar to today's. These findings have important implications for future ENSO behavior and, consequently, this project seeks to thoroughly scrutinize the preliminary results with additional high quality measurements. The research involves training and mentoring of University of California, Irvine undergraduate students in fundamental laboratory skills and scientific communication, and supports an early career scientist with no prior NSF support.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research seeks to understand how ENSO responds to changes in greenhouse gas forcing by examining ENSO variability during the Pliocene, the last time pCO2 levels are thought to have been similar to modern. Modern equatorial Pacific nitrate consumption variability has been linked to ENSO and, based on this relationship, a 5 million year long record of nitrate consumption was constructed using nitrogen isotope signature of bulk sediments. These results suggest that long-term equatorial Pacific nitrate consumption variability did not respond to changes in greenhouse gas concentrations over the past 5 million years, and imply that long-term ENSO variability is also insensitive to greenhouse gas radiative forcing. The funded research seeks to determine the fidelity of these bulk sediment results, which can be overprinted by diagenetic effects, by measuring the nitrogen isotope signature of planktic foraminifera from the same sediment samples. These "foraminifer-bound" signatures should be less subject to post-depositional alteration and thus a more robust proxy for past nitrate utilization. These results will address two questions: (1) what is the fidelity of equatorial Pacific bulk sediment nitrogen isotopes? (2) how did equatorial Pacific nitrate consumption evolve over the past 5 million years?</AbstractNarration>

ENSO is the largest source of global climate variability, but there is currently no consensus on how it will respond to the current rise in atmospheric greenhouse gases like CO<sub>2</sub>. One approach for understanding (and therefore predicting) the ENSO-CO2 relationship is to look to the past?by reconstructing ocean conditions that are diagnostic of ENSO states and comparing these reconstructions with known changes in Plio-Pleistocene CO2. For example, Principal Investigator (PI) Rafter?s early work found that a 1 million year record of Eastern Equatorial Pacific nutrient consumption?a trait that is strongly tied to equatorial ocean physics, based on Rafter?s later work&nbsp;(<em>2</em>,&nbsp;<em>3</em>)?suggests there is no relationship between ENSO and CO2. In other words, if ENSO is insensitive to changing CO2, it is a rare bit of good news on climate change.</p> <p>One argument against this good news is that the atmospheric CO2 of the last 1 million years is not directly analogous to current and future CO2, so Rafter extended the original records (of bulk sediment N isotopes) back 5 million years (when CO2 is presumed to have been near today?s concentration). Preliminary results reinforce the initial findings that long-term changes in the upper equatorial Pacific physics (and presumably ENSO) are completely insensitive to atmospheric CO2. Because similar findings using different techniques have been controversial (e.g.,&nbsp;(<em>4</em>?<em>6</em>)), PI Rafter requested NSF funding to produce new ?gold standard? measurements that would remove one additional shortcoming of the new record. To quickly summarize, the preliminary results were based on the widely used bulk sediment N isotope measurement, which I refer to here as the ?Quick-And-Easy? measurement.&nbsp;</p> <p>The NSF-funded work (NSF#1635610) aimed to test these ?Quick-And-Easy? measurements with ?Gold-Standard? measurements of marine microfossil N with two questions: (1) Is the&nbsp;?4 million year long increase in the Quick-And-Easy measurements reproduced by the Gold-Standard measurements? (2) Is the short-term variability (at&nbsp;?23,000 years) also seen in the Gold-Standard measurements? With the help of 5 undergraduate researchers from UC Irvine (detailed below), the awarded proposal made &gt;100 Gold-Standard measurements of planktic foraminifera-bound N isotope measurements. The Gold-Standard measurements clearly answer Question 1: the long-term increase in equatorial Pacific bulk sediment N isotopes is a robust feature of bulk sediment N isotopes. Prior publications by PI Rafter argue that these trends must result from basin-wide changes in nutrients, perhaps implicating a long-term variability of upper Southern Ocean nutrient efficiency&nbsp;(<em>3</em>,&nbsp;<em>9</em>,&nbsp;<em>10</em>). These results have been presented at several conferences, including the most recent International Conference on Paleoceanography in 2019 and the AGU Fall Meeting in 2019. As far as peer-reviewed publications, this funding supported: One first-author peer-reviewed publication by Rafter (in GRL); Five peer-reviewed publications with Rafter as co-author (in review), and a final publication in preparation for submission to a peer-reviewed journal like AGU?s&nbsp;<em>Paleoceanography &amp; Paleoclimatology</em>.
