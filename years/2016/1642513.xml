<AbstractNarration>1642513 &lt;br/&gt;Kelly, Kerry E.&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;This award is under NSF's topic of Public Participation in Scientific Research. The project will build on the principal investigators' (PIs) existing community partnerships, K-12 outreach program, and their network platform for low-cost air quality sensors (AirU) to engage and empower their community in understanding and addressing their city's most pressing air-quality research questions and to evaluate sensor reliability. It focuses on the Salt Lake Valley, which experiences periodic episodes of poor air quality, at times having the highest levels of particulate matter (PM) pollution in the nation. The project will bring together three communities: high-school and middle-school students who will build their own sensor package and contribute data to the network; a non-profit organization, Breathe Utah, who will develop educational curricula and bring low-cost sensors to middle schools; and a community organization, PurpleAir, which has been collecting air-quality data to understand the effects of gravel-pit operations on local air quality. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The approach involves: (a) engaging the community groups to identify their most pressing air-quality research questions, (b) improving understanding of the geo-spatial and temporal resolution of air-quality metrics, (c) developing strategies to leverage citizen science in understanding sensor reliability, and (d) integrating a low-cost sensor package into the Department of Chemical Engineering's regular visits to high-schools as part of their STEM outreach efforts. The air-quality data network will continually report online air-quality parameters, including PM, NO2, and CO, and will educate the public about project progress and more broadly about local air quality with regular updates and opportunities for feedback.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The project, AirU, has had key impacts on education, understanding local air quality, and citizen science. We developed numerous hands-on active-learning teaching modules, which have been successfully used to engage and train prospective citizen scientists. These modules (available online at airu.coe.utah.edu) expand on best practices for engaging high-school and undergraduate students in outreach module development for K-12 students, and in recruiting and training new citizen scientist researchers, which is a relatively new area of research. &nbsp;The student scientists in this project delivered critical insight into the spatial and temporal resolution of air quality and sensor reliability over time. This project addresses a critical challenge for this region, winter-time fine particulate matter pollution as well as a critical challenge for citizen science and low-cost sensors: sensor reliability.</p> <p>This project has also contributed to the training of 13 undergraduate students, 2 graduate students, and 10 high-school interns.&nbsp; It has resulted in 7 peer-reviewed publications/conference proceedings (with one additional publication under review), numerous presentations from the community to the international level, a ScienceNation video, national press coverage, and in 2018 a demonstration of our teaching modules at the National Science and Engineering Fair and Expo in Washington DC.&nbsp; Undergraduate students were active participants in all peer-reviewed publications, and two publications boast undergraduate students from underrepresented groups as lead authors.&nbsp; One of these papers received the Chemical Engineering Best Paper award.&nbsp; In addition, student team members won the annual AIChE STEM outreach competition in 2019 and 2020 with teaching modules developed under this project.&nbsp;</p> <p>The project has broader impacts on the smart-cities /internet of things (IoT) communities, air-quality policy makers, environmental justice, and social and behavioral science.&nbsp; Specifically, the sensor reliability data will help the smart-cities/IOT communities understand sensor reliability and to develop strategies to address this uncertainty as well as to improve user experience with this data.&nbsp; The NSF partner project (1646408) is working on these research questions as well as others. <strong></strong></p> <div> <hr size="1" /> </div><br> <p>            Last Modified: 12/29/2020<br>      Modified by: Kerry&nbsp;E&nbsp;Kelly</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1642513/1642513_10447135_1609281286050_image--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1642513/1642513_10447135_1609281286050_image--rgov-800width.jpg" title="AirU Data Visualization"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1642513/1642513_10447135_1609281286050_image--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="AirU Data Visualization"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">AirU Data Visualization</div> <div class="imageCredit">Jimmy Moore</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyright owner is an institution with an existing agreement allowing use by NSF</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Kerry&nbsp;E&nbsp;Kelly</div> <div class="imageTitle">AirU Data Visualization</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1642513/1642513_10447135_1609281463672_NationalScienceFair--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1642513/1642513_10447135_1609281463672_NationalScienceFair--rgov-800width.jpg" title="AirU Team at National Science Fair"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1642513/1642513_10447135_1609281463672_NationalScienceFair--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="AirU Team at National Science Fair"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">University of Utah AirU Team at the National Science and Engineering Fair, April 2018</div> <div class="imageCredit">Anthony Butterfield</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyright owner is an institution with an existing agreement allowing use by NSF</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Kerry&nbsp;E&nbsp;Kelly</div> <div class="imageTitle">AirU Team at National Science Fair</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1642513/1642513_10447135_1609281636291_AirUTabling--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1642513/1642513_10447135_1609281636291_AirUTabling--rgov-800width.jpg" title="AirU Hands on Demonstration"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1642513/1642513_10447135_1609281636291_AirUTabling--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="AirU Hands on Demonstration"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">AirU Hands on Demonstration at the University of Utah's HiGear Camp, an opportunity for students from under-represented groups to engage in engineering.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Anthony Butterfield</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyright owner is an institution with an existing agreement allowing use by NSF</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Kerry&nbsp;E&nbsp;Kelly</div> <div class="imageTitle">AirU Hands on Demonstration</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1642513/1642513_10447135_1609281738429_LegoHighRes--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1642513/1642513_10447135_1609281738429_LegoHighRes--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Building block air quality sensor"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1642513/1642513_10447135_1609281738429_LegoHighRes--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Building block air quality sensor"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Building block air quality sensor</div> <div class="imageCredit">Anthony Butterfield</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyright owner is an institution with an existing agreement allowing use by NSF</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Kerry&nbsp;E&nbsp;Kelly</div> <div class="imageTitle">Building block air quality sensor</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1642513/1642513_10447135_1609281994419_NAraphao--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1642513/1642513_10447135_1609281994419_NAraphao--rgov-800width.jpg" title="STEM outreach"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1642513/1642513_10447135_1609281994419_NAraphao--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="STEM outreach"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">STEM outreach visit to the Northern Arapaho Nation</div> <div class="imageCredit">Matt Dailey</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Royalty-free (restricted use - cannot be shared)</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Kerry&nbsp;E&nbsp;Kelly</div> <div class="imageTitle">STEM outreach</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
