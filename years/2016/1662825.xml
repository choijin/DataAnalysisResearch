<AbstractNarration>Location of transportation service facilities (such as security gates at airports, transit stations near shopping malls) and layout of guideways (such as tunnels, gates and barriers) affect pedestrian traffic and poor design may induce congestion in both the immediate and surrounding contiguous spaces.  Failure to address congestion-related issues leads to deterioration in the efficiency of those facilities, and negatively impacts the general public, through unnecessary delay and safety hazards due to overcrowding. An extreme manifestation of poor design leading to congestion is devastating pedestrian stampede incidents in crowded spaces. The overcrowding situation is further worsened if some of the built facilities become unavailable for service from time to time. This research will create new methodology for planning efficient and reliable service facility location and guideway layout, while considering how pedestrian traffic will respond to the system design. It will provide key insights and strategies that will underpin improvement in design and ultimately result in significant economical and societal benefits for transportation, freight and manufacturing industries. This project will also lead to new educational practices by the creation and integration of education materials and a variety of outreach activities with transportation industries and public schools.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;While it is well-known that many service systems are vulnerable to congestion and disruptions, studies on problems posed in open spaces are quite limited. This project will develop methodology to describe customer traffic fluxes, and overcome challenges associated with facility and guideway design using two complementing modeling schemes: one based on continuous/planar modeling techniques, and the other based on discrete model formulations to address a number of pressing challenges, including (i) point-wise service facility location design, (ii) integrated guideway deployment, and (iii) probabilistic service disruptions, in a variety of engineering contexts. The framework will enable quantification of the system performance either in analytical closed forms or in compact-sized (i.e., of low-order polynomial to the system size) expressions, either exactly or as high-fidelity approximations. This scheme opens up opportunities to transform a set of traditionally hard problems into solvable models.</AbstractNarration>
