<AbstractNarration>This project supports research that is integral to the summer field campaign that will take place at the University of Michigan Biological Station (UMBS) beginning in July 2016.  The objective of the field campaign is to gain a better understanding of reactive chemistry in the atmosphere of a forested environment. This is important for improving predictions of the production of ozone and secondary organic aerosols in the atmosphere, species important for sustaining human health and the environment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Atmospheric Measurements of Oxidants in Summer (AMOS) campaign includes the study of the oxidative processing rate and oxidation mechanisms of biogenic volatile organic compounds under varying nitrogen oxide concentrations.  The proposed research focuses on formaldehyde as a tracer for the oxidation of volatile organic compounds. The project includes the study of formaldehyde emissions from plants using leaf enclosure, measurement of the fluxes of the formaldehyde exchange between the surface and the atmosphere, formaldehyde flux measurements via eddy correlation at the top of the tower and gradient measurements through the canopy, and application of a 1-D box model approach to examine VOC oxidation to investigate whether missing organic peroxy radical sources are correlated with missing formaldehyde sources. The results will contribute to an improved ability to mitigate the anthropogenic effects of emissions on climate, human health, and the environment.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The work under this grant investigated unknown sources of formaldehyde in forest canopies. The oxidation of volatile organic compounds (VOC) in the troposphere is directly coupled to the formation of ozone and secondary organic aerosol both of which impact human health and climate. Formaldehyde is an important VOC oxidation product and measurements of formaldehyde are commonly used as tracer for the formation of secondary pollutants and to estimate emissions of volatile organic compounds, such as isoprene. Therefore, it is important to understand all sources of formaldehyde. Previous work by the Keutsch Group had demonstrated an unknown formaldehyde source, i.e., known VOC oxidation chemistry and emissions could not account for it. Under this grant we conducted additional, more targeted measurements in a deciduous forest, which again found a significant in canopy source of formaldehyde. The finding was confirmed by using two independent instruments to measure formaldehyde, providing confidence in the observation. Work is underway to evaluate whether direct emission of formaldehyde by plants, rapid gas-phase VOC oxidation within the canopy, or reactions on plant surfaces are the source of the formaldehyde. It is important to identify the exact process driving this formaldehyde source due to the ubiquitous use of formaldehyde as tracer and as only process level will allow prediction of how this contribution to the overall formaldehyde budget will depend on environmental changes.
