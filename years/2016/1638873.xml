<AbstractNarration>This project supports the 8th international Gordon Research Conference titled "Biogenic Hydrocarbons and the Atmosphere."  Biogenic hydrocarbons are volatile compounds that are released naturally by vegetation and play an important role in ecosystems and atmospheric chemistry across a variety of scales. The interdisciplinary conference program will be of interest to a broad suite of scientific communities, including (1) biologists, (2) ecosystem ecologists, and (3) atmospheric scientists.  The conference will impact society by improving the understanding of biosphere-atmosphere trace gas exchange and the role of human activities in global environmental change.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the conference, participants will explore newly emerging research topics including root emissions, communication between plants and fungi, airborne investigations of hydrocarbon and related fluxes, surfactant chemistry of isoprene, and the influence of biogenic hydrocarbons on aerosol formation processes. The main uncertainties that the meeting will address include the biological formation and function of biogenic hydrocarbons, the ecological consequences of biogenic hydrocarbons, and the impact of biogenic hydrocarbons on atmospheric chemistry and climate. The conference is scheduled to take place at the PGA Catalunya Business and Convention Centre in Girona-Costa Brava Spain from June 26 - July 1, 2016.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Operational Summary  The Gordon Research Conference (GRC) on Biogenic Hydrocarbons &amp; the Atmosphere was held at the PGA Catalunya Business and Convention Centre in Girona, Spain from June 26-July 1, 2016.   The meeting covered a variety of scientific topics and the content presented was highly rated by participants.    Conference Participants  The Conference had 95 participants. Scientists from academia represented 93% of the participants while attendees from government accounted for 6% and those from industry totaled 1%. The meeting also attracted a strong mix of young investigators and senior scientists.  Students and post-docs accounted for 38% of all attendees. Approximately 49% of the participants at the 2016 meeting were women.   Conference Program  The goal of the Biogenic Hydrocarbons and the Atmosphere GRC was to enhance our understanding of the incredible diversity and function of the exchange of organic molecules between the biosphere and the atmosphere and the impact that this exchange has on organismal and ecosystem function, atmospheric chemistry, and climate processes. The multidisciplinary nature of this conference covered a wide-range of topics ranging from plant and microbial physiological ecology, atmospheric chemistry, aerosol dynamics, modeling and climate science, reflecting the wide diversity of disciplines required to understand Earth's coupled Biosphere-Atmosphere system. The 2016 Biogenic Hydrocarbons and the Atmosphere GRC continued its tradition of providing an engaging format for researchers to discuss recent findings and develop new understandings of the diversity and roles of biogenic compounds and their impact on atmospheric chemistry and climate, with a focus on identifying key unknowns and establishing collective priorities for advancing the science of atmospheric organics in the 21st century.     The conference brought together a collection of investigators who are at the forefront of their field, and provided opportunities for junior scientists and graduate students to interactively present their work and exchange ideas with established senior scientists. Further, a special session provided a small group of early career scientists (graduate students and post-doctoral scholars) to give short oral research presentations of their latest research. The collegial and inter-disciplinary atmosphere of this Conference, with programmed discussion sessions, as well as opportunities for informal gatherings in the afternoons and evenings, provided an excellent venue for scientists from a diversity of disciplines to brainstorm and connect in an effort to support existing and develop new collaborations across scientific fields.     Conference Feedback  Participants had an opportunity to provide feedback at the end of the Conference. The feedback collected from the meeting was extremely positive. Evaluations included numerous positive remarks regarding the networking opportunities with experts in the field, the young investigators presentations, and the quality of the talks.   GRC would like to thank the National Science Foundation for its continued support of the meetings.  The contributions received from the National Science Foundation have been critical to the success of the conferences and are having a measurable impact in advancing the frontiers of science worldwide.
