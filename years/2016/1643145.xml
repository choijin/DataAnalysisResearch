<AbstractNarration>Non-technical Abstract: &lt;br/&gt;There has been growing interest in a new class of material system known as topological insulators, which are known to harbor topologically protected conducting surface states. The charges forming these topologically protected states are expected to have fascinating properties arising from the way they are forced to spin as they are moving. The project will explore these unique properties, also known as the helical spin structure, by performing direct spin detection experiments on samarium hexaboride, which has no charges in its bulk at cryogenic temperatures and test new device concepts that rely on unique properties of topological surface states. On the educational side, the project will provide excellent training for graduate and undergraduate students. The principal investigator will also be leveraging University of Michigan's existing REU and Master's bridge programs to bring in a student from an underrepresented group to join this project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Abstract: &lt;br/&gt;There has been growing interest in a new class of material system known as topological insulators, which are known to harbor topologically protected conducting surface states. The transport properties of the surface of topological insulators are expected to be quite unique, arising from the helical spin structure of surface electrons. Even though such surface states have been seen in many materials, in most cases these materials are actually bulk conductors, and not true insulators making electrical characterization of these surface states very challenging. In this project, topological surface will be studied in samarium hexaboride, which has recently been discovered to be a correlated topological insulator with a truly insulating bulk. The helical spin structure will be detected using specially designed spin injection devices incorporating magnetic tunnel junction together with Corbino experiments performed on different surfaces of samarium hexaboride. The Corbino and spin injection devices will be fabricated using standard lithographic techniques on high quality samarium hexaboride crystals grown both using floating zone and Al flux methods. The transport experiments will be performed at cryogenic temperatures and high magnetic fields. If successful, these experiments will unambiguously reveal the topological nature of surface states. Probing the helical spin structure using purely transport measurements will be critically important in moving the field forward. These experiments will also provide new opportunities to study the interplay between strong-correlation effects and topology in the search for new principles of physics. The project will provide excellent training for the graduate and undergraduate students. The principal investigator will also be leveraging University of Michigan's existing REU and Masters bridge programs to bring in a student from an underrepresented group to join this project.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Samarium hexaboride (SmB6) is a fascinating heavy-fermion system which appears to be the first correlated topological insulator with robust surface conduction and truly insulating bulk. The material has been long studied as a Kondo insulator, where the insulating behavior of the bulk arises from the hybridization of f-d electrons. The absence of bulk conduction at cryogenic temperatures makes this material ideal for studying the emergent properties of topologically protected two-dimensional electrons. Even though there has been a plethora of recent research activity, we are far from having a complete understanding of electrical conduction in this material.  Intellectual Merit: The major goal of the project was to investigate fundamental properties of this material using transport experiments, including the helical spin structure of the surface electrons. We invented a new type of transport measurement which we call inverted resistance measurement, that allows us to extract the bulk conductivity while the surface conduction dominates in a 3D topological insulator. Inverted resistance measurements allowed us to extend resistivity measurements by an additional 5 orders of magnitude. These experiments suggest that unlike other topological insulators or conventional semiconductors, the bulk conduction in this material appears to be immune to point defects.  Motivated by our transport experiments we have challenged the presence of impurity states in SmB6 and developed a new theory to explain the discrepancies between spectroscopic transport gaps in this material system, which has been a mystery for some time. We proposed that SmB6 can be modeled as an intrinsic semiconductor with a depletion length that diverges at cryogenic temperatures. We found good agreement between our model and a collection of transport data from 4-40 K.  Broader Impacts: The research performed through this grant lies at the intersection of three major fields: correlated electron systems; TIs; and two-dimensional electron systems.  The inverted resistance measurement is a powerful technique and likely to be used by researchers to characterize other topological insulators.
