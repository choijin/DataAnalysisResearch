<AbstractNarration>This project seeks to engage representatives of the scientific and engineering communities supported by NSF into an active dialogue aimed at making publicly available the results of scientific research sponsored by NSF. Scientists with a broad variety of expertise will come together for a workshop to discuss the lessons learned in previous domain-specific workshops, identify common needs regarding knowledge preservation and open access for the scientific and engineering communities, and suggest possible requirements that will promote broad public access to data. The latter are expected to be discipline dependent, but promoting a dialogue between communities is necessary in order to identify effective practices and cost-effective solutions to serve the community needs and to help pave the way to a world with broad public access to scientific data. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Making research data broadly available opens the scientific enterprise to citizen scientists and other researchers and enhances the potential for discovery. Recognizing that the transition from the Digital Age to the Big Data Age provides also the technical means needed to make public the research data from a wide variety of scientific inquiries, this workshop will play an import role towards the development of a framework by which public access can be accomplished. Economies of scale are expected by combining projects and infrastructure across various disciplines. As such, this effort will identify new opportunities for cross-disciplinary research by emphasizing the dataset and metadata interoperability in the design of archival systems.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This report reflects the deliberations and conclusions of an NSF-wide Workshop to explore the prospects for a common response to the requirements for public access to research data.  Representatives of almost all of the NSF Directorates convened in Alexandria, VA, February 22 and 23, 2018, to review a diverse and multi-disciplinary collection of projects and workshops that have been conducted in the recent past. All of these activities were focused on aspects of public access to research data, from broad surveys of entire areas of research to development projects aimed at prototyping specific infrastructure for data access and discovery.  The workshop had three major points of focus:  1. The sharing of lessons learned and findings as collected from each of the scientific communities                                                       2. Linking communities with common interests in knowledge preservation and access      3. The formation of suggested requirements related to knowledge preservation and open access  As the workshop progressed, it became clear that there exists consensus on many of the conclusions related to public access to data across the many disciplines represented by the NSF.  In particular, all of the scientific communities represented recognize the importance of data sharing, moving towards FAIR principles (that data should be Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) for research data.  The participants felt that this consensus should empower the NSF to take a leadership role in all aspects of public access to data, from establishing policies to technical innovation to supporting workforce development, since it is clear that its scientific stakeholders support these efforts.  The priorities for the scientific communities and the suggested areas where the NSF can have the most significant impact are presented in the workshop report.  By virtue of its position as a funding agency, the NSF has a variety of means for influencing the scientific community, and, through coordination with other agencies and international entities, influencing national and international policy. With decisive action and policies, the NSF can take leadership roles in all of the areas required for moving the scientific community along the arc towards a shared-data research paradigm.  Specific areas of focus could be:  Formulation of requirements Sustainability Capacity building, including in the areas of:   Workforce development/training Cultivating curation activities, tools   Infrastructure Cross-disciplinary dialogue and coordination   Around infrastructure Around policies and standards   Driving culture change   These focus areas are discussed at length in the workshop report.
