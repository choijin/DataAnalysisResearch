<AbstractNarration>The proposed research is concerned with questions at the crossroads of geometry and partial differential equations. In recent years, methods involving partial differential equations have become increasingly important in geometry: Perhaps the most spectacular example is the Ricci flow method pioneered by Richard Hamilton and the solution of the Poincare conjecture by Grigoriy Perelman; other important advances were made in the understanding of minimal surfaces. These are surfaces which minimize area and serve as models for soap films. The goal of this project is to further our understanding of these and similar equations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specifically, the PI and Gerhard Huisken are planning to study singularity formation for geometric flows. Besides the Ricci flow, a particular focus are flows for 2-convex hypersurfaces. The PI is also planning to work on problems in minimal surface theory. In this direction, he is planning to study the eigenvalues of the Laplace operator on a minimal surface; another direction is the classification of minimal annuli with free boundary. Finally, the PI is planning to study the gluing approach to the construction of solutions to geometric PDEs.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project has been concerned with higher dimensional shapes and their curvature. It is often useful to deform surfaces to improve their properties. This is done via geometric flows; the most important examples are the mean curvature flow and the Ricci flow. Under these equations, the curvature satisfies a reaction-diffusion equation, where the diffusion term tries to spread out the curvature evenly in a way that is analogous to heat dissipation.   A solution to a geometric flow may develop singularities where the curvature becomes infinitely large and the surface breaks apart. A main goal is to understand exactly the process of singularity formation. This is a central question in geometry; for example, the understanding of singularities of Ricci flow in dimension 3 lies at the heart of Perelman's proof of the Poincare and Geometrization conjectures.  This project has shed light on various aspects of singularity formation:  1. This project has led to an understanding of singularity formation under the Ricci flow in higher dimensions, under a natural positivity condition on curvature. This can be viewed as a higher-dimensional version of Perelman's work.   2. This project has led to a precise picture of singularity formation of mean curvature flow, in the special case of 2-dimensional surfaces of positive mean curvature. In particular, there is a complete classification of all singularity models that can occur in this setting. The possible singularity models include the sphere, the cylinder, and the rotationally symmetric bowl soliton.  3. This project has shed light on how convex surfaces behave if we deform them by powers of the Gaussian curvature. In particular, we were able to identify the range of exponents for which the flow converges to a round sphere.          Last Modified: 08/02/2019       Submitted by: Simon Brendle]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
