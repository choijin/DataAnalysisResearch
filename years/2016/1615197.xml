<AbstractNarration>The origin of the elements has been identified by the Nuclear Science Advisory Committee as one of the most important questions of our day. Current astronomical observations indicate that many elements found commonly on Earth were first synthesized in the center of stars, where fusion and other nuclear reactions take place. These nuclear reactions control the associated energy generation and evolution of stars. However, the stellar conditions are difficult to reproduce in the laboratory. Under the special conditions proposed here, using a novel compact accelerator placed deep underground, some of the key nuclear reactions that take place in stars can be measured. The goal of this research is to measure nuclear processes that are part of a chain of reactions leading to the synthesis of elements.  These are the elements that make possible life on Earth.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The project seeks to study the strength of stellar neutron sources that drive the s-process, one of the two dominant sources for the production of heavy elements. One of the most critical processes is alpha-particle induced reactions on Ne-22, producing Mg-25 plus a neutron, but other alpha-neutron reactions may also play a role depending on the stellar environment. However, the large cosmic ray induced neutron background has been prohibitive for advancing these measurements into the stellar energy range and the present reaction rates rely on theoretical extrapolations that carry high uncertainties. There has been no facility where these measurements can be pursued in a background neutron free environment. Over the past years the CASPAR (Compact Accelerator System for Performing Astrophysical ReÂ¬search) instrumentation has been constructed at the Sanford Underground Research Facility to address this need. CASPAR operates a 1 million-Volt, high intensity, fully refurbished Van de Graaff accelerator that can provide alpha beam intensities of several hundred micro-Ampere. The proposed experiments rely on the use of a solid and a recirculating gas target system and a He-3 detector system for neutron counting. Successful implementation of a science program at CASPAR will offer a competitive opportunity for the US nuclear astrophysics community to maintain leadership in the field. It will provide a world-wide unique opportunity to study stellar helium burning reactions associated with the synthesis of carbon and the neutron production for trans-iron nuclei.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>CASPAR is the only underground accelerator in the US and one of three facilities in the world which allow measurements of nuclear cross section of astrophysical importance close to the temperature and energy range present deep inside the core of a star. The CASPAR facility is located a mile underground in the Sanford Underground Research Facility (SURF) in Lead, South Dakota in an old gold mine formerly known as Homestake Mine. This project has provided a fully commissioned accelerator system and delivered first scientific results with the new underground facility. The experiments performed at this facility will significantly reduce uncertainties in stellar evolution models, e.g., late stellar evolution and Asymptotic Giant Branch phase, and, thus, lead to a better understanding of the origin of the chemical elements in our universe. The heavier elements, e.g., chemical elements beyond iron, are formed in a series of nuclear reactions called the s- and the r-process. The former takes place during the final evolutionary phases of stars generally more massive than our Sun, while the latter is believed to take place in very violent, explosive astrophysical events. Each process contributes about half of the total amount to the heavy element synthesis. The availability of precise nuclear data is currently in particular timely and important since with the recent first detection of gravitational waves from a neutron star merger an additional window into the astronomical observation of such violent astrophysical events has been opened. New information on the potential site of the r-process became available. However, the details of the r-process models and calculations can only be verified if the s-process contribution from the solar isotopic abundance can be subtracted with high accuracy.

In the astrophysical energy range the cross section of the second reaction <sup>22</sup>Ne(alpha,n)<sup>25</sup>Mg is dominated by an isolated resonance.
