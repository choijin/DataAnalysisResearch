<AbstractNarration>A Security-Integrated Computer Science Curriculum for Intensive Capacity Building&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project, at the University of Colorado at Colorado Springs (UCCS), will develop a security-integrated computer science curriculum in order to increase the number of students who are exposed to cybersecurity concepts and skills, and who understand the interplay between cybersecurity and other areas of computer science.  A total of 12 courses will have relevant security topics integrated into them.  This set includes 9 core courses and 3 electives.  Existing courses will be enhanced through the use of course content modules, lab exercises, course projects, and guest lectures.  In addition to making project materials publicly available, the project team will organize both a regional and a national workshop.  The regional workshop will include faculty from other schools in Colorado such as UC Boulder, Colorado State, University of Denver, Colorado College, and Metropolitan State University of Denver.  They will also collaborate with a number of institutions with which they have educational collaborations and institutional Memoranda of Understanding, including Otero Junior College, Lamar Community College, and Pikes Peak Community College.  These schools do not currently have sufficient cybersecurity education capacity, and their programs will be significantly enhanced through the materials made available to them through this project. This project will be funded by the Division of Graduate Education through the SFS program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The course infusions involved in this project will focus on topics related to web, cloud, system, network, and biometrics cybersecurity research.  Topics addressed will include drive-by-download attacks, single-sign-on system security, biometrics-based user authentication methods, cross-site scripting, security policies, malware analysis, privacy leakage detection and prevention, and trusted platform module chips.  Project evaluation will be done using a combination of mechanisms: student and instructor surveys; focus group studies; cybersecurity knowledge and skill measurements; cybersecurity course and program enrollment data; cybersecurity student club and competition team participation; cybersecurity projects, theses, dissertations, and research papers; and student placements into cybersecurity positions or cybersecurity graduate programs upon graduation.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project advances the state of art and practice in cybersecurity education by systematically exploring a novel security-integrated computer science education approach. It encourages and involves more instructors who do not have previous cybersecurity experience to include relevant cybersecurity topics in their computer science courses. It ensures that computer science students will have no way to escape cybersecurity education, will have many opportunities to learn cybersecurity knowledge and skills from the perspectives of different computer science subareas, and will understand the correlation and interplay between cybersecurity and other subareas of computer science. It quantitatively and qualitatively evaluates the teaching and learning effectiveness of the approach, and disseminates the results through publications to advance the cybersecurity education research. It promotes the adoption of the approach and boosts cybersecurity education collaboration and resource sharing among institutions.    We have developed 11 micromodules by exploring our security-integrated computer science education approach.  All the micromodules are independent of each other.  Each of them includes the presentation slides and a survey that can be integrated as a one-to-two-hour presentation and discussion session into a non-cybersecurity course.  We have used the materials of these 11 micromodules and performed the cybersecurity integration activities multiple times in many non-cybersecurity courses and class sessions at three institutions.  We have designed anonymous surveys for all the 11 micromodules, and collected the data at the end of each class session from all the participating students.  The survey results indicate that these micromodules and our activities achieved the goals on helping students increase their knowledge and understanding of the relevant cybersecurity topics.    This project enhances computer science students? individual and collective skills in cybersecurity, encourages more students to learn cybersecurity and pursue careers related to cybersecurity, involves more instructors to discuss cybersecurity topics in different computer science courses, and promotes collaboration and resource sharing in cybersecurity education.  More computer science students have learned the relevant cybersecurity knowledge and skills in different courses&#894; they will be well qualified to join the cybersecurity workforce of the United States, to build the secure and trustworthy cyber space, and to better serve the nation.    With the support from this NSF grant, both Colorado School of Mines and University of Colorado Colorado Springs have significantly increased their cybersecurity research and education capabilities from the perspectives of research grants, research publications, cybersecurity programs, cybersecurity courses, cybersecurity competitions, as well as the enrollment, mentoring, and placement of cybersecurity area students.
