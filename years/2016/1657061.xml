<AbstractNarration>This project investigates how to ensure that self-adaptive cyber-physical systems (SA-CPS) function correctly as they execute.  An SA-CPS can reconfigure itself, at run time, to mitigate unforeseen circumstances, where an example SA-CPS is an autonomous vehicle that reacts to unexpected road conditions by automatically adjusting its driving strategy to avoid an icy patch.  Therefore, the system must be tested to ensure that it operates correctly following a reconfiguration.  This project will provide techniques for ensuring that verification and validation strategies for an SA-CPS have been derived correctly and that any future adaptations are correct with respect to its original requirements.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will enhance assurance for SA-CPSs by providing test oracles (i.e., software that determines if a test passes or fails) that adapt alongside an executing system; verifying and validating adaptive test oracles at design time and run time; and providing traceability between adaptive oracles and software requirements.  Together, these three points will ensure that both test cases and oracles can effectively validate a running system throughout its lifetime.  This work will be demonstrated on real hardware to show that together, software verification and validation can enhance system assurance as well as public perception and trust in SA-CPSs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will ensure that software test oracles are verified and validated to ensure that any software validation activities are being correctly performed on SA-CPS.   The knowledge gained from this project will be published in highly-regarded conferences/journals and all artifacts and results released to GitHub and NSF's CPS Virtual Organization (CPS-VO).  Information will also be shared publicly through a series of blog posts intended to educate the public on CPSs.  This project will also train graduate students, results will be presented in a graduate class on CPS, and distilled into summer camps to introduce K-12 students to embedded programming.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project was proposed to enhance assurance for cyber-physical systems (CPS) at run time, where assurance provides confidence in the system.  Specifically, we aimed to introduce adaptation techniques into the verification and validation domains.  The ability to adapt to unforeseen circumstances (i.e., uncertainty) in either the environment or system itself is a necessity for a CPS to continue executing correctly.  As such, we investigated how software test oracles, or software modules that specify correct and incorrect behavior (either by monitoring the system itself or by performing and monitoring the outcomes of tests), can be adapted as necessary at varying levels of formality.  Moreover, we initiated development on an experimental testbed for our techniques comprising heterogeneous devices and simulation environments.  Overall, the project was successful in that we proposed and refined our experimental testbed at multiple conferences in terms of design, with implementation being actively carried out as part of a PhD dissertation.  Our investigations into online adaptation of oracles has been discussed at several conferences to varying degrees, leading to parallel investigations into uncertainty, big data, continuous optimization of adaptive systems, and medically-assistive technologies (specifically monitoring and supporting patients with early-stage Alzheimer's disease).   For example, we incorporated non-functional (i.e., difficult to quanity) and functional (i.e., quantifiable) requirements in such a way that each contributes towards the optimization of the overall system performance, where hidden or unintended relationships can also be automatically discovered as part of the optimization process.  We also initiated research projects for incorporating formal models at run time as part of a combined verification and validation process.  The project work carried out under this grant was successful in that it enabled the creation of a funded laboratory at Oakland University to investigate the oracle problem in CPSs, comprising students of various backgrounds, ethnicities, genders, and multiple levels of education (i.e., doctoral, masters, and undergraduate).  Moreover, resources purchased for the lab were used to support STEM outreach programs for middle-school students to learn about the programming and the CPS domain.  To summarize, we greatly appreciate the resources that this grant has provided, enabling development of a research program that has led to many new and interesting research paths that we are confident will be fruitful for future research projects.
