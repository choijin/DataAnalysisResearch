<AbstractNarration>The University of California, Irvine will lead this Design and Development Launch Pilot to engage with collaborators from the Orange County CA STEM Initiative, the Orange County CA Department of Education, the Orange County CA Workforce Investment Board, the Jamboree Affordable Housing Communities, the Orangewood Foundation for Foster and Community Youth Services, OCTANE-Technology Incubator, Project Tomorrow and Growth Section. This project was created in response to the Inclusion across the Nation of Communities of Learners of Underrepresented Discoverers in Engineering and Science (NSF INCLUDES) program solicitation (NSF 16-544). The INCLUDES program is a comprehensive national initiative designed to enhance U.S. leadership in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) discoveries and innovations focused on NSF's commitment to diversity, inclusion, and broadening participation in these fields.  The INCLUDES Design and Development Launch Pilots represent bold, innovative ways for solving a broadening participation challenge in STEM.  &lt;br/&gt;The full participation of all of America's STEM talent is critical to the advancement of science and engineering for national security, health and prosperity.  Our nation is advancing knowledge and practices to address the computing technology education practices for recruiting, better educating, retaining and graduating a productive STEM workforce.  However women who are members of underrepresented minority groups, with low socioeconomic status, historically underperform in STEM and specifically in computing technology.  This project, NSF INCLUDES: Supporting Women Advancing Through Technology, has the potential to significantly advance a collaborative approach by a group of organizations to improve the success of poor, underrepresented minority women who are learning computing technology and transitioning to the STEM workforce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will demonstrate the outcomes of computer science training for women, particular disenfranchised and underrepresented minority women that may be exiting foster youth services, living in low income housing, and/or having been denied access to programs particularly in technology due to their socioeconomic status.  Partnering organizations will design, develop and launch a short-term, intensive training opportunity in computer science for women ages 16 to 34 who are unemployed or underemployed, and who desire to engage in upward career mobility. The program will include a replicable, custom curriculum and an educational approach that will be scalable. A boot camp will teach the fundamentals of Ruby on Rails, HTML, CSS, SQL, JavaScript, and AngularJS, and prepare participants for a career in web development while enabling them to keep their day jobs and have childcare provided.  Educating a randomized sample treatment group of up to 150 women in this launch pilot, the partners will also offer internships and/or job shadows, where participants gain client experience, learn from more experienced developers, and continue to build their portfolios. All of the women in the program will receive information, coaching and exposure to college and career opportunities. Job placement in STEM careers is the outcome goal of this design and development launch pilot.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The Women Advancing Through Technology (WATT) Program funded by NSF INCLUDES, created an opportunity for women living in low income housing complexes in Orange County, CA to participate in Computer Science/web page design training.&nbsp; Led by the University of California Irvine, in partnership with Jamboree Housing Corporation, Orange County STEM Initiative, Orange County Dept. of Education, Dreams for Schools, Gargani + Co. and Cielo, the project included an 8 week course for women, delivered at the housing properties where the women lived. The WATT training &nbsp;&nbsp;covered topics such as: developing web design elements using templates; creating pages with WYSIWYG and Mobi Rise; HTML Mark up: Syntax, Essential &amp; Common Tags; CSS; Java Script; Cascading, Color &amp; Typography; overlays, buttons, page layout; Java Script sliders, loops, object, events &amp; functions.&nbsp; Job readiness workshops conducted by Cielo to deliver self-efficacy/career training based on Social Cognitive Career Theory was also made available each week to the women. Initially, recruitment meetings were held at three different Jamboree Housing sites, resulting in forty-nine women signing up for the course. Ultimately, thirty-nine women completed the course (attending 80% or more of the weekly classes, 4 to 5 hours per week.) The courses were held at the three housing complexes with meals, and childcare provided to eliminate barriers for anyone who wanted to attend. Upon graduating for the course, Jamboree Housing provided each completer with a new laptop to keep. Twenty-two women participated in the exit survey which is what our outcome data is based upon for this study. Our conclusions are drawn from knowing that WATT is innovative and ambitious. It serves a group of women largely absent from the technology workforce. The WATT participants were one-hundred percent socio-economically disadvantaged and predominately women of color. Their education levels ranged from no high school to some high school, and/or no college to some college. &nbsp;Our estimated impacts are encouraging. They suggest that WATT increased women?s confidence, perceived ability in STEM and interest level in college and career activity. However WATT also decreased some outcome expectations and interest regarding STEM careers, which we believe may have been due to the perceived nature that computer science is difficult and requires higher education only. The majority of the women were interested in learning about computers at a basic level which included the web design using prepared templates, and other technical skills such as how to use Word, Adobe, Excel and the Microsoft Office Suite. &nbsp;The career training component also helped women build the practices that they would need to eventually find work such as writing an effective resume and understanding work-related responsibilities.&nbsp; Our study sample was small, but our impact estimates based on pre-post differences were significant in measure. Five suggestions for further study of the WATT program include: 1) recruit job seekers into the WATT program, if women are not seeking employment, WATT could be perceived as too challenging and requiring too much commitment over the long-term. 2) Include more bilingual instructors and instructional aides to accommodate English Learners in the program. 3) Determine the optimal length of the training, using A-B testing protocol. 4) Find a more scalable and longer time setting for future study in order to develop a deeper levels of outcome evidence. 5) Acknowledge the challenge that WATT addresses and use an iterative design cycle over time to find the optimal program that meets the needs of the participants.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 03/12/2019<br>      Modified by: Linda&nbsp;Christopher</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Image         </div> <div class="galControls onePhoto" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation onePhoto" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1649377/1649377_10466360_1552408984644_WATT3--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1649377/1649377_10466360_1552408984644_WATT3--rgov-800width.jpg" title="WATT participants"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1649377/1649377_10466360_1552408984644_WATT3--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="WATT participants"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Women Advancing Through Technology</div> <div class="imageCredit">Alfaro, S.</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Linda&nbsp;Christopher</div> <div class="imageTitle">WATT participants</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
