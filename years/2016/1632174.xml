<AbstractNarration>Everyday situations require individuals to understand another person's level of confidence in his/her memory. For example, when a spouse says, "I'm pretty sure I locked the door" do you interpret that statement as indicating that you should double check the lock or not. Interpretation of such expressions of confidence present important cognitive challenges and can be influenced by a number of different factors. The cognitive biases that can influence these interpretations of confidence and the approaches to expressing confidence that might limit the impact of these biases are important areas of research with wide-ranging applications. The current project examines these factors in the context of eyewitness identification. When an eyewitness identifies someone from a lineup and states, "I'm pretty sure it's him," how do we know that police, jurors and others will interpret this expression of confidence in the way that it was intended? While a large literature exists on eyewitness confidence and (a) its relationship with identification accuracy, (b) its influence on jurors, and (c) its vulnerability to influence from post-identification feedback, very little is known about how other people understand the verbal expressions of eyewitness confidence. The outcomes of this project in terms of a more thorough understanding of the cognitive factors that influence interpretations of confidence are anticipated to have broad implications for settings, such as judicial proceedings, that involve the interpretation of another person's confidence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project investigates how people understand an eyewitness's verbal expression of confidence in the accuracy of his/her identification from a lineup of faces.  There are three goals:  first, the project examines how the particular content of an eyewitness's justification for his/her level of confidence (e.g., "I'm pretty certain it's him because I remember his chin") influences how people understand the eyewitness's confidence-statement. Second, there are a variety of cognitive biases that cause individuals to misinterpret the verbal expressions of certainty.  For example, mounting research on the 'outcome-severity bias' shows that the identical verbal probability phrase (e.g., "it is somewhat likely") is interpreted as denoting a higher numerical likelihood when that phrase refers to more severe events rather than less severe events.  The project considers whether eyewitness expressions of confidence are vulnerable to misunderstandings that are caused by the same kinds of cognitive biases.  Third, the proposed experiments investigate whether the harmful influence of these cognitive biases can be mitigated by expressing confidence numerically instead of verbally. Overall, the project will fill a profound lack of knowledge about how people understand eyewitness confidence in a lineup identification. Moreover, the knowledge that verbal expressions of certainty are vulnerable to misinterpretations may: (a) guide police to obtain a numerical estimate of certainty from eyewitnesses; and (b) alert police, lawyers, judges and jurors to potential pitfalls about interpreting verbal expressions of certainty.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Every day we must evaluate probabilistic information to guide our actions.  The weather forecaster states that it will probably rain this afternoon; should I bring an umbrella?  Climatologists predict that sea levels will likely rise by 1 foot in the next 50 years; should I sell my house?  And, an eyewitness reports that he is pretty sure about his identification of the suspect; should I conclude that the suspect is guilty?  Do people accurately interpret the intended meaning of the verbal expression of confidence in each of these situations?  We answered this question in the context of eyewitness expressions of confidence in an identification of a suspect from a lineup. We show that there are a variety of different cognitive biases that systematically influence and distort how people interpret eyewitness expressions of confidence.   One outcome of this project involved investigating a bias that we call the Featural Justification effect (Dodson &amp; Dobolyi, 2015).  Consider an eyewitness’s confidence statement in a lineup identification, such as "I am positive it’s him."  We have found that this identical verbal expression of confidence will be interpreted by others as indicating a lower numeric value when this expression is accompanied by a reference to a visible feature on the suspect (e.g., "I am positive it’s him.  I remember his eyes.") than when it is accompanied by a statement of recognition (e.g., "I am positive it’s him.  I recognize him.") or by a reference to an unobservable detail (e.g., "I am positive.  He looks like my cousin."; Dobolyi &amp; Dodson, 2018; Dodson &amp; Dobolyi, 2015; Grabman &amp; Dodson, 2019).  Moreover, eyewitnesses are perceived as less accurate and suspects are judged as less likely to be guilty when an eyewitness refers to an observable feature than to one of these other details (e.g., Dodson &amp; Dobolyi, 2017; Slane &amp; Dodson, 2019).  Although the results of the featural justification effect may appear counterintuitive, the effect highlights and depends on a flaw in people’s social metacognitive processes.  Specifically, individuals appear biased to rely on their own subjective experience with a feature when attempting to evaluate someone else’s experience with the goal of understanding their expression of confidence &ndash; a bias we explain with our Perceived-Diagnosticity account (Dobolyi &amp; Dodson, 2018; Dodson &amp; Dobolyi, 2015, 2017).  Although a feature may in fact be diagnostic for the eyewitness when they mention, for example, the suspect’s eyes, it will not appear to be particularly diagnostic from the observer's point of view because everyone in a fair lineup will likely share the mentioned feature. Consequently, observers will assume that the eyewitness is not particularly accurate or confident.  Individuals do not readily appreciate that a seemingly nondiagnostic visible feature, such as someone’s nose, may be distinctive to someone else who has seen this feature before.  In contrast to references to observable features, statements of recognition and references to unobservable features (e.g., "He looks like my cousin") cannot be evaluated by others in terms of how well they discriminate a target face from other faces in a lineup and so they are accepted at face value.    Another bias that we examined is the Confirmation bias (Grabman &amp; Dodson, 2018).  By their very nature, lineups contain an individual that the police have identified as their suspect.  Overwhelming research shows that individuals (even experts) are vulnerable to confirmation biases.  We are biased to interpret evidence as consistent with our beliefs, expectations, etc., particularly when this evidence is ambiguous and open to various interpretations.  Verbal probability phrases tend to be ambiguous and thus appear especially vulnerable to misinterpretations caused by the confirmation bias.  Grabman &amp; Dodson (2018) is the first paper to examine how an evaluator’s prior knowledge, such as which lineup member is the police suspect, influences their interpretation of eyewitness confidence about a lineup identification.  We show that participants perceived the identical statement of confidence as meaning a higher and lower level of certainty, respectively, when the eyewitness’s selection either matched or mismatched the police’s suspect.  Our results suggest that current recommendations for assessing eyewitness confidence are incomplete. Present procedures, such as double-blind lineup administration, prevent investigators from influencing eyewitness reports (and should continue to be used). However, they do not mitigate the effects of prior knowledge and confirmation biases on interpretations of eyewitness statements.  Finally, the third bias that we examined is the Outcome Severity bias, the phenomenon whereby the identical verbal probability phrase can be interpreted as denoting a higher numerical likelihood when the phrase refers to events having more severe than less severe outcomes.  For the first time, we show that the outcome severity bias generalizes to the interpretation of eyewitness statements of confidence.
