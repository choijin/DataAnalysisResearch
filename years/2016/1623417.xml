<AbstractNarration>1055974&lt;br/&gt;Cremaschi&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Biomass has great potential for weaning the chemical process industries (CPI) from fossil based&lt;br/&gt;feedstocks. As a renewable and locally available resource, the use of biomass as a CPI feedstock will have a synergistic effect on the U.S. economy by supporting the agricultural sector and promoting future innovation and growth of the CPI. The switch from current fossil fuel based CPI to a future CPI that utilizes biomass feedstock will require substantial amounts of research &amp; development (R&amp;D) and capital investments for technology development both by the CPI and the government. There is opportunity for investigating how these investments will impact the evolution of the biomass feedstock system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research objective of this Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) project is to develop novel models and computational methods that are capable of predicting the impact of R&amp;D and capital investment decisions (how much to invest and in which technology and when) on the evolution of biomass conversion technologies for CPI feedstock development. Two characteristics of this system, uncertain decision-dependent endogenous technology evolutions and game theoretic issues, limit the applicability of existing representations and methods. Drawing analogies to the R&amp;D pipeline management and graph theory, the PI proposes two frameworks to analyze this problem. First, the PI will investigate the effectiveness of these frameworks for the investment problem with respect to four criteria: easy scalability, universality, ability to represent the uncertain evolution paths of different technologies, and amenability to community upkeep and expansion. The PI will next develop simulation-based optimization approaches to the investment problem assuming perfect information sharing among the government and CPI agents. Lastly, the PI will develop an agent-based framework embedding simulation-based optimization approach as decision models in the agent-based framework and investigate the impact of game-theoretic issues on the investment decisions when complete information is not available to any party. This research to study the biomass-to commodity chemicals investment decision problem should lead to advances in representation of technological developments and evolution problems, large-scale solution capability of stochastic optimization problems with exogenous and endogenous uncertainties, and fundamental understanding of how game theoretic issues impact new technology development and evolution, particularly for the biomass feedstock system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The overarching goals of the education plan are to integrate research and education and contribute to the diversity of the engineering workforce and scientific community by training students in systems-level thinking. These goals will be achieved by:&lt;br/&gt;1. Integrating research themes and projects that require and promote systems-level thinking and interdisciplinary work into traditional engineering undergraduate curriculum courses,&lt;br/&gt;2. Expanding the undergraduate/graduate-level course, Risk Management and Optimization (developed by the PI) and integrating projects from this research into the course,&lt;br/&gt;3. Engaging and mentoring at least two undergraduate students per year in this research project utilizing two successful unique campus wide capstone programs that promote student participation in original research programs, and&lt;br/&gt;4. Recruiting and supervising at least two full time graduate students who will pursue advanced degrees in chemical engineering. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Advances in biomass feedstock conversion could lead to advances ranging from hybrid and seed engineering, to fertilizer and other agricultural techniques, to classical chemical catalysis. Because of the importance to U.S. national and economic security and the range of options available for evolving a complex biomass feedstock system, this work has potential for scientific, technical and societal impact. In addition to the dissemination of the results via scientific publications and at national and international meetings, the developed models will be made available for the use of the community through the World Wide Web.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The chemical process industry (CPI), which has been historically one of the strongest national manufacturing sectors, is a large consumer of fossil fuels.  According to the 2010 Manufacturing Energy Consumption Survey, the total net energy consumption of the CPI accounts for about 26.5% of the total U.S. manufacturing sector energy consumption.  The chemical process industry uses about 53.4% of this energy as raw material. Considering the sporadic changes in oil prices, and environmental and national energy security concerns, supplementing the current fossil based feedstock with renewable and novel feedstocks for commodity chemical production will increase the competitiveness of our CPI in the global market.  Top chemical companies are shifting their focus from bulk chemicals to specialty products. For example, BASF expects to increase the share of "customized products, and functionalized materials and solutions" sales to 70% of its total by year 2020. Dow Chemical Company is "carving-out" its chlorine and epoxy assets reducing its commodity chemicals foot-print while it continues to grow in downstream specialty products in integrated plastics, electronics, and agriculture. Bayer announced that they will become a "pure Life Science company", focusing their business entirely on products that enhance human health and nutrition. Dupont continues to focus its product offerings on agriculture and nutrition developed using the latest advancements in biotechnology. These trends suggest that the feedstock and product portfolios along with utilized technologies of CPI may grow and be quite different compared to today?s in the near future. As such, there is tremendous opportunity for investigating the impacts of these new technologies, feedstocks, and products on the existing CPI and on how CPI may change in the near future.  Incorporating new technologies, feedstocks and products into the existing CPI infrastructure may require significant amounts of investment. Determining the optimum investment decisions, i.e., how much to invest, which technologies, feedstocks and products to invest in, and when to make those investments for research and development and for capacity expansion, is a challenging task. There are often many emerging technologies, feedstocks and products, and their future performances are uncertain. The investment decisions are generally made by the help of decision support tools that are developed using stochastic optimization models. Unfortunately, these models quickly become quite large for real-world problems, and cannot be solved using the state-of-the-art commercial solvers prohibiting their usability.  Intellectual Merit:  During this project, we developed stochastic optimization models to study the impact of incorporating biomass or new technologies to existing CPI infrastructure, and developed novel heuristic and bounding approaches to efficiently solve these stochastic optimization models. Our results show that the solutions obtained by our heuristic approach provide feasible investment plans for the original problem, and our heuristic algorithm generates these investment plans several orders of magnitude faster than solving the original optimization problems. For assessing the quality of the solutions that were obtained using our heuristic approach, we investigated using several different decomposition approaches, which revealed that our heuristic algorithm solutions were within, in general, 5% of the true solution. To the best of our knowledge, our heuristic algorithm is one of the few approaches that can solve real-world size problems in tractable time; and with the addition of the decomposition approaches, we are able to efficiently evaluate the quality of the solutions our heuristic algorithm generates. Our approaches enable the solution of real-world size optimization problems under uncertainty resulting from investment planning problems for incorporating biomass or new technologies into existing CPI infrastructure.  Broader Impacts:  This research project has provided partial or full financial support for six graduate students pursuing their PhDs in process systems engineering area, four at Russell School of Chemical Engineering, The University of Tulsa, and three at Department of Chemical Engineering, Auburn University (one student attended both schools).
