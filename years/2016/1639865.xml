<AbstractNarration>Naturally occurring radioactive nuclides provide invaluable "clocks" with which to investigate a wide range of processes in earth and environmental sciences. Nuclides with shorter half-lives are well suited to studying rapid processes, but are often present at very low concentrations and are particularly difficult to measure. The goal of this Early Concept Grant for Exploratory Research (EAGER) is to develop and demonstrate a new analytical method for measuring bismuth-210 (half life, 5 days) in lake water, seawater, and associated particles. Because bismuth tends to become associated with particles more than its parent isotope lead-210 (half life, 22 years), the bismuth-210/lead-210 daughter/parent pair can potentially be used to investigate very short time-scale processes associated with particle (sediment) formation and cycling in lakes and the coastal ocean. Knowledge about such processes is important to understanding carbon and nutrient cycling in these productive and dynamic areas. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The specific goals of this exploratory project are to 1) demonstrate an improved method for measuring the lead-210/bismuth-210/polonium-210 trio in aquatic system samples; 2) measure lead-210/bismuth-210/polonium-210 in Lake Michigan; and 3) explore the feasibility of using bismuth-210/lead-210 disequilibrium as a proxy for particle flux. The project would support an undergraduate student researcher for the summer.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This one-year EAGER grant allowed PI James Waples (University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee) to develop a method for measuring the naturally occurring radionuclides of bismuth-210 (210Bi; half-life: 5.01 days), lead-210 (210Pb; half-life: 22.3 years), and polonium-210 (210Po; half-life: 138 days) in aquatic systems.  210Bi is the daughter of 210Pb and the parent 210Po, and while 210Pb and 210Po have been routinely measured in aquatic systems for nearly half a century, measurements of 210Bi are rare and its behavior in lakes and oceans is poorly understood. Community interest in naturally occurring radionuclides stems from our ability to use them as tracers of rates of aquatic system processes including e.g., particle settling, which ultimately affects the rate of carbon dioxide removal from the atmosphere and the transport and fate of many terrestrial and anthropogenic materials (e.g., nutrients and toxins) in coastal environments.  This new method for measuring 210Pb, 210Bi, and 210Po (Figure 1) is simple and rapid and shortens the time currently needed for measuring 210Pb and 210Po by nearly an order of magnitude. A timeseries analysis of dissolved and particle-bound activities of 210Pb, 210Bi, and 210Po in water samples from Lake Michigan suggests that 210Bi might successfully be used as a tracer of rapid particulate flux. This field dataset is the largest yet assembled for 210Bi activities in a natural aquatic system.  Results from this project have been presented at the Association for the Sciences of Limnology and Oceanography 2019 Aquatic Sciences Meeting and a manuscript describing: (1) details of the methodology; (2) decay-corrected calculations for total, dissolved, and particle-bound fractions of each nuclide; and (3) all field measurements has been submitted for peer review.
