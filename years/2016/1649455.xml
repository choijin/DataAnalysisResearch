<AbstractNarration>Solidification of ionic liquids (ILs) inside templating nanoporous materials (e.g., MWCNTs, TMSs and AAMs) is one step in the synthesis of optically-active (e.g., fluorescent) and magnetic nanomaterials based on ionic liquids (ILs). These IL-based nanomaterials have potential applications in fields as diverse as optoelectronics, photovoltaics, separations, analytical chemistry and biomedicine. Therefore, determining the nanostructure of IL-based nanomaterials in confined spaces is important for understanding the (nano)structure-property relationships of these materials for their rational design and use. The PI proposes to conduct fundamental molecular level investigations to understand the behavior of ILs confined in nanopores. The proposed work will include molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of representative ILs inside different templating materials (carbon nanotubes, mesoporous silicas, slit graphitic nanopores, etc), and the nanostructure of the confined ILs will be characterized by order parameters (OPs) that will enable the PI to detect crystalline order in nm-sized regions. The inclusion of an experimental collaboration strengthens this proposals approach. &lt;br/&gt;The work proposes to understand an important aspect of the behavior of ILs in the solid phase, when confined in nanopores, by looking at nanoscale properties on a fundamental level. A better understanding of the phases of ILs in nano-sized confinement will help advance the potential application of this material for optoelectronics, photovoltaics, separations, sensing, analytical and biomedical applications. ILs have also been considered potential candidates for developing systems for CO2 sequestration.</AbstractNarration>

ILs are organic salts made of bulky ions that are typically in liquid phase at room temperature; a common IL is 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide, [emim<sup>+</sup>][NTf<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup>]. On the other hand, DESs are made by mixing two or more components, typically a quaternary ammonium salt such as choline chloride, with a molecule such as ethylene glycol that can form hydrogen bonds with the ions; the resulting liquid mixture has a much lower melting point compared to the original components. In this project, the PI?s group modeled for the first time the nucleation of a crystalline phase of an IL from its subcooled liquid phase (i.e., a liquid that is below its freezing point). Crystal nucleation is the first step in the formation of a solid phase and involves a few molecules organizing themselves into an ordered, unstable and transient species called the critical nucleus, which is very challenging to detect in experiments as it only involves a few molecules and can appear anywhere in the system. Using advanced molecular simulation tools, the PI?s group studied the crystal nucleation of an IL that is either directly in contact with a carbon surface (heterogeneous nucleation), or by itself in the bulk (homogeneous nucleation). A fundamental understanding of the crystal nucleation of ILs is relevant to developing new materials for applications in biomedicine, photovoltaics and chemical sensors. Furthermore, the advanced simulation techniques used in this study could also be used to examine nucleation of other systems, impacting fields ranging from pharmaceuticals and separations to formation of hydrates for energy storage and CO2 sequestration.</p> <p><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>In another thrust of this project, ILs and DESs have long been considered for CO2 separations and capture, however their application is limited by the high density and viscosity of most of these solvents, and by the elevated cost of most ILs. These issues can be overcome by incorporating small quantities of ILs or DESs (which are significantly cheaper) into porous materials, leading to the development of supported IL/DES membranes (where the porous materials have micron?sized pores) and supported IL/DES phase materials (where the materials have nm-sized materials). Using molecular simulations with all-atom models, the PI?s group determined that common DESs and ILs confined in carbon or titania materials having micron? or nm?sized pores have excellent performance for separations of CO2 from gas streams. These findings could lead to the development of novel, optimal, low?cost porous adsorbents and membranes to separate CO2 from gas streams, which could also be suitable for other liquid separations. Systems of ILs and DESs inside nanopores are also relevant as electrolytes in batteries, electrochemical double layer capacitors and dye sensitized solar cells. Finally, the PI?s group also used computational tools to examine mixtures of ILs or DESs with conventional fluorinated refrigerants (e.g., R134a) for applications in high?efficiency absorption cycles that use solar or low-quality waste heat to produce electricity or drive air conditioning/refrigeration systems.</p> <p><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>This project supported a total of five female graduate students, two of which are expected to complete their doctoral studies very soon, while the other three have already obtained their PhDs and are currently working as professors and scientists in academia and industry.
