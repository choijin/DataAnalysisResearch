<AbstractNarration>Current problems in approximation that are driven by applications in science and engineering, are formulated in very high dimensions. This project involves the study of different objectives related to high-dimensional approximation, that arise in a large number of applications including neutron, tomographic and magnetic resonance image reconstruction, uncertainty quantification, optimal control and parameter identification for engineering and science applications, as well as important energy and material science applications.  The approaches used in this work will result in substantially improved and mathematically well-founded methodologies for computer simulations of solutions to real-world problems. The project will also involve the interdisciplinary training of graduate students on computational data sciences and engineering. The results obtained will be disseminated through journal articles, conference talks, a collaborative website, and by the research and training activities of the junior participants. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this effort we propose to develop novel mathematical techniques  for approximation of high-dimensional systems from a limited amount of sparse and noisy data.  The results of this effort will enable scientists to understand what are the number realizations of a nonlinear manifold that required to recover the entire high-dimensional solution map, with optimal approximation guarantees and minimal computational cost. Our rigorous mathematical approach includes: Novel weighted convex optimization and iterative thresholding techniques for optimal polynomial recovery, established via an improved estimate of the restricted isometry property; and Advanced multi-index methods that alleviate complexity and accelerate convergence of solutions by constructing model hierarchies with the use of reduced-basis techniques.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    The goal of this project was to establish modern mathematical techniques for approximation of high-dimensional systems from a limited amount of sparse and noisy data. This includes both deterministic and stochastic parameterizations defined over a multi-dimensional domain, where the parametric dimension can be very large, or even infinite.      The main achievements of this collaborative project are summarized below:     * Theoretical analysis of sharp asymptotic error estimates of quasi-optimal stochastic Galerkin approximations, in which we achieve sub-exponential convergence rates with constants only depending on the shape and size of multi-index sets.    * Development of weighted compressive sensing method using lower sets, where a novel choice of weights for sparse minimization, and lower hard thresholding operators, that exploit the structure of the best s-term polynomial space to overcome the curse of dimensionality.  * Development of a reduced-basis approach for nonlocal diffusion problems, where the online cost is independent of the non-locality.  * Compressed sensing approaches for polynomial approximation of high-dimensional functions. Sparse grid quadrature rules based on conformal mappings.  * A new theory for strong convergence of forward-backward splitting in reconstructing jointly sparse signals.  * A domain-decomposition based reduced-basis approach for convection dominated PDEs with random velocity fields.  * An improved discrete least-squares/reduced-basis method for parameterized PDEs.        These innovative capabilities are aimed at conquering several challenges, related to high-dimensional approximation, that arise in a large number of fields. Examples include neutron, tomographic and magnetic resonance image reconstruction, uncertainty quantification, optimal control and parameter identification for engineering and science applications, as well as important energy and material science applications.  The algorithmic and mathematical advances should have a great and direct impact on a broad spectrum of academic, laboratory, and industrial science and engineering communities; especially those who require accurate and robust computational methodologies for solving problems involving multi-dimensional parameterized differential equa- tions. The approaches used and results obtained have been disseminated through journal articles, conference talks, and by the research and training activities of the junior participants later in their careers.
