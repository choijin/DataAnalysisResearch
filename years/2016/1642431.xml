The workshop will address the current state of the art, the roadblocks preventing a reliable and reproducible manufacturing of nano/quantum devices. Participants will propose and prioritize realistic research and development approaches that can lead to possible solutions. The Workshop will be held April 27-28, 2016 at the Basic Research Innovation and Collaboration Center (BRICC) in Arlington VA. &lt;br/&gt;Technical:&lt;br/&gt;Examples of technology approaches and devices discussed are atomic resolution electron microscopy, GaN-based materials and new oxides, Molecular Beam Epitaxy for current-generation nano-quantum devices, nanoimprint-based large-area, high-throughput nanomanufacturing, genetic code for reproducible nano/quantum devices and reproducible 2D films. The Workshop will allow learning and understanding of the latest advances in design, growth, fabrication, device physics related to electronics and optoelectronics, as well as their reproducibility related issues.  The report expected from it will summarize the outcome of the discussions.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[Summary  The workshop that took place on April 27 and 28, 2016 focused on the issues of reproducible advanced technologies for the next generation of nano/quantum devices. Reproducibility and reliability in quantum and nano-devices is a challenging area with need for future investment. As a result it is crucial to understand how best approach the study, fabrication and development of these materials and their related devices to significantly decrease the time to market. The workshop participants have discussed the current state of the art, outlined the roadblocks that prevent a reliable and reproducible manufacturing of nano/quantum devices, and proposed and prioritized realistic research and development approaches that can lead to possible solutions. The workshop discussion and program has developed along four main themes: Device Simulation and Design &ndash; The presentations in this area have outlined the state of the art and development needs of simulation tools that will enable design for reproducibility. Material Growth and Characterization &ndash; This session has addressed the needs of specific growth and characterization approaches necessary to reliably develop novel materials and increase the reproducibility of the performance of conventional one Device Processing and Characterization &ndash; The third theme has focused on the impact that processing and characterization techniques have on the reproducibility of devices Manufacturing &ndash; The last topic has centered the discussion on the manufacturing approaches that can enable a reproducible manufacturing of devices that employ novel material systems. The initial part of the workshop has consisted of several plenary talks they have outlined the state of the art in each area. Following the plenary sessions, the workshop participants have been asked to attend appropriate breakout sessions. The final section of the workshop focused on preparing a final report that will identify priority research and development directions. The main conclusions and recommendations of the workshop are provided at the end of this document.  Conclusion and recommendations generated from the breakout session discussions are summarized below.   Device Simulation and Design Conclusions    - There is a need to develop integrated hierarchical models to account for different scales and multi-physic aspects.  - Variations and uncertainty quantification need to be integral part of the modeling methodology.  - Reliability has close ties with variability and process simulation and should be addresses at the same time.  - Disparate and highly specialized codes are a challenge across the community and the simulation development is often performed in isolation from experiments  - To provide adequate industrial support TCAD vendors need to be involved in the development process.  - Compact models are an important transition tool for circuit and systems insertion.  - The current silicon modelling and circuit design should be should be integrated in new modelling tools.  -  Coordination between academic and national labs with industrial is needed to enhanced opportunities for modeling-experiment partnerships.  Material Growth and Characterization Conclusions  - It is critical to have a parallel theoretical and experimental designs of 2D materials.  - Both top-down and bottom-up synthesis approaches are needed.  - Control of doping and the development of appropriate doping techniques.  - To enhance growth and its reproducibility, it is important to standardized and purify materials that are used.  - MOCVD is highly scalable and also enables growth at higher pressures which is advantageous for controlling native defect concentrations in the films.  - In situ and real time, non-destructive methodologies are important and need to be developed when not available.  - Innovation for reproducible technology must come from academia.  - Reproducible growth technologies must be developed together with equipment design and development.  Device Processing and Characterization Conclusions   - New methods of characterization are needed to speed up the testing and enable quicker, more efficient methods of identifying "stealth variables".  - Improved (nanoscale) spatial resolution.  - Process automation and nondestructive and non-contact characterization.  - Rapid, variable ambient-capable processing and testing.  - Non-substrate based methodologies.  - Separation, sorting, and reconfiguration techniques can be an important approach to the fabrication of nanoscale device.  - Bottom up assembly of purified components should be investigated.  - Leverages experience from the chemical sorting and purification industry.  - Improve processes to deal with surfaces/interfaces where passivation techniques are critical.  - Co-design nanomaterials-nanodevices-architecture as well as employ defect-tolerant properties when available.  Manufacturing Conclusions   - There is an overriding need to examine classical scaling laws and how these laws break down. New scaling laws are required which come directly from physical principles rather than scaling analysis.  - A new field of robust manufacturing is needed, together with its techniques, its products as well as design and analysis.  - Fundamental studies of materials, devices and systems that are combined with novel concepts of design, processing and characterization are required.  - Apply the novel manufacturing paradigms to a broad range of fields from physics to chemistry, bioengineering and electric, computer engineering.
