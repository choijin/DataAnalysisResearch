<AbstractNarration>Abstract: We aim to disrupt the multigenerational cycle of poverty in our rural indigenous (18% Native American and 82% Hispanic) community by training our successful college students to serve as role models in our schools. Poverty has led to low educational aspirations and expectations that plague our entire community. As such, its disruption requires a collective effort from our entire community. Our Collective unites two local public colleges, 3 school systems, 2 libraries, 1 museum, 1 national laboratory and four local organizations devoted to youth development. Together we will focus on raising aspirations and expectations in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) topics, for STEM deficiencies among 9th graders place them at risk of dropping out while STEM deficiencies among 11th and 12th graders preclude them from pursuing STEM majors in college and therefore from pursuing well paid STEM careers. We will accomplish this by training, placing, supporting, and assessing the impact of, an indigenous STEM mentor corps of successful undergraduate role models. By changing STEM aspirations and expectations while heightening their own sense of self-efficacy, we expect this corps to replenish itself and so permanently increase the flow of the state?s indigenous populations into STEM majors and careers ? in line with NSF?s mission to promote the progress of science while advancing the national health, prosperity and welfare.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our broader goal is to focus the talents and energies of a diverse collective of community stakeholders on the empowerment of its local college population to address and solve a STEM disparity that bears directly on the community?s well-being in a fashion that is generalizable to other marginalized communities. The scope of our project is defined by six tightly coupled new programs: three bringing indigenous STEM mentors to students, one training mentors, one training mentees to value and grow their network of mentors, and one training teachers to partner with us in STEM. The intellectual merit of our project lies not only in its assertion that authentic STEM mentors will exert an outsize influence in their communities while increasing their own sense of self-efficacy, but in the creation and careful application of instruments that assess the factors that determine teens? attitudes, career interests, and behaviors toward a STEM future; and mentors? sense of self development and progress through STEM programs. More precisely, evaluation of the programs has the potential to clarify two important questions about the role of college-age mentors in schools: (1) To what degree is the protege?s academic performance and perceived scholastic competence mediated by the mentor?s impact on (a) the quality of the protege?s parental relationship and (b) the social capital of the allied classroom teacher; (2) To what degree does the quality of the student mentor?s relationships with faculty and peers mediate the impact of her serving as mentor on her self-efficacy, academic performance, and leadership skills?</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   Northern New Mexico College (NNMC) is the oldest Hispanic Serving Institution in the country and one of the few that are also Native American Serving Non-Tribal. Through an NSF INCLUDES pilot, The Northern New Mexico STEM Mentor Collective at NNMC developed key partnerships with local schools, foundations, and nonprofits. Our Collective places Underrepresented STEM College students at the fulcrum of a Community of Practice that    prepares college students to mentor and lead, through both soft and hard skills training, prepares high school students to value mentors, through a workshop called Expanding your Network of Caring Adults, prepares school teachers to engage their students in small group, multi-week, hands-on, mentored STEM projects.    We have successfully established such Mentored Communities in local libraries and Elementary, Middle, and High Schools in five school districts - serving hundreds of students and dozens of teachers with over 30 trained, devoted mentors. We have expanded our Mentor/Leader training and recruiting to all other regional higher educational institutions.    Our Collective was awarded a STEMY by the Air Force Research Lab at Kirtland Air Force Base for best STEM Outreach from a New Mexico Institution of Higher Education in 2018.    Improving the STEM classroom experience for all requires much more than trained facilitators. Our Collective aims for mentors to inspire students and teachers to embrace STEM projects in a way that changes their whole attitude toward learning. As one example of such an outcome we point to the attached graphic, created by a Santa Fe High School teacher as part of an extensive blog post of her experience in a mentor driven week of professional development where she and her fellow teachers built, wired, and programmed a laser guitar.
