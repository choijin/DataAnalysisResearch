<AbstractNarration>The National Center for Science and Engineering Statistics (NCSES) at the National Science Foundation collects high-quality data on the scientific workforce, but these data are not as widely utilized by the larger Science of Science and Innovation Policy (SciSIP) community because of changes in survey instruments over time and the data format restrictions.  The NSF only supports SAS for NCSES data whereas the majority of researchers use STATA.  This proposed research will break down the barriers to using SESTAT and SDR data for the SciSIP community that in the long-run, could yield new insights about science policy.  This project will create data infrastructure and enhancements for NCSES data that will be posted to the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) website for use by the broader research community.  The proposed data tools and data sets are public goods for the Science of Science and Innovation Policy research community. In the process of developing these tools one graduate student will be trained.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project creates the 1993 ? 2013 Harmonized Survey of Doctorate Recipients (SDR) and Harmonized Science and Engineering Data System (SESTAT) data.  In both the SDR and SESTAT variable definitions have changed, major fields have been added, and answers to questions have also changed. This proposal creates SAS and STATA code for use with the restricted-use and public-use versions of the SDR and SESTAT micro data that harmonizes variable definitions based on the 2013 variable definitions where possible.  This source code will be accompanied by a working paper and posted to the NBER website.  Second, it will create a data set of patents assigned to US campuses.  The United States Patent and Trademark Office has matched patents to university assignees.  While some of the university assignees are single campuses, several are large university systems (e.g. the Regents of the University of California).  This project will use several sources to assign patents to individual campuses. In addition, the PI will identify whether these patents acknowledge federal research funding and the source of that funding. The patent data will be linked to campuses using IPEDS codes and can be merged onto the SDR or linked to other patent data.  Third, it will create a data set of NSF and NIH funding ranks to be used as quality measures.  Previous research has found that NIH funding rank was a better measure of institution quality than NRC ranking or Carnegie ranking. This project proposes to create data on the NIH and NSF funding rank of an institution by major research field and year matched to institutional IPEDS codes. These data can then be merged onto SDR data by IPEDS code in order to have improved measures of institutional quality.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project created several enhancements for NCSES data that are posted on the following website https://ipsr.ku.edu/CSTEP/eager.shtml or can be made available to those with access to the NORC Data Enclave for use by the broader research community by emailing the PI, Donna Ginther (dginther@ku.edu).  This project's intellectual merit is making NCSES data easier to use for the Science Policy research community.  These data are the foundation of the Science of Science and Innovation Policy (SciSIP) research enterprise. NSF only supports SAS for NCSES data whereas the majority in the research community use STATA.  This research has made Science and Engineering Data System (SESTAT) and the Survey of Doctorate Recipients (SDR) more accessible for the SciSIP community that in the long-run, could yield new insights about science policy.  This project had the broader impact of contributing data and code as public goods for the Science of Science and Innovation Policy research community. In the process of developing these tools one graduate student was trained.      This project resulted in the following data or statistical code products:     NCSES SAS to STATA CODE:  Statistical code to convert the public and restricted-use versions of the Science and Engineering Data System (SESTAT), the National Survey of College Graduates (NSCG), and the Survey of Doctorate Recipients (SDR) data from SAS to STATA data sets.  These data are delivered in SAS format, however many researchers use STATA.  This code coverts all variables to numeric and adds variable and value labels.  This code converts the 1993-2013 SESTAT from SAS to STATA as well as the 2015 and 2017 NSCG and SDR. IPF-IPEDS-FICE-DUNS CROSSWALK: In order to link institutional information to many NCSES data sets, this project created a crosswalk that assigns to each organization name their corresponding NIH identifier (IPF code), IPEDS code (UNITID), FICE code, and Dun &amp; Bradstreet (DUNS) number.  This crosswalk is available in Excel and STATA formats. NIH FUNDING RANK:  The amount of federal research funding received by a higher education institution is a measure of the research intensity and quality of that institution.  As a result, we created the NIH funding rank of higher education institutions from 1985-2017.  This data is linked to the IPEDS code and can be linked to other data sources such as the Survey of Doctorate Recipients.   HIGHER EDUCATION RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT SURVEY (HERDS) FUNDING RANK: This data set contains yearly rankings of institutions of higher education from 1990 to 2015, constructed using the NSF?s Higher Education Research and Development Survey (HERDS).  This ranks institutions by total federal research funding, as well as research funding by broad scientific fields including computer science, engineering, geosciences, life sciences, biomedical, other life sciences, mathematics, physical sciences, chemistry, psychology, social sciences, economics, other social sciences, and non-science and engineering fields.  HARMONIZED RESTRICTED USE SURVEY OF DOCTORATE RECIPIENTS:  We created a harmonized version of the 1993-2015 Survey of Doctorate Recipients with consistent variable definitions across all years of data.  These longitudinal data can be used to analyze individual career outcomes.  These data are available on the NORC data enclave. HARMONIZED RESTRICTED USE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING DATA SYSTEM (SESTAT):  We created a harmonized version of the 1993-1993 and 2003-2013 restricted use SESTAT longitudinal data with consistent variable definitions across all years of data.  These longitudinal data can be used to analyze individual career outcomes.  These data are available on the NORC data enclave.
