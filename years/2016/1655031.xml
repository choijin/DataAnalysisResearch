<AbstractNarration>The geosciences continue to lag other science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) disciplines in the engagement, recruitment and retention of traditionally underrepresented and underserved minorities, requiring more focused and strategic efforts to address this problem. Diversity is a vital priority for the geosciences community because it promotes innovation, strengthens the community's ability to tackle complex geoscience research problems, and engenders widespread public Earth and environmental science literacy.  Achieving diversity at larger and systemic scales requires a network of diversity "champions" who can catalyze widespread adoption of these evidence-based best practices and resources. Although many members of the geoscience community are committed to the ideals of broadening participation, the skills and competencies that empower people who wish to have an impact, and make them effective as leaders in that capacity for sustained periods of time, must be cultivated through professional development.  NSF's GEO Opportunities for Leadership in Diversity (GOLD) solicitation will result in a multiple pilot programs for professional development for Geoscientists to enable them to become champions for diversity.  This workshop will bring together the principle investigators of the GOLD projects to create synergy among the projects, strengthening their likelihood of success.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop will work on further development of funded projects on common issues, build community and synergy among the projects, and provide leadership development for the project teams.  The leadership development will be related to 1) leading successful change projects on complex issues and 2) leading diversity and inclusion focused change.  The workshop will facilitate intra-team and inter-team dialog about change strategies and goals.  Best practice tools and knowledge related to leading diversity and inclusion focused change will come out of the workshop.</AbstractNarration>
