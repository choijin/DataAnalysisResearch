<AbstractNarration>This award will support the participation of mathematical sciences graduate students and postdoctoral researchers in the National Conference of the Society for the Advancement of Chicanos and Native Americans in Science (SACNAS) held October 13-15, 2016 in Long Beach, California.  SACNAS is a society of scientists dedicated to fostering the success of Hispanic/Chicano and Native American scientists from college students to professionals to attain advanced degrees, careers, and positions of leadership in science. One way SACNAS strives to achieve their goals is through their annual National Conference, whose programming includes scientific symposia sessions featuring talks by members of the scientific research community. The purpose of these sessions is to present research from diverse disciplines, share advanced research and discoveries, interact with attendees, and mentor science students. In addition to scientific symposia, the conference also includes professional development sessions, undergraduate poster presentations, graduate student and postdoctoral fellow oral presentations, and a mathematical sciences keynote address.  All of these components are useful in promoting the professional advancement of mathematical sciences researchers from under-represented groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Several mathematical sciences symposia will be held at the 2016 SACNAS conference.  Topics include computational mathematics, mathematical modeling, biostatistics, algebraic structures, and topological entanglement of biopolymers.  These symposia are geared towards the beginning graduate student level, providing good accessibility to more junior participants.  Each symposium involves as leaders several mathematical sciences faculty members who have strong experience mentoring students.  The faculty leaders represent a diverse set of institutions.  The conference will also entail professional development sessions, one of which will focus on the benefits of undergraduate research programs for students and another which will focus on mathematics outside of academia.
