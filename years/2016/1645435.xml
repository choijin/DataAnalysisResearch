<AbstractNarration>NSF actively promotes the inclusion of graduate students in technical conferences and in the advancement of scientific research. To this affect the IEEE Photonics Society requests that the Photonics Program, within the ECCS Division of the Engineering Directorate at the NSF, sponsor a select number of graduate students to participate in the 2016 IEEE Photonics Society Summer Topicals Meeting Series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Topical Meetings of the IEEE Photonics Society are the premier conference series for exciting, new areas in photonic science, technology, and applications; creating the opportunity to learn about emerging fields and to interact with the research and technology leaders in an intimate environment. The 2016 Summer Topical Meetings are focused on "Emerging Technologies for Green Photonics". The following five Topical meetings will be held:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1.     Emerging Technology for Integrated Photonics (ETIP)&lt;br/&gt;2.     Space-Division Multiplexing and Multimode Photonics (SDMP)&lt;br/&gt;3.     Nanowire Optoelectronics (NANO)&lt;br/&gt;4.     Photonic and Analog Hardware Accelerators for Energy Efficient Computing (PAHAC)&lt;br/&gt;5.     Optical Wireless Communication Latest Trends in Systems and Techniques (OWC)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NSF funding will be used to support travel, per diem, transportation and registration costs for U.S. graduate and undergraduate students. Ten (10) graduate and undergraduate student participants will receive funding to support their participation in the IEEE Photonics Society 2016 Summer Topicals Meeting Series. Additional funds will be used to support other conference related costs such as the Student Poster Session.</AbstractNarration>

The funds were used to support selected students' travel, per diem, transportation and registration costs for U.S. graduate and undergraduate students attending the meetings series and to present their work to the broader conference in a special poster session.  The goal of the grants were to provide material support to facilitate students' engagement in the conference, expose them to unique technical content, and enrich and energize their educational and professional lives.  Each student received $750 in support travel, per diem, transportation and registration costs. Additional funds were used to support related costs such as the Student Poster Session at the San Juan Marriott Resort including but not limited to rental, set up and service charge for poster boards.  In addition to participating and presenting at the conference, each grantee who presented a paper had his or her work archived and published as part of the official IEEE proceedings for the event.  The Topical Meetings of the IEEE Photonics Society is the premier conference series for exciting, new areas in photonic science, technology, and applications; creating the opportunity to learn about emerging fields and to interact with the research and technology leaders in an intimate environment.
