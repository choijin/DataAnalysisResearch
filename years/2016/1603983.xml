<AbstractNarration>The 2016 Yamabe Memorial Symposium will be held from Friday to Sunday, September 30-October 2, 2016, at the School of Mathematics, on the Minneapolis campus of the University of Minnesota. One goal will be, as a way to honor the memory of Hidehiko Yamabe, to advance areas of mathematics related to his interests, which touched in a substantial and ground-breaking way on several quite different areas of mathematics, all of which may be roughly described as having significant geometric aspects. At the same time, it will provide a valuable opportunity for graduate students and junior researchers to interact with, and learn from, mathematicians working at the highest international level. Finally, a long-lasting benefit will be the stimulation of innovative developments in mathematics research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This year is the eighth anniversary of the Yamabe program, on the theme of "Symplectic Geometry and Complex Geometry." Eight experts in this area will be invited to speak. It will be a high-level conference on aspects of symplectic geometry, complex geometry, contact structures and the interactions between these and related areas. The purpose of this Symposium is to bring to our participants deeper understanding of some recent discoveries in those areas, and to bring to the fore new issues that have arisen in light of them. The new understanding will encourage participants to gain a wider perspective of the recently found deep connections between symplectic and complex geometry. Potentially, this knowledge will inspire further discoveries in these and related fields.&lt;br/&gt;Details of the Yamabe Symposium are at http://www.math.umn.edu/yamabe/.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The eighth Yamabe Memorial Symposium, was held Friday afternoon through Sunday morning, September 30-October 2, 2016, at the University of Minnesota Minneapolis. The focus of the Symposium was "Symplectic geometry and complex geometry". Eight leading researchers gave the principal talks. Attending were 55 mainly young mathematicians, 35 of them receiving support from our NSF grant. The purpose of the conference was to inform the attendees of the latest discoveries in the subject and to stimulate discussion among them and with the principal speakers regarding their research, and potential research in this area. Timely face-to-face meetings like this, are often much more productive than communication via email. Mathematicians can speak informally with each other,  exchanging, exploring and clarifying ideas which are perhaps not fully formed. Such a meeting  is also venue for establishing collaborations formed to attack specific outstanding problems. Symplectic geometry and complex geometry are two deeply connected areas which also have their unique structures. Some of the special topological properties of compact Ka ?hler manifolds are not shared by symplectic manifolds. However their is abundance of symplectic rigidity. Gromov?s foundational work on the pseudo-holomorphic curve theory coupled with ideas from gauge theory and string theory, has led to Gromov-Witten invariants and various versions of Floer homology, which set up enumerative and homological mirror symmetry respectively. The conference aimed at presenting the recent advances of these topics to the audience.  Without NSF support, programs like this would be impossible to mount. It is one example of how NSF funds are used to advance mathematics research in the U.S.          Last Modified: 10/31/2017       Submitted by: Yu-Jong Tzeng]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
