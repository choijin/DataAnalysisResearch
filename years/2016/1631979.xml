<AbstractNarration>ACM Mobihoc has been a premier venue for publishing results on the theory and design of wireless networks and mobile computing, and serves among the top two venues that attract leading researchers in this area. The 2016 edition of this conference features a technical program with a sizable portion of papers from several U.S.-based institutions. Given the high cost of travel to this venue, NSF travel grants provided by this award will be used to defray part of the expenses incurred in attending this conference for the travel grantees.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Conference attendance is a crucial part of the life of a researcher. By creating new opportunities for students (especially those from under-represented groups) to attend a high-quality conference, this project will benefit the research community in several ways. The students themselves benefit from the opportunity to meet and interact with many other researchers in a favorable setting, and from attending research presentations that may be related to their research areas. The research community benefits from the improvement of the students in the pipeline, and from the introduction of new researcher perspectives. Additionally, everybody benefits from increased diversity of participants attending the conference. Given that the PI has reserved a portion of the travel funds to target under-represented groups in this area, it will increase the international exposure for such grantees.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Organized by the ACM SIGMOBILE Society, MobiHoc is the premier international symposium dedicated to addressing the challenges emerging from wireless networking and computing. The highly selective technical program has traditionally brought together a unique blend of researchers and practitioners thereby influencing the direction of a broad spectrum of wireless networking and mobile computing research. The program consists of technical sessions, workshops, panels, and tutorials. This project aimed at providing students based in the United States conducting research in the field of mobile computing and networking with the opportunity to attend the MobiHoc 2016.   The conference took place in Paderborn, Germany from July 5th to 8th, 2016. Information about the 2016 conference can be found at: http://www.sigmobile.org/mobihoc/2016/. A total of 16 students selected were from all over the country through a competitive application based on the student's CV, a letter from the student and recommendation of the advisor.   The following institutions were represented in the awards made to the students: UIUC, Virginia Tech, Univ. of Michigan, USC, Rice Univ., Columbia Univ., University of Tennessee Knoxville, UC-Davis, The Ohio State University, Stony Brook, Missourie Science and Technology -Rolla, University of Notre Dame. In some of these universities, there was more than one student selected for the award.  4/16 selected students were women engineers. All students were enrolled in full time Ph.D. degree programs within US universities at the time of the application.  To ensure an equal opportunity for all interested individuals to apply for the travel funds, the program was advertised in several ways, including an announcement on the MobiHoc 2016 web page and other appropriate mailing lists.  Attending a high-caliber technical venue like Mobicom is extremely valuable for future researchers. Not only were the students exposed to the state-of-the-art in the field, but they also had the opportunity to interact with peers from institutions worldwide, meet with leading researchers, and take part in discussions that are likely to shape the future of the field (e.g., in terms of technology, standards, etc).
