<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is that it will address an important public health problem - restoring mobility in individuals with disability. The proposed technology offers a new assistive device for wheelchair users to improve their upper-body strength and wheelchair mobility. Adequate strength and mobility are critical for overcoming obstacles, functioning independently, and maintaining quality of life. Nearly every healthcare facility provides some form of treatment to the 3 million U.S. adults who rely on wheelchairs for assistance. The clinical significance of establishing this technology as a robust and usable assistive device is that it could be used in facilities where a large number of wheelchair users are treated. Using this technology to improve strength and mobility could help to reduce the enormous healthcare costs associated with caring for individuals that have disabilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project will obtain feedback from wheelchair users, clinicians, and assistive device manufactures to better understand mobility challenges that wheelchair users face. Engaging in physical activity is a top priority for wheelchair users and effective interventions that improve strength and wheelchair mobility deserve widespread implementation. However, there are major barriers that negatively impact wheelchair user's ability to engage in physical activity. This technology circumvents several of these limitations. Research indicates that compared to traditional devices, this technology is wheelchair accessible and highly adjustable, elicit greater strength gains, and serves as a safe movement for wheelchair users. Exploring customer needs and motivations will provide a better understanding of the market opportunity of the technology to further address mobility related challenges.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>We participated in the NSF Innovation Corps (I-Corps) program in the Summer of 2016. Our team consisted of Steven Elmer (PI), Matthew Kilgas (Entrepreneurial Lead), and Michael Morley (Business Mentor). Our goal was to explore the customer base surrounding our technology for wheelchair users and to understand the market opportunity. For this program we traveled to San Francisco, CA on two separate occasions for multi-day workshops where we interacted with other I-Corps teams and received hands-on training from the I-Corps instructors. As part of the I-Corps curriculum we were tasked with conducting 100 customer interviews. We were also required to complete weekly webinars to learn about sections of the business model canvas which included customers segments, potential partners, pricing, and revenue models. Collectively, our team members interviewed wheelchair users (sedentary individuals to Olympic athletes), physical therapists, fitness center owners, and equipment manufacturers. Each week we documented the interviews and presented our results to the teaching team through a videoconference. Based on that feedback we revised our business model and proceeded with more interviews. One of the most important outcomes of the program was that we were able to broaden our customer segment beyond just wheelchair users. Accordingly, we interviewed other patients and clinicians in the area of cardiopulmonary rehabilitation to find out their pain points and how we could potentially adapt our technology to address these needs. In general, the customer feedback that we received through this program has helped us improve our technology by adapting it for both wheelchair users and able-bodied individuals. Broader impacts include translating this research device into rehabilitation to help improve mobility for individuals living with disabilities. Finally, the I-Corps program provided valuable entrepreneurship training to the principle investigator and graduate student and helped them better engage with industry.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 10/28/2017<br>      Modified by: Steven&nbsp;J&nbsp;Elmer</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
