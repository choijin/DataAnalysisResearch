<AbstractNarration>This project will provide long-term support for external evaluation activities and services for the Computing and Information Sciences and Engineering Research Experiences for Undergraduates (CISE REU) community. This project will address the ongoing need among principal investigators who are fulfilling CISE REU Site program evaluation efforts by providing an evaluation toolkit that facilitates evaluation reporting while strengthening research about undergraduate research program outcomes. The primary purpose of the evaluation Toolkit is to provide targeted resources and tools for quality program evaluation that balance the desire for standardized assessment along with the responsibility to account for individual program contexts. Toolkit contents include instructional materials about evaluation practice, a standardized applicant management tool, and a validated modulated outcomes measure. Services associated with the Toolkit are providing a Common Application for site recruiting, coordinating a Shared Applicant Pool for principal investigators to share applicants across sites, delivering an online student survey known as the A la Carte Student Survey, and developing tailored analyses to REU Site principle investigators. Project expansion will include development of an Alumni Tracking tool to help investigators evaluate long-term outcomes and a study of faculty mentoring and career impact. The benefits of the toolkit are in providing cost effective, sustainable evaluation tools, a community forum for program evaluation, and aggregate measurement of key program outcomes indicators. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The key contribution of project is in the refinement of understanding evidence-based practices in evaluating undergraduate research programs to help faculty successfully manage these programs. The project contributes to understanding the impact of undergraduate computing research programs for both students and faculty participants. The comprehensive program evaluation will inform collective efforts to recruit and mentor undergraduate students involved in cutting-edge research. The knowledge generated by this study will also provide insights about how faculty engage in REU Sites and the impact on their careers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The CISE REU Evaluation Toolkit Project  The CISE REU Evaluation Toolkit project was born out of an expressed need among  faculty who manage summer research experiences for undergraduates (REUs) withinn the Computing Information Sciences and Engineering (CISE) fields. Launched in 2010 and managed with NSF support for 10 years, the Toolkit project provides evaluation and outcomes assessment support to faculty overseeing summer REUS, while also providing aggregate summative information about undergraduate students who apply to and participate in summer research. The tools contained in the Toolkit include the following.  Common Application: This is a standardized set of application questions that faculty can use to manage student applications to their research programs. The applicant data is aggregated across the CISE REU Programs to inform the community about trends in student interest in research and the demographics of the applicant pool.  Shared Applicant Pool: This feature of the Toolkit provides students who apply to a summer research program with greater opportunities to be considered by other summer programs, if they wish. It also allows faculty to expand their pool of candidates for their summer programs.  A la Carte Survey: The pre and post student survey is designed to measure student outcomes from their program participation, that are aligned with the CISE REU program goals. It?s known as ?a la carte? because it is modular, and faculty can tailor it to their specific programs. For example, all faculty use the self-efficacy module, but some add the sense of belonging module.  Alumni Tracker: This feature provides a set of common follow up questions so that students who participated in an REU can report graduations, entrance into graduate school, and career successes.  Online Resoures:  The Toolkit features are provided as open-source on its website. Resources are curated that address the unique context of undergraduate research programs in computing. Many other disciplines have used the resources, such as Engineering and Chemistry research programs.  Highlights of Student Outcomes 2010-2020  Not only does the Toolkit support faculty who manage undergraduate research programs, it also serves as an information source about program application and outcome trends.  Student applications to the CISE REU programs has increased 5-fold over ten years. Students have reported gains in research skills every year. Self-efficacy, students? belief in their abilities, have increased statistically for 9 years in a row.   These findings are indicative that the CISE REU Program is making a positive impact on students in computing. The Toolkit resources make  this information is possible to capture and share with the community, by providing mechanisms to show consistent outcomes across all projects. The Toolkit resources have provided faculty who manage REU projects access to evaluation and measurement resources that are relevant, customizable, and save them time and effort.
