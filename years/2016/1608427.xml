<AbstractNarration>One of the major intellectual achievements of the 20th century was the development of the Standard Model (SM) of particle physics. This model succeeded in classifying all of the elementary particles known at the time into a hierarchy of groups having similar quantum properties. The validity of this model to date was recently confirmed by the discovery of the Higgs boson at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. However, the Standard Model as it currently exists leaves open many questions about the universe, including such fundamental questions as to why the Higgs mass has the value it has and why there is no antimatter in the universe. A primary area to search for answers to these and other open questions about the universe, how it came to be and why it is the way it is, is to focus on a study of the properties of neutrinos and to use what we know and can learn about neutrinos as probes of science beyond the Standard Model. Neutrinos are those elementary particles that interact with practically nothing else in the universe. They have no electric charge and were once thought to be massless. Like other elementary particles, they were believed to have an antimatter counterpart, the antineutrino. Moreover, the Standard Model predicted that there were actually three different kinds of neutrinos that were distinguishable through the different interactions that they did undergo whenever there was an interaction. But recent measurements have totally changed our picture of neutrinos. We now know that neutrinos do have a mass and because they do, they can actually change from one type to another. Detailed measurements of these changes, along with other current neutrino experiments, form one of the most promising ways to probe for new physics Beyond the Standard Model (BSM), and are the subject of this investigation. This research will involve the work of undergraduate students at an RUI. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports work, using the neutrino beam at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (FNAL), on three related neutrino experiments: MINERvA, Nova and MINOS+, all measuring neutrino oscillations: muon neutrino to electron neutrino transitions. To correctly measure these transitions, precise knowledge of neutrino interactions is required. This award will be used to measure (using the MINERvA detector) these interactions across a wide energy range available at FNAL. This will improve our knowledge of the neutrino flux, useful for future Short Baseline (detector near the source at FNAL) and Long Baseline (detector hundreds of kilometers away) experiments as well as the current Nova experiment. The work on the MINOS+ experiment will help map out the shape of the energy dependence of the neutrino oscillation probability, which could reveal new anomalies in the neutrino sector. A number of BSM proposed phenomena, from sterile neutrinos to extra dimensions, can cause measurable deviations in the neutrino oscillation probability in the 4-10GeV range.&lt;br/&gt;A special contribution of this award and an exciting broader impact of this research program is the development and implementation of 3D visualization tools to guide the physics analyses of the experiments and to render visible to students and the public the nature of neutrino interactions as recorded and studied by scientists.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This grant supported work at Otterbein University to contribute to several ongoing neutrino physics experiments. The majority of our work was on the MicroBooNE short-baseline neutrino oscillation experiment. MicroBoonE serves two purposes, one scientific and one technical.  The scientific goal is to look for the origin of anomolies seen in earlier experiments, namely LSND and MiniBooNE.  These experiments saw excesses of electron-neutrino-like events in muon-neutrino beams.  These excesses could be due to new neutrino physics, or misunderstood neutrino-nucleus interactions.  MicroBooNE aims to resolve this issue by cafefully examing neutrino events in relevant energy range to see exactly what the interaction looks like.   The technical goal was to build the first US-based, large-scale liquid argon time-projection chamber (LArTPC), and to improve on existing designs for saftey, stability, reconstruction software, and so on, while building up US-based expertise in these systems. The LArTPC technology uniquely serves neutrino experiments in allowing high-resolution images of neutrino interactions with nuclei.  Our group, consisting of a PI faculty member and 2-3 undergraduates, worked on various parts of this project. We developed a powerful web-based event display package called Argo (shown in figure) that allows scientists and students from around the world to see live, simulated, or reconstructed data from the MicroBooNE detector.  We helped debug and maintain many low-level systems, including the novel "supernova" continuous readout data stream, and the online monitoring tools to ensure detector stability.  Our students worked on several studies of detector performance and stability with both the light- and charge-collection systems. We contributed to important outreach programs as well.  We also began to transfer our tools and experitse to the new DUNE experiment, currently under design and early construction.   Students at Otterbein were supported by this grant financially and were given opportunity to develop scientific skills, work in a large international collaboration, and see how real scientists work in "big science".  All of our students have graduated their undergraduate programs, and mosthave gone on to graduate school in physics or related disciplines.   Despite the small size of this group, we have made substantial contributions to important scientific endeavors.        Last Modified: 08/13/2020       Submitted by: Nathaniel Tagg]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
