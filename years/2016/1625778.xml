<AbstractNarration>Non-technical: &lt;br/&gt;This Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) grant awarded to Texas State University at San Marcos (TxState) provides funding for the acquisition of an Atomic Force Microscope (AFM). This high-resolution instrument enhances the research and educational capabilities at TxState, a Hispanic Serving Institution. Because AFM data is highly visual, the results are accessible to non-scientists and will thus engage students not already committed to STEM. The proposed instrument acquisition will immediately impact 58 students and postdocs upon acquisition (with hundreds of additional users over the lifespan of the instrument). The addition of this tool to TxState, where 55% of the students and postdocs are underrepresented in science and engineering, will have a long-term impact on a diverse population of students and the institution in which they are trained. In addition, this acquisition strengthens, in particular, the research activities of the NSF-funded PREM Center on Interfaces in Materials (PREM: Partnerships in Research and Education in Materials). A primary goal of the PREM Center is to increase the participation of underrepresented minorities in materials research. Data from this instrument will impact energy and medical-related research projects that are intended to enrich our lives. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical: &lt;br/&gt;Atomic Force Microscope (AFM) is a scanning probe technology that identifies surface features at the nanometer scale. AFM will be used by Texas State University at San Marcos (TxState) to advance fundamental surface science and applications in energy and biomaterials-related research topics. Specifically, this acquisition of a AFM Workshop Life Sciences AFM will impact the following materials research areas: 1) nanocomposites, 2) self-assembly of photoactive bioconjugates, 3) nanomaterials for energy storage and conversion, 4) metallo-supramolecular assembly, 5) perovskite solar cells, and 6) stimuli-responsive biomaterials.</AbstractNarration>
