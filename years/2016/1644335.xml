<AbstractNarration>The 2016 Campus Cyberinfrastructure and Cybersecurity Innovation for Cyberinfrastructure PI Workshop builds upon the success of the previous Campus Cyberinfrastructure Workshops while also expanding its scope to include awards from the awards from the NSF's Cybersecurity Innovation for Cyberinfrastructure program.  The workshop provides the opportunity for NSF Campus Cyberinfrastructure (CC) and Cybersecurity Innovation for Cyberinfrastructure (CiCi) award recipients to meet in person, exchange project findings, interact with national cyberinfrastructure experts and collaborate across project areas and project regions.   As with the 2015 CC PI Workshop, the 2016 PI Workshop is co-located with two other community meetings, the ESnet Site Coordinators Committee (ESCC) meeting and The Quilt Fall Member meeting.   The workshop builds on the last year's success developing strong ties between cyberinfrastructure, science driven applications and regional and national cyberinfrastructure resources, including those new to the program.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this project is the exchange of project findings, interaction between national cyberinfrastructure experts and discipline area researchers as well as collaboration across project areas and project regions that will lead to new ideas and relationships that develop from an in person workshop.   The broader impact associated with the workshop includes the dissemination of workshop information, including the workshop presentations to the campus and research community in general. By including awardees from all areas of the Campus Cyberinfrastructure program as well as the Cybersecurity Innovation for Cyberinfrastructure program the workshop facilitates interaction and collaboration between research intensive and under-resourced colleges and universities as well as different cyberinfrastructure program areas in ways that would not otherwise occur. Co-locating the 2016 PI Workshop once again with the ESCC and Quilt meetings builds upon the relationships developed last year leading to a broader set of collaborations and lasting impact on national campus cyberinfrastructure and science driven applications.</AbstractNarration>
