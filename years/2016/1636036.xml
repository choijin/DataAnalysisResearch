<AbstractNarration>Nanoscale materials are found in many consumer products to serve as particle reinforcement in a polymer matrix; the material system is called a polymer nanocomposite. One such example is the use of nanoscale silica particles in tires to improve fuel economy. Choices of material combinations are often determined through trial and error experiments.  This research grant will enable the design of polymer nanocomposites via an informed approach using computational modeling and experiments, resulting in a simple tool to predict compatibility as a function of material types and processing conditions. Potential applications for polymer nanocomposites include solar cells, sports equipment, medical devices and aerospace structures.  The project will involve several female undergraduate students through a program at the University of Cincinnati as well as high school students through the University of Dayton Summer Honors Institute and the Minority Engineering &amp; Technology Enrichment Camp.  Long-standing relationships with Ethiopian universities will be leveraged via grants through the NSF Partnerships for Enhanced Engagement in Research (PEER) program. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Multicomponent polymer mixtures such as nanocomposites are among the most commonly used polymeric materials, but there is a significant gap in the understanding of how hierarchical structure develops in such systems. This research tests the hypothesis that it is possible to accurately determine a parameter controlling filler dispersion in a polymer matrix, and to employ this parameter in a toolbox to predict optimized structure and performance. The approach couples a pseudo-thermodynamic analysis of binary mixtures to obtain a pseudo-second order virial coefficient which quantifies binary enthalpic interactions, and which relates to a coarse-grained potential. This parameter will be employed in mesoscale simulations to predict optimal compositions, processing conditions, dispersion and/or segregation of components in complex blends, correlation functions and correlation lengths for fillers. These features can also be experimentally determined in separate x-ray and neutron scattering measurements. Therefore, the researched work involves three novel components: 1) tabulation of pseudo-second order virial coefficients using scattering and determination of potential functions for simulation; 2) dissipative particle dynamics  simulations of binary, ternary, quaternary mixtures using potentials from part 1; 3) x-ray and neutron scattering, microscopy, dynamic mechanical and rheological measurements to verify simulation results. The outcome of our approach is a practical solution to compounding issues, based on a mutually validating experimental and simulation methodology.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Polymer nanocomposites and macromolecular behavior at surfaces and interfaces have been of abiding interest for decades. In most practical applications commonly employed by industry, large quantities of fillers are added to provide effective mechanical reinforcement and other properties such as anti-oxidative effects. However, the role of complex interfaces generated by such aggregated and agglomerated filler particles in determining system behavior, as well as the hierarchical structure that develops in these systems is yet to be completely determined, or satisfactorily manipulated to give dialed-in properties.</p> <p>In this project, we have performed mesoscale dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) simulations to investigate the kinetic and structural behavior of disordered filler polymer nanocomposites. Binary and ternary blends were explored in order to predict chain partitioning and segregation effects. DPD simulations demonstrate the growth of a hierarchical network of ramified fillers, validating rheological measurements and small-angle scattering analysis [Gogia et al. (2021)]. The large-scale global network is formed at approximately 8 wt% of additive, and is evidenced by the emergence of percolating agglomerates formed by clustering of primary particle aggregates. Simulations also reveal that the assembly of such large clusters is accompanied by a change in their dimensionality: scaling analysis shows that the percolating clusters have a different fractal nature than smaller ones. These so-called spanning clusters are found to be denser and less ramified than smaller agglomerates, invariant on polymer-filler size or interactions. Global percolation is influenced by the mass fractal dimension of the aggregate. Local network formation is demonstrated at much lower concentrations, and is found to be strongly dependent on the thermodynamic parameter governing dispersion of fillers.</p> <p>DPD modeling is further validated against theoretical predictions of agglomerate formation. Since the simulations explore true global equilibrium in systems where significant overlap between particles occurs, an assessment against hierarchical thermodynamic models for <em>"soft" </em>aggregates is warranted. Our results reveal that the number distributions of freely associating additive clusters formed are commensurate with the aggregate theory of Mulderig et al. (2019). These comparisons are critical in developing the mesoscale simulation technique as an effective predictive tool for thermodynamic and kinetic behavior of experimental systems ranging from carbon black and silica filled elastomers, pigment blends to inks.</p> <p>In addition to mesoscale simulations, there is considerable merit to considering how polymers interact with, and adsorb onto, inhomogeneous surfaces. This is because most commercial fillers possess surface features that are rarely uniform, and there is little knowledge of the nanoscale thermomechanical behavior of heterogenous interfaces. Furthermore, isolating the effects of roughness in nanocomposite properties is challenging due to the difficulty in accurately synthesizing fillers with well-defined asperities. Since the fillers evaluated in the DPD studies exhibit complex hierarchical structures with irregular features, a less coarse grained united atom model which maintained fidelity to the mesoscale structures was developed. Monte Carlo simulations of polymers adjacent to rough substrates of varying surface fractal dimensions were performed as shown in Venkatakrishnan &amp; Kuppa (2018). These investigations reveal that adsorption is non-monotonic, dependent on both the fractal nature and the amplitude of height variations from mean. Further studies are planned to correlate interfacial width and attachment strength to roughness. Addressing this challenging problem is key to the rational design of not only more effective polymer composites, but also for better understanding the broader category of macromolecular interaction with substrates, including for protein adsorption, catalysis and biomimetics.</p> <p>The project also afforded considerable scope for outreach to underserved high-school students not well-represented in STEM fields in higher education. A JAVA module for a nanocomposite bridge design was developed by an undergraduate student, and was used in the Women in Engineering and Summer Honors summer camps every summer that the grant was active, except 2020 (due to shutdowns caused by the COVID-19 pandemic). The module was used as a game, encouraging participants to compete in coming up with creative solutions for engineering a bridge that could withstand the weight of a puppy attempting to cross a ravine. Not only did the gaming aspect of the module appeal to young prospective engineers, but it also encouraged imaginative answers for cost and environmental consciousness in materials selection. The module was highly successful as demonstrated by summative assessments; a large majority of the participants were inspired to show a greater interest in STEM disciplines in general, and polymer science and materials engineering in particular. The module will continue to be offered every year at the University of Dayton, since it has proven to be an effective recruiting strategy for the College of Engineering.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 12/29/2020<br>      Modified by: Vikram&nbsp;K&nbsp;Kuppa</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1636036/1636036_10441345_1609268840901_VMD_NSF_2--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1636036/1636036_10441345_1609268840901_VMD_NSF_2--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 1"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1636036/1636036_10441345_1609268840901_VMD_NSF_2--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 1"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Snapshot of DPD simulation box and percolated (spanning) agglomerate formed by clustering of disordered aggregates.
