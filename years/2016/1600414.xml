<AbstractNarration>This award provides funding to help defray the expenses of participants in the "Concluding Conference of the Special Program on Nonlinear Equations: Progress and Challenges in Nonlinear Equations" that will be held April 8-10, 2016, on the campus of Harvard University.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Center of Mathematical Sciences and Applications (CMSA) at Harvard University will host a Special Program on Nonlinear Equations during the academic year 2015-2016. This program will include a large cohort of expert visitors from around the world in the areas of partial differential equations, including experts in general relativity, geometric analysis, and nonlinear equations. Harvard University will host a three-day capstone conference to conclude the activities of the Special Program. The conference will include both speakers who are participating in the program and outside speakers. The dates were chosen to reflect the highest concentration of visitors to the CMSA in order to provide a rich research environment for conference attendees. The goal of the conference is to facilitate collaboration among experts in various fields of analysis, with the goal of making progress on some of the most fundamental open problems in mathematics and physics. The conference program provides ample opportunity for graduate students, postdocs, and other young scientists to present their work.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Nonlinear partial differential equations lie at the heart of physics and mathematics, describing everything from fluid flow to the motion of the planets and the shapes of bubbles.  This project funded two conferences and a mini-school in nonlinear analysis.   The first conference, "The concluding conference of the special program on nonlinear equations" was held at the Center of Mathematical Sciences and Applications (CMSA) at Harvard University from April 8-10, 2016.  It featured talks by 15 renowned experts on nonlinear analysis in topics ranging from fluids and general relativity to string theory and gauge theory.  The NSF funding was used to support the attendance of 29 young researchers.  The second conference, titled "Workshop on aspects of general relativity", was held on May 23-24, 2016 at the CMSA and featured talks by 14 established experts in mathematical general relativity.  NSF funding supported the attendance of  11 young researchers.  The  "Mini-school on nonlinear equations" was held December 3-4, 2016 and featured mini-courses taught in four different areas of nonlinear analysis, taught by established experts in the field.  NSF funding was used to support the attendance of  20 young researchers.  Overall, the project brought together experts in diverse aspects of nonlinear analysis, early career researchers and graduate students for intensive discussions on aspects of nonlinear partial differential equations.  The mini-school detailed some of the most important advances in nonlinear analysis in the past 40 years, explained by recognized experts, with the intent of fostering the development of the next generation of researchers in this important area of mathematics.  The project resulted in a two-volume series detailing the proceedings of the thematic year on nonlinear equations held during 2015-2016 at the Center of Mathematical Sciences and Applications, at Harvard University. Furthermore, all lectures from the conference and mini-school were recorded and released for public consumption on youTube.
