<AbstractNarration>PI: Meiburg, Eckart  &lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: 1630244 &lt;br/&gt;Institution: University of California-Santa Barbara&lt;br/&gt;Title: Travel Support for U.S. Participants Attending the 8th International Symposium on Stratified Flows (San Diego, August 29 - September 1, 2016)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a proposal to support the participation of about 20 US scientists to the 8th International Symposium on Stratified Flows that will take place in San Diego, California, between August 29th and September 1st, 2016. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This symposium is motivated by the need to understand stratified flows of different flavors and scales. Such flows are found all around us, in the atmosphere, in oceans, in rivers and in the chemical process industry. Recent developments in mathematical analysis, laboratory techniques and numerical approaches generate the need to have this symposium five years since the last one in Rome (2011).  The symposium aims, in addition to the dissemination of the most recent research findings, include bringing together researchers across the world to discuss future needs in this field and to educate the next generation of young scientists. Travel and participation costs for about 20 US participants are expected to be funded with the NSF support to this conference, with priority given to younger scientists who would otherwise be unable to attend.</AbstractNarration>
