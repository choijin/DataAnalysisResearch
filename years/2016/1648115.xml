<AbstractNarration>This SBIR phase I project seeks to address the critical need for lung cancer diagnosis at an early stage. North America has the highest age-standardized incidence of lung cancer in the world. An estimated 224,390 new cases of lung cancer will be diagnosed this year and 158,080 deaths are predicted to occur due to lung cancer in 2016. The five-year survival rate for lung cancer patients is much lower when compared to other common cancers due to late-stage diagnosis of the disease in these patients. The survival rate for lung cancer patients significantly improves when the cancer is diagnosed at an early stage. Early detection of lung cancer by computed tomography scanning is disadvantageous to high false positive rates and the need for invasive and expensive follow-up procedures. The breath analysis technology described in this project can mitigate this health crisis by drastically reducing false positives, lowering the cost of diagnosis and reducing the need for repeated radiographic scans or invasive biopsies. Moreover, the cutting-edge breath analysis technology described in this project can be used for other applications, such as environmental monitoring or detecting other diseases including cancers elsewhere in the body.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The central innovation proposed in this project is a silicon microreactor consisting of micropillars coated with a carbonyl-selective reagent that covalently captures volatile carbonyls of cancer metabolism exhaled in alveolar breath. The microreactor retains the adducts of these metabolic markers, concentrating them up to 10,000-fold, while allowing all other tidal breath components to pass through unaffected. The biomarker adducts of the chemoselective reagent are eluted from the microreactor using methanol and then quantified via mass spectrometry. Elevated concentrations of certain carbonyl biomarkers are indicative of cancer. The Phase I research objectives are to demonstrate the effectiveness of newly engineered, fast-flow microreactors coated with chemoselective reagents designed for enhanced reactions with unsaturated aldehydes. The microreactor design will be optimized so as to evacuate exhaled breath samples through the microreactors at 10-fold the current rate without compromising VOC capture efficiencies. Also, new hydrazine-based reagents will be synthesized to serve as microreactor coatings in combination with the current carbonyl-selective microreactor coating. These innovations will enable the microreactor approach to overcome the critical challenges faced by current breath analysis technologies for early detection of lung cancer.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Lung cancer is the leading cause of death among all cancer patients.  The disproportionate mortality due to lung cancer can be mitigated significantly by early detection of the disease.  Breath analysis when integrated with radiographic tests has the potential to detect lung cancer in early stages.  The oxidative stress produced by the variable redox environment within cancer cells increases the production of certain volatile compounds, which then are exhaled in the breath.  However, no breath analysis methods have been clinically adopted for cancer detection due to a host of challenges, such as the complicating large number of distinct chemicals in the breath, low concentrations of marker compounds, variations in breath samples, the lack of identification of cancer-specific markers, and failures to accurately quantify cancer markers.  This project aimed to further develop and optimize a breath analysis tool for non-invasive detection of lung cancer.  The multidisciplinary project required expertise in materials science, clean-room fabrication, electrical engineering, synthetic chemistry, analytical / clinical chemistry and medicine.      The fulfillment of the project led to 3 major technical outcomes:     1.   A longer, more efficient silicon-based microreactor chip has been prepared and tested for the ability to capture of volatile carbonyl compounds in breath.  To accomplish this, several parameters including microreactor pillar shape, pillar width/gap ratio and chip length were studied.  New microreactors were then fabricated using the optimal parameters and subsequently evaluated in breath analysis studies.  The newly designed microreactors captured low abundant metabolites with better efficiency at higher flow rates than the first-generation microreactors.  This key development was a principal goal of the project.     2.   Another significant research achievement concerns the development of an integrated evacuation unit that can accommodate the newly designed microreactor chip for convenient evacuation of a collected breath sample across the chip.   As a result of the funding, Breath Diagnostics has created the first clinical prototype of such an evacuation station.  The new unit features a paired cassette for housing the microreactor chip so as to both protect the chip from breakage and for convenient attachment of the chip to the evacuation unit.  These devices allow ready implementation of the microreactor for breath analysis in clinical settings.  The technical developments also reduced variability in breath analysis and delivered an easy-to-use device that requires minimal handling by an operator.     3.   Analytical development funded by this NSF grant has led to a thorough evaluation of a triple-quad mass spectrometry system for quantification of the captured cancer markers eluted from the microreactor chips.  Prior to the funding, all data had been collected using an FT-ICR-MS system.  Securing the use of an LC-TQMS system now has enabled resolution of isomeric markers (i.e., constitutional isomers), thus, providing more accurate quantification of the cancer markers.  Also, the TQMS system is clinically more robust, cheaper and more available.     Integrating these accomplishments &mdash; improved chips, evacuation station, new analytical platform &mdash; has placed Breath Diagnostics on the path to its first clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy of breath analysis in detecting and diagnosing of lung cancer.  As a logical next step, a small pre-clinical trial will be conducted to re-establish the thresholds of select exhaled cancer markers in cancer patients and control subjects using the improved devices.     This project also supported the participation and interdisciplinary training of recent PhD graduates.  The results obtained from the studies will greatly benefit exploration of breath-based diagnostic modalities for other diseases and may even serve to trigger the clinical and commercial utility of breath analysis.
