<AbstractNarration>The significance of this study is that it seeks to use a Maker space to improve success rate of a gatekeeper course in community college, Precalculus II, which is required course for most STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) students.  This project aims to drastically improve completion rates for this make-or-break course for most community colleges.  The researcher will investigate whether 3d printing, infused at this critical juncture, can save students from falling off the STEM pathway and instead use 3d printing to help unlock STEM potential and passion in students who would not otherwise stay in, or gravitate toward STEM.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of the research is that it builds off of Maker movement momentum and the institution's recent acquisition of its first 3d printer.  The research piece of the project hypothesizes that by "flipping" the College's Precalculus II class with 3d curriculum and adding an optional hands-on lab component, success rate can be improved.  The potential impact 3d printing has on retaining STEM students and students' long-term memory of key math concepts will also be explored. One of the significant broader impacts is that faculty will be better equipped to teach concepts that are tough for most to visualize, let alone grasp. With the efforts described, students will literally be able to grasp the desired concepts as 3d printing offers a vast array of tools not previously available to faculty or students. This project is a part of NSF's Maker Dear Colleague Letter (DCL) portfolio (NSF 15-086), a collaborative investment of Directorates for Computer &amp; Information Science &amp; Engineering (CISE), Education and Human Resources (EHR) and Engineering (ENG).</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Math education often begins with physical objects: counting, adding, subtracting, measuring, and other concrete ideas.  By the time students reach college level, more abstract mathematical ideas are quickly explored, and usually with only verbal or visual methods.  This can lead to confusion and misconceptions on the part of the student, especially if they have a hard time connecting the material to prior knowledge or experiences.  But what if we could leverage the tactile senses again at the college level?  Obstacle to using physical objects and tactile learning at the college level include time constraints and a lack of physical objects and lessons that are ready to be used in the classroom.  Physical manipulatives may rarely be available for ideas that are typically covered in college-level math, but 3D-printing has provided a way for creating manipulatives tailor-made for any topic being taught.  In this study combining active learning with 3D-printed manipulatives, as opposed to only using lecturing methods, resulted in an increase in student success in Precalculus II (Trigonometry) and the subsequent course, Calculus I (even though active learning and manipulatives may not be used in the Calculus class).  All students being compared were from a single Precalculus II professor using different teaching techniques in a total of 9 sections between Fall 2016 and Spring 2018.  Overall, there were 109 students who were in the lecture sections and 192 students in the 3D-Active learning sections of Precalculus II.  From this population of Precalculus II students, there were 43 in the lecture sections and 74 in the 3D-Active learning sections that enrolled in Calculus I by Spring 2018.  Students in Precalculus II sections using active learning with 3D-printed manipulatives saw gains of 8% in overall student success (C or better) when compared to students in lecture sections.  These students were also compared in the subsequent Calculus I course (not using 3D-manipulatives), and those in the active learning Precalculus II sections had 15% higher success rates in Calculus I than those in the lecture sections of Precalculus II.  These results show that the addition of tactile manipulatives and active learning can help improve student success rates.  Given how much tactile learning we do as babies, toddlers, throughout childhood, it shouldn't surprise us that this often forgotten sense can also enhance our learning throughout our late teen years and into adulthood.  Classroom activities and 3D-manipulative files used in this study can be found at http://graspthemath.wordpress.com .
