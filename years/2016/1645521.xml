<AbstractNarration>This award provides support for a workshop that will focus on the technical aspects of observatory infrastructure, both backbone and ?sensor network infrastructure?. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;oOer the last decade many ocean observatories and related components have been installed in the ocean. In many of the current and new ocean observatories there have been failures that impact both the engineering infrastructure as well the science sensors and their performance. This workshop will bring together the leaders and technology developers of these systems to share lessons learned, improve our understanding of best practices, and work to improve performance and reliability.</AbstractNarration>
