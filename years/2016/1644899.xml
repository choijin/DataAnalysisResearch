<AbstractNarration>Despite recently reported positive associations between active-learning instruction and STEM performance and persistence, the impact of active learning on the success of HSI two-year college, and 4-year college transfer students remains largely unstudied. Responding to the need for research on effects of particular strategies, this project will deploy and assess an instructional method/curricular focus concurrent with mentorship that is novel for the target population, and rich in the practices deemed essential for its success (e.g., frequent faculty interactions, and content-based peer-collaborations).  Thus, this project will contribute to filling knowledge gaps on successful STEM interventions, and identify factors bearing upon the success of the target population.  Addressing the need to build capacity to improve STEM teaching at two-year HSIs, this project will forge faculty collaborations across two- and four-year institutions, seeking to improve performance and persistence of the target population before and after transfer. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project goals are to design, implement, and assess interactive-engaged (IE) problem-solving courses complemented by mentorship for pre-calculus students at a large two-year HSI, and pre-calculus/calculus transfer students at a four-year emerging HSI.  Curricula will be co-developed and IE-training will be collaborative.  Outcomes will be assessed using locally relevant (e.g., final exams) and validated, national-scope measures (e.g., concept inventories), enabling comparison of target-group performance gains with national ones, and consistency of performance measures across time and institutions. Qualitative analyses of essay survey data will identify emergent themes in target-group perceptions of mentorship and overall project impact.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project was aimed at exploring the effectiveness of a successful, evidence-based, university-level, precalculus problem-solving course, in a new context, and for a new purpose: improving performance and persistence of 2-year HSI students, before or after transfer to the university.  More generally, this "problem-solving + mentoring" project sought to infuse equity in the transition from 2-year Hispanic Serving Institutions (HSIs) to the university.  The 2-year HSI courses central to this study were taught by community college faculty assisted by university teaching assistants.  Further, these courses were, by design, asset-based, that is, focused on enhancing students' strengths, rather than remediating students' perceived deficits.  Project outcomes at the institutional, instructor, and student level included:  New co-curricular course offerings at two 2-year HSIs, which effectively engaged precalculus 2-year HSI students with conceptual rigor and student-centered pedagogies increasingly common in university gateway courses New faculty capacity at 2-year HSIs for teaching mathematics leveraging evidence-based pedagogies Significantly better performance of 2-year HSI intervention participants, relative to non-participants, in common, high-stakes, precalculus assessments  Empowerment and enhanced student identities in connection to mathematics problem-solving, peer-collaboration, and college careers A more nuanced understanding of the needs and opportunities for serving traditionally minoritized groups (e.g., Veteran students) in higher education New emergent theoretical frameworks for equitably transforming STEM education at HSIs and other Minority Serving Institutions (MSIs).
