<AbstractNarration>The Mid-Atlantic Biology Research and Career (MABRC) network is a community of scientists, educators and business professionals working together to improve workforce preparation of life science students. The MABRC network seeks to determine the essential technical and professional skills needed to succeed in today's life sciences workplace and critically assess the current undergraduate biology curricula with respect to workforce preparation. The results of the network's evaluation will be disseminated by multiple vehicles to reach all interested stakeholders. A career conference will also be organized to inform and train students and to promote networking between graduates and employers. The network will also initiate the design of a framework for providing authentic research experiences for biology students, with an emphasis placed on early engagement in research and in experiences that incorporate emerging technologies that are critical for the workforce. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The MABRC network will create a forum for bridging the divide between undergraduate biology education and student preparation by a) identifying technical and professional skills essential for the workplace, b) evaluating undergraduate biology training in the context of career preparation, and c) serving as a gateway between academe, government, and the private sector to students and teachers at high schools, and community colleges, 4-year colleges, and universities.  Preparation of graduates from these institutions for the workplace will assessed via examination of departmental learning aims, curricular offerings, and via surveys of stakeholders including industry leaders. Follow up analyses will be performed to evaluate strengths and deficiencies of undergraduate biology curricula in relation to desired workface skills. Subsequent network activities include enhancing student career preparation through the development of a framework for authentic research experiences that can serve as a model for other networks in a variety of discipline contexts. The network is designed to promote training of diverse student populations, with the intent of recruiting and retaining underserved and underrepresented students in life science careers. Member institutions and organizations will initially be affiliated with the emerging biotechnology industry in the mid-Atlantic region. This strategy will promote direct access to a large network of future employers, facilitates connections with regional high school programs, and allows direct contribution to the workforce in the home states of participating students, the latter being especially important for underrepresented students to serve as peers and STEM role models for K-12 students in their own communities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is being jointly funded by the Directorate for Biological Sciences and the Directorate for Education and Human Resources, Division of Undergraduate Education as part of their efforts to address the challenges posed in Vision and Change in Undergraduate Biology Education: A Call to Action http://visionandchange/finalreport/.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Mid-Atlantic Biology Research and Career (MABRC) network was formed with the intention of trying to uncover the factors contributing to the workforce shortage associated with entry-level positons in bioscience industries.  Our focus was on the BioHealth Capital Region (BHCR), comprised of Maryland, Virginia, and Washington D.C.  In many ways this region serves serves as a microcosm of the changing employment trends in the life sciences as a whole.  The BHCR represents one of the fastest growing biohealth clusters in the U.S.  Unprecedented growth in the region?s bioscience industries has occurred since 2001, with more than 1300 biohealth-related companies now located in the BHCR.  The burgeoning industry has led to creation of over 300,000 jobs in Greater Baltimore, Virginia and metropolitan DC during the last decade.  The potential exists for the workforce to double by 2023.  Contributing to this growth potential is the BHCR?s close proximity to several government agencies (e.g., NIH, NCI, USDA, FDA, NIST, and others) that offer a steady supply of experienced scientists for collaboration and possible employment.  It thus comes as a surprise that growth in the region has been limited by the inability to attract and retain a sufficient workforce, especially for entry-level positions that require bachelor?s degrees.   The MABRC network formed in 2016 with the primary objectives of determining the essential technical and professional skills needed in the region?s biosciences workplaces and to evaluate whether traditional undergraduate life science curricula equip graduates with these skills. These objectives were based on two premises regarding the workforce shortage in the BHCR: 1) most undergraduates are not aware, or only at an ancillary level, of career opportunities in bioscience industries, government, and the private sector, and 2) that regardless of student knowledge of alternative careers, the majority lack the necessary technical and/or professional ("soft") skills required for these workplaces.  We acquired data on skills sought by employers and those inherent to undergraduate life science curricula using a series of perception surveys administered electronically (i.e., through email solicitations or via tablets at career conferences and networking events) to stakeholders who were key to educating, training, and hiring college graduates. Stakeholders surveyed included employers (e.g., hiring managers, talent acquisition recruiters, and industry scientists), program directors/chairs of undergraduate life sciences programs, university career counselors, and undergraduate students (including those currently matriculating and recent graduates) located in the BHCR.        What was uncovered is that a severe disconnect exists between all stakeholders.  Students, faculty, and career counselors are under-informed about a wide range of career opportunities that lie outside of the traditional career mentoring received at colleges and universities.  Concomitantly, bioscience industries in the BHCR have done a relatively poor job of marketing entry-level careers to academe.  The end result is that several obstacles exist that impede the preparation, recruitment, and hiring of graduates from undergraduate programs.   As a first step to overcoming the comunication and information disconnect that exists between stakeholders, the MABRC network held an all day conference for high school and college/university career counselors to discuss the network's findings and to allow networking with key industry and government leaders.  Maryland Secretary of Labor Kelly Schulz was the keynote speaker for the conference.  Each session of the conference was video taped and subsequently posted on the MABRC network website (http://www.mabrc.org) and YouTube.  A summary of the work has also been submitted to the journal CBE: Life Sciences Education, where is has been recommended for publication.  A white paper microsite is currently being developed on the network's website.  Upon completion, an executive summary and link will be forwarded to company CEO's and government leaders in the BioHealth Capital Region.  The network also worked collaboratively with several other entities in the state of Maryland to develop Career Opportunities in Biotechnology, a career map for high school and college graduates considering careers in the life science industries       Last Modified: 06/04/2018       Submitted by: David B Rivers]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
