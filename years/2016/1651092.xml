<AbstractNarration>Incorporating Computer Programming into Middle School Mathematics Curricula to Enhance Learning for Low Performing Underserved Students is a critical contribution to a national challenge.  Improving access to the STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics) landscape for students across the nation is now a national priority. Expanding access to low performing students is particularly important if the nation is to slow the growing divide between those who have access to the technology sector and those who do not.  The project infuses computational thinking and programming into students' algebra course experience.  Students targeted in the project are 7th-9th grade students in the lowest quartile of mathematics proficiency. Demonstrating a means to not only improve their mathematics' performance, but to effectively engage them in basic computing has the potential to be transformative for this particular sub-set of students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Algebra Project has developed an effective pedagogical model of algebra instruction over the last 30 years.  The project is an experiment in pedagogical innovation.  Using MIT App Inventor, students learn basic programming in alignment with core algebraic concepts.  The algebra learning modalities are potentially enhanced by greater student engagement and greater development of the logical and analytical thinking necessary to succeed in algebra.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Introduction: In this research, we have developed and refined a set of enhancements to an existing mathematics curriculum using a specific type of computer simulations that blend computing ideas with math instruction.  Students in our research configured math simulations in a mobile application using a visual programming interface, and then they managed, analyzed and shared their results with other students.  Our research demonstrated how this type of virtual and shared activity can have a positive impact on conceptual understanding, visual reasoning and representational logic, and not just on the ability to manipulate math symbols when solving equations.  Intellectual Merit: This research shows how creating certain type of mobile simulations along with a visual programming language to manage and explore the virtual activities that are created, can positively augment mathematics curricula that employ experiential learning activities.  In particular, this research builds upon an experiential mathematics pedagogy developed by the Algebra Project that has been shown, through past NSF-funded research and evaluations, to help disadvantaged and low performing students in particular.  Our work builds on the extensively documented past work on the Algebra Project that shows how a five-step experiential mathematics pedagogy can improve mathematics learning outcomings.  The five steps are: 1) Experience a physical event as a group; 2) Represent that event through drawings or by creating models; 3) Describe the event informally and intuitively, using natural and idiomatic language (called "People Talk"); 4) Translate the idiomatic description into a structured, formal, feature rich description (called "Feature Talk"); 5) Create a symbolic representation of the event using mathematical formalisms. See Figure 1.  In our work, step 1 involves a simulated event, step 2 and 3 are unchanged, step 4 involves connecting the event to a set of visual program blocks that represent functional units, and step 5 involves using the functional units to reprogram the simulation in various configurations, and then analyze and share how those simulated re-creations are connected to symbolic representations of the event that involve mathematical formalisms.  By extending the experiential pedagogy to include students' reflections upon interactions with simulations and computing, we are providing the students with.  In our research, the work the students do with our app-simulations shows that by providing ?low-performing? students with visually animated and programmatically accessible enactive-iconic representations we create a space for them to apply cognitive abilities that they are not getting sufficient opportunity to engage in traditional mathematics classrooms.  Identifying how to represent appropriate grounding metaphors visually and with animations in an app involves a 3-dimensional design process.  The three design criteria we need to consider are: 1) How does the visual representation support and maintain the enactive-iconic representational logic; 2) How does the visual representation allow for a shared outcome and discourse; and 3) How does the visual representation directly link to the mathematics knowledge and practice involved in a particular curriculum's units and learning progressions. See Figure 2.  In this research we designed our app-simulations to address these three issues for two specific curricular units designed by the Algebra Project.  The first unit is called the "Road Coloring" unit and it involves students creating directed graphs of vertices called ?buildings? connected with edges called red and blue ?roads.?  Students then try to create instructions in a function-based syntax that will get the occupants of the different buildings to the same building at the same time.  The activity involves learning how to use functional notation, ordered pairs, arrow diagrams, and how to plot points on a coordinate plane. And the concept of the domain and range of a function are also developed.  See Figure 3.  The second unit is called the "Race Against Time" and it involves students racing to stack different sets of cubes that represent the magnitudes of bi-directional vectors that are added together, and then students produce tables, arrow diagrams, graphs and explore linear equations of the resulting vector displacements.  See Figure 4.  Broader Impact: Over 200 students participated in some aspect of this exploratory research over a 12-month period. The results of this work demonstrated to us that this research has the potential to have a broad impact through (1) illuminating an approach for how more math teachers can incorporate mobile app simulations in their classroom in the context of a pedagogy that involves visual reasoning and representational logic, visual/function block programming, and virtual "hands on" activities to enhance student learning; (2) leveraging the existing attraction of the current generation of students to digital media and its applications to get more students actively engaged in mathematics in particular, and STEM+C in general, and to potentially encourage them to pursue careers in these fields as well; and finally (3) promoting the use simulations and applied computing ideas in domains other than computer science to encourage a type of academic collaboration across compatible learning pedagogies.
