<AbstractNarration>The Historically Black Colleges and Universities - Undergraduate Program funds conferences that seek to broaden the participation of students in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields from groups underrepresented in those disciplines. To this end, the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) will hold the Emerging Researchers National Conference in STEM in 2017, 2018 and 2019. The conference will primarily include undergraduate and graduate students from the following programs at the National Science Foundation (NSF): Historically Black Colleges and Universities - Undergraduate Program, Louis Stokes Alliances for Minority Participation, Centers of Research Excellence in Science and Technology, Alliances for Graduate Education and the Professoriate, Tribal Colleges and Universities Program and Research Experiences for Undergraduates. However, any student wishing to participate in the conference, is encouraged to apply. Estimated annual conference participation is 1,000, including 650 students and 350 faculty and administrators. This conference, unlike those of most other professional societies, allows for presentations in all NSF supported disciplines, as well as presentations in interdisciplinary and crossdisciplinary areas of study. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The three-day conference will include undergraduate and graduate student posters and oral presentations; plenary sessions that feature STEM professionals discussing their educational and career pathways and lessons learned about navigating a career in the STEM workforce; workshops focused on strategies for applying for and succeeding in graduate programs and finding funding for graduate school; and career preparation workshops focused on employment searches, use of computing and data in science, and other topics. Other conference features include exhibitors from government, academia, and business who will showcase graduate programs, fellowships, summer undergraduate research programs, employment opportunities, and international research and education opportunities. AAAS will provide pre-and post conference tools and resources for the students. The project is guided by formative and summative evaluation; as well by an advisory board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is co-funded by the following programs: Alliances for Graduate Education and the Professoriate, Centers of Research Excellence in Science and Technology, Louis Stokes Alliances for Minority Participation, and Tribal Colleges and Universities Programs.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The Emerging Researchers National (ERN) Conference in STEM provides a safe, affirming and encouraging context for undergraduate and graduate student researchers from diverse backgrounds to present their research in all areas of STEM that include: 1) Biological Sciences, 2) Chemical Sciences, 3) Computer Sciences and Information Management, 4) Mathematics and Statistics, 5) Physics, 6) Ecology, Environmental and Earth Sciences, 7) Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences, 8) Mathematics and Science Education, 9) Nanoscience, and 10) Technology and Engineering.</p> <p>Students from the following NSF research programs: Alliance for Graduate Education and the Professoriate (AGEP), Centers of Research Excellence in Science and Technology (CREST), Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP), Louis Stokes Alliances for Minority Participation (LSAMP) and LSAMP Bridges to the Doctorate, Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU), Emerging Frontiers in Research and Innovation (EFRI), Tribal Colleges and Universities Program (TCUP), and other programs from around the country have participated. &nbsp;In addition to providing an opportunity for students to hone their scientific presentation skills, students also engage in professional development workshops on topics that include preparing for graduate school, science communications, internships and fellowships, research opportunities, and STEM career pathways. Participants also engage in an education/career fair that provides resources to students and faculty.</p> <p>The 2017 ? 2019 annual ERN Conferences, HBCU-UP/CREST PI-PD Meetings and the 2019 LSAMP PI-PD Meetings were held in Washington, DC. A total of 3310 participants (students, faculty, judges, exhibitors, speakers, and workshop facilitator), 2155 undergraduate and graduate students, 149 HBCUs, 807 institutions, 1750 student oral and poster presentations, 712 HBCU-UP and CREST PIs, and 191 exhibitors were engaged during this timeframe. Approximately 1750 student oral and poster research presentations in total have been assessed from 2017 -2019 by ~150 expert STEM professional judges each year and 300 ? 400 student travel awards were provided. Over 70% of the participants on average each year were underrepresented minorities in STEM.</p> <p>Internal evaluations of the ERN Conference from 2017 ? 2019 showed average ratings of 4.0 ? 5.0 for overall conference satisfaction and individual sessions and workshops, which corresponds to a range of very good to excellent. Student oral and poster presentations were rated by expert judges between very good and excellent on average each year. External evaluations for each year from students indicate that their greatest knowledge gains were in research opportunities, internships and fellowships, preparing for graduate school, and STEM career pathways. Additionally, students consistently report that the ERN Conference is a positive environment, that they develop beneficial networks, and that they feel a sense of belonging in STEM. External evaluation data from the 2019 Conference also shows positive gains in science identify and science self-efficacy.</p> <p>&nbsp;Each year the ERN Conference highlights STEM luminaries and exemplars during the five plenary sessions. During the 2017 ? 2019 conferences, students have had the opportunity to interact with STEM role models such as Richard Tapia, Jedidah Isler, and a special <em>Hidden Figures</em> panel with Margot Lee Shetterly, Robert Lee and Christine Darden. &nbsp;</p> <p>The ERN Conference has provided multiple benefits and a significant impact towards supporting the development of a diverse cadre of undergraduate and graduate student STEM researchers. These include a positive and affirming environment to hone research presentation skills, engage in professional development to prepare for global STEM careers, and build sustaining networks and a sense of belonging and community in STEM. The conference has provided the opportunity for students to learn about STEM research within and across disciplines but has also provided a platform for students from diverse backgrounds to learn about the depth and breadth of research being conducted around the nation. The ERN Conference serves as an exemplar in broadening participation in STEM and enhancing student motivation and success.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 11/28/2020<br>      Modified by: Iris&nbsp;Wagstaff</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1645036/1645036_10450441_1606621765350_studentsbanner--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1645036/1645036_10450441_1606621765350_studentsbanner--rgov-800width.jpg" title="2019 Students at ERN Banner"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1645036/1645036_10450441_1606621765350_studentsbanner--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="2019 Students at ERN Banner"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">2019 Students Pose at ERN Conference Banner</div> <div class="imageCredit">Michael Colella</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Royalty-free (unrestricted use)</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Iris&nbsp;Wagstaff</div> <div class="imageTitle">2019 Students at ERN Banner</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1645036/1645036_10450441_1606621511993_Tapiaandstudents--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1645036/1645036_10450441_1606621511993_Tapiaandstudents--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Richard Tapia with ERN Students"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1645036/1645036_10450441_1606621511993_Tapiaandstudents--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Richard Tapia with ERN Students"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">2019 closing awards plenary with keynote Richard Tapia and ERN students</div> <div class="imageCredit">Michael Colella</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Royalty-free (restricted use -
