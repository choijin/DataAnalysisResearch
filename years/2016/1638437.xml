<AbstractNarration>PI: Elder, Alison&lt;br/&gt;#1638437&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 8th International Nanotoxicology Congress is focused broadly on the human and environmental health effects of engineered nanoscale materials.  There will be presentations about both the benefits and health risks associated with nanotechnology.  Professionals from many different disciplines will come together with the goal of determining how nanomaterials can be used in a way that does not create harm for the environment or for the humans who make and use them.&lt;br/&gt;The conference has three objectives to: 1) bring together scientists from academia, industry, government agencies, and non-governmental organizations to present new research findings and analyses to better understand exposures to engineered nanomaterials and their potential impact on human and environmental health; 2) critically evaluate the progress of the preceding decade of nanotoxicology research  and to develop new strategies and research priorities to facilitate decision-making regarding the safe implementation of nanotechnology; and 3) support the participation of junior investigators and scientists from underrepresented groups and underdeveloped countries.  The objectives will be met via a scientifically-rigorous program that includes high-level and focused lectures, interactive workshops and poster sessions, and a commitment to inclusiveness across disciplines, seniority, sex, nationality, and status.  Participants are coming from academia, industry, government, and non-profit organizations to share their respective expertise.&lt;br/&gt;In successfully meeting the conference objectives, there will be significant benefits for both scientists and the US public.  Specifically, the integrated conference program will maximize interactions amongst scientists to support the prioritization of future research and the establishment of fruitful collaborations.  For the public, a successful conference will contribute to both the market viability of nanotechnology and its implementation in a way that does not put human or environmental health at risk.</AbstractNarration>

The final registration count totaled 396 individuals from 35 different countries.  The two and a half-day program included a 10th anniversary plenary panel discussion; three plenary talks; 96 invited talks that were distributed amongst 15 parallel sessions; 2 special workshops; a colloquium for young scientists; and 284 poster presentations that were selected from the submitted abstracts.  The topics covered in this conference included: Green Nanomaterials; Emerging Nanomaterials; Nanoparticle Dosimetry; Alternative Testing Strategies in Support of Decision-Making PBPK Modeling; Developmental Effects of Nanomaterials; Commercialization; Nanotechnology for Neuroscience; AOP and Systems Biology; Genotoxicity Testing Standardization; Biomolecular Corona Formation and Particle Uptake; Environmental Exposures; Human Nanotoxicology; Nanomaterials in Food; and Mechanistic Lessons from Mouse Susceptibility Models.  The conference also provided time to reflect on the past accomplishments and future goals of nanotechnology and nanotoxicology research, which were summarized in an editorial for the special issue of NanoImpact that contains papers that were presented at the conference (volume 7, 2017; open access).  The main impact of the 2016 Nanotoxicology Conference was the prioritization of future research aims and the establishment of fruitful collaborations to ensure that nanotechnology is implemented in such a way that both maintains the viability of a valuable global market by reducing uncertainty and the informed and responsible manufacture, formulation, use, and disposal of engineered nanomaterial-containing products.
