<AbstractNarration>Large scale refugee flows are often accompanied by public disagreements over the effects of refugees on host societies. Typically, there are sharp divisions between those who view refugees as social burdens and those who see potential economic benefits.  But recent events suggest that a more nuanced view, which would pay attention to variability in host contexts and refugee skills, is necessary to understand why refugee settlement is less contentious in some situations than in others. In the research supported by this RAPID award,  one aspect of local context will be examined in depth: the roles refugees play in local labor markets.  The researchers ask: When might refugee settlement be an economic stimulus rather than an economic drain? And is economic stimulus sufficient to counterbalance perceptions of social burden? Answering these questions will help to refine international migration theory with regard to national labor policies and humanitarian positions.  It will also allow the development of improved policy for refugee incorporation in Europe and the United States.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will be carried out by East Carolina University anthropologists, Dr. Christine B. Avenarius and Dr. David Griffith. They will focus data collection on labor markets in three rural regions in Germany during the summer of 2016, the second summer of large scale Middle Eastern refugee flows into Europe. The researchers will employ a mix of social science methodologies including in-depth interviewing, focus groups, and social network analysis with employers, town leaders, and refugees.  Researchers will also collect media reports as background for local-level understandings. Findings from this research will serve as a baseline for a larger, multi-year study of Middle Eastern refugees settling throughout Europe.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Drs. Griffith and Avenarius, the two individuals responsible for completion of this project, spent the majority of the time on the project collecting and analyzing data in Germany and from U.S. and German media sources on issues involving refugees.  Focusing on small towns in four regions of Germany, their interviews were with refugees, government officials who deal with refugees daily, and German citizens who live with refugees, volunteer to assist with refugee settlement in small towns, and otherwise participate in events that help refugees adapt to small town German life.  Our coverage of the media sources focused on relationships among political sentiments, politicians? positions, and state policies affecting immigrants and refugees in Europe and North America.  Our analysis and writing related to these data and this information are ongoing, and we anticipate utilizing the information to continue research in this area in the future.   Intellectual merit.  Research on refugees in receiving countries tends to focus on urban areas where refugees have formed ethnic enclaves that German and other state officials often deem disturbing, considering them "parallel societies" that enable refugees to resist integration into the host society.  Our focus on refugees settling in small towns in Germany, which was somewhat unique, revealed that German citizens in rural Germany, along with German officials who provide state services to refugees, tend to view refugees as in need of hands-on management, similar to guestworkers, rather than mere assistance.  The direction that the management of refugees has taken has been to prepare them for the labor force with training in the German language and for specific jobs, both of which often require long-term commitments to the local society and economy.  This often involves long-term association with government programs that train not only refugees, but also German citizens who have had trouble finding and keeping employment in the German formal economy.   These behaviors raise issues of theoretical importance regarding the potential for the affective labor of volunteers and the committed work of government officials to generate value in the form of productive labor for the German political economy.  In some cases, transforming affective labor and committed work into productive labor has been frustrated by the resistance among some refugees to conform to German guidelines for formal participation in the labor force, given the length of time it takes to learn German and pass tests required for occupational certification and the immediate need for many refugees to provide for their families in the countries they have fled.  The PIs continue to develop these ideas for publication and future research, in particular focusing on relationships between temporary workers in the European Union and other developed countries and the economic incorporation of refugees and immigrants.  Broader Impacts.  Thus far, this research has had two significant broader impacts: First, in part based on field work in Germany, co-PI Avenarius has taken a position with an organization in Germany that develops strategies to address refugee issues.  Avenarius has been using the findings from the research to educate German government officials about the problems associated with the high demands of occupational certifications and the immediate needs of refugees.   Second, co-PI Griffith was able to leverage findings from this project to join an interdisciplinary team of researchers to investigate the relationships between environmental change and human migration, including how two major environmental developments in the Middle East and Northern Africa&mdash;civil war in Syria and drought across the entire region&mdash;have contributed to refugee crises in Europe and elsewhere.  This is a five-year project (2018-2013) that will model the migration process in response to gradual environmental forcing (e.g. from drought) and environmental shocks (e.g. hurricanes).    The findings from the research have also been shared with students and faculty at the University of Hamburg.       Last Modified: 08/10/2018       Submitted by: David Griffith]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
