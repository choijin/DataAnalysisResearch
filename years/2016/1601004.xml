<AbstractNarration>While sleep is nearly universal throughout the animal kingdom, the physiological functions and biological factors regulating sleep remain unclear. This project seeks to understand how diet and metabolism influence sleep duration using the blind Mexican cavefish as a model system. The Mexican cavefish is an extremely informative system for examining behavioral and genetic adaptations.  These fish were trapped in caves ~1-8 million years ago, and have adapted to these nutrient-poor environments by dramatically reducing sleep and developing numerous physiological changes, including altered metabolism, eye-loss, and albinism. This project will determine the evolutionary basis for the reduction in sleep. The differences in habitat between river-dwelling surface and cave populations of these fish present a unique opportunity to examine the effects of ecology and evolutionary history on sleep. Sleep will be measured in fish fed either a high or a low-fat diet to determine whether high-calorie diets are capable of restoring normal sleep in cavefish. Furthermore, genetic hybrid fish will be tested for sleep and other foraging behaviors to determine whether distinct or overlapping genes regulate reduced sleep and altered feeding behaviors. Taken together, these experiments will determine the evolutionary basis for sleep loss in Mexican cavefish.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Work produced in this project will contribute to our understanding of the biological basis of sleep with potential extension to a better understanding of the relationship between diet and sleep in humans.  In addition to contributing to scientific knowledge across life disciplines, this project will provide opportunities for student training and outreach in the local community.  Teaching laboratories will be developed with a local high school to expose students to behavioral ecology and neuroscience research.  All developed lab protocols will be made available online for access and use at other high schools and teaching institutions.  Additionally, this project will fund students enrolled in programs for first generation and minority college students to work in the research laboratory.</AbstractNarration>

This award sought to examine the relationship between sleep loss and metabolism. We had previously shown that at least three independent A. mexicanus cave populations display a dramatic reduction in sleep duration. The differences in habitat between surface and cave populations of A. mexicanus present a unique opportunity to examine the effects of ecology and evolutionary history on sleep. The overarching goal of this research award was to further our understanding of the function and evolutionary basis for changes in sleep need. With support from this award, and previous findings we have developed A. mexicanus as a model for investigating how sleep evolves in response to a changing environment. Over the course of this award, we applied a number of complementary approaches and made a number of significant discoveries that further our understanding of how sleep is regulated.   A major finding from this award relates to identifying interactions between sensory systems and sleep.  We identified a relationship between enhanced sensory input from the lateral line in cavefish and sleep loss and suggest changes in sensory processing may contribute to the dramatic differences in sleep observed throughout the animal kingdom.  We were able to identify specific populations of neurons in the head and trunk regions of the fish that regulate sleep.  These findings reveal, for the first time, an interaction between the evolution of sensory systems and sleep duration.  Further, they provide a model for investigating sensory gating, a phenomenon where incoming sensory information is dampened in sleeping animals that appears to be conserved from nematodes to humans.  More recently, we have extended on these results by identifying Orexin signaling, a major target of human sleep drugs, as under regulation of the lateral line.  Remarkably, inhibiting Orexin signaling with human sleep drugs restores sleep in cavefish, providing strong evidence that investigation of sleep evolution can provide insight into highly conserved mechanisms regulating..
