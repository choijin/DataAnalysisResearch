<AbstractNarration>Mankind's energy usage is a staggering 15,000,000,000,000 watts, 80% of which is from fossil fuels that produce about 9,000,000,000 tons of carbon dioxide believed to be a major contributor to global climate concerns.  The goal of displacing this fossil fuel based energy production is a daunting problem requiring the equivalent of 10,000 nuclear, solar, wind or hydroelectric carbon-free power plants.  To put this in perspective, currently worldwide, there are only 441 nuclear power plants and far fewer renewable energy sources.  For this reason, most of the effort in stemming the growth of energy demand is focused not on production, but on efficient energy consumption.  To that end, this team proposes to commercialize "engineered semiconductor building blocks" (engineered substrates) that will enable customers to create major advances in energy efficient electronic power and lighting devices enabling massive energy savings through improved power efficiency.  The initial focus of the team's efforts will be to demonstrate engineered substrates using a recently patented technology useful for emerging markets in power electronics and UV and green light emitters (known as LEDS). These engineered substrates will allow (a) various semiconductor devices to be fabricated with higher quality/performance for devices currently being produced and (b) existing manufacturers to expand into new devices that have higher performance and are currently not achievable by any competing method.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps team will conduct a detailed market survey of existing nitride substrate template technologies, including their cost, material quality, production value, and time to delivery. The team will identify customers within the Nitride community with experience in device design and growth using traditional non-native substrates (e.g., Silicon, SiC) and native templates (AlN and GaN). This team  will conduct detailed customer surveys to understand the desired material quality and doping levels. The insight provided by these customers through direct surveys of their experience will be invaluable to maturing the proposed technology into a production ready product offering. It is critical that the team members understand the existing device performance metrics from the perspective of the customer, so that they can identify the key issues and challenges for which the team can provide an immediate solution and generate direct marketable impact for the customer. This team will also survey customers on pricing structure, and identify what they would be willing to pay for engineered substrates customized to their specifications.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ I had not intended on including so many details in my report but the NSF program requires 200 words before it will allow you to submit the report.  so here are the details I had intended to keep to myself:  We were funded to go to Los Angeles to attend the ICORP cohort meeting.  We had hoped to learn about business plans, and how to properly start a technical business.  From the beginning, it was clear the instructors were not interested in teaching and at times were highly inappropriate, cursing and making inappropriate political comments in attempts to get laughs like an unruly middle school student.  Given the overly aggressive, highly offensive treatment by the instructors and after a request that my team viewed as unethical by the program manager, we chose to withdraw from the program.  It was not possible to continue in the program and be treated fairly after the request made by the program manager.  The award amount was reduced to just the amount we expended for our travel.  I would not recommend this program to anyone.  the instructors tried to simulate the TV show "Shark Tank" and it got downright ridiculous. It was a total waste of time.
