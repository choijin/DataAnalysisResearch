<AbstractNarration>The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill will host a three day conference on Statistical Machine Learning and Data Science from June 6-8, 2016. (See http://www.unc.edu/~yfliu/sldm2016/.) The objective is to bring together researchers in statistical learning and data science from academia, industry, and government in a stimulating atmosphere focused on the development of statistical learning theory, methods and applications. Statistical machine learning is a relatively new discipline, evolving from machine learning methods of artificial intelligence and multivariate statistics. It also plays an essential role for the new important area of data science and big data. NSF funding will provide travel support to increase the number of junior researchers who are able to attend.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Section on Statistical Machine Learning and Data Science of the American Statistical Association will hold a meeting at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill from June 6-8, 2016. Topics of the conference include, but are not limited to, big data analytics, classification, computational biology, covariance estimation, graphical models, high dimensional data, learning theory, model selection, network analysis, precision medicine, and signal and image processing. This award will provide travel support for junior researchers.</AbstractNarration>
