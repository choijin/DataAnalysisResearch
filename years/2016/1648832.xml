<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project will be to enable affordable access to quantum annealing quantum computers and to take the complexity out of the programming and application hosting tasks, which currently poses a major barrier of entry for potential users. The company expects quantum computing technology in the next few years to disrupt significant portions of the high-performance-computing environment for optimization problems, which has previously been characterized by slow and incremental performance improvements. This project would yield a platform that both increases the efficiency and lowers the cost of analyzing complex optimization problems, which could spur fast-paced innovation in wide areas of the economy that tackle such issues. These sectors include energy distribution, pharmaceutical design, cancer research, data analytics, cybersecurity, autonomous systems, planning and scheduling activities, financial services such as risk management and portfolio optimization, and basic and applied research in physics and chemistry.  In each of these disciplines, there are optimization-based computational problems that are currently intractable. The results of this research should enable a much larger community of experts to use the power of quantum computing to solve these important but currently intractable problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project addresses the need for a cloud-based platform for using quantum annealing computing technology. Quantum annealing computers have come to market in the last few years, and research laboratories and universities have used these machines to explore algorithms that could eventually be solved efficiently on them. Despite advances in performance of quantum annealing computers, little effort has been directed toward developing programming environments and tools that provide simple and inexpensive access to quantum computing capabilities. This project researches a platform-as-a-service (PaaS) with a suite of front-end and back-end tools that efficiently transform high-level computing problems into binary optimization formulations suitable for quantum annealing, simplifying and automating the low-level details and domain knowledge currently necessary to perform useful calculations. This project will further develop the PaaS to include a classical-quantum computing environment and framework for analysis of large data sets using standard distributed computing tools. The research explores the best software tools and platform methods to integrate emerging quantum computing capabilities into workflows by streamlining and making affordable the processing of data and by decomposing real-world problems into sub-problems amenable to quantum computers of today and in the future.</AbstractNarration>

The AQUA platform will allow quantum computing--currently in the hands of a few highly-skilled researchers with experience in quantum physics--to proliferate into industrial verticals and more broadly throughout the scientific and research communities.  AQUA is a software development kit to simplify the programming experience,?a framework to integrate classical computing resources with quantum processing, a time-sharing service to make the capability affordable, an initial set of applications, and a sophisticated?back-end that will automate the complex mapping, parameter-setting and embedding tasks that currently require significant user proficiency. This suite of front-end and back-end tools efficiently transform high-level computing problems into binary optimization formulations suitable for the quantum optimization computers, abstracting away the physical low-level details and domain knowledge currently necessary to perform useful calculations. The areas of application extend broadly to any field that involving discrete optimization and probabilistic sampling, such as planning, scheduling, portfolio allocation, resource distribution, deep learning, and more.  This project focused on the user experience of AQUA.  Before the QC-Ware AQUA, using the quantum computer incurred a steep learning curve.  Beginning with a problem to be solved, the researcher must first express it as a discrete optimization problem.  Then the problem must be mapped to the quadratic unconstrained binary optimization form (QUBO) that the D-Wave machine (and similarly other proposed quantum computer running algorithms for optimization) have been designed to solve.  Once in QUBO form other programming tools are used to embed the QUBO form to the inherent architecture of the machine.  Then the program is run and results are returned to the user.  Finally, the results need to be error-corrected and post-processed/analyzed to be useful for the specific question of interest for the user.  This process includes problem formulation, mapping, embedding, and running is so far quite challenging, which is why considerable expertise is needed on the researcher?s part.   AQUA has been developed to handle all of the complexities of simplifying, automating, and optimizing the QA programming process.  AQUA has been used in the development of several applications:  fault detection, financial portfolio optimization, maximizing proceeds from combinatorial auctions, job shop scheduling, set cover, and max cut, among others.   With the support of our research partner, USRA, QC Ware has released an alpha version of the AQUA platform to selected users.
