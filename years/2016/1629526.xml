<AbstractNarration>The Cyberlearning and Future Learning Technologies Program funds efforts that will help envision the next generation of learning technologies and advance what we know about how people learn in technology-rich environments. Cyberlearning Exploration (EXP) Projects explore the viability of new kinds of learning technologies by designing and building new kinds of learning technologies and studying their possibilities for fostering learning and challenges to using them effectively. Citizens and workers in tomorrow's world must be prepared to approach what have been called "wicked" problems involving multiple, interlinked complex systems, including issues such as climate change, crime, communicable diseases, transportation, and many more. Preparing learners with the background to face such problems is a primary challenge of our age. To gain a complete understanding of such systems, learners need to understand both the high-level aspects of a system's dynamics and the rules that govern its individual interacting elements. In this project, the Concord Consortium, the MIT Scheller Teacher Education Program and the Argonne National Laboratory Systems Science Center will combine two different proven educational technologies used for understanding complex systems to form a powerful hybrid technology. Using it with learners and researching its value for learning about systems dynamics, the project will shed light on how to foster deep understanding of multiple, interlinked complex systems. The project will conduct research with diverse school districts and project materials and technologies will be made available free of charge to both researchers and practitioners nationwide. Additionally, this project has potential to create tools and generate understanding of great utility to the large field of professionals who currently use technology to model and understand complex systems as part of their everyday work.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two main approaches and technologies exist currently to aid learning to reason about complex systems. Systems dynamics approaches offer a broad, "eagle's eye view" of a system that facilitates an almost-immediate sense of the structure and interactions within a system and its components, while agent-based approaches offer an "ant's eye view" that lays bare the details and mechanisms behind the system's interactions. Interactions with these two approaches occur at similarly different grain sizes, with systems dynamics views offering the ability to instantiate and easily recast large-scale connections among components quickly and agent-based approaches offering a "fine-control knob" that enables subtle tweaking of the intricate rules underlying the system's individual actors--fine tweaks that, in complex systems, can often result in surprisingly large and anti-intuitive changes in the overall system itself. Without an explicit connection between these levels of interpretation, learners are left with fragmented experiences and understanding. Merging the agent-based modeling capabilities of MIT's StarLogo with the systems modeling and diagramming capabilities of the Concord Consortium's SageModeler software, the project will develop an important new genre of educational technology termed linked-hybrid modeling and test it in K-12 science classrooms. This new technology genre, capable of permitting learners to move between detailed individual models and global views of stocks and flows for the first time, will enable whole new modes of experimentation and should ultimately foster levels of learner reasoning about complex systems and systems dynamics that are not currently possible. The project research will combine theoretical frameworks for both systems dynamics and systems emergence, applying a design-based research approach to study student reasoning of complex systems. By examining how use and design affordances of this new genre lead to productive complex systems reasoning and thus better understanding of systems, the project will lay the groundwork for understanding how to foster powerful learning in the context of wicked problems.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Real-world systems dynamics problems involve multiple complex systems and the interactions between them. Preparing learners to reason about such systems requires developing their ability to navigate and understand systems at multiple levels. On the one hand, learners need to be able to investigate and understand stocks and flows and the related global-level effects taking place in such interrelated systems in order to gain and apply global systems thinking reasoning and understanding. On the other hand, learners need to be able to appreciate&mdash;and ideally construct and modify&mdash;the rules that govern individual agents within systems in order to gain an understanding of how system-level effects arise from simple rule adherence and interaction among these agents.</p> <p>The distinction between these two levels closely mirrors those seen between modeling approaches applied in research involving complex systems. Professional study of complex systems problems makes use of two distinct technologies, agent-based modeling and system dynamics modeling, with the two typically evoking slightly different approaches to the field. Though they have traditionally been taken up by different professional modeling communities, these technologies and their approaches are highly complementary.&nbsp;</p> <p>Technology for both of these modeling approaches exists and is well established for use in educational applications. MIT&rsquo;s StarLogo, a well-developed platform for agent-based modeling, excels at providing the capability for learners to investigate and modify rules for individual agents and observe effects. Prior work has established its ability to help students understand emergent effects and aspects of complex systems. The Concord Consortium&rsquo;s SageModeler software&mdash;a system dynamics-based direct descendant of Model-It has stock and flow concepts and diagramming techniques at its core and excels at representing this global-level view via semi-quantitative and quantitative continuous modeling techniques.&nbsp;</p> <p>Viewing the problem through the lens of learning, we can see that these two different representations and associated technologies&mdash;agent-based modeling and systems dynamics stock and flow diagrams&mdash;each support separate but critical levels of systems dynamics reasoning. &nbsp;As was the case in professional modeling, keeping these two levels separate creates a crucial gap. Constructing the details and effects of individual agent-based models allows for close understanding and observance of emergent phenomena in simplified examples of complex systems. Creating and using a global systems dynamics model allows students to test their mental models and observe the predicted outcomes or results. Without an explicit connection between these two levels, learners are left with fragmented modeling experiences, reducing their ability to understand and predict complex systems.</p> <p>The goal of this study was to characterize the development of student understanding of the links between agent-level and system-level entities, properties, and events in complex systems, as a result of creating and analyzing models in an agent-based modeling environment followed by equivalent activities in a system dynamics modeling environment.&nbsp;</p> <p><em><strong>Research findings</strong></em>.This study investigated the effects of sequentially interacting with an agent-based modeling environment and a system dynamics modeling environment on students&rsquo; abilities to reason about scientific phenomena by making causal links among agent-level and system-level properties and events.&nbsp;Our analysis found that students used more system-level and agent-level descriptions after interacting with the two modeling environments. Posttest responses showed that students&rsquo; understandings of the target phenomena improved and misconceptions became much less frequent. However, only a small percentage of the students demonstrated the ability to make explicit causal links across the two levels in the posttest. Based on these results, we conclude that the two modeling environments provided the opportunity for students to improve their understanding by incorporating more ideas from both the system-level and agent-level perspectives, but it is still challenging for the majority of the students to explicitly and causally link the ideas across levels. The sequential experience may not be sufficient to promote such a demanding cognitive task. A more integrated modeling environment, one that explicitly visualizes chained events across the agent level and the system level, may hold the potential to support more students in acquiring such sophisticated cross-level perspectives.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p> <p><em><strong>Limitations of the study</strong></em>. One of the limitations was that the three questions did not prompt students to use evidence from their system dynamics models and agent-based models to construct their explanations.

With this rather conservative approach, we observed small percentages of students showing the ability to make causal links across the agent-level and system-level.&nbsp;</p> <p><em><strong>Contributions to the teaching and learning of science</strong></em>. The findings of this study will advance knowledge in the field of science teaching, particularly when it is focused on facilitating student understanding of complex systems.
