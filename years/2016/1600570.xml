<AbstractNarration>The Tyrannini group of flycatchers contains 34 bird species, some of which are among the most common and conspicuous birds of the Americas. Several unrelated Tyrannini lineages are strikingly similar in appearance while varying greatly in body size. This makes them an important system for studying the biological processes that cause distantly related species to resemble each other. This research will foster graduate student training at the University of Washington, international collaborations between scientists in the United States and Latin America, and public science education and outreach at the Burke Museum of Natural History and Culture in Seattle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Phenotypic convergence can be explained by common ancestry, chance, parallel selection, or mimicry. Disentangling these alternatives requires concurrent analyses of phylogenetic history, character evolution, and behavioral ecology. Interspecific social dominance mimicry (ISDM) is a two-party mimicry system mediated by interference competition in which the model (the species being mimicked) is also the signal receiver. This research explores the patterns, processes, and the role of ISDM in the phenotypic evolution of Tyrannini flycatchers. The researchers will construct a species-level phylogeny of Tyrannini using sequence capture, investigate patterns and correlations between visual and acoustic phenotypes using phylogenetic comparative methods, and evaluate ecological evidence for ISDM and alternative mimicry hypotheses using behavioral field experiments.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Why do distantly related species sometimes closely resemble each other? Mimicry, chance, and parallel selection can all lead to apparent lookalikes, and evaluating these alternatives requires understanding both evolutionary history and the function of specific traits in a behavioral context. Interspecific social dominance mimicry (ISDM) is a two-party mimicry system where a smaller mimic benefits both from reduced competition from a larger model/signal receiver and a lower cost of maintaining large body size. ISDM is theoretically plausible but has not been rigorously tested empirically. Graduate student Dave Slager is investigating the patterns, processes, and role of ISDM in the plumage evolution of Tyrannini flycatchers. These birds are a premier hypothesized example of ISDM, with multiple independent lineages showing striking plumage similarity despite wide variation in body size. Dave is working on reconstructing the evolutionary history of plumage similarity in Tyrannini flycatchers, including assessing whether mimetic plumage features appear to have exhibited correlated evolution over time. To further test predictions of ISDM in the field, Dave has traveled to Panama to conduct field experiments on three species of Tyrannini flycatchers (Great Kiskadee, Social Flycatcher, and Rusty-margined Flycatcher) that overlap in habitat and strongly resemble each other but differ in body size. One requirement of ISDM is visual deception of a larger model/signal receiver by a smaller mimic. To test whether this deception was possible, Dave has carried out a series of experimental trials presenting mounts of Great Kiskadee (putative model/signal receiver), Social Flycatcher (putative mimic), and Rusty-margined Flycatcher (putative mimic) to Great Kiskadees. Preliminary results indicate that Great Kiskadees were likely not visually deceived by mounts of the smaller mimics. Thus, third-party mimicry or alternative mechanisms may better explain plumage convergence in Tyrannini flycatchers than ISDM.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 10/29/2019<br>      Modified by: David&nbsp;L&nbsp;Slager</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
