<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Nicholas Switala worked as an NSF Postdoctoral Fellow at the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) under the supervision of sponsoring scientist Wenliang Zhang. Switala studies commutative algebra and algebraic geometry. Algebraic geometry is (or at least began as) the study of "varieties", solutions to systems of polynomial equations. When the polynomial equations do not involve multiplying variables together, these sets of solutions are well-understood using linear algebra; in general, high-powered machinery is brought to bear in order to obtain better knowledge of the solution sets, and some of this machinery is studied and developed in the field of commutative algebra.  The principal goal of the project was to use D-module theory (an algebraic formalism based on differential calculus) to better understand local cohomology modules, which encode information about the minimal number of equations needed to define a geometric object.  Five original research papers were prepared for publication during Switala's time at UIC, and a sixth, based on Switala's Ph.D. thesis, was completed and published. Switala and Zhang developed a theory of graded Matlis duality for D-modules over polynomial rings and used its interaction with the "de Rham cohomology" construction to obtain some new information about the algebraic structure of certain varieties. In positive characteristic, differential calculus behaves strangely; for example, in "characteristic 2", the second derivative of any polynomial is zero. There is a useful replacement for the theory of D-modules in this case: the theory of Frobenius modules, which relies on raising expressions to powers rather than differentiating them. Switala and Zhang were able to extend two of their D-module results into this framework as well.  The products of this research were presented at conferences and seminars, including seminars at Northwestern University, the University of Notre Dame, and the University of Michigan; the 2019 Joint Mathematics Meetings in Baltimore; and the 60th birthday conference of Gennady Lyubeznik, who was Switala and Zhang's thesis adviser and originated the study of local cohomology via D-modules. Switala also taught a one-semester mini-course, attended primarily by postdocs and graduate students, on algebraic D-modules at UIC.
