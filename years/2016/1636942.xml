<AbstractNarration>One of the critical challenges civil societies face is coping with emergencies due to natural or human-created disasters, such as major floods, tornadoes, or civic unrest. Resilience, the sustained ability of a community to utilize available resources to plan for, respond to, and recover from adverse situations, is critical and can be improved by a systematic, scientific process.  This project will investigate the potential for Big Data-- harnessed through integrated and networked data resources, along with the proper analytics--to benefit preparation, response, and recovery processes.  The project will bring together leaders in disaster response at state, county, and city levels with data scientists to craft a plan to capitalize on existing data and to utilize previously untapped data for emergency response and recovery.  Potential benefits include improved forecasting of incidents and their impacts, more efficient and effective utilization of resources, enhanced situational awareness during response, and improved planning for recovery.  The project will also define issues related to policies for data sharing and management and may lead to the development of new policy models.  The interaction between experienced emergency management personnel and data scientists will disclose novel combinations of data and tools that can benefit planning, response, and recovery.  The project also has the potential to develop a community of practice focused on data in resilience and incident response in several Midwestern states.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will tackle several key challenges.  First, the data involved are "big" in terms of volume, velocity, and complexity.  Second, all emergency and disaster response is locally controlled in the U.S., and each jurisdiction has traditionally been responsible for collecting its own data regarding equipment and resources, which introduces variability in format and types of data collected across locales and over time.  Third, data sharing across jurisdictions creates issues related to ownership of data and privacy that require the development of policies and administrative regimes.  Fourth, a great deal of the data is unstructured.  To address these challenges, the team will convene a representative set of stakeholders and experts in five step process to develop requirements and recommendations concerning the contributions an integrated data resource can make to community resilience.  The stakeholders will include leaders in emergency response and policing, public health, state and local government, subject matter experts, data scientists, and analysts representing several Midwestern states. Participants will define key questions, the types of data needed to answer them, and what outputs would be contribute to resilience.   The team will also identify a comprehensive list of stakeholders who should be involved in a full project and metrics for measuring success of the project.  Participating states include Illinois, Indiana, and North Dakota.  The product will be a plan set to take this effort to the next stage, implementation of data resources for community resilience in the face of disaster and emergencies.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ BD Spokes: Planning: Midwest: Networked Resilience of Communities Facing Natural and Social Emergencies  One of the critical challenges civil societies face is coping with emergencies due to natural or human-created disasters, such as major floods, tornadoes, or civic unrest. Resilience, the sustained ability of a community to utilize available resources to plan for, respond to, and recover from adverse situations, is critical and can be improved by a systematic, scientific process.  This project will investigate the potential for Big Data&mdash;harnessed through integrated and networked data resources, along with the proper analytics&mdash;to benefit preparation, response, and recovery processes.  "Data science" is a relatively new discipline whose scope covers statistics, machine learning, deep learning, and cognitive architecture.  The project brought together leaders in disaster response at state, county, and city levels with data scientists to generate and prioritize ideas for how data science could serve and improve emergency preparation and response.  Based on these ideas and further advice from emergency response leaders, the project crafted a design for a system  to integrate data and provide analytics for emergency response and recovery.   The project convened two workshops for the purpose of bringing data scientists and leaders of the emergency response communities of Illinois, Indiana, and North Dakota together for a discussion of potential applications of data science in emergency incidents. The first workshop was held May 10, 2017 in Wheeling, IL. This day and a half workshop featured key speakers on data-needs, data security, and forms of data that may be included during and in prevention of a disaster.  Focus Groups were conducted to identify key issues involved in data and emergency response which generated an extensive list including issues pertaining to but not limited to the broader categories of Predictive Analytics, Data Harmonization, Social Media Data and utilization, UAS (Unmanned Aerial Systems), GIS and Mobile Data Sensing and Data Visualization, Governance, and Data security. The ideas generated in the first workshop are summarized in the document, "Ideas for Emergency Preparation and Response June 2017-Summary."  The second Workshop was held October 19, 2017 in Grand Forks, ND. The results of the first workshop were presented and discussion from a group of 20 emergency response leaders were elicited and used to inform development of a plan.  The project developed a plan for a system to provide support for incident preparation and management, "A Data Science Platform for Emergency Preparation and Response."  The system has five components: (1) Data sensing and Data Finding, which included the use of Unmanned Aerial Systems (UASs), Social Media data (e.g. metadata, text analysis, etc.), existing databases of emergency response equipment, personnel, and training records, satellite data, television reports, and other sources of data; (2) Data Harmonization and Integration of the various types of data from different agencies, in different formats, and with different privacy and proprietary restrictions; (3)  Predictive Analytics to use this data to estimate damage, resource needs, additional threats that might develop during an incident, among other things; (4) Data Visualization to provide insights and a common operational picture for emergency managers and responders; (5)  Governance Systems to manage the use of the data, the operation of the systems and represent the interests of all involved parties.   Two posters summarizing the project were presented at NSF Big Data Workshops on "Networked Community Resilience."  Potential benefits of this effort include improved forecasting of incidents and their impacts, more efficient and effective utilization of resources, enhanced situational awareness during response, and improved planning for recovery. The interaction between experienced emergency management personnel and data scientists identified disclose novel combinations of data and tools that can benefit planning, response, and recovery.  The project also has developed a community of practice focused on data in resilience and incident response in several Midwestern states.
