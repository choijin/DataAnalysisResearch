<AbstractNarration>This award supports student travel for US-based graduate students to attend the 2016 USENIX Annual Technical Conference (ATC16). ATC is considered one of the premier forums for advanced professionals from academic and industrial backgrounds to meet and discuss the latest research in systems software. USENIX ATC16 will be held in Denver, CO from June 22-24, 2016 and will consist of 3 days of the expanded ATC technical program. Co-located workshops available for student participation include: HotStorage, HotCloud, and SOUPs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to attending the conference events, students receiving assistance may serve as scribes for the conference sessions to write summaries for a later issue of ;login: magazine, will be invited to sessions to interact with senior members of the research community specifically interested in meeting students in a casual and informal atmosphere, and will be strongly encouraged to present posters and works in progress as part of the selection process.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Participation in conferences is a valuable and important part of the graduate school experience providing students exposure to senior researchers and leading edge work in the field.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  USENIX ATC 2016 Project Outcomes 2016 USENIX Annual Technical Conference NSF Student Grant Award   Major Goals The 2016 USENIX Annual Technical Conference (USENIX ATC ?16) was held in Denver, CO from June 22 to 24, 2016.  This grant provided support for 15 students to travel to attend, providing valuable exposure to advanced research in the field. ATC ?16 featured research that furthers the knowledge and understanding of modern computing systems with an emphasis on implementations and experimental results. The conference organizers encouraged the submission of papers that broke new ground, presented insightful results based on practical experience with computer systems, or were important, independent reproductions or refutations of the experimental results of prior work.   Intellectual Merits and Broader Impacts: Participation in ATC 2016 and similar conferences is a valuable and important part of the graduate school experience. It provides students with the opportunity to interact with more senior researchers, and exposes students to leading edge work. The support requested in this proposal made possible the participation of students who would otherwise be unable to attend.
