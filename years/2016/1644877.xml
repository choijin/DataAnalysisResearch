<AbstractNarration>This project pursues a smart cyber-physical approach for improving the electric rail infrastructure in the United States and other nations. We will develop a distributed coordination of pricing and energy utilization even while ensuring end-to-end time schedule constraints for the overall rail infrastructure. We will ensure this distributed coordination through transactive control, a judicious design of dynamic pricing in a cyber-physical system that utilizes the computational and communication infrastructure and accommodates the physical constraints of the underlying train service. The project is synergistic in that it builds upon the expertise of the electric-train infrastructure and coordination at UIC and that of transactive control on the part of MIT.   We will validate the approach through collaboration with engineers in the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transport Authority, where significant modernization efforts are underway to improve their electric-train system. The project also involves strong international collaboration which will also enable validation of the technologies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will formulate a multi-scale transitive control strategy for minimization of price and energy utilization in a geographically-dispersed railway grid with broader implications for evolving smart and micro grids. The transactions evolve over different temporal scales ranging from day-ahead offline transaction between the power grid and the railway system operators yielding price optimality to real-time optimal transaction among the trains or the area control centers (ACC). All of these transactions are carried out while meeting system constraints ranging from end-to-end time-scheduling, power-quality, and capacity. Our research focuses on fundamental issues encompassing integration of information, control, and power, including event-driven packet arrival from source to destination nodes while ensuring hard relative deadlines and optimal sampling and sensing; and formulation of network concave utility function for allocating finite communication-network capacity among control loops.  The project develops optimization approaches that can be similarly applied across multiple application domains.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The primary objective of the project titled ?CPS: Breakthrough: Collaborative Research: Transactive control of smart railway grid? was to develop a transactive control framework to operate the joint smart electric railway system and its electric system. The two major goals within the proposal (paraphrased) are as follows:  Assess electricity utilization cost savings opportunities in electric railway power systems and determine the necessary mechanisms to achieve these savings while satisfying schedule and physical constraints of the system. Develop a transactive control framework for distributed coordination of the electric railway power system.   Over the last two years, the team at MIT, led by Dr. Anuradha Annaswamy, successfully developed a railway dynamic market mechanism (rDMM) that includes an optimization framework for trip optimization and a control algorithm for dispatching distributed energy resources (DERs) along an electric railway. During the first year of research, the team formulated the optimization problem faced by train operators when determining the optimal power profile of their electric train routes and numerically solved this problem under electricity prices that vary in space and time.     The second year focused on developing a transactive control price signal that was able to both feed the train optimal power profile problem and serve as the control input to the DER minimum cost dispatch problem. The rDMM ultimately enables minimum cost operation of electric railway networks, including the operating costs of the individual trains and those of the DERs.     The optimization framework attempts to minimize the operational costs for a given set of electricity prices along the track, by allowing variations of the trains? acceleration profiles and therefore their power consumption and energy costs. The train can be subject to prices that vary in both time and the position of the train along the track, which is typically divided electrically into a series of discrete buses with separate capacity considerations. Figure 1 showcases the electrical divisions that exist along the Northeast Corridor (NEC) of the United States. Constraints imposed by train dynamics, route schedules, and infrastructure are included in this framework.     A control algorithm is proposed to optimize the electricity price through an iterative procedure that combines the desired demand profiles obtained from the optimization framework together with the variations in DERs while ensuring power balance. Together, the optimization framework and the control algorithm form an overall mechanism to manage the desired transactions between the railway and power grid infrastructures.     This approach is validated using simulation studies of the Southbound Amtrak service along the NEC between Boston, MA and New Haven, CT in the United States, reducing energy costs by 25% when compared to standard trip optimization based on minimum work, and 75% reduction in energy costs when compared to the train cost calculated using a field dataset. The position and velocity of the three dispatch profiles for this route: minimum work, minimum cost (rDMM) and the field dataset, are plotted against time in Figure 2.
