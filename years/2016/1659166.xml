<AbstractNarration>This REU Site award to Alabama State University (ASU), located in Montgomery, AL, will support the training of 10 students for 9 weeks during the summers of 2017- 2019. The focus of the program is to provide research experiences in the multidisciplinary field of Nanobioengineering. Faculty from the Departments of Biological Sciences, Biomedical Engineering, Chemistry, Physical Sciences and related disciplines will serve as mentors for the program. The student projects will be organized around the themes of nanobiotechnology and bioengineering, and some will involve analysis of microbial growth and immune responses.  Students will participate in a full-time closely mentored lab research project together with seminars, field trips, and workshops on professional development, responsible conduct of research, career opportunities in academia and industry, and the graduate school application process. Students will present their findings as a poster at the research symposium during the final week of the program. Students will also submit a scientific report of their project in a manuscript format at the end of the program. Housing, a stipend, meal and travel allowances will be provided. Students from underrepresented minority groups and from colleges with limited research opportunities are especially encouraged to apply. Students will be selected based on their interest in research, academic record, recommendation letters from their home institutions and phone interviews with potential faculty mentors. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is anticipated that a total of 30 students, primarily from underrepresented minority groups and from schools with limited research opportunities, will be trained in the program. Students will learn how research is conducted, and many will present the results of their work at scientific conferences. The training is aimed for students to pursue a higher degree in STEM fields. The scientific advances made through the proposed projects will also significantly enhance knowledge in the proposed field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A common web-based assessment tool used by all REU Site programs funded by the Division of Biological Infrastructure will be used to determine the effectiveness of the training program. An internal evaluation tool will also be used for assessing the program success. Students will be tracked after the program in order to determine their career paths. Students will be asked to respond to an automatic email sent via the NSF reporting system. More information about the program is available by visiting http://www.alasu.edu/academics/research--centers/reu-program/index.aspx, or by contacting the PI (Dr. Komal Vig at komalvig@alasu.edu) or the co-PI (Dr. Shree R. Singh at ssingh@alasu.edu). This REU site is co-funded by the Division of Biological Infrastructure (Directorate for Biological Sciences), and the Division of Engineering Education &amp; Centers (Directorate for Engineering).</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Alabama State University`s REU program during 2017-2020 on ?NanoBioengineering? successfully provided hands on research experience for 9 weeks each summer in the theme of multidisciplinary field of Nanobioengineering to the URMs and women. During these 3 years, 30 students were supported of which 25 (83%) were URMs and 21 (70%) were women. We successfully recruited minority students, with 13 (43%) coming from HBCU and 3 (10%) from community colleges.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;Our REU program was a success in our recruitment efforts both in terms of applicant numbers and student diversity. Each year the REU program started with a 4 day workshop on Nanobioengineering for incoming interns to teach various instrumentation and techniques in bioengineering and nanotechnology. Each student was individually mentored by a faculty member and a graduate student or post doc. As many of the projects were multidisciplinary the students at times were mentored by 2 faculties. Besides hands on research, the program also provided structured professional developments workshops to prepare students for graduate school and career in STEM. Talks and workshops on responsible conduct in research and bioethics were conducted to get awareness of ethical choices in research. Instructions on biosafety were also provided to make students aware of safe laboratory practices. Furthermore, the program comprised critical thinking exercises, scientific writing and oral/poster presentations guidance. Field trips to bioethics museums and research/industry centers were organized to create STEM career awareness.</p> <p>&nbsp;A parameter to evaluate student success in research is by the presentations they make at national and international scientific meetings. Our program resulted in 45 presentations in last 3 years by REU students from their summer research in a variety of scientific meetings including Annual Biomedical Research Conference for Minority Students (ABRCMS) and Emerging Researches National Conference in STEM (ERN). They also published&nbsp; conference proceeding papers. Another factor by which student research can be judged is by the awards they get at the scientific meetings. Many of our REU interns received travel awards from ABRCMS and ERN to present their research and many won awards for their research presentations at these meetings.</p> <p>&nbsp;The ultimate goal of the REU was to encourage participants to pursue graduate education or a career in STEM fields. Of the 30 interns supported by our REU program 22 graduated and 12 of them are pursuing graduate school and 7 are working as STEM employees. Throughout the three years of the REU program, program was assessed, and evaluation results were used to improve the program and successfully implement the program objectives. Overall, the student?s responses regarding our program were positive. Our interns assessed the overall research experience, including working relationships with the research mentors and research group as excellent. The interns felt the program helped in understanding the theory and concepts of research projects. The interns also believed they became confident and got the ability to work independently possibly due to our emphasis on early intense mentoring followed by relative freedom. The students felt they were engaged in real-world scientific research and felt like a scientist which plays an important role in retention in a scientific career for students. Students agreed that their resume has been enhanced by research experience and prepared them for advanced coursework, thesis work, graduate school, and a job. Most of the students felt they could work in science lab and likely to pursue a Ph.D. When asked to rate their satisfaction with various aspects of the research program, pleasantly, very high satisfaction levels were reported by the REU interns for: the application process, ease in locating a research mentor, ease in securing lab or field equipment, support and guidance from program staff, research mentor, other group members, research group meetings, and financial support. Most indicated that the workshops on science writing and presentation, safety training, and the ethics seminars helped immensely. The evaluations also showed that the interns learned more about bioengineering, nanotechnology, microbiology, &nbsp;biotechnology and the research experience significantly influenced their long-term goals.</p> <p>&nbsp;Our program outcomes clearly demonstrate that the REU program does in fact provide meaningful mentoring and extensive research experiences along with professional development training and a series of educational components that aided in career development for undergraduate students.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 07/30/2021<br>      Modified by: Komal&nbsp;Vig</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1659166/1659166_10475580_1621130280840_Picture5--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1659166/1659166_10475580_1621130280840_Picture5--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Student"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1659166/1659166_10475580_1621130280840_Picture5--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Student"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">group</div> <div class="imageCredit">David Campbell, ASU</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Komal&nbsp;Vig</div> <div class="imageTitle">Student</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1659166/1659166_10475580_1621130217764_Picture3--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1659166/1659166_10475580_1621130217764_Picture3--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Student"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1659166/1659166_10475580_1621130217764_Picture3--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Student"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Student</div> <div class="imageCredit">David Campbell, ASU</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Komal&nbsp;Vig</div> <div class="imageTitle">Student</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1659166/1659166_10475580_1621130140241_Picture6--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1659166/1659166_10475580_1621130140241_Picture6--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Student"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1659166/1659166_10475580_1621130140241_Picture6--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Student"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Student</div> <div class="imageCredit">David Campbell, ASU</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Komal&nbsp;Vig</div> <div class="imageTitle">Student</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1659166/1659166_10475580_1621130339837_Picture4--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1659166/1659166_10475580_1621130339837_Picture4--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Student"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1659166/1659166_10475580_1621130339837_Picture4--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Student"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Student</div> <div class="imageCredit">David Campbell, ASU</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Komal&nbsp;Vig</div> <div class="imageTitle">Student</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1659166/1659166_10475580_1621130407801_Picture2--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1659166/1659166_10475580_1621130407801_Picture2--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Student"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1659166/1659166_10475580_1621130407801_Picture2--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Student"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Student</div> <div class="imageCredit">David Campbell, ASU</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Komal&nbsp;Vig</div> <div class="imageTitle">Student</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1659166/1659166_10475580_1621299495160_pic1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1659166/1659166_10475580_1621299495160_pic1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Student"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1659166/1659166_10475580_1621299495160_pic1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Student"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">student</div> <div class="imageCredit">David Campbell, ASU</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Komal&nbsp;Vig</div> <div class="imageTitle">Student</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
