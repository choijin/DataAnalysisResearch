<AbstractNarration>This award provide support for an international workshop, the International Symposium on Recent Observations and Simulations of the Sun-Earth System III (ISROSES-III).  This activity is intended to be a forum for scientists from all heliophysics communities to present and discuss recent advances in theory, modeling and observations of the Sun-Earth System (SES) and to form research collaborations. This workshop would be the third one following similarly-focused workshops held in 2006 and in 2011. The budget covers travel expenses and registration expenses for three people (PI and two Co-PI).  Registration expenses for 20 invited speakers would be supported from this award. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The uniqueness of this Symposium is in that it will bring together cross-disciplinary scientists from around the globe to have focused discussions on fundamental problems related to the Sun-Earth System and space weather. The main emphasis will be put on the integration of these studies - ranging from observations to related interpretation, theory and numerical modeling across different temporal and spatial scales of this system. It will thus provide training for new researchers in geospace system science. Young postdoctoral and early career researchers are expected to come away from the Symposium with a better appreciation of the benefits of interdisciplinary approaches to understanding the dynamic near-Earth space environment.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The main purpose of this NSF grant is to foster interdisciplinary research and education through the vehicle of an international workshop, the International Symposium on Recent Observations and Simulations of the Sun-Earth System III (ISROSES-III).  The 3rd International Symposium on Recent Observations and Simulations of the Sun-Earth System (ISROSES-III) was held in Golden Sands, Bulgaria, from 11 to 16 September 2016 to discuss recent advances and chart future developments in space weather research.  The Conveners of the Symposium were Vania Jordanova (ISR, LANL) and Joseph Borovsky (Space Science Institute).  The main purpose of the symposium was to foster interdisciplinary research and collaboration by enhancing communications between the space and earth sciences communities worldwide.  In addition to NSF Solar-Terrestrial funding, the LANL Center for Space and Earth Science (CSES) and the SCOSTEP/VarSITI (Variability of the Sun and Its Terrestrial Impact) also supported the symposium.  ISROSES-III also received collaboration and support from the US National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), and locally from the University of Sofia, Bulgaria.    ISROSES-III created a forum for researchers from all space science communities to discuss the complex, multi-scale, interactions in the Sun-Earth system. The Symposium covered a broad range of topics: a) interactions and coupling within the Sun-Earth system, b) advances in measurement, data analysis, theory, and simulations of the Sun-Earth system, c) reaction of the Earth system to the Sun and the solar wind, and d) recent research in space weather science and applications.  The ISROSES-III scientific program consisted of oral and poster sessions which gathered about 100 participants for fruitful discussions.  These included the fundamental physics of how waves and shocks in magnetic fields create dangerous radiation by accelerating particles throughout space. One study at the meeting examined the origin of these particles as measured from geosynchronous orbit. Another study analyzed the types of magnetic disturbances that lead to geomagnetic storms. Others focused on the structure of the Earth?s magnetospheric current systems, improving our understanding of them and how they map to the ionosphere. Yet another detailed an improved representation of magnetospheric electric potential to create more accurate simulations. The community also highlighted common misconceptions as well as the need to develop contemporary and innovative technologies in space exploration. In the research community, it is easier to denounce new concepts than express doubt in old, deeply-held misconceptions. In contrast, in the market economy, old concepts or misconceptions are constantly abandoned in search for something new.  Among the ISROSES-III participants were well-known speakers from the US, European Union, Canada, China, Japan, Norway, Russia, and other countries.  A special issue of the Journal of Atmospheric and Solar-Terrestrial Physics (JASTP) is currently organized to publish both invited and contributed papers presented during ISROSES-III.  For further information about the symposium, please visit the official website: http://www.isroses.lanl.gov/.
