<AbstractNarration>Non-Technical Abstract&lt;br/&gt;In a quantum communication network, information is carried by light pulses containing single photons and is processed by individual quantum systems or quantum bits, such as single atoms or single electron spins.  This new information processing paradigm can enable secure or unbreakable communication and can tackle computational problems that would otherwise be impossible with conventional computers.  A key requirement for developing this new paradigm is the control of interactions between light and quantum systems at the level of single photons and single quantum bits.  This experimental project uses individual electron spins in a thin diamond membrane as quantum bits. Strong interactions between single photons and single spins are enabled by confining the photons in an optical micro-resonator with a dimension less than 50 micrometers.  The primary goal is to use a single electron spin to control the quantum state of a single photon, thus realizing an optical switch that can operate at the level of single photons.  These switches can serve as an important component in a quantum network.  This research project also provides excellent training opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students in areas including nanophotonics and nanofabrication as well as quantum science and technology.  This training prepares the students for careers in academia, industry, or government.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Abstract&lt;br/&gt;This project develops a unique composite cavity QED system, in which an electron spin in a thin diamond membrane couples to the evanescent field of an optical whispering gallery mode in a silica microresonator via a resonant Raman transition.  Fundamental optical interactions at the level of single electron spins and single photons are explored in a solid state environment.  The research activity focuses on the experimental demonstration of the Duan-Kimbe scheme, which realizes a pi-phase shift for a single photon, conditioned on the quantum state of an atom.  This cavity QED process takes place in the limit that cooperativity, a dimensionless parameter characterizing the strength of atom-photon or spin-photon coupling, exceeds 1, but does not require strong coupling at the single-photon level. The near term objective is to achieve single-spin-induced optical transparency and to realize a photonic switch that can control the quantum state of a single photon through its interaction with a single electron spin.  These switches can enable the generation and distribution of quantum entanglement in a quantum network, potentially playing a significant role in the development of quantum information technologies.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In a quantum communications network, information can be encoded on light pulses containing single photons.  This quantum information can propagate between individual nodes containing single atoms, including artificial atoms.  The quantum communications network can be used to implement secure communications and to solve computational problems that would otherwise be difficult with conventional computers.   This research program at the University of Oregon has developed an experimental platform, which aims to realize the transfer of quantum information between single photons confined tightly in an optical resonator with a dimension about 50 micrometers and single artificial atoms hosted in a diamond crystal.  The artificial atoms are a special type of defect centers, so-called silicon-vacancy centers, which consist of two vacancies (i.e., two missing atoms in the diamond lattice) that are adjacent to each other, with a silicon atom inserted in between.  The silicon vacancy centers are created in a diamond membrane with a thickness about 100 nanometers.  The optical resonator is formed via propagation of light along the equator of a silica microsphere with a diameter about 50 micrometers.   A composite system has been developed, in which the silicon vacancy centers in the 100 nanometer thick diamond membrane are coupled to photons confined in a silica microsphere.  The photonic spatial confinement greatly increases the light intensity that can be generated by a single photon and thus enhances its coupling to the defect center.  The thickness of the diamond membrane is much smaller than the wavelength of the photon such that the photonic scattering loss off the membrane is nearly negligible.  This composite system can enable a silicon vacancy center in the diamond membrane to emit a photon into the optical resonator and at a later time to reabsorb this photon, a precursor for the transfer of quantum information between single photons and single artificial atoms.  This research program has also made important contributions to education and human resource by providing training for graduate and undergraduate students in areas of both scientific and technological importance. One graduate student has graduated with a PhD in physics.  Another graduate student is expected to obtain her physics PhD degree soon.
