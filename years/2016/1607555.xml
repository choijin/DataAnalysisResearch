<AbstractNarration>Ultra-high-energy neutrinos are unique astrophysical messengers as they interact only weakly with intervening matter and can therefore be used to probe the distant universe.  A small but observable flux of these ultra-high-energy neutrinos are expected to be produced in interactions between high-energy "cosmic ray" charged particles traveling through the Universe and Cosmic Microwave Background photons.  Observations of these cosmogenic neutrinos probe the structure and evolution of the Universe and test physics at energies beyond the standard models.  Utilizing the large volume of radio transparent ice, several pioneering efforts to detect these high energies neutrinos have been implemented in Antarctica.  Ultra-high-energy neutrinos traveling through the dense Antarctic ice generate cascades of particles that emit observable radio waves.  This award will support the development of a new method for detecting this signature of neutrino interaction based on radio interferometry.  The University of Chicago group will develop, deploy, and test a ground-based interferometric phased array to measure the neutrino-induced radio emission.  This array will be integrated with the existing Askaryan Radio Array (ARA) experiment located at the South Pole.   The award will also support public outreach efforts in partnership with the Adler Planetarium.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The University of Chicago group will design and fabricate beam-forming trigger hardware for the phased array, integrate the new array with the existing ARA station hardware in their local laboratories, and then deploy the instrument to the South Pole and perform in situ tests.  With data from the integrated stations, they will evaluate the detector design and acquire scientific data to help develop this technology for a larger-scale experimental deployment.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Through high energy neutrino astrophysics, we explore the structure and evolution of the universe in a unique way and test our understanding of particle physics at energies much greater than those available at particle colliders.  The discovery of the highest energy neutrinos would shed light on the physics that drives the acceleration processes inside the highest energy sources and be a key step in determining the origin of the highest energy cosmic rays.  The highest energy neutrinos are observable via the radio emission that is created by neutrino-induced showers in glacial ice, such as that at the South Pole.  Under this award, we have developed a new technology that improves the sensitivity of the radio detection method for high energy particles.  We have designed, built, and installed and operated a new data acquisition system at the South Pole as part of the Askaryan Radio Array (ARA) experiment, based on a new interferometric phased array trigger.  The system is extremely robust, and performs exactly according to simulations that we have developed.  We published the result of this work in a paper (preprint available: https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.04573).   The system has been running maintenance-free for two years, and this first-generation interferometric phased array trigger has improved the sensitivity over the previous state-of-the art systems by a factor of two or more, across the band.  Further improvements, that are currently being incorporated into a second-generation system, promise to further extend the sensitivity reach of this design.  Under this award, members of the research team have collaborated with the Adler Planetarium to participate in Astronomy Conversations as experts in particle astrophysics, reaching hundreds of museum-goers and discussing high-energy neutrino astronomy.   Participants have also developed new material, including an experimental lab, for Expanding Your Horizons, an event for middle school girls.
