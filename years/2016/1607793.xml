<AbstractNarration>The principal investigator plans to organize two 5-day long workshops at the Centre de Recerca Matematica (CRM) in Bellaterra, Spain, as part of a program in large cardinals and strong logics at CRM. The program will take place from September 5 to December 16, 2016, and will comprise lectures and workshops. The award is intended to support a unique opportunity for active participation of twelve early-career researchers and graduate students from the U.S. in regular weekly seminars, workshops, and intensive courses, as well as four established researchers. The geographical area of the conference, Catalonia, is very strong in the area of general logic, set theory, and model theory, and the location is a natural focal point for researchers in Europe and the United States. to attend. The program's web page is at http://www.crm.cat/en/Activities/Curs_2016-2017/Pages/IRP-Large-Cardinals-and-Strong-Logics.aspx, which contains the full program, list of invited researchers, and scientific events. All CRM activities are posted in the AMS calendar and EMS website among other web pages.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The thematic program is an opportunity for the dissemination of the results obtained in the area of strong logics and large cardinals to the broader mathematical community, and as an invaluable instrument for the consolidation of a new field of interdisciplinary research. One of the planned workshops is entitled "Set Theoretical Aspects of the Model Theory of Strong Logics," which will take place at the beginning of the program, and the other is entitled "Applications of Strong Logics in Other Areas of Mathematics," which will take place towards the end of the program. An advanced course aimed at junior researchers is planned during one of the workshops. The proposed list of speakers contains the most distinguished international speakers in Set Theory, Model Theory and Logic, and the program includes the most cutting-edge developments in research the area.</AbstractNarration>
