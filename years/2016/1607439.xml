<AbstractNarration>This project, an Industry-University Collaborative Project between the University of Wisconsin-Madison and scientists and engineers at Northrop-Grumman Corporation, studies a new approach to making extremely precise and sensitive measurements using Nuclear  Magnetic Resonance (NMR).  NMR forms the basis for the MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) that a medical patient might receive, and for various types of chemical analysis.  This project will investigate a new NMR method designed for use as either a compact, high precision gyroscope for navigation, or for a tool to search for evidence of previously unobserved types of forces between matter and nuclear spins.  Any new forces so observed would likely give important information on the properties of so-called "dark matter" which is believed to make up most of the universe but which has never been directly observed.  Even if such forces are not detected, the project will place constraints on theoretical models which seek to go beyond the so-called "standard model" of particle physics.  The applications of the new method for navigation involve a possible means to make compact quantum-based measurements of rotation with unprecedented sensitivity and accuracy.  As a collaborative effort between university researchers and industrial scientists and engineers, the project will promote practical applications of nuclear spins for such measurements, promote technology transfer between university and industry, and expose young researchers to an industrial research and development laboratory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The underlying principles rely on the application of NMR bias magnetic fields in the form of sequences of short pulses of well-defined areas that act, in concert with time dependent optical pumping, to allow alkali atoms and noble-gas nuclei to precess at the same frequency despite having magnetic moments that are different by 3 orders of magnitude. Both species can then be polarized and precess entirely transverse to the bias field. This greatly suppresses the dominant systematic errors that are known to affect traditional designs of such instruments, but retains the benefits of ultrasensitive readout of the NMR precession using the embedded alkali magnetometer. Estimates of technical noise indicate the system has a potential frequency noise level of better than 10 nano-Hertz per square-root Hertz bandwidth, with fundamental limits that are much better. The system will be used to set new stringent limits on the potential couplings of axions to nuclei.  The basic physics principles of this approach have now been demonstrated in the laboratory and the key systematic errors have been shown to be suppressed by at least a factor of 2500.  The next steps are to realize the high sensitivity promise in dual-species experiments that promise exceptionally good magnetic noise and drift suppression. In this context the system will be tested as a precision NMR gyroscope, of great interest to the industrial partners, and will be used to set new mass and sensitivity limits in searches for axion-like particles.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Motivation:   Precision instruments based on fundamental quantum phenomena are increasing used in modern technology.  The premier example is the use of atomic clocks for the Global Positioning System (GPS).  However, GPS can be jammed or disabled and so it is desirable to have alternate means of navigation.  The NMR gyro technology pursued under this grant has the potential to provide accurate navigation without satellite communication.  Furthermore, it has the unique feature that is does not require calibration; the device directly compares rotation rates to the fundamental precession of nuclei in magnetic fields. From a scientific perspective, NMR provides an extremely sensitive method for searching for small forces that could be present but are outside the ?Standard Model? of physics.     Intellectual Merit:   We studied a new approach to NMR gyros.  Our central innovation is the use of magnetic fields applied as sequences of pulses of well-defined amplitude and duration.  These pulses allow the optically active but rotationally insensitive atoms (Rb) in our experiments to behave almost as if the magnetic fields do not exist.  On the other hand, the rotationally sensitive nuclei (two species of Xe) care only about the time-averaged fields and so hardly notice the pulsed nature at all.  In this way, we take advantage of the Rb atoms for production and detection of the NMR, while minimally perturbing the Xe nuclei for detection of rotation.              We demonstrated two designs for the new approach in this project.  The first used light pulses to drive and detect the NMR.  This turned out to have some drawbacks that led us to introduce a second design in which the light was held constant but we changed the arrival times of the magnetic field pulses in such a way as to mimic the light pulses.              We made careful studies of the properties of these instruments.  We showed that we can completely cancel the effects of magnetic field noise at the current levels of sensitivity, demonstrating the validity of the approach.  In the course of studying other sources of error, we learned new ways that the Rb-Xe interactions subtly alter the NMR process.  At the end of the grant period, these insights enabled us to measure the sensitivity of the device at a level of about 1/10 of the earth?s rotation rate in about 100 seconds of integration time.  We believe that the insights so attained will allow us to improve on this in the next stage of this research.     Broader Impacts:              This research provided valuable training for 3 graduate students at the University of Wisconsin, one of whom completed his PhD and is now a scientist at Sandia National Laboratory.  The students also we able to interact in a very substantive manner with scientists and engineers at Northrop-Grumman Corp (NGC) and get exposure to industrial research and development.  Furthermore, some of the effects that were studied turned out to directly applicable to the NMR gyro design used at NGC, and so the fundamental research pursued here had important consequences for state-of-the-art NMR gyros.
