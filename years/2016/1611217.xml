<AbstractNarration>Non-Technical Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;Quantum phases of matter are based on entanglement between electrons confined to crystal lattices. A familiar example of such a phase is superconductivity; this once-exotic phenomenon has now matured and is being used for technological applications such as Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI).   Similarly, the new quantum phases of matter being explored in this research on honeycomb lattice magnets (i.e., magnets built from a lattice structure composed of hexagons) could provide dramatic technological consequences.  One predicted quantum phase, the Kitaev Honeycomb Quantum Spin Liquid, supports special excited states that could form unusually robust "qubits" for quantum computations.  This research project aims to produce such exotic phases in new honeycomb lattice materials, using previously unexplored choices of magnetic ions.  Undergraduate researchers, who prepare samples and perform basic techniques for magnetic characterizations, carry out a large part of the exploratory aspects of the research.  Graduate students involved in this project master techniques in single crystal growth, thermodynamic characterization, and inelastic neutron scattering.  This project heavily relies on large-scale neutron science facilities in the United States.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;This research is designed to produce new quantum phases of matter using unconventional materials choices.  Magnetic insulators with strong spin-orbit coupling are ideal targets for exploring a wide variety of interesting phases based on quantum entanglement, such as Quantum Spin Liquids.  These exotic phases host potentially useful quasi-particle excitations; one example is the "anyon" excitation predicted for the Kitaev Honeycomb Quantum Spin Liquid.  Anyons, once they are successfully produced in a real material, could be used for topologically protected quantum computations.  The two key ingredients for exotic phases like this are 1) anisotropic magnetic interactions on the honeycomb lattice, obtainable from magnetic species with strong spin-orbit coupling, and 2) quantum fluctuations, which are a natural feature of correlated pseudo-spin Â½ magnetic moments.  These ingredients have previously been sought in honeycomb lattice materials based on 4d and 5d transition metal ions.  The current research project extends the search to unconventional choices of magnetic species outside of these series, enabling a wider variety of characterization techniques while opening a new arena of materials to be explored.  Solid-state synthesis methods, including intense crystal growth efforts, are combined with detailed characterizations of materials using thermodynamic probes and inelastic neutron scattering at temperatures as low as 50 mK.  Undergraduate researchers, who prepare samples and perform basic techniques for magnetic characterizations, carry out a large part of the exploratory aspects of the research.  Graduate students involved in this project master techniques in single crystal growth, thermodynamic characterization, and inelastic neutron scattering.  This project heavily relies on large-scale neutron science facilities in the US.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ We have made and studied four different quantum magnetic materials, which all form similar lattice structures known as the "honeycomb lattice".  The unique design aspect of the materials we studied is that they are based on rare earth or cobalt magnetic ions, which are not typically considered for quantum magnetism.   This choice of ions on the honeycomb lattice can theoretically lead to very interesting phases of matter, such as the famous Kitaev Quantum Spin Liquid, and the materials we studied give insight into this and some of the other possible phases that can be realized.  Perhaps most intriguingly, we have found a "quantum dimer magnet" that exhibits a state called Bose Einstein condensate (BEC) in the presence of an applied magnetic field.  This material is a unique example of this well-known physical state, since the fields required are much smaller than all other material examples known to date, allowing it to be studied by powerful experimental probes such as neutron scattering, which we have begun to do.  It also exhibits a "mystery phase" which is under further investigation.  We have also studied a related material with the same structure, but different rare earth ion, that appears to form a more conventional magnetic state.  Studying the reason behind the different magnetic states of these materials will be instructive to advancing the field of rare-earth based quantum magnetism.  Another material example we have studied, based on cobalt ions, does not demonstrate conventional magnetic behavior, instead forming "puddles" of two different magnetic structures.  This may be a sign of it being "proximate" to a Kitaev Quantum Spin Liquid phase.  Overall, our results demonstrate the range of possibilities of rare earth and cobalt ions for quantum magnetic applications, potentially paving the way for future advances in quantum information.    The project has involved nine trainees, including six undergraduate students, two graduate students, and a postdoctoral fellow.  Each of the trainees have significantly contributed to the materials synthesis, measurements, analysis, and scientific communication aspects of the project, gaining valuable skills in these areas.  The principal investigator also organized and held two workshops for middle-school aged girls, about 80 in total, which gave them exposure to concepts in magnetism.  This outreach effort was intended to spark curiosity in girls to study STEM fields, and had the additional benefit of being run by female researchers who served as role models for careers in this area.
