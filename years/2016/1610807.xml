<AbstractNarration>In this project funded by the Environmental Chemical Sciences Program of the Division of Chemistry, Professors Ning Dai and Luis Velarde at the University at Buffalo are investigating the contribution of atmospheric nitrogen oxides to the changes in pesticides which reside on leaf surfaces. Due to the widespread use of pesticides in agricultural and urban environments and their inherent toxicity, it is critical to develop capabilities to accurately predict the changes that occur in these molecules on exposure to the environment. This research project addresses a pesticide transformation pathway that is currently not considered in the predictive models.  The research is integrated with synergistic educational activities, including training of graduate students, research experiences for undergraduate students, incorporation of research into the Environmental Engineering curriculum at the University at Buffalo, and public science outreach for high school teachers and underrepresented high school students in the Greater Buffalo region.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project identifies pesticide functional groups that are susceptible to nitrogen oxide reactions in water and organic solvents. The kinetics and products of nitrogen oxide-induced pesticide transformation are then determined on simulated and authentic leaf surfaces. The effects of environmental factors, including sunlight, pesticide formula, and the structure of leaf cuticle wax, on the reactions are also characterized. Lastly, vibrational sum frequency generation (VSFG) spectroscopy is employed to characterize the molecular orientation and tethering of surface-bound pesticides and their transformation products on model leaf surfaces.  This characterizational technique is used to correlate the pesticide-leaf physical interaction with nitrogen oxide-pesticide reactions.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This project examined the transformation of pesticides on environmental surfaces such as leaf and soil. Herbicides, the largest group of pesticide chemicals, were the focus of the study. Through experimental work, we advanced the knowledge of fundamental nitrosation and nitration chemistry involving nitrogen oxides (NOx), the understanding of sunlight photochemistry on environmental surfaces, and the ability to characterize the interaction between organic molecules and surfaces at the microscopic level.</p> <p>We developed an experimental framework and a laboratory setup to allow systematic evaluation of the behavior of herbicide compounds under sunlight. Using these methods, we first examined the degradation of the herbicides in the 2,4-D family. Developed in the 1940s, 2,4-D remains the 7th most used agricultural pesticide and the most used pesticide in non-agricultural sectors. Using the rate constants obtained from experiments conducted on wax surface, the half-life of 2,4-D on leaf surface in the natural environment was estimated to be comparable with that of 2,4-D biodegradation. This suggests that photodegradation on surfaces should be included in the models to allow more accurate prediction of the persistence of herbicides in the environment. Second, we evaluated the herbicide metolachlor and its safener benoxacor. Safeners are a group of additives in commercial formulations to selectively protect crop plants from active herbicidal ingredients. In this work, we showed that the safener benoxacor exhibited reactivity under sunlight. Specifically, it can induce the transformation of the herbicide metolachlor on simulated soil surface. These results illustrate how a safener can influence the photochemistry of its co-formulated herbicide and suggest that such mixture effects should be considered when evaluating the environmental fate of herbicides. Lastly, we examined the role of land-applied biosolids, materials derived from municipal sewage treatment, in contributing to the degradation of organic contaminants under sunlight. The preliminary findings showed that biosolid-derived organic matter was more effective in inducing contaminant degradation than soil-derived organic matter under sunlight.</p> <p>The study also determined the binding and preferred orientations of commonly used carbamate pesticides, such as carbaryl and propoxur, at surfaces representative of mineral soil and the waxy leaf cuticle. A detailed molecular-level picture of surface bound carbamates was revealed by computational and experimental vibrational sum frequency generation (SFG) studies. The preferred orientations are consistent with optimization of hydrogen bonding interactions with the silica surface and van der Waals contacts for the hydrophobic wax. Results show a primary anchoring motif for the more rigid carbaryl molecule but a bimodal distribution of fluxional orientations for propoxur, demonstrating a link between molecular structure and adsorption equilibrium geometries. Our studies showed the pesticides are readily removed from the surface by exposure to water. The reported findings are particularly relevant to understanding the correlation between surface orientation and exposed molecular groups of the adsorbed pesticides to degradation by gaseous radicals, sunlight, and pesticide runoff.</p> <p>The intellectual merit of this work is reflected in the novel method development in most research tasks and the significance of our findings in advancing fundamental science. We dedicated effort to develop a standardized experimental framework to examine the photodegradation of herbicides and related organic compounds under sunlight. We developed novel reactor setups to achieve well-controlled surface reaction environment. The broadband femtosecond SFG spectroscopy used in this study represents the state-of-the-art technology for interfacial in-situ measurements, making it possible to characterize the herbicide-surface interaction at the molecular level.
