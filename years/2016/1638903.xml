<AbstractNarration>The world is being changed by Big Data, and data science is receiving a remarkably rapid uptake across the nation and the globe as it institutionalized in university curricula, state governance, and industry strategy. Across the sciences, state and industry, new forms of data collection and analysis hold the prospect of our being able to address the major social and scientific issues of our times: from responding to natural disasters to monitoring the environment to developing fundamental technological insights which will revolutionize industry.  None of this will happen by fiat ? the development of the appropriate data analytics must be accompanied by new organizational alignments between research, policy and industry.  The Big Data Hubs and Spokes (BDHubs) program is a key site for analyzing the nature of these alignments with a view to gaining a basic understanding of the stakes as the terrain shifts.  All long-term research and innovation infrastructure must adapt to such ongoing changes. This research will contribute to understanding institutional flexibility: strategies, techniques and organizational innovations to adapt to changes in regulatory, policy and funding environments.  We can expect but not precisely predict, continuing transformations in the sociotechnical, scientific and institutional ecologies of today?s research and scientific infrastructure.  This project will investigate the ongoing activities at the BDHubs and its partner institutions, their emerging plans for the future, and tie these to the long-history of developing research infrastructures (50+ years) to understand the changes we can expect BDHubs to encounter over time (scientific, technological and institutional), and what strategies they employ in the face of transformations to the landscape of science, information technology and institutional environment. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many challenges facing contemporary science such as environmental research or chronic disease management require long-term studies and supporting infrastructures. This project will contribute directly to NSF and other efforts to build more open, effective, and sustainable knowledge communities across the sciences, industry and government. Improving understanding of the long-term trajectory of research infrastructure will lead to smarter and more sustainable investment and design choices on the part of project leaders, participants, tool builders, and funders. Many other science agencies are in the midst of funding such cross-cutting projects. This research will inform science policy and regulatory environments to help develop sustainable and productive research infrastructures. In order to do so, this study will develop a general organizational understanding of the development of large-scale and long-term endeavors in the data sciences and map the institutional landscape of modern data science with particular focus on the activities of infrastructure building, policy development and community formation. In addition, this study will help to develop an understanding of the ?rise of the data sciences? in the US both as an institutional movement and as a form of technical research, with special focus on establishing a framework for evaluating and understanding large-scale, cross-disciplinary collaboration on big data tools, techniques and methods.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Assembling Data Science was a first-in-kind sociotechnical analysis of efforts to institutionalize data science at the national level in the United States, a process occurring at vastly different scales and at quite a rapid pace. Within and across nearly every domain, it is argued that new modes of aggregating and analyzing data hold the promise of addressing the major social and scientific issues of our times: from agriculture to healthcare, and from interoperability to computational reproducibility.  Taking the NSF-funded Big Data Regional Innovation Hubs and Spokes (BDHubs) as our point of departure, we situated this recent initiative in a much longer historical arc of large-scale and long-term research infrastructure development in the US dating back more than 50 years. From this perspective, BDHubs was a key site for analyzing the ongoing and mutual (re)shaping of policy, technological development, and socio-organizational dynamics at the dawning of a new era of data science.  Unpacking large-scale, cross-sector collaborations centered on the tools and techniques of data processing and visualization motivating a fundamental insight: that the advent of data science in the US is not only indicative of a burgeoning paradigm of technical research, but also points to a broader scientific-intellectual movement whose very unfolding warrants further exploration. Our research program established a coherent ethnographically-informed analytic framework for mapping technological assemblages and policy pathways, one that has found relevance to students of science, policymakers, and practitioners alike.  A central contribution of this project was the development of the conceptual framework 'the logic of domains': an examination of the social, organizational and technical relationships between general computational fields (such as data science) and specific domains (i.e., biology, geology, etc). In endeavors organized  by the logic of domains, computational services are offered to the domains (such as data analytics, visualizaiton tools, or computational 'cycles') and, in turn, these problem domains serve as testing grounds for novel computational research. This research project examined both the benefits of arranging research by the logic of domains, as well as its recurrent sociotechnical challenges. Findings were published and disseminated to a wide variety of communities, including Science and Technology Studies (STS), Computer Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW), and Big Data scholarship.
