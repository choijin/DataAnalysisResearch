<AbstractNarration>This grant supports the annual workshop for Women in Machine Learning (WiML). WiML brings together female researchers in industry and academia, postdoctoral fellows, and graduate students from the machine learning community to exchange research ideas and build mentoring and networking relationships. The one-day workshop is especially beneficial for junior graduate students, giving them a supportive environment in which to present their research (in many cases, for the first time) and enabling them to meet peers and more senior researchers in the field of machine learning. The networking opportunities provided by the workshop have also helped senior graduate students find jobs following graduation. This workshop will foster collaboration within the machine learning community. Established researchers will expose workshop participants about cutting-edge ideas from diverse areas of machine learning. Students will present their own research and receive valuable feedback from both senior researchers and their peers. By enabling women at all stages of their careers in machine learning to exchange research ideas and form new relationships, we expect that new connections and research collaborations will be established, thereby advancing the state-of-the-art of the field. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; This workshop will provide a forum for female graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, junior and senior faculty, and industry and government research scientists to exchange research ideas and establish networking and mentoring relationships. Undergraduates, particularly those who are interested in pursuing graduate school or industry positions in machine learning, are also welcome to attend. Bringing together women from different stages of their careers gives established researchers the opportunity to act as mentors, and enables junior women to find female role models working in the field of machine learning. The workshop will also benefit the wider machine learning community: The WiML website includes a directory of over 400 women for organizations looking for female invited speakers.  Co-locating with a major machine learning conference (a) enhances the visibility of the participants in he broader community and (b) facilitates travel for WiML attendees to stay on for the main conference.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Women in Machine Learning is a non-profit organization that organizes a flagship workshop (the Workshop for Women in Machine Learning) as well as smaller satellite events at major machine learning conferences.  The objective of the workshop is to improve the retention and impact of women in machine learning.  We accomplish this through technical presentations by established female researchers, a poster session where junior researchers (e.g. graduate students) can get critical feedback on their work in a supportive environment, and ample networking opportunities that build the connections that will help keep attendees in the field and help them increase the impact of their work.  Over the course of the grant, the total number of attendees at the workshop were 593 (2016), 908 (2017), and 851 (2018) participants.  These numbers largely track the exponential growth of NeurIPS (the bump in 2017 comes from where we experimented with a 2-day format; the number includes all people, whether they came for one day or two).  One of our biggest accomplishments has been scaling the event to keep up with this growth, while maintaining a friendly, welcoming atmosphere where people feel comfortable sharing ideas and critique.    Moreover, by co-locating with NeurIPS, a major machine learning conference, the workshop also helps women attend NeurIPS: because we provide travel support, WiML participants have one less cost associated with attending NeurIPS.  Specifically, this NSF grant funded close to 100 travel awards for workshop participants.        Last Modified: 08/12/2019       Submitted by: Finale P Doshi-Velez]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
