<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this project to develop short term Solar irradiance forecasting, will be to support very large deployment of Solar photovoltaic (SPV) generation capacity, by reducing the cost of mitigating cloud caused fluctuation of SPV electricity generation. This increased SPV system deployment will reduce the amount of base load and peaking generation from greenhouse gas causing, and water consuming fossil fuel generators. Such forecasting will enable development of pre-­&amp;#8208; mitigation strategies instead of post mitigation using electrical storage systems. Prior studies indicate that this will result in the reduction by up to a factor of five, of the input/output requirements of the electrical storage system used in the pre-­&amp;#8208;mitigation scenario, compared to the post mitigation scenario. These benefits will be seen with grid-­&amp;#8208;tied, micro-­&amp;#8208;grid and off-­&amp;#8208;grid SPV systems. This opens commercial opportunities for introducing intelligent sensors and control systems to reduce bulk electrical storage. The technology areas used in this project include sensors, 3D printing, neural network based learning systems, embedded computers and cloud computing. The market sectors that will see a positive impact include all demographics as consumers, and manufacturers of SPV modules and SPV balance of system suppliers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project  addresses  the  problem  of  mitigating cloud movement induced fluctuation in the output of SPV systems. The research objectives of Phase I are (a) prototype a whole sky imager that provides sufficient circumsolar image discrimination, to drive a neural network based learning system ? this will require  development  of  a  3D-­&amp;#8208;printed  mounting system for a whole sky sensor, and interface to a cloud connected, local single board computer, (b) develop and optimize Image Acquisition, Compositing, Analysis, and Forecasting Algorithms to provide 15-­&amp;#8208;500 second forecasts of Solar irradiance, and (c) deploy imager + software prototypes to evaluate real live sky imagery in multiple locations with different weather patterns, by gathering data to ?train? the neural network. It is anticipated that this evaluation and analysis of prototype performance will continue in subsequent phases, to obtain high confidence results. The anticipated results of the research in Phase I  are (i) refinement of the image capture system to produce ?good? imagery, (ii) development  of procedures  to  tune  neural  network  learning  system  towards  obtaining  high  confidence  forecasts, and (iii) understanding of performance requirements of local single board computer.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[Solar Micro-forecasting- Award no 1648751  Project outcomes Report   A Solar Irradiance Microforecasting prototype was developed by Microgrid Labs, Inc with the University of New Mexico as subcontractor, under NSF-STTR Phase I grant #16-555.   We used FLIR Lepton IR sensors for sky imaging for creating input for a LAPART neural network The Lepton IR sensor is a consumer grade device: a significant achievement of our work was that we validated that a consumer-grade-IR-sensor based imaging system coupled with a neural network can perform solar irradiance predictions.   In the prototype system (Figure 1), we used a single board computer for IR image capture, desktop computers for hosting image processing, and a LAPART neural network for irradiance forecasting. We captured "training" data in Boulder, Colorado and Albuquerque, New Mexico, and achieved Global Horizontal Irradiance forecast with a mean accuracy of +/- 70 watts/sqm. over a 120 second time horizon  We designed the IR image capture system to accommodate limitations in image accuracy of sensors that were intended for consumer operation. The most significant limitation was that the absolute values measured by the Lepton in radiometric mode were insufficiently accurate for prediction purposes. We resolved this issue by exclusively using the Lepton sensors for capturing and tracking circumsolar cloud movement. We added a calibrated LICOR LI-200R pyranometer for measuring Global Horizontal Irradiance &ndash; this was used for training the neural network and for validating predictions made by it.  We developed Python code for performing image capture from the 8 Lepton compound sensor, and irradiance data from the LICOR (Figure 2). The Python code "frame_grabber.py" is run on a low power single board computer running Ubuntu 16.04. This code creates a directory, performs a specified number of captures at a specified time interval, and writes Lepton image files as csv files, and Licor readings as txt files. One full set of images, one image from each of the eight sensors, is gathered every 10 seconds. These eight images are stitched together to form a full sky image.(figures 4 and 5)  Two systems were deployed.  The University of New Mexico and Boulder, Colorado systems are shown below, in two different configurations.  Figure 3 shows the Boulder, Colorado system and has the key components and features anticipated in the fully functional final Solar Irradiance Micro-forecasting product.  The system includes an IP66 rated electronics enclosure surrounded by stainless steel sheet metal to protect against rain, hail and UV rays.  The camera dome is a 3D printed acrylonitrile butadiene styrene UV stabilized painted plastic enclosure that houses the camera electronics.  The system also houses the pyranometer.  Neural networks are machine-learning systems whose design and processing are motivated by biological nervous systems. They borrow from biology the notions of neurons as the elemental processing unit and the ways in which neurons are linked via unidirectional adaptive connections.   The LAPART network architecture used in this project is based upon the lateral coupling of two Fuzzy ART subnetworks (see Fig. 6). The interconnections between the two subnetworks force an interaction of the respective categorizations performed by the individual Fuzzy ART subnetworks.  This modifies their unsupervised learning properties to allow the learning of inference relationships or associations between the learned pattern categories representing their respective input domains.  This can be thought of as supervised learning, or supervised classification.   Our approach to learning the relationships between cloud patterns at one time and solar irradiance at a future time utilizes the supervised learning properties of the LAPART neural network. In this application, the network learns the approximate functional mapping of circumsolar cloud image representations at a time t to solar irradiance values at a time t + ?th,.  After learning, the performance of the trained network is measured by disabling training and presenting the testing set of data.  For each testing input of a cloud pattern, a irradiance prediction is read out of LAPART and compared to the actual irradiance value.  In a study of error statistics, the system was shown to make irradiance predictions with an RMS error of 76.1 Watts/sq. meter at a prediction time horizon of 120 seconds.  This forecasting system will be demonstrated as part of two microgrid projects in 2019. The purpose of this is to prove the quality of short term forecast and its value for a microgrid control system. We see islanded operation of microgrids as one of the key applications for short term solar irradiance forecasting.   We did not pursue NSF Phase 2 application as the market demand for short term solar irradiance forecasting is still scattered and limited. However, we are continuing with our marketing and looking for more pilot projects.                          Last Modified: 08/26/2018       Submitted by: Narayanan Sankar]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
