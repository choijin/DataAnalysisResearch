<AbstractNarration>The 74th Device Research Conference (DRC) has a University setting and will take place at the University of Delaware, Newark, DE from June 19 to 22, 2016.  Topics to be addressed include biological devices, emerging Electronic device materials (graphene, MoS2), devices for energy scavenging power, memory, nanoscale applications, including Terahertz and spin-based approaches.  The Conference seeks financial support to underrepresented minorities as invited speakers as well as students, It has a strong tradition of student involvement, with strong student attendance to its short courses, poster session and oral presentations. The DRC also has a tradition of offering discounted student registration fees, not only for general attendance but also for its short courses, in order to encourage student participation and attendance from additional students who are not presenting an abstract. Support will allow offering 50% discount for student registration to the general conference and the day-long short course "Device Fundamentals You Were Never Taught: Interpreting Your Device Data" held just prior to the beginning of the conference.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ We received NSF support for increasing the diversity of speakers and enhancing student participation at the 74th Device Research Conference (DRC). The DRC has a University setting (this year was held at the University of Delaware), and a strong tradition of involvement from researchers around the world.  Yet, the DRC&mdash;and the device research community as a whole&mdash;stands to benefit from an increase in the invited speakers at the conference that are underrepresented minorities. Additionally, student involvement is a hallmark of the DRC, with traditionally strong student attendance to its short courses, poster session and oral presentations; however, student participation is strictly tied to the ability of offering a discounted student registration rate.  DRC has a history of offering discounted student registration fees, for general attendance and short courses, in order to encourage student participation and attendance from additional students who are not presenting an abstract.  To these ends, $4,000 of the NSF grant was used to discount student registration to the general conference.  Anticipating 100 student registrants, we reduced the student registration by $40 per student (final student registrant tally was 74), in addition to not increasing registration from the previous year.  Another $1,000 of the NSF grant was used to discount registration for the short course so as to make it more affordable for students to attend.  The short course cost came out to be $60 per student attendee and there were 18 students that attended.  Finally, $2,000 of the NSF grant was used to support travel grants for students to attend the conference, including two recipients of the Best Student Paper award.  In addition to the student support, we placed strong emphasis on increasing the diversity of plenary and invited speakers at the 74th DRC.  Using the final $3,000 of the NSF grant, we supported the conference registration and travel for a female plenary speaker (Michal Lipson, Cornell Univ).  Professor Lipson?s involvement was a highlight of the DRC meeting.         1 http://www.deviceresearchconference.org         Last Modified: 12/21/2016       Submitted by: J.
