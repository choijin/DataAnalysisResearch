<AbstractNarration>This award supports a NSF workshop focused on identifying undergraduate research in advanced manufacturing that would support the aerospace industry. The workshop is held in Dallas, Texas due to the proximity of aerospace manufacturers, service providers, and manufacturing support companies.  Aircraft manufacturing is considered one of the technological backbones of the U.S. manufacturing base. As an industry, aerospace manufacturing directly supports high-skilled and relatively well-paid private sector manufacturing jobs worldwide and with industry-wide estimated sales of over $200 billion generally accounts for approximately 1.4 to 1.7% of U.S. gross domestic product (GDP). U.S. commercial (non-defense, non-space) aerospace manufacturing industry has major trends affecting the future of the industry. Manufacturing of aerospace composites and materials has currently reached a plateau where performance is high but component costs have not been reduced.  The origins of using advanced manufacturing such as additive manufacturing for composite development has provided an unprecedented opportunity to promote manufacturing resurgence. This is essential to the reduction of aerospace value chain production costs, increased aircraft throughput (time to market), and improved sustainability to the environment (reduce carbon footprint and minimize lifetime cycle costs).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop will last 2.5 days, and will include 15 leaders and up to 100 participants from industry, government and academe to characterize the current state of the art, and summarize future needs in four domains, including: advanced sensing and control; visualization, informatics and digital manufacturing; advanced materials manufacturing, and; environmental and sustainability.  This workshop will work to achieve the following five objectives that collectively lead to the identification of specific research and education needs, as well as the initiation of a national roadmap towards addressing the needs:  (1) Examine and review cutting edge research in manufacturing process technologies, automation methods and equipment, and systems-level research taking place in industry, (2) Assess future prospects and outlook, including the growth in the use and the demand for advanced machinery and processes, (3) Gather the aerospace industry's perspective of the short-term (1-3 year ahead) and long-term (3-10 years ahead) research issues, (4) Identify and formulate specific needs, gaps and challenges, in the aerospace value stream, (5) Formulate recommendations for research and education programs, including follow-up workshops as needed, to advance manufacturing technologies and systems for the aerospace industry.</AbstractNarration>

The University of Texas at Arlington Department of Industrial, Manufacturing, and Systems Engineering and Tarleton State University Department of Engineering Technology organized the workshop.  The University of Texas at Arlington Research Institute (UTARI), Tech-Labs Inc., The Dallas Chamber of Commerce, and the Texas Research Alliance also provided support.  The workshop objectives were to:  Examine and review cutting edge research in manufacturing process technologies, automation methods and equipment, and systems-level research taking place in industry Assess future prospects and outlook, including the growth in the use and the demand for advanced machinery and processes Gather the aerospace industry?s perspective of the short-term (1-3 years ahead) and long-term (3-10 years ahead) research issues Identify and formulate specific needs, gaps and challenges in the aerospace value stream Formulate recommendations for research and education programs, including follow-up workshops as needed, to advance manufacturing technologies and systems for the aerospace industry.     The workshop included seven keynote speakers, twenty-six panel members and a total of eighty participants from industry, government, and academia.  The panel discussions included: Advanced sensing, control and platforms for manufacturing; Visualization, informatics and digital manufacturing technologies; Advanced materials manufacturing, and; Environmental and sustainability in advanced manufacturing.  A special set of presentations was also given on 3D printing.   A strong manufacturing base is critical to grow the economy.  Significant positive impacts were noted when advanced manufacturing technologies were integrated and used effectively. There were also barriers noted that needed to be overcome before the full potential of these technologies could be realized.  In particular, attention needed to be put on the effective integration of technologies to improve cost recovery of new investments and better use of data acquisition, modeling, and analysis to better justify and utilize these technologies. Other discussions included topics such as an increased attention to environmental sustainability, scalability, and time to market. Workforce development was seen as a major impediment to faster integration of advanced manufacturing technology in industry.
