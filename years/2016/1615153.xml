<AbstractNarration>This award will support three important experiments in neutron beta decay, a process in which a neutron decays because of the weak nuclear force (or weak interaction) into a proton, an electron and an anti-neutrino.  The weak nuclear force is important because it powers our sun and helps determine the abundance of elements in the universe.  Neutron decay in particular is important because it plays a key role in the formation of helium in the early universe.  Additionally, neutron decay involves only a single nucleon and that makes it possible to calculate very precise predictions from the Standard Model of fundamental particles and interactions without complications from other nucleons.  With very accurate measurements of neutron decay, we can perform a kind of particle physics forensics, looking for discrepancies in the Standard Model that can indicate the presence of new forces but without using high energy particle beams.  This research is a part of the "precision frontier" for physics, and defines the cutting edge of our knowledge of the weak nuclear force and possible new interactions.&lt;br/&gt;An important aspect of this research is the training of students and post-docs.  This contributes to the spreading of technical methods and expertise.   This training comes from the specific nature of the projects, which use nuclear physics analysis and technology, and from the many opportunities students have to perform research at our national laboratories and nuclear facilities. Some of the techniques used have real-world applications in energy generation and medical imaging.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;One of the experiments supported by this award, Nab, will use an unpolarized beam of cold neutrons at the Spallation Neutron Source from the Oak Ridge National Laboratory to measure the angular correlation between the decay electron and the neutrino, with the goal of improving the precision of this correlation by over an order of magnitude improvement.  The other two experiments, UCNA and UCNtau, are situated at the ultracold neutron (UCN) source at Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL). The UCNA experiment measures the angular correlation between the neutron spin and the decay electron momentum (called the beta-asymmetry), and aims for a factor of 3 improvement over the precision of the global data set for the axial form factor. UCNtau is designed to measure the lifetime of the neutron, with the goal of a 1 second uncertainty during the proposal period.  These programs will impact: (1) knowledge of the axial form factor at the level required for a the establishment of the CKM matrix element Vud from the neutron at the same level as the super-allowed decays, (2) knowledge of the neutron lifetime at a level such that it will not limit tests of cosmological 4He abundance models for some time, and (3) limits on tensor couplings at or above the level expected from CERN.  For each of these experiments, the group brings its experience in beta decay measurements to bear on key sources of systematic error by developing instrumentation and analysis required by the experiments.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The primary goal of this project was to provide high precision measurements of the decay of free neutrons, a process caused by the weak nuclear force.  In neutron decay, the neutron transforms into a proton, with an electron and an antineutrino emitted as well.  This process powers the sun, determined elemental abundances during the big bang, and govens the radioactive decay of many isotopes in our environment.  Because the neutron decay involves a single nucleon, the theoretical model for this decay, based on the very successful standard model of particle physics, is more simple than that required for isotopes with many nucleons, making it an ideal target for high precision measurements. Since beta decay provides us with our most accurate data on the charged weak interaction, it provides our definitive understanding of this process in the standard model.  This is one of the essential goals of our experimental program: provide the most reliable and precise characterization of the charged weak interaction. For the case of neutron decay, this requires two measurements to determine both the vector and axial-vector coupling constants of the standard model.  Using  lifetime and angular correlation data together, consistency tests are possible that probe for new physics, and when the measurements are sensitive enough, these experiments can compete directly with particle physics at the highest energy collider experiments, such as the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN.  One of the most sensitive BSM tests, the CKM unitarity test, is of particular interest because of recent theoretical progress, both increasing the potential "reach" for beta decay for new physics and also suggesting that there may already be an issue with unitarity at roughly the two sigma level.  We report on a measurement of the neutron lifetime,UCNtau and two angular correlation measurements, UCNA and Nab.  Both UCNA and UCNtau use ultracold neutrons (UCNs) to measure neutron decay.  Ultracold neutrons have effective temperatures below about 4 mK and can be stored in material and magnetic bottles.  A strong magnetic field can be used to effectively 100% polarize UCNs which can then be used for decay experiments.  UCNA used polarized UCN to measure the angular correlation between the initial neutron polarization and the direction of the decay electron.  UCNA was the first experiment to use UCN to measure an angular correlation in beta decay, and was brought to conclusion during this project period, where this angular correlation was measured to be -0.12054(76). This resulted in an axial coupling constant value of -1.2772(20) when taken together with previous UCNA results, with a relative precision of 0.16%.  UCNA provided what is still the most precise cross-check of current cold neutron beams experiments, with UCNA's sensitivity comparable to that from the LHC.  UCNtau trapped the polarized UCN in a bowl-shaped array of magnets, call a Halbach array, using magnetic repulsion to trap the weak-field seeking spin state, and using gravity to keep UCN from escaping out of the top of the trap.  UCN are loaded into the array, cleaned to remove UCN with high energies which can escape from the trap, then stored for either a short or long storage time. The surviving neutrons were counted, and the ratio used to determine the lifetime.  This approach constitutes a breakthrough for the field, in that the systematic corrections are for the first time, assessed below the current level of statistical uncertainty, paving the way for precision levels below 0.3 s and more reliable values for the neutron coupling constants.  The lifetime determined from this measurement was 877.7(8) seconds.  The Nab experiment will utilize an optimized magnetic spectrometer to measure the angular correlation between the emitted neutrino and the recoiling proton (called the beta-neutrino asymmetry) through time of flight measurements of the neutron, with higher precision than all experiments to date. Nab is sited at the Spallation Neutron Source at Oak Ridge National Laboratory and  was under construction during this project.

These experiments have broader impact for particle physics and cosmology, with constraints on neutron decay to dark particles also produced by UCNA and UCNtau.  These experiments have also provided in-depth training for students and post-docs to enter academia, national laboratory positions, and industry.   In particular, we support the growing community of neutron scientists, both in fundamental physics, in the neutron scattering community, and in other aspects of neutron production and nuclear energy generation through our program.
