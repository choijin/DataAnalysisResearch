<AbstractNarration>The National Academies' Board on Mathematical Sciences and their Applications (BMSA) provides a broad interface between the research enterprise and federal agencies that rely on the mathematical sciences. It plays a unique role of advising the federal government and policy community how to make best use of the mathematical sciences. Over its 32 years of existence, the BMSA has produced 78 reports. Through its work, the Board strengthens the policy making process; increases the visibility of, and appreciation for, the mathematical sciences; and identifies growth areas for the discipline.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Board provides objective and authoritative advice on how best to apply the tools of mathematics, statistics, operations research, financial engineering, simulation science, analytics, risk analysis, systems engineering, and decision analysis to practical problems of national importance. It consists of 19 pro bono experts from a broad range of quantitative fields with experience in academia, industry, government, and national laboratories. Five BMSA members are members of the National Academy of Sciences and three of the National Academy of Engineering; all are recognized leaders in their fields. Board members carry out their work by identifying important steps of value to federal agencies and the mathematical sciences, and then recruiting leading mathematical scientists to participate in workshops, studies, and other activities focused on the technical challenges of federal decision-makers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Project Outcomes Report for the General Public   Award #1643066 SUPPORT FOR THE  BOARD ON MATHEMATICAL SCIENCES AND ANALYTICS  Period of Performance: 09/1/2016&ndash;08/31/2017     The Board on Mathematical Sciences and Analytics (BMSA) of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine provides expert advice relating to mathematical sciences to federal agencies. That advice helps to guide federal investments and to incorporate mathematical insight into public policy. BMSA also informs the greater mathematical sciences communities of emerging national challenges.  The subject award supported one meeting of BMSA as well as preparations for this meeting and follow-through from this and previous meetings. BMSA?s meetings provide opportunities to build interfaces between the mathematical sciences communities and a wide variety of federal agencies, some of which have little involvement with the mathematical sciences communities and may not recognize the mathematical nature of their problems. This award also provided support for the continuity and "presence" of BMSA within the science policy community and the National Academies, resulting in more mathematical scientists getting involved in the science policy activities of the National Academies.  During this performance period, BMSA initiated the following activities, all of which were funded separately:  A workshop on frontiers of big data, modeling, and simulation in urban sustainability; and A planning meeting for possible follow-on efforts in predictive analytics for human service applications and education.      BMSA also oversaw the following activities, all of which were funded separately:  BMSA?s standing Committee on Applied and Theoretical Statistics, A roundtable on data science postsecondary education, A study on strengthening data science methods for Department of Defense personnel and readiness missions,  A study on envisioning the data science discipline from an undergraduate perspective, and A series of meetings on financial risk analysis and model validation.      The studies each resulted in a published report, and each roundtable meeting is recorded, publicly webcast, and documented in a brief roundtable highlights.
