<AbstractNarration>Oak Ridge Associated Universities, Inc. (ORAU) requests National Science Foundation (NSF) support for selection and attendance of US graduate students and postdoctoral researchers to attend the Heidelberg Laureate Forum (HLF) in 2016. The Heidelberg Laureate Forum takes place annually in Heidelberg, Germany, and brings 200 young researchers in the computer and mathematical sciences together from all over the world with a group of typically 30 laureates of the Abel Prize, Fields Medal, Turing Award, and Nevanlinna Prize, and is patterned after the Lindau Meeting of Nobel Laureates in the physical sciences. The ORAU has formalized a partnership with the HLF to organize a U.S. delegation for participation in the meetings. This proposal requests support for a total of 9 graduate students and postdoctoral researchers in computer science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ORAU proposes to support this program by promoting and advertising the opportunity; recruiting from and selecting a diverse pool of applicants; developing and maintaining a program Web site for recruiting, selecting, information and dissemination; coordinating travel and orientation activities for participants, and conducting a follow-up survey to document the program's impact.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This award funded nine PhD students to attend the Heidelberg Laureate Forum (HLF) held in Heidelberg, Germany from September 18 to September 23, 2016.  This delegation of the future American computer scientists was enabled with the opportunity to interact with Laureates of prestigious computer science and mathematics awards - namely the Abel Prize, Fields Medal, Nevanlinna Prize, and the A.M. Turing Award - and with other high caliber graduate students from around the world.  HLF provided opportunities to form new research collaboration with Laureates and other students.  Participants gained a valuable global perspective on computer science that prepares them for leadership in the global community.  As one supported student noted, "Aside from motivating my current research efforts, the talks and discussions at the events have given me ideas of topics to pursue after my PhD."  The philosophy of the HLF is rooted in the words of the late Dr. Klaus Tschira, forum founder. He wrote: "Mathematics and computer science pervade all aspects and spheres of life.  They provide the foundation for today's highly engineered and modern society, and they belong to our culture.  Their social relevance will continue to grow."  In that spirit, the meeting connects these young researchers to collaborate and further the discipline as they mature professionally and to bridge the gap between the generations of computer science research.  One student conveyed success by reporting that "HLF provides a unique opportunity to think beyond one's current research; think of the big picture and the major unsolved problems of computer science and mathematics in general."  The HLF gave participants an opportunity for interaction that is typically not available within their normal university environment, whereby Laureates provided formal plenary lectures and led small group discussions with topics driven by a combination of prepared presentations as well as student questions.  The Laureates presented on a broad selection of topics related to computer science. For example, Turing Award winner Leslie Lamport (2014) gave a compelling lecture advocating the use of mathematics in the description of computer systems to aid in their construction and anaylsis.  One American student noted that "Due to the theme of the integrating mathematics with computing, I found Leslie Lamport's talk to be very promising.  By combining programming with mathematical annotations, his work opens new opportunities for collaboration and dialogue between both disciplines."  Another student noted the applicability of the presentation by Robert Tarjan (Turing Award, 1986) on "Binary Search Tree."  The student stated that "binary trees is such a classical and fundamental computer science topic that I did not think that any non-triival contribution could be made.  Before the talk I did not think any significant non-incremental discoveries could still be made on such a topic.  After the talk, I can now say that I was wrong.  The talk made me realize that revisiting old and established topics and problems is definitely not a waste of time!"  Based on feedback collected, the supported students overwhelmingly reported that this was an invaluable experience.  The general consensus found in the participants' feedback included having the opporunity to speak with Laureates about their research, receiving inspiration and ideas, and a sense that the experience was a unique and positive opportunity that every PhD student would value.
