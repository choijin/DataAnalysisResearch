<AbstractNarration>The award supports research in the field of algebraic geometry, the discipline devoted to the study of polynomial or algebraic equations. Algebraic equations are both beautiful and ubiquitous, as they describe many natural phenomena, from the motion of planets to the shape of leaves and flowers, to the behavior of microscopic particles. The goal of this research project is to study the deeper properties of the solutions to more complicated algebraic equations (called algebraic maps). The investigator plans to continue long-term investigation of the topology, Hodge theory, and cycle theory of algebraic maps. The close connection between the two main threads of the research, namely the discovery of new and deep aspects of the general theory and the study of fundamental examples, are the motivating principle behind the work. It is anticipated that the results will be of use to mathematicians (in algebraic geometry, combinatorics, and representation theory) and to mathematical physicists (in string theory). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigator will explore the fundamental aspects of the general theory as well as important examples through three projects: to determine the supports of Hitchin fibrations and to establish and explain certain remarkable hidden symmetries on the cohomology of the moduli spaces of Higgs bundles; to identify and study classes of maps for which the decomposition theorem holds over a finite field; and to establish a relation between birational maps and arc spaces by linking the supports in the decomposition theorem with special subvarieties of arcs.</AbstractNarration>

Another major theme is the study of holomorphic Lagrangian fibrations via the introduction of techniques coming from the decomposition theorem which are new and powerful in this context.   Broader impacts.The PI has:  -- co-organized a Summer School for Graduate students on Algebraic Groups at the Simons Center in Stony Brook; -- authored by invitation an essay on the Notices of the AMS on advice for Early Career Mathematicians;   --advised three Ph.D. students.
