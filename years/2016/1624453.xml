<AbstractNarration>Little Cayman is one of the least developed tropical islands in the Caribbean, yet it provides a unique opportunity for research because of the facilities developed by the Central Caribbean Marine Institute (CCMI) in 2005. CCMI's Little Cayman Research Centre (LCRC) provides an ideal facility where the reefs are under minimal local anthropogenic stress and are far removed from continental influences. Due to low population density and well-established marine protected areas, Little Cayman provides the rare opportunity to separate anthropogenic from environmental effects on coral reefs and their inhabitants. LCRC provides the laboratories, classroom, accommodations, vehicles, boats, and oceanographic instrumentation for scientists to conduct this vital research. Research at LCRC has led to major breakthroughs including the discovery of new marine invertebrates, improved understanding of low light reefs, advanced paleoclimatic reconstructions, a new physical oceanographic model for diurnal heating of shallow seas, and simulated ocean pH for 2100 to evaluate interactions between ocean acidification and calcification. This work is transforming knowledge and understanding of fundamental oceanographic processes and of mechanisms that drive coral reef stress and resilience. The facilities improvements shall further advance discovery and scientific understanding while promoting teaching, training, and learning through programs held at LCRC: K-12 Marine Ecology and undergraduate courses, the Little Cayman Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU), the Earthwatch Institute, and a new Dive with Heroes program for disabled US military veterans.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The increasing number of new partnerships with leading academics and institutions highlight the importance of LCRC to the wider community and are resulting in more visiting scientists. This proposal seeks to meet the growing needs of the visiting scientists and students at LCRC by i) renovating the main building to double on-site accommodations intended for visiting scientists and graduate students, (ii) modifying and updating common areas (dining room, bathhouse) to support the increase in occupancy during its research and education programs, and (iii) upgrading to hurricane-rated windows and doors in order to reduce the chances of weather adversely affecting the research projects and to improve the safety of both people and equipment. The field station renovations in this proposal will allow the programs at LCRC to run more efficiently and simultaneously due to the increased capacity and capabilities. The programs conducted at LCRC shall continue to be broadly disseminated though peer-reviewed scientific publications, scientific conferences, a monthly news channel segment, newspaper and magazine articles, weekly lecture series, and social media network updates.

Therefore, the success of the improvements includes an increase in the capabilities of the facility with a full integration of science and education. The renovations also improved the overall logistics for scientists to be on site to monitor experiments and mentor students. &nbsp;Common area improvements add back time to field, lab, and class daily schedules by streamlining meal service and increasing the dining areas. The project is also demonstrating that sustainable alternatives including passive and photo-voltaic solar systems included in the off-the-grid bath house can comfortably replace conventional, resource-inefficient facilities.&nbsp;</p> <p>CCMI project had the following outcomes:</p> <ol> <li>Created additional on-site private accommodations for scientists and graduate students by renovating a roughly 330 square foot attic space in the main building to create a third floor with two private bedrooms/work areas.</li> <li>Expanded common areas including the dining/kitchen pavilion to increase food service by installing a new fridge freezer system, changing out kitchen equipment, and doubling the seating capacity in the dining area to match the residential capacity. The primary outcome is improved efficiency so that meals could be served in one seating.&nbsp; Food service backups were a bottleneck to productivity but with the additional room, service has been streamlined.</li> <li>Made safety upgrades to reduce the chances of weather adversely affecting the research projects and education programs with (39) new hurricane rated windows and doors.&nbsp;</li> <li>Achieved a threefold increase in passive solar systems for heating water at the off-the-grid bath house for the increased number of daily showers; The outcome is that higher capacity and more activity requires more hot water.&nbsp; However, the usage does not require increased (on the grid) power making the facility more sustainable.</li> <li>Remodeled the bath house to improve efficiencies.</li> </ol> <p>Broader impacts include creating space so that students and early career scientists can interface with working scientists and better understand the scientific process. Increased efficiencies lower the carbon footprint, reduce costs and improve sustainability of a facility where US students, interns and scientists are studying and working to find solutions to major issues facing the ocean and impacting humanity. &nbsp;The improvements are successful examples for K-12 students, graduate students, research interns, community members, and island visitors to learn about sustainability.</p> <p>By mid-2017, the facility was working at capacity with the new accommodations and expansions in full service. &nbsp;The following research activities and programs have already benefited from the improvements made possible by this grant:</p> <ol> <li>During January and February, a research collaboration between CCMI, Scripps, Oregon State, the Cayman Islands Department of Environment and graduate students that required 24 hour experiments to estimate the survival of larval-stage grouper species under future climate scenarios was possible.&nbsp; One PhD thesis and 2 publications are in progress.</li> <li>In January, thirteen research interns took part in a 2-week CCMI program alongside a visiting group of 8 undergraduate students from Cedar Crest College, a non-research institution. </li> <li>In February and early March, 17 Dartmouth College students, who have used the facility since opening to the public in 2006, were in residence interacting with the ongoing research.</li> <li>A new collaboration was established with the Chairman of the Department of Geology, University of Texas- Austin, Dr. Charlie Kerans, CCMI REU intern/alumni, Scarlette Hsia, and FSML PI Carrie Manfrino.

Common area improvements add back time to field, lab, and class daily schedules by streamlining meal service and increasing the dining areas. The project is also demonstrating that sustainable alternatives including passive and photo-voltaic solar systems included in the off-the-grid bath house can comfortably replace conventional, resource-inefficient facilities.   CCMI project had the following outcomes:  Created additional on-site private accommodations for scientists and graduate students by renovating a roughly 330 square foot attic space in the main building to create a third floor with two private bedrooms/work areas. Expanded common areas including the dining/kitchen pavilion to increase food service by installing a new fridge freezer system, changing out kitchen equipment, and doubling the seating capacity in the dining area to match the residential capacity. The primary outcome is improved efficiency so that meals could be served in one seating.  Food service backups were a bottleneck to productivity but with the additional room, service has been streamlined. Made safety upgrades to reduce the chances of weather adversely affecting the research projects and education programs with (39) new hurricane rated windows and doors.  Achieved a threefold increase in passive solar systems for heating water at the off-the-grid bath house for the increased number of daily showers; The outcome is that higher capacity and more activity requires more hot water.  However, the usage does not require increased (on the grid) power making the facility more sustainable. Remodeled the bath house to improve efficiencies.   Broader impacts include creating space so that students and early career scientists can interface with working scientists and better understand the scientific process. Increased efficiencies lower the carbon footprint, reduce costs and improve sustainability of a facility where US students, interns and scientists are studying and working to find solutions to major issues facing the ocean and impacting humanity.  The improvements are successful examples for K-12 students, graduate students, research interns, community members, and island visitors to learn about sustainability.  By mid-2017, the facility was working at capacity with the new accommodations and expansions in full service.  The following research activities and programs have already benefited from the improvements made possible by this grant:  During January and February, a research collaboration between CCMI, Scripps, Oregon State, the Cayman Islands Department of Environment and graduate students that required 24 hour experiments to estimate the survival of larval-stage grouper species under future climate scenarios was possible.  One PhD thesis and 2 publications are in progress. In January, thirteen research interns took part in a 2-week CCMI program alongside a visiting group of 8 undergraduate students from Cedar Crest College, a non-research institution.  In February and early March, 17 Dartmouth College students, who have used the facility since opening to the public in 2006, were in residence interacting with the ongoing research. A new collaboration was established with the Chairman of the Department of Geology, University of Texas- Austin, Dr. Charlie Kerans, CCMI REU intern/alumni, Scarlette Hsia, and FSML PI Carrie Manfrino. They are developing the first comprehensive geologic map and stratigraphic framework for the island.  The University of Florida's Director of the School of Natural resources, Dr. Tom Frazer has two graduate students, including on International Fulbright Scholar, conducting new research that is leading to 2 MSc theses. Two additional interns were in residence fully using the new accommodations.     The activities described above and the broader impacts demonstrate the need for the improvements and success of this NSF FSML grant to the Central Caribbean Marine Institute.
