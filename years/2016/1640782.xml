<AbstractNarration>Gases are important raw materials for a large number of chemical transformations/productions, and are used as routine energy resources for both industrial enterprise and our diary life. Because of their unique state, special handling and transportation are necessary for their routine usage. Gas cylinders, typically under high pressures, are essential for gas storage. Although the gases are compressed under high pressure into the gas cylinders, the gas storage capacity by such traditional methods are typically not high. Furthermore, the high pressure might also have some safety concerns. Materials with higher gas storage capabilities can not only increase the gas storage amount within fixed cylinder spaces, but also reduce the storage pressure for gas storage and, thus, improve safety concerns. This project explores the market potential of porous metal-organic framework (MOF) materials for industrial gas storage and separation, particularly methane and acetylene storage, and separation of acetylene/ethylene. Through the implementation of new materials for the high capacity storage of natural gas and acetylene for the future vehicles, it reduces the United States' heavy dependence on the gasoline energy resource and diminishes the environmental side effect of carbon dioxide emission from the combustion of high carbon hydrocarbons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Porous MOF materials are very promising adsorbents which can be filled into gas cylinders to significantly enhance the gas storage capacities. The tunable pores and functional sites within porous MOFs have also enabled these porous materials to be very useful for gas separations.  This team will conduct customer discovery during the 7-week I-Corps program to assess the industrial customers' real needs in terms of gas storage and separation, and the target market size. Following completion of the I-Corps curriculum, the team will decide whether or not to establish a start-up company and to continue its commercialization efforts through SBIR and/or STTR funding.</AbstractNarration>
