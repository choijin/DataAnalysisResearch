<AbstractNarration>1604491&lt;br/&gt;PI: Rankin, Stephen E. &lt;br/&gt;Title: Tailoring the Ionic Liquid Environment in Nanopores for Green Reaction Engineering&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ionic liquids (ILs) are salts with a low melting temperature such that they can be used as solvents at or near room temperature. ILs are considered green solvents because of their low volatility, but also have unique and tunable properties that allow them to be used in applications where few alternatives are available, such as the solubilization and catalytic conversion of lignocellulosic biomass to commodity chemicals.  Recently, molecular and nanometer-scale structural and dynamic features of ILs have been identified that indicate coexisting domains of both charge and polarity, which may explain why they are able to dissolve amphiphilic polymers, such as cellulose and lignin. Introducing a surface leads to density and charge layering at the interface giving rise to oscillatory surface forces and the ability to precisely tune surface properties.  The proposed work focuses on tuning these surface properties for ILs in contact with metal complexes confined in nanopores to provide a local environment for high catalytic performance and stability.  Nanoporous supports provide control in localizing a catalyst, creating a distinct environment for tuning reactivity and controlling the partitioning of substrates, reactants and products. This project will translate the unique local solvent and layered electronic properties of confined ILs to heterogeneous catalysis, addressing the major limitations of the commercial applications of ILs. The relationship between the solvent environment in the confined pore and the corresponding catalytic activity will be applied to challenging aqueous-based catalysis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The dehydration of D-glucose to 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) will be used as a model reaction. The following tasks are proposed: (1) Construction, characterization and control the local environment of ionic liquids and tethered imidazolium-based ionic liquids in nanoscale pores as a function of pore size. Surfactant templated silica thin films with oriented, tunable nanopores (2-20 nm) will serve as the platform for characterization of the local environment and subsequent catalysis in ionic liquids. (2) Design of IL/metal ligands and their corresponding silanes to translate homogeneous catalysis in ILs to effective, stable heterogeneous catalysts in nanoscale pores. The dehydration of glucose to HMF using non-toxic aluminum-based catalysts will be investigated, with a goal of improving its catalytic performance to make it a viable alternative to traditional toxic catalysts. (3) Demonstration of the catalysis of glucose to HMF from the aqueous phase and development of a confined IL pore environment that minimizes catalyst deactivation and leaching due to water uptake.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research project has the potential to generate innovative green/sustainable chemistry and engineering technologies for a broad range of applications in catalysis, energy storage, photovoltaics, gas separations, and carbon dioxide capture.  Multi-faceted plans to develop a video-based communication program (video-CATS) are included, which will train students on how to communicate science for the benefit of society to a diverse audience.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The objective of this project was to better understand how nontraditional solvents called ionic liquids behave when confined in very small pores, such as in the ordered nanoporous thin film shown in Image 1.   Ionic liquids (ILs) are salts composed of pairs of oppositely charged molecules where at least one of the components is a bulky hydrocarbon.  The large size of the molecules makes it difficult for them to crystallize into solids, so these ionic (charged) substances are liquids at or near room temperature.  They have the unique ability to selectively dissolve substances such as cellulose (paper) that are otherwise insoluble.  Their tunable solvation properties allow ILs to be used for catalytic upgrading of sustainable plant-based feedstocks to displace petroleum-derived chemicals.  This project has advanced our understanding of how ILs behave when loaded into materials with nanometer-sized pores, to allow reactions and separations to be done with only small amounts of these unique solvents.  Intellectual Merit. For this project, catalysts were designed using aluminum as an inexpensive, abundant active metal to drive the conversion of glucose (a common sugar) to hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF), a valuable chemical intermediate formed by loss of water from 6-carbon sugars (dehydration).  Surprisingly, our results showed that the aluminum catalyst is only needed to convert glucose to another closely related sugar, fructose.  The IL itself then catalyzed the dehydration of fructose to form HMF.  The catalytic results also showed that one of the most significant challenges is not catalyzing the dehydration reaction, but preventing further reactions that give unusable byproducts.  When ILs are confined in nanometer-scale pores, only a finite number of molecules can fit within the pore.  For example, we have created films with 2.5 nm diameter pores, which can only accommodate 4 layers of IL pairs across their width.  This was found to cause major changes in the properties of the ILs when confined in these pores.  For example, Image 2 shows how the infrared spectra of an IL confined in a silica film with 8 nm pores responds to changes in relative humidity (RH).  As RH increases, more water in the vapor is taken up by the IL in the film, and the increase in height of the large peak on the left comes from that water.  We can use the peak intensity to quantify how much water is in the film.  By itself, the IL takes up a lot of water ? as much as 90% by 85% relative humidity.  However, when the same IL is confined in pores, it takes up about 1/3 less water, making it resistant to negative effects of water on catalysts.  More spectroscopic studies have shown that the IL layers with its positively charged molecules next to the silica pores, and then alternating layers of negative and positive charge.  This changes how the IL takes up water, but also other properties such as how the IL crystallizes, and how quickly molecules can move through the pore.  For example, the team discovered that one IL that is a liquid at freezing temperatures (12 ?F) forms crystal that will not melt even at 125 ?F when confined in 8 nm pores.  Other ILs were found to melt more easily in pores because of how they interact with the pore wall.  Differences observed in how quickly molecules move through the pores allow us to design new materials for separations ? for example membranes that have shown as much as 20 times faster diffusion of hydrophobic (oil-loving) molecules compared to hydrophilic (water-loving) molecules when they are confined, paving the way for new separations and reaction processes for green chemistry.  Broader Impacts. In addition to the technical outcomes, the project provided professional development opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students, and outreach to high school students.  Two Ph.D. students (one in Chemical Engineering and one in Chemistry) were completed their dissertations based on the research in this project, and one M.S. student in Chemical Engineering.  In addition, the project provided support for 4 Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) interns and additional undergraduate students to conduct multidisciplinary research directed at understanding the synthesis and applications of advanced nanoscale porous materials for separations, catalysis, and sustainable chemical manufacturing.  The project also provided opportunities for outreach about producing plant-based chemicals at Engineering Day (E-day) and American Chemical Society events at the University of Kentucky.  A new Women in Engineering Workshop was developed by one of the team members (Dr. Knutson) and used to introduce over 50 female high school students to the use of porous adsorbent materials for water treatment and remediation (Image 3) and the synthesis of membranes for water desalination.  The workshop included discussion of sustainability issues and the roles of engineers in addressing environmental and ecological challenges.
