<AbstractNarration>Atoms of oxygen, carbon, nitrogen, hydrogen and sulfur naturally occur in multiple stable states know as stable isotopes. The atom?s nucleus may have differing numbers of neutrons that result in these stable states. Scientists have been able to use these different isotopic forms of atoms to study biological, chemical and physical processes in the environment. Stable isotopes are routinely used for animal and plant physiology, community and ecosystem ecology, biomedicine, paleo-biology, evolution, and climatology. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Given the broad diversity of questions that can be answered with stable isotopes, coupled with advancements in instrumentation that yield extremely high throughput on a single mass spectrometer, isotope datasets now represent "big data" that can (and should) be mined repeatedly, just as genomic data are routinely accessed. Unfortunately, a centralized database tied to Darwin Core Standards through museum specimens does not yet exist for stable isotope data. The use of stable isotopes in the natural sciences is no longer limited by data acquisition, but rather data exchange, availability and integration with other large databases (e.g., GIS, GenBank). Such inefficiencies have led to unnecessary duplication of effort, redundancy in data and generally stymied progress as researchers spend more time generating pilot isotope data, rather than testing biological hypotheses and research ideas. This workshop will focus on the development of the first centralized, online, broadly accessible database for stable isotope data - an IsoBank.</AbstractNarration>
