<AbstractNarration>This award will provide participant support for graduate and undergraduate students to participate in one of the world's leading annual conferences on plasma science and engineering, the 43nd IEEE International Conference on Plasma Science (ICOPS), to be held in Banff, Alberta, Canada on June 19-23, 2016. This conference expects about 600 participants from around the world, including many of the leaders in plasma science and engineering research. There will be presentations in most of the major topics in plasma science and engineering, including basic plasma physics, computational plasma physics, as well as applications to accelerator science, geospace, radiation sources, inertial and magnetic confinement fusion, and plasma aided bio-medical and environmental research. In addition, to help enhance interactions among young professionals and potential employers, a new event "IEEE NPSS Young Professionals Symposium" will be organized as a part of the conference.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The award will be used to provide partial travel support for students to attend the conference. The students will be making presentations and participating in the symposium for young professionals. The recipients of the student travel stipends will be selected using a merit-based selection process led by the Student Travel Award Committee. This program will be an excellent opportunity for young scientists to interact with and to learn from the more experienced researchers in plasma science and engineering.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[Overview: ICOPS (International Conference on Plasma Science) is an internationally renowned, well-attended conference involving topics of direct interest to the National Science Foundation. The meeting is sponsored by the IEEE Nuclear and Plasma Sciences Society (NPSS). The Plasma Science and Applications Committee (PSAC) of the IEEE NPSS oversees the ICOPS conferences and their development and a PI is a member-at-large of PSAC ExCom as well as a member of International Organizing Committee of ICOPS 2016 responsible for the Student Travel Grant. NFS awarded 5K for the student travel support at ICOPS 2016. Intellectual Merit: Applications of plasma technologies are expanding in many new areas for fusion, materials processing, lighting, environmental protection, and medical research and treatment. All of these technologies depend on a strong underpinning of basic research traditionally supported by our meeting. Also such plasma frontiers as studying warm dense matter using the X-ray free electron lasers at SLAC are represented. The program of the 43rd ICOPS emphasizes both the traditional areas of plasma science and these new areas of growth through the plenary talks and the regular technical program. The Student Travel Grant Subcommittee of PSAC ExCom of the IEEE solicited candidates and selected student awardees to receive grants to cover partial costs of attendance at the ICOPS 2016 based on the scientific merit of the submitted abstracts. Six student presenters including a female student from various US universities were selected to receive travel grants from this award. The provided travel funding for these students gave them an excellent opportunity of attending the conference with a lot of experts in the field of plasma science and delivering very good presentations.   Broader Impacts: The student grants enhanced participation of the students in the conference and in the new event "IEEE NPSS Young Professionals Symposium" at ICOPS 2016 and hence increased partnerships between academia, national laboratories industry, and industry.
