<AbstractNarration>While the term 'failure' brings to mind negative associations, there is a current focus on failure as a driver of innovation and development in many professional fields. It is also emerging from prior research that for STEM professionals and educators, failure plays an important role in designing and making to increase learning, persistence and other noncognitive skills such as self-efficacy and independence. By investigating how youth and educators attend to moments of failure, how they interpret what this means, and how they respond, we will be better able to understand the dynamics of each part of the experience. The research team will be working with youth from urban, suburban and rural settings, students from Title I schools or who qualify for free/reduced-price lunches, those from racial and ethnic minority groups, as well as students who are learning English as a second language. These youth are from groups traditionally underrepresented in STEM and in making, and research indicates they are more likely to experience negative outcomes when they experience failure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this project centers on establishing a baseline understanding of how failure in making is triggered and experienced by youth, what role educators play in the process, and what can be done to increase persistence and learning, rather than failure being an end-state. The research team will investigate these issues through the use of qualitative and quantitative research methods. In particular, the team will design and evaluate the effectiveness of interventions on increasing the abilities of youth and educators in noticing and responding to failures and increasing positive (e.g., resilience) outcomes.  Research sites are selected because they will allow collection of data on youth from a wide range of backgrounds. The research team will also work to test and revise their hypothesized model of the influence of factors on persistence through failures in making. This project is a part of NSF's Maker Dear Colleague Letter (DCL) portfolio (NSF 15-086), a collaborative investment of Directorates for Computer &amp; Information Science &amp; Engineering (CISE), Education and Human Resources (EHR) and Engineering (ENG).</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  Makerspaces in schools, museums, libraries and out of school activities have grown rapidly in the past decade. These spaces are often guided by principles such as iteration, experimentation and/or invention - processes which inevitably include failure, trying again or exploring dead ends. We wondered what youth (aged 9-14) thought of the word failure when used related to maker education experiences, and if that definition was shared by educators. Additionally, our research team wanted a better understanding of how youth and educators attend, interpret and respond to failures during making in different learning contexts. Our main research questions were:    How do views and identification of failure from youth and educators align?   In what ways do the educational setting, pedagogical strategies and activity design promote persistence through failure?   For our research study, we used the following broad definition of failure: An experience where the result does not match the outcome expected by the maker or the maker’s interpretation of the outcomes expected by the designer of the activity/project.   Through observations of youth and educators in maker programs, using point-of-view video data, interviews and surveys, we came to understand the more about complexities of the idea of failure. On the whole, the concept of failure was not universally applied by learners and educators, across maker education learning spaces, or in the research literature. Our findings include:    Youth experienced failure in making differently and not entirely negatively.   Youth in this study were likely to use alternative terms such as mistake, error, adjustment, and inconvenience to describe when things didn’t work out when they were making. To many, failure implied finality - either not being able to try again, or not beginning in the first place.    Youth in our study were often resilient and expressed how failures throughout a process of making typically led to opportunities to learn from their errors and mistakes; to make improvements and to gain understanding of what works and does not work in particular situations. Failure was often viewed by youth as giving up on a project and/or yourself, or as not trying hard enough (i.e., effort), which was rarely observed in our study.   Youth showed that they typically did not view failures as detrimental or associate it with negative emotional states (Simpson et al., 2018; 2019). For some youth, this view transcended making contexts to other contexts such as academic settings and the arts.     Maker educators viewed youths’ moments of failure during making tasks as a critical juncture in helping them learn both about the content and about the nature of innovation, discovery and/or inquiry.   Maker educators acknowledged that youth’s experiences with failures are dependent on individual students; who they are and their previous experiences with failures in any context.   Maker educators often reported not using the word failure but similar words such as challenges, obstacles, and setbacks (Maltese et al., 2018).     Many maker educators already have many strategies for supporting youth to persist. These can be shared, adapted, and adopted by others. However, having no plan isn’t helpful. Strategies include:   talking about failure (or struggle, mistakes, challenges) before, during, and after making to help youth process the experience;   meeting questions with questions, putting the problem solving onus on the youth;    modeling how to respond when failures occur during making; and   providing struggling youth with a small set of possible solutions but not telling them which one is most likely to fix the problem.     For both educators and students, embracing open-endedness and iterations makes the potential for failure more "safe" (Anderson et al., 2019). Educators can assess how their materials, activity design and expectations will support learners to experience some struggle and problem solving throughout the experience. Those elements can be categories into four features:    Flexibility: the variety of possible endpoints within the activity   Scale: How big or small the failure is as it relates to the end goal   Finality: The ability to keep working on a project   Materiality: The availability, variety and features of materials        We hypothesize that if we can support youth to persist through failures by attending, interpreting and responding, there is a stronger chance for them to persist with the activity and develop resilience to setbacks and deeper interest in STEM. In future research, we would like to focus on the emotions that youth experience throughout the making process, as well as exploring effective professional development models for educators.
