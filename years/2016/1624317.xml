<AbstractNarration>This project explores how frontline workers identify and assist vulnerable, exploited, andtrafficked persons in the U.S. As anti-trafficking efforts and legislation increase, service providers increasingly face a growing client base that includes trafficked persons. The medical, legal, law enforcement, and social service sectors must disseminate services while also navigating competing understandings of human trafficking. In particular, human trafficking is frequently mobilized in binaries: victims or criminals, survivors or perpetrators, moral or immoral. This project seeks to understand how service providers use these frames -- specifically, concepts of "deserving" or "undeserving" trafficked persons -- to navigate their workloads and interact with their clients. While much scholarship has focused on both the importance of frontline workers and domestic human trafficking efforts, little has been done to bring these two fields together. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project links street-level bureaucracy theory to the study of human trafficking in Midwestern and rural communities, honing in on the role of frontline workers in anti-trafficking efforts. In order to address the unique perspectives of service providers, this project uses both surveys and semi-structured interviews. Surveys will provide the scope of how anti-trafficking efforts manifest, while semi-structured interviews provide a broader space for service providers? own narratives of their work.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>During the award period for &ldquo;How Frontline Work Identifies and Categorizes Human Trafficking,&rdquo; co-PI Corinne Schwarz conducted a mixed methods research project to understand how Midwestern service providers in the legal, law enforcement, non-profit, and social service sectors classified their anti-trafficking work and the client populations they served. In total, 722 frontline workers responded to a survey gauging the breadth of anti-trafficking efforts, and 54 participated in a more detailed semi-structured interview process. Data were deidentified and coded for major themes. In general, the survey data pointed to the presence of trafficking in the Midwest&mdash;which counters dominant stereotypes of trafficking being an exclusively coastal or urban phenomenon&mdash;and the common risk factors that sex and labor trafficking survivors may share.

They are bringing other criminal statutes and their own moral codes to their discretionary practices, which serve as a gatekeeping strategy between &ldquo;deserving&rdquo; survivors and &ldquo;undeserving&rdquo; criminal actors or people facing less extreme exploitation. This is not surprising, especially given the research on street-level bureaucrats. However, it can complicate service delivery for those persons who are not&nbsp;legally? trafficked but still face exploitation and have needs to be remedied, like assistance with visa applications or job searches. This finding points to the need for advocates and scholars to think about ways to make services more accessible beyond legally mandated definitions or qualifications. This could be where anti-trafficking coalitions or collectives could play a bigger role, because people can work together to strategize creative service delivery for their clients who might not quite fit one box.</p> <p>2) Midwestern communities, both urban and rural, need more shelter services. Many service providers described the challenges of finding stable housing for both trafficked clients and clients who were generally at risk of exploitation. People often had to resort to detention facilities in order to access secure housing, even if those individuals had not committed any crimes. This can be retraumatizing for clients, especially those who have negative histories with the law enforcement sector. Instead of continuing to rely on the short-term use of jail cells and juvenile detention centers, trafficking-specific housing resources and shelter staff trained to be affirming towards survivors must become a funding priority for anti-trafficking non-profits and government offices.</p> <p>3) Anti-trafficking work is emotionally demanding work.
