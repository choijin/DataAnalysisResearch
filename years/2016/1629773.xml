<AbstractNarration>This award is to fund the National Academy of Science dues for continued representation of the United States in the Scientific Committee on Solar-Terrestrial Physics (SCOSTEP) of the International Council for Science (ICSU) from May 1, 2016 - April 30, 2019. SCOSTEP's principal tasks are to promote, organize, and coordinate international interdisciplinary programs and symposia in solar-terrestrial physics (STP), and to define the data relating to these programs that should be exchanged through data centers. Through its programs, SCOSTEP advances scientific knowledge of solar terrestrial physics, supports a globally aware and engaged STP community, and promotes the development of early-career STP scientists. The U.S. continues to have a substantial scientific and leadership role in SCOSTEP, and the U.S. dues support these activities.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The National Academy of Sciences (NAS) serves the U.S. national member of the International Science Council (ISC)[1] and many of its scientific unions and organizations, including the Scientific Committee for Solar Terrestrial Physics (SCOSTEP).  Eight ISC organizations are involved in SCOSTEP:  -          Committee of Space Research (COSPAR)    -          International Association of Geomagnetism and Aeronomy (IAGA) [2]   -          International Association of Meteorology and Atmospheric Sciences (IAMAS) [3]  -          International Astronomical Union (IAU)  -          International Union of Pure and Applied Physics (IUPAP)   -          International Union of Geodesy and Geophysics (IUGG)  -          Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research (SCAR)  -          International Union of Radio Science (URSI)   SCOSTEP works with these organizations to organize and conduct international solar-terrestrial physics research programs of finite duration.  This grant provided the U.S. dues to SCOSTEP, and funded communication activities among the U.S. National Committees that correspond to the scientific unions participating in SCOSTEP.     SCENTIFIC MERIT  SCOSTEP?s scientific program for 2014-2018 was Variability of the Sun and Its Terrestrial Impact (VarSITI) that studied the causes and consequences of weak solar activity during cycle 24. It had four themes:  -          SEE:  Solar Evolution and Extrema, [U.S. co-leader Petrus Martens (Montana State University)];  -          ISEST:  International Study of Earth-Affecting Solar Transients, [U.S. co-leaders Jie Zhang (George Mason University) and Nat Gopalswamy (NASA/GSFC)];  -          SPeCIMEN:  Specification and Prediction of the Coupled Inner-Magnetospheric Environment, [U.S. co-leaders Jacob Bortnik (University of California, Los Angeles) and Shri Kanekal (NASA/GSFC)]; and  -          ROSMIC:  Role of the Sun and Middle atmosphere/Thermosphere/ionosphere In Climate.  Specific scientific questions addressed by VarSITI are highlighted on the attached slide.  VarSITI assembled 134 different solar-terrestrial databases, and organized or supported 64 meetings, some of which were in the United States.  Many VarSITI-related papers also were published with links on the VarSITI website (www.varsiti.org).    Following extensive international consultation in 2018 and 2019, a new scientific program, Predictability of the variable Solar&#8208;Terrestrial Coupling (PRESTO), was developed for 2020-2024 (https://www.bc.edu/content/dam/bc1/offices/ISR/SCOSTEP/Multimedia/other/PRESTO_ISSI-BJ13_June2019.pdf).  PRESTO?s goals are to "address the predictability of 1) space weather on timescales from seconds to days and months, including processes at the Sun, in the heliosphere and in the Earth?s magnetosphere, ionosphere and atmosphere, [and] 2) sub-seasonal to decadal and centennial variability of the Sun-Earth system, with a special focus on climate impacts and a link to the World Climate Research Program (WCRP) Grand Challenge Near-Term Climate Predictions as well as the IPCC."  Chaired by Ramon Edgardo Lopez (University of Texas at Arlington) and co-chaired by Jie Zhang (George Mason University), PRESTO has three pillars:  -    Sun, interplanetary space and geospace, co-led by Allison Jaynes (University of Iowa);  -    Space weather and the Earth?s atmosphere, co-led by Nick Pedatella (High Altitude Observatory, National Center for Atmospheric Research); and  -    Solar activity and its influence on the climate of the Earth System, co-led by Odele Coddington (Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics, University of Colorado Boulder).  U.S. scientists provide impressive leadership within SCOSTEP.  In addition to the individuals mentioned above, Nat Gopalswamy served as the SCOSTEP president from 2011-2019 and now serves as Past President.  Daniel Marsh (National Center for Atmospheric Research) and Patricia Doherty (Boston College) currently serve as SCOSTEP?s Vice President and Scientific Secretary respectively.   The NAS appointed Paulett C. Liewer (NASA/JPL) as the U.S. National Adherent Representative to SCOSTEP, and assists SCOSTEP by using its network of U.S. National Committees, its website (www.nas.edu/biso), and social media to disseminate information about SCOSTEP opportunities and programs. Updates on SCOSTEP activities are made to the BISO Board that consists of leaders of the U.S. National Committees and several U.S.-based union presidents.  BROADER IMPACT  SCOSTEP's work is important to society broadly.  Solar disturbances, such as solar flares, coronal mass ejections, and high-speed solar wind streams, are common causes of disturbances in the near-Earth environment that affect satellite systems and ground-based technology.  Severe geomagnetic storms affect satellites, interplanetary spacecraft, and ground power grids.  SCOSTEP?s scientific programs seek to advance quantitative understanding of the coupling mechanisms responsible for the transfer of mass and energy throughout the solar-terrestrial system. The practical goal is to improve predictability of the effects of the variable components of solar energy and disturbance on the terrestrial environment.  SCOSTEP also emphasizes education and capacity building.  Its programs include:  -          Comic books: SCOSTEP?s comic books serve as a major form of outreach and education to high school students.  Available in multiple languages, they are available online at http://scostep.apps01.yorku.ca/outreach/comics-and-informatin-for-children-and-students/comic-books/.  -          Visiting Scholar Program: This program provide training to young scientists and graduate students from developing countries in established laboratories in developed countries for one to three months.  Several U.S. institutions regularly host SCOSTEP Visiting Scholars.
