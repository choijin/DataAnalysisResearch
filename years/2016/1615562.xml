<AbstractNarration>Cells physiologic states are dictated by the collective behavior of thousands of molecular components and may vary dramatically depending on environmental factors, resulting in non-linear behaviors. Despite significant advances in systems and synthetic biology, protein function in cells remains hard to decipher due to the plasticity and adaptability of cellular regulatory and quality control mechanisms. The overarching goal of this project is to generate a platform technology to modulate the accumulation of target proteins in cells. This technology is expected to provide exquisite dynamic control over protein expression, thereby providing a tool to study protein function. A series of complementary strategies will be explored to achieve stimulus-dependent control over modulation of protein expression and to deploy this technology to study complex biological processes. As a result, this study is expected to promote progress of fundamental science , advance the bioeconomy, and enable advances in healthcare.  By providing broad reaching educational and training opportunities to students belonging to underrepresented groups, this project is also expected to support education and diversity and to benefit society. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To overcome the limitations of existing methods for regulating protein steady state levels, the research team built a platform for modulating protein expression post-translationally using a bifunctional system consisting of a molecular recognition unit for target specificity and selectivity, and a degradation-signaling unit that specifies the rate and mechanism of degradation of the target protein. The goal of the proposed research is to engineer this technology to generate a universal platform for controlling protein levels through exogenous or endogenous stimuli. To achieve this goal, three research objectives will be pursued: 1) engineer stimulus-responsive degradation of protein depletion, 2) enhance the dynamic resolution of stimulus-dependent circuits through controlled reporter depletion, and 3) decipher and manipulate the hypoxia signaling network. This research program will be leveraged to provide training, research, and mentoring opportunities for high school teachers and students from the Greater Houston area, and to improve teaching and learning for college students.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Cells physiologic states are dictated by the collective behavior of thousands of molecular components and may vary dramatically depending on environmental factors, resulting in non-linear behaviors. Despite significant advances in systems and synthetic biology, protein function in cells remains hard to decipher due to the plasticity and adaptability of cellular regulatory and quality control mechanisms.  Protein function has been traditionally investigated by monitoring the phenotypic changes associated with alteration in the protein’s levels. Proteins levels are typically altered by enhancing expression &ndash; a widely used approach that is inevitably associated with potential for gain-of-function phenotypes &ndash; or by reducing expression, which is commonly achieved via RNAi and, more recently, through genome editing approaches. Despite their widespread use and success, methods for genetic inactivation provide limited control over knockdown kinetics and are not compatible with targeting of post-translational modifications and conformational changes, which are often important determinants of protein function. Dynamic control over protein expression can be achieved using tools that operate over time scales faster than those for the process involved in reaching steady state levels of cellular proteins (i.e., transcription and translation). Small molecule-based protein inaction strategies, for instance, act at the post-translational level to induce a fast and dose-dependent response, but they are characterized by off target effects and target-dependent efficiency. Post-translational protein depletion through accelerated proteolysis presents exquisite control over the kinetics of knockdown. However, specificity is typically achieved through genetic manipulation of the target protein and often relies on mechanisms for degradation that are highly target-specific.  To overcome the limitations of existing methods for regulating protein steady state levels, the research team built a technology for modulating protein expression post-translationally using a bifunctional recognition system consisting of a nanobody, which is the smallest antigen-binding fragment and can be customized with respect to target specificity and selectivity fused to a degradation signaling unit, the degron, which can be customized with respect to rate and mechanism of degradation to mediate degradation of the nanobody-target complex.  The research team deployed this technology to generate a universal platform for controlling protein levels either through exogenous stimuli or by engineering a genetic circuitry that interfaces this orthogonal nanobody-mediated degradation system and endogenous regulatory or metabolic pathways.  This study resulted in an universal plug-and-play technology for controlling steady state levels of proteins in mammalian cells that does not require genetic manipulation of the target protein, can be potentially customized to target any cellular protein, and can be potentially adapted to target post-translational modifications. As such, this technology is poised to overcome limitations of other methods based on genetic or chemical inactivation and targeted degradation through accelerated proteolysis, and will provide an efficient method for dynamic control over protein accumulation in the complex cellular environment of mammalian cells.
