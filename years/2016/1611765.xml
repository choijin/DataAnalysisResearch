<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award: DMS 1611765, Principal Investigator: Alexander Furman&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Study of symmetry is one of the central themes in mathematics: one investigates mathematical laws and various associated objects by analysing their symmetries (i.e., transformations that do not change them) and further analyses how the laws and objects change under various transformations. In modern language one studies groups of symmetries and groups of transformations. The overarching theme of the project is to study phenomena in dynamics and geometry that occur in the presence of large groups (i.e., situations with a lot of explicit or implicit symmetries). This research continues important work over the last few decades that connects topics in geometry, probability theory, dynamical systems, and number theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More specifically, the proposal focuses on three areas: (1) measured group theory - an ergodic-theoretic analogue of geometric group theory; (2) further study of higher-rank super-rigidity phenomena; and (3) study of Lyapunov exponents in the classical context of the multiplicative ergodic theorem in the presence of large groups. The first topic includes study of rigidity for rank-one lattices in analogy with previously established rigidity results for higher-rank lattices. Another promising direction is development of a measured analogue of Gromov-hyperbolic groups. The second theme includes study of rigidity phenomena for groups that resemble but are different from higher-rank lattices, but admit rich Weyl groups. The third topic develops a method of establishing simplicity of the Lyapunov spectrum using certain group actions - this investigation connects now classical results on random products of matrices, geodesic flows on negatively curved manifolds, and recent developments in Teichmuller dynamics.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The project was focused on exploring a synthesis and interactions between Symmetry, Dynamical Systems, and Geometry.Many aspects of these interactions involve rigidity -- a phenomenon of robustness of the structure under perturbations.   One aspect of the project included new approach to the phenomenon of super-rigidity, that resulted in several publicationsby the PI, and built essential tools that were used in several recent breakthrough results in geometry. One of those developments (by Bader-Caprace-Lecureux) showed non-linearity  of certain mysterious geometric objectsis (so called exotic A_2 buildings), and another (by Bader-Fisher-Miller-Stover) proved a conjecture of McMullen and Reid about hyperbolic manifolds.    Another aspect of the project involved use of boundary techniques for problems in Dynamical Systems. This lead to several new results and a number of new research projects, in particular around Central Limit Theorems for matrix products.   During the project the PI was involved in a number of educational activities, including 6 mini-courses and lecture serieson topics related to the project, that were attended by a large number of PhD students and junior as well as senior researches, in the US and abroad.    The PI also continues the outreach program (UICMOP) for gifted Chicago school students. In recent years the program has grown and attracted a larger and more diverse group of students.
