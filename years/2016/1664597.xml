<AbstractNarration>Award: DMS 1664597, Principal Investigator: Steven Rosenberg&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award provides partial support for participation by U.S.-based mathematicians at an international school and workshop in mathematics related to topological phases of matter to be held in Leiden, the Netherlands, on February 27 - March 10, 2017.  Remarkable phenomena of current interest in condensed matter physics have been described as new phases or properties of material systems, subject to rules specified by sophisticated mathematical structures.  This international meeting will include a one-week school to give junior participants background in the mathematics and physics of the area and a second-week workshop of advanced research talks.  The conference aims to spark collaborations between researchers of varied backgrounds and to enhance the contributions of the mathematics of K- and KK-theory (Kasparov's bivariant K-theory) to the subject.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Few researchers have background in all three topics of the workshop (gauge theory, Kasparov KK-theory, and topological phases of matter), so this interdisciplinary conference aims to be of benefit to all of these communities.  Recent developments in KK-theory and noncommutative geometry, such as a constructive approach to the Kasparov product, seem relevant to current condensed matter physics. Related mathematical topics on which discussions are expected include correspondences in KK-theory, boundary issues, new methods in gauge theory, applications to index theory.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The purpose of this grant was to fund travel and local expenses for graduate students based at US universities to attend the conference "KK-theory, Gauge Theory, and Topological Phases, held at the Lorentz Center in Leiden, the Netherlands, on February 27 - March 10, 2017.  The topics covered in this program are of strong current research interest, but most of the research takes place at European institutions.  This grant allowed US-based students to be exposed to this developing research area.  The format of the conference, consisting of a one-week workshop with lecture series by senior faculty, and a one-week conference with research presented by experts, allowed the graduate students to obtain the necessary background to then understand cutting edge research in the field. The grant funded six students, who in their feedback expressed great appreciation for this opportunity. In turn, NSF support was a key factor in the Lorentz Institute's decision to fund this conference.  This grant was in a broad sesnse a training grant, so that the next generation of US-based mathematicians are exposed to research areas that are both important yet somewhat underrepresented in the US.  We expect that the students supported by the grant will disseminate their knowledge to other students and faculty back in the US.
