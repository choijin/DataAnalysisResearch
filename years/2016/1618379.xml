<AbstractNarration>Today's computing systems are becoming increasingly heterogeneous, providing new levels of computational horsepower and power efficiency.  Hardware accelerators are a key element in this trend, allowing compute-oriented code to be offloaded to specialized hardware. Accelerators are starting to be used for security services, where high-volume data is encrypted to ensure integrity/confidentiality. However, the security of accelerators has only just begun to receive attention. Issues such as information leakage through side channels have not been addressed.  Secure data will continue to grow in importance as we enter into the era of the Internet-of-Things (IoT). This project addresses national security needs, helping individuals, companies and governments to protect their data.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project develops new knowledge of the attack surface of accelerator devices that are becoming attractive platforms for encryption acceleration. A new class of resiliency approaches are developed to guard sensitive data and reduce the attack surface.  The project evaluates side-channel attack vulnerability on a range of systems, including discrete GPUs, integrated APUs (devices with the CPU and GPU sharing memory), and other classes of accelerators.  The 3 classes of attacks include: 1) timing attacks, 2) power analysis attacks and 3) electromagnetic emanation attacks. Three resiliency mechanisms are studied: 1) software obfuscation, 2) compiler-assisted modifications to address power/EM leakage, and 3) hardware techniques that add significant timing noise.   The project develops tutorials on reliability issues present in accelerator devices.  The project provides multiple opportunities for undergraduates from under-represented groups to engage in security-related research.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ A wide range of demanding applications, including deep learning, high performance computing and automous navigation, have become dependent on the use of hardware accelerators to process the growing volumes of data associated with these workloads. Graphic Processing Units (GPUs) have been the platform of choice in many of these deployments.  While the use of GPU has been supported by industry, there is a general lack of knowledge about the vulnerability of these popular platforms to security attacks, especially side-channel attacks, which are a growing class of exploits on today's hardware systems.  Exploits on GPU can leak encryption keys and other sensitive secrets to an attacker.  This project develops new knowledge of the attack surface of GPU devices. As a result of this project, a new class of resiliency approaches have been developed to guard sensitive data and reduce the attack surface. The project has evaluated side-channel attack vulnerability on a range of systems, including discrete GPUs and integrated APUs (devices with the CPU and GPU sharing memory). The 3 classes of attacks have been studied: 1) timing attacks, 2) power analysis attacks and 3) fault-based attacks.

The project supported six PhD students, including two female students, and provided multiple opportunities for undergraduates to engage in security-related research.  This project also helped the PI in their efforts to create a new University/Industry Collaborative Research Center targeting hardware security.   Many of the products associated with this project are available on the project website, and are open-source and free to use by the research community.  This research produced a number of well-cited papers in both leading peer-reviewed conferences and ACM/IEEE journals.
