<AbstractNarration>Massive volumes of magma poured out and filled in the split during the breakup of the supercontinent Pangea. As much as ten million cubic kilometers of basalt may have erupted in just a few hundred thousand years, and the magma may have triggered the rupture of the continent. Geologists define these areas of massive eruptions as Large Igneous Provinces.  The Ethiopian Plateau is an example of a younger volcanic province, while the Palisades on the opposite side of the Hudson River from Manhattan is part of a of a 200-million-year-old volcanic province that stretches from Newfoundland to Brazil.  In recent years, scientists have collected data that provide evidence of thick piles of lavas buried just offshore of most rifted continental margins, and as much lava may be offshore as what is estimated from mapping on land.  This project is focused on using numerical models to simulate and understand the way magma intrusion and extrusion influence the breakup of continents and the structure of the resulting continental edges. There is growing interest in how these types of magmatic processes affect the generation and preservation of hydrocarbons. The project supports the training of a post-doctoral researcher and a graduate student.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The thick sequences of volcanic flows found offshore of most rifted margins, termed Seaward Dipping Reflectors (SDRs), are a defining feature of volcanic margins. However, the formation of these features and the potential contribution of mantle plumes as a source of the lavas that form SDRs remain a topic of controversy.  This project considers the large-scale question of whether plumes are consistent with volcanic rift propagation. Observations suggesting that rifts propagate from the distal end of rifts to the central, plume-affected areas has called into question the idea that plumes are needed to initiate volcanic rifts such as those that produced most of the Atlantic margins.  The primary hypothesis of this project is that a rapidly evolving pattern of volcanism along a rift can reconcile the plume concept and the observed rift propagation directions.  Testing this hypothesis requires consideration of how volcanism is fed along a several thousand kilometer-long volcanic rift. This study uses moderately low-resolution 3-D models of mantle flow and melting to consider how plume material might spread along an incipient rift.  The second, and main, component of the study focuses on 2-D cross-sectional models of magmatic rift development. The effect of magma intrusion and volcanism on rift formation and particularly on the development and the rapid subsidence of SDRs will be assessed. Preliminary models produce fast subsidence after SDR formation if the lower crust can flow into a region of stretching crust.  The new models will allow quantitative testing of previous conceptual models, particularly those involving lateral variability in the thermal and density structure of an evolving rift during SDR formation.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Roughly every 30 million years basaltic lava pours out of the earth at rates up to 1000 times faster than the biggest current volcanic centers of today. During about a million years of torrid activity these flows produce a Large Igneous Province (or LIP) that can be thousands kilometers wide. The carbon dioxide liberated during such events may explain why all mass extinctions occurred at about the same time as LIP formation.  These provinces often form in the center of places where large continents split apart into smaller ones. Remnants of these lavas can be seen as the Palisades Cliffs west of New York City, the Columbia Plateau straddling Oregon and Washington, most of Ethiopia and much of Central and Western India.  What many people do not know is that far larger amounts of basaltic rocks, formed at about the same time as the LIP surface features, are deeply buried and so are imaged only buy geophysical techniques.  This grant was focused on ways that LIP intrusion and surface flows affect how continents split apart and what structures are produced along the margins of the new continents.  We approached this with a series of projects that dealt with the mechanics of magma extrusion onto and intrusion into the crust.  The first study simulated the structure of volcanic flows on rifted margins in a far more sophisticated way than had been attempted before.  A key result was a prediction of how the shape of these volcanic flows should depend on the strength of the continental edge being rifted.  We showed that the model predicts observed structures well and that some continental margins were apparently stronger than others during breakup.  A big limitation of our models of rift-related volcanic flows was how to deal with intrusion of magma. To investigate possible effects of intrusion we turned to the youngest LIP, the 15 million-year-old Columbia River Basalts.   The thing that interested us about this LIP is that the basalt flows formed in a bowl-shaped depression that is presently about 700 meters lower than the surrounding region.  This depression contrasts sharply with the next youngest LIP, the 30 million-year-old Ethiopian Plateau, that forms a 2-3 kilometer high plateau.  We found that the simplest way to explain the low elevation of the Columbia Plateau was for the lower crust to be hot and weak enough to flow out of the way as magma piled up inside the crust.  Two other things had to occur to produce a low plateau.  First, a significant fraction of the intruded magma had to freeze onto the strong upper crust to pull it down.  Second, much of the intrusion of magma had to happen before the extrusion to explain the geometry of the lava flows.  In areas of cold, strong lower crust, like Ethiopia, our models predicted that intrusions also largely occur before the main phase of extrusion, but the slow crustal flow allows a high plateau to be maintained.  The work on plateau elevation led us to the question of how LIPs are associated with global warming and mass extinction events.  Temporal correlations between flood basalt eruptions and mass extinctions led to the hypothesis that release of CO2 from LIP volcanism causes global climate change.  However, recent more accurate dating of the Deccan Traps and the Columbia River Basalts challenges this causal link by showing that global warming preceded the major phase of flood basalts eruptions by several hundred thousand years.  We argue that major eruptions of continental flood basalts may require densification of the crust by intrusion of larger volumes of magma at depth than are extruded at the surface.  Simple models show that magma crystallization and release of CO2 from such deep intrusions could produce global warming before the main phase of flood basalt eruptions on the observed timescale.   During the course of this grant we also considered how magma intrusion affects the topography of plate spreading centers.  The papers we published on this topic provide the first unified model that can be compared with data on the topographic relief and pattern of faulting at spreading centers.  That work has led to trying to explain how magma chambers affect the along-axis structure of many spreading center segments.  This involved a detailed investigation of the way repeated magmatic intrusions interact with crustal-scale faults. We designed new models that explain how the extensional deformation that accompanies the separation of two tectonic plates becomes partitioned between a magmatic and a tectonic component over geological time.
