<AbstractNarration>This award funds doctoral dissertation research that will be conducted by coPI Kevin Pan. He wants to understand how the market for corporate bonds is affected by the existence of corporate bond exchange traded funds (ETFs). These funds maintain liquidity by establishing authorized participants (APs) who are the only market participants allowed to transact with the ETF issuer to create and redeem shares of the ETF. The coPI will examine how AP trading behavior affects underlying bond returns, liquidity, and price volatility. The goal is to understand whether ETF arbitrage might fail under certain circumstances.  ETF shares are owned by individual investors in the U.S.; understanding conditions under which the market could fail is important, since a market failure could have significant effects on many Americans' retirement savings. The results will be useful for regulators, who have been concerned about ETF liquidity during financial stress.  They will also be useful to the many individual investors who hold ETF shares; the lack of scientific research on ETFs means that individual investors have few resources for disinterested information on the benefits and risks of ETF investments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project generally seeks to understand how financial institutions, specifically authorized participants, can affect financial markets and asset prices. The coPI will construct a detailed panel set of (1) ETF prices, holdings, and arbitrage ability, (2) AP lists by ETF, and (3) corporate bond trades and characteristics. The plan to is to examine several research questions. First, how are excess volatility and co-movement of underlying corporate bond returns affected by the intermediation friction of broker-dealers in this market? Second, how have changing market trends and conditions affected the market and trade of corporate bonds and corporate bond ETFs? Third, how do APs use the creation/redemption process to relax their inventory or financial constraints? What are the resulting implications for their trading behavior in corporate bonds and ETFs, and how is this behavior different than what is observed for financial intermediaries who are not APs? Fourth, how and under what circumstances might ETF arbitrage fail? What are the implications of failure and what role do APs play in this failure? The coPI's theory suggests a new channel of transmission via APs' inventory constraints and ETFs' liquidity mismatch. The coPI will also use the data to test various theories about arbitrage in this market.</AbstractNarration>

We provide theory and empirical evidence, in the particular context of corporate bond ETFs, showing that liquidity mismatch can reduce market efficiency and increase fragility. The theory leverages two key institutional frictions: 1) the natural liquidity mismatch, and 2) the dual role of authorized participants (APs) as both bond dealers and the only intermediaries able to create/redeem ETF shares.</p> <p>Theoretically, the paper shows that APs&rsquo; ETF creation/redemption motives are influenced by two opposing effects: an arbitrage effect and an inventory management effect. Briefly, when the absolute magnitude of inventory imbalances of APs (also as bond dealers) is small, APs use ETF creations/redemption to close relative ETF mispricings. APs are willing to close relative mispricings when the marginal benefit of expected arbitrage return outweighs other costs, including suboptimal inventory levels. ETF arbitrage however remains far from frictionless and is limited by the natural liquidity mismatch of the ETF. In contrast, when the absolute magnitude of APs&rsquo; bond imbalances is large, the motive to trade towards an optimal bond inventory level doinates. While APs still create/redeem ETF shares, ETF arbitrage may go in the opposite direction than what would be implied by the initial relative mispricing. Intuitively, APs strategically use ETF creations/redemptions not to correct relative mispricings but to unwind bond imbalances, reduce existing inventory risks and facilitate future market-making in their role as bond dealers. In this sense the ETF arbitrage mechanism becomes &ldquo;distorted&rdquo; -- creations/redemptions are disconnected from fundamentals and gives rise to the possibility of larger relative mispricings.</p> <p>This project further develops empirical evidence by leveraging unique datasets that capture APs&rsquo; ETF transactions and corporate bond trading. First, we obtain lists of APs for each corporate bond ETF of two ETF issuers. Second, we obtain a proprietary version of all secondary market corporate bond transactions with dealer identifiers allowing us to directly link secondary market bond transactions of APs. Using these identifiers, we impute bond order flow imbalances on APs&rsquo; balance sheets and identify their impact on APs&rsquo; arbitrage activity. Finally, we obtain time-series data on the daily create/redeem baskets for each ETF in our sample to identify the subset of bonds used in the ETF arbitrage. We use these datasets in our empirical design to trace the effect of initial bond pricing and inventory through to realized AP arbitrage.</p> <p>We find empirical results that are consistent with the model predictions. First, increases in market volatility and bond market illiquidity reduce ETF creations and redemptions. An increase of 1% in the ETF premium generates an increase in AP arbitrage by 50 basis points; however, as market volatility rises, holding fixed the ETF premium, a one standard deviation increase in market volatility generates a 10% decline in AP arbitrage. Moreover, the decrease in arbitrage sensitivity is asymmetrically larger when the ETF premium is negative. Second, when APs experience extreme bond inventory imbalances, APs&rsquo; creation/redemption activities become less sensitive to perceived arbitrage opportunities, and more sensitive to the amount of their bond inventory imbalances. While ETF arbitrage goes in the direction of the arbitrage opportunity, suggesting that an &ldquo;ETF arbitrage&rdquo; channel dominates, a &ldquo;differences-in-differences&rdquo; approach comparing ETFs across inventory scenarios reveals that APs actually do less (more) net redemptions when inventory shocks are large and positive (negative) despite there being an ETF discount (premium). Third, outside the model, we find evidence that realized AP arbitrage affects relative mispricings across markets as well as return and liquidity in the underlying corporate bond market.
