<AbstractNarration>This award provides funding to help defray the expenses of participants in the conference "Free Probability and the Large N Limit (V)" that will be held March 22-26, 2016, on the campus of the University of California-Berkeley.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This event is the fifth in a series of workshops that have focused on the subject of free probability, an active research area closely tied to the theory of operator algebras. The meeting will bring together and foster collaborations amongst researchers from the following fields: free probability; operator algebras; random matrix theory; probability theory; subfactor theory; combinatorics. The conference program provides ample opportunity for graduate students, postdocs, and other young scientists to present their work.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Free probability is a highly noncommutative probability theory with the role of random variables, like in quantum mechanics, taken by Hilbert space operators, while the notion of independence is modelled on free products instead of tensor products, so that freely independent random variables do not commute in general. Random matrices in the large N limit provide one of the core models for the theory, while operator algebras on Hilbert space and the combinatorics of noncrossing partitions provide other approaches to the subject. In addition to these, the analogy with classical probability has turned out to provide often important suggestions for the lines along which the theory should develop. Since free probability is a meeting place for several approaches, workshops like the series of workshops Free Probability and the Large N Limit, held over the years and of which this was the fifth play a very important role for the interaction between researchers with different expertise and approaches. This is especially important for young researchers entering the field. The workshop Free Probability and the Large N Limit V held at UC Berkeley March 21 - 27 , 2016 provided an excellent opportunity for researchers, especially young researchers, to meet other researchers in the field, communicate, present their results and think about future directions for their work. The major goal of the project was to partially support travel and accommodation for participants to attend the workshop. Residual funds were used to support travel for a young mathematician to give a lecture on a free probability subject in the Probabilistic Operator Algebra Seminar at UC Berkey organized by the PI (November 6, 2016). The partial support for travel and accommodation from the grant was provided for 29 mathematicians (14 juniors aand 15 seniors). All the recipients of support gave lectures about their research work. The support provided by the grant had the desired impact in the development of young mathematicians, their interaction with senior contributors to the field, an excellent training opportunity which made an important human resources contribution. The workshop also had an important impact for the development of the field of free probability.
