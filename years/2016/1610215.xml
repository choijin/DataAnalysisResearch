<AbstractNarration>Non-technical Description: The ability to manipulate properties of light beams has changed our understanding of the physical universe. Photon beams are being explored to process information, probe the nature of solids and understand how the brain responds to and interacts with external stimuli. New semiconductors that interact with light in unusual ways often form the cornerstone for enhancing the effective coupling of photons to matter. The project investigates the potential of new semiconducting oxide systems in emerging photonic devices. The research goal is to explore optical and electronic properties of thin film SmNiO3 that has a controllable phase change near room temperature that can be systematically induced by changing the electronic structure for potential applications in optoelectronic devices such as optical modulators and optical memories. The project is collaborative between materials scientists and photonics engineers to bring multi-disciplinary skills together to work on cutting-edge topics in nanophotonics incorporating new thin film oxide materials. The project trains graduate and undergraduate students to carry out research at the intersection between materials science, nanophotonics, and optoelectronics. The project engages diverse students in interdisciplinary research that encompasses materials growth, device design, computer modeling, cleanroom nanofabrication, and optical/electronic characterization of materials/devices. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Description: This project investigates the potential of electron-doped perovskites as novel phase-changing materials for future light modulation devices needed for optical memory, brain-inspired photonic devices with multiple states. The research goals of this collaborative project are to elucidate the fundamental mechanisms and reliability of non-volatility of the electron incorporation process and to understand the limits on the speed of phase change studied by optical routes. The research team uses a combination of thin film materials synthesis, electron diffraction, carrier transport measurements, optical microscopy and spectroscopy to study the nanostructure and optical properties of selected perovskite oxides. The research team uses ?metasurfaces?, which are two-dimensional arrays of optical antennas, to maximize the interaction between intensely confined light and thin films of phase-change materials. The project involves diverse graduate and undergraduate students to work on frontier topics in nanophotonics. Collaborations between materials scientists and photonics researchers enhances the research experience and broaden the technical horizons of the participating students.</AbstractNarration>

Our work has demonstrated that SmNiO<sub>3</sub> exhibits a large modulation of resistivity and optical band gap at room temperature during electron-doping-induced phase transition. The project has led to fundamental understanding of the nature and dynamics of phase transitions in rare-earth perovskite nickelates. The project has succeeded in integrating the phase-change material with two-dimensional nanostructured thin-films, called metasurfaces, which has led to strongly enhanced interactions between light waves and the phase-change material, and a few novel photonic devices. The latter include optical modulators, variable emissivity coating, smart windows, and thin-film stacks with tunable coloration.</p> <p><strong>Broader impacts:</strong> The PI accomplished many activities of education, outreach, and technology transfer under the support of this award. The program provides comprehensive training for graduate students in materials characterization, and device design, fabrication, and testing, using state of the art computation, nano-fabrication, and characterization facilities. One graduate student (Zhaoyi Li) has been primarily supported by the award and another two graduate students (Norman Nan Shi and Adam Overvig) have been partially supported by the award. Zhaoyi has published five first author papers in peer-reviewed scientific journals including <em>Advanced Materials</em>, <em>Nature Communications</em>, and <em>Nature Nanotechnology</em>; he has defended his Ph.D. thesis in Dec. 2017 and is now a postdoc researcher at Harvard. Norman has published two first author papers in <em>Light: Science &amp; Applications</em> and <em>Science</em>; he has defended his Ph.D. thesis in May 2018 and is now a principle optics scientist at Western Digital, San Jose, CA. Dr. Li and Dr. Shi both won the Robert Simon Memorial Prize, which is awarded to the best Ph.D. thesis annually to one graduate student in the Department of Applied Physics &amp; Applied Mathematics, Columbia University. In addition, the project provided summer research opportunities to three Columbia undergraduates during the 2016-2019 period. The PI has incorporated selected results and discoveries made with the support of this project into Modern Optics and Laser Physics, two graduate-level courses that he teaches. The device prototypes developed in this project have great promise for a variety of applications, including planar optical modulators, smart windows, and coatings with tunable thermal emissivity. The project has produced three technological inventions in the form of provisional patents and PCT patent applications.</p> <p>Highlights of outcomes of this project include:</p> <p>1. We discovered a new optical phase-transition material samarium nickelate, SmNiO3. SmNiO3 is a strongly correlated perovskite. Electron doping at room temperature substantially modifies its bandstructure and triggers its phase transition reversibly between a transparent and an opaque state. Optical transmission of SmNiO3 thin films is measured to change reversibly between a few percent and more than 70 percent over the entire visible, near-infrared, and mid-infrared spectra (wavelengths from 400 nm to 15 microns) (<strong>Fig. 1</strong>). The magnitude and bandwidth of optical tuning that this material offers are rarely seen in other tunable optical materials.</p> <p>2. We discovered a new mechanism to trigger the phase change of SmNiO3 based on water electrolysis (<strong>Fig. 2</strong>). We conducted systematic spectroscopy measurements and showed that the complex optical refractive indices of water-treated SmNiO3 are quite comparable to SmNiO3 treated with standard liquid and solid electrolytes. We found that SmNiO3 is stable in salt water, does not corrode, and allows exchange of protons with the surrounding water at ambient temperature, with the concurrent modification in electrical resistance and optical properties. The implication of the discovery is that, since SmNiO3 is stable in liquid water, it could be used in biochemical or biomedical environments (aqueous solution of living cells and tissues), as a reconfigurable optical interface for imaging or sensing applications.</p> <p>3. We experimentally demonstrated free-space optical modulators based on thin-film SmNiO<sub>3</sub> integrated with a metasurface structure consisting of a two-dimensional array of cross aperture antennas (<strong>Fig. 3</strong>). The antenna array facilitates a strong interaction between light and the phase-change material, resulting in a strong optical modulation at the antenna resonant frequency when SmNiO<sub>3</sub> undergoes phase transition.</p> <p>4. We experimentally demonstrated a variable emissivity coating that can provide a tuning of thermal emissivity by ~50% (<strong>Fig. 4</strong>). Surfaces with variable emissivity can be used to control thermal radiation in response to varying climatic conditions to thermoregulate building and vehicles.</p> <p>5. We designed a smart window based on SmNiO<sub>3</sub> that is able to modulate transmissivity of sunlight over the visible and near-infrared range by more than 60% (<strong>Fig. 5</strong>).</p> <p>6. We designed thin-film stacks based on SmNiO<sub>3</sub> that provide tunable coloration (<strong>Fig. 6</strong>).</p> <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong><em>&nbsp;</em></p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 11/22/2019<br>      Modified by: Nanfang&nbsp;Yu</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1610215/1610215_10425835_1574458659802_Picture3--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1610215/1610215_10425835_1574458659802_Picture3--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Fig. 3 Free-space optical modulators based on thin-film SmNiO3 integrated with a metasurface structure"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1610215/1610215_10425835_1574458659802_Picture3--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Fig. 3 Free-space optical modulators based on thin-film SmNiO3 integrated with a metasurface structure"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">We experimentally demonstrated free-space optical modulators based on thin-film SmNiO3 integrated with a metasurface structure consisting of a two-dimensional array of cross aperture antennas.</div> <div class="imageCredit">nanfang yu</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Nanfang&nbsp;Yu</div> <div class="imageTitle">Fig. 3 Free-space optical modulators based on thin-film SmNiO3 integrated with a metasurface structure</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1610215/1610215_10425835_1574458539500_Picture2--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1610215/1610215_10425835_1574458539500_Picture2--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Fig. 2 A new mechanism to trigger the phase change of SmNiO3 based on water electrolysis"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1610215/1610215_10425835_1574458539500_Picture2--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Fig. 2 A new mechanism to trigger the phase change of SmNiO3 based on water electrolysis"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">We conducted systematic spectroscopy measurements and showed that the complex optical refractive indices of water-treated SmNiO3 are quite comparable to SmNiO3 treated with standard liquid and solid electrolytes.</div> <div class="imageCredit">nanfang yu</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Nanfang&nbsp;Yu</div> <div class="imageTitle">Fig. 2 A new mechanism to trigger the phase change of SmNiO3 based on water electrolysis</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1610215/1610215_10425835_1574458384820_Picture1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1610215/1610215_10425835_1574458384820_Picture1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Fig. 1 Optical phase-transition material samarium nickelate SmNiO3"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1610215/1610215_10425835_1574458384820_Picture1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Fig. 1 Optical phase-transition material samarium nickelate SmNiO3"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">SmNiO3 is a strongly correlated perovskite.
