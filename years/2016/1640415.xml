<AbstractNarration>This program will study quasar outflows to test the evolutionary paradigm that links quasars and supermassive black holes to their host galaxies.   This will be accomplished via observational and theoretical work on quasar accretion disk outflows that will derive the kinematics, densities, ionization levels, and driving mechanisms of the flows.    Elemental abundances in quasar environments will also be addressed, as will the relationship between quasars and host galaxy evolution via use of submillimeter-wavelength measurements.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of the work include research training of undergraduate and graduate students, implementation of a clicker system of classroom response for introductory classes, and public lectures.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Quasars provide a unique glimpse into the early evolution of massive galaxies. They represent the most luminous stage(s) of matter accreting onto super-massive black holes (SMBHs) in the centers of these galaxies. An observed correlation between the masses of SMBHs and their surrounding galactic spheroids indicates that SMBH growth is somehow directly linked to the processes of galaxy formation. A paradigm has emerged for linking SMBHs to galaxy evolution that involves major bursts of star formation and quasar activity that together drive blowouts of gas and dust from the galaxies. These blowouts provide a form of "feedback" to the host galaxies that might be essential for regulating both the star formation and SMBH growth during young/active evolution stages, thus producing the SMBH&ndash;galaxy mass relation. Quasars are powered by matter heating up as it spirals its way into the SMBHs. This infall forms a disk around the SMBH, called an accretion disk, that glows very brightly and produces powerful winds to drive feedback processes in the surrounding host galaxies.    Our NSF-funded program was a multifaceted study of the gaseous environments around quasars and the relationships of quasars to galaxy formation and evolution.  We worked specifically on three fronts to examine 1) the energetics and physical properties of quasar accretion-disk outflows that might be the main drivers of feedback in the host galaxies, 2) quasars with red colors caused by dust obscuration because these quasars might identify a particular very early stage of galaxy formation when the galaxies are still dusty before the blowout of gas and dust has fully occurred, and 3) the physical processes of quasar outflows interacting with the host galaxies and the infall of gas from the circum-galactic medium that is expected to feed the bursts of star formation, grow the galaxies, and fuel quasar activity via accretion into the SMBH.    Our work on this program provided important results to help us piece together the puzzle of quasars in bigger picture of galaxy formation. For example, our analysis of the absorption lines formed in quasar outflows gives us new insights into the physical structure, energetics, and potential impact of quasar outflows on their surrounding galactic environments.
