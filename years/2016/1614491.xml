<AbstractNarration>It has been estimated that the entire world-wide demand for energy will double in the next&lt;br/&gt;two decades, therefore it is critical to investigate revolutionary energy technologies&lt;br/&gt;to meet this demand. A potential hydrogen economy is a key player in this market&lt;br/&gt;space. However, hydrogen as a fuel requires efficient storage materials that retain and release&lt;br/&gt;a great deal of hydrogen as desired. This proposal aims to use large scale and accurate quantum&lt;br/&gt;mechanical calculations on an important class of porous hydrogen storage materials: metal-organic&lt;br/&gt;frameworks (MOFs). The research team will study the properties of hydrogen inside of MOFs&lt;br/&gt;and seek to understand their physical properties and how one can design improved MOFs that&lt;br/&gt;should deliver improved storage of hydrogen per unit weight under reasonable and real-world&lt;br/&gt;operating conditions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To understand and improve MOFs for hydrogen storage applications, it is key to study the microscopic&lt;br/&gt;physical properties of MOFs that govern hydrogen uptake, release, and diffusion&lt;br/&gt;inside the MOFs. This requires simulation of hydrogen inside of MOFs at the atomistic scale.&lt;br/&gt;The project propose to perform highly accurate quantum mechanical simulations of hydrogen dynamics&lt;br/&gt;inside of MOFs using first principles density functional theory to describe the electronic&lt;br/&gt;state of the system coupled to molecular dynamics of the nuclear degrees of freedom including&lt;br/&gt;quantum nuclear effects (via the path integral formalism). The effect due to the quantum&lt;br/&gt;fluctuations of the nuclear degrees of freedom are critical for understanding the binding&lt;br/&gt;and dynamics of light elements such as hydrogen. The project will use this advanced and accurate theoretical&lt;br/&gt;framework to address three questions of key importance to this field: (1) How do quantum&lt;br/&gt;nuclear effects alter hydrogen dynamics inside of MOFs? (2) How do the transition metal atoms&lt;br/&gt;incorporated into the MOF structure change the hydrogen binding and dynamics properties and&lt;br/&gt;which metals are best for real-world applications? (3) How does the flexibility and temperature-dependent&lt;br/&gt;fluctuations of the MOF framework affect hydrogen storage?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The scientific outcomes of this research will be of interest and importance to researchers&lt;br/&gt;studying MOFs and hydrogen storage. The aim is to provide useful understanding and information&lt;br/&gt;that may lead to the creation of materials that will help create a hydrogen economy. The&lt;br/&gt;results of the work will be published in high quality journals, presented widely at international&lt;br/&gt;conferences, and form the basis for outreach events to the broader public in order to elevate&lt;br/&gt;general interest in science and technology as well as how simulations and computations can&lt;br/&gt;address important real-world problems. Junior researchers carrying out the research work&lt;br/&gt;will be trained in the use of advanced computational methods, attendant software infrastructures,&lt;br/&gt;and materials design approaches that are all highly useful skills in the twenty-first century.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The supercomputing access provided by this PRAC grant (NSF award 1614491) enabled the use large scale and accurate quantum mechanical calculations to study how useful a class of porous materials, called metal-organic frameworks or MOFs,  may be  for hydrogen storage. Hydrogen has the strong potential to be a green energy source or fuel, but since it is a gas, its use requires efficient storage materials that can retain or release a great quantity of hydrogen on demand. Our calculations  directly  simulated the motion of hydrogen molecules inside the the internal voids of MOFs at low and higher temperatures.  The results of our simulations described the rapidness with which hydrogen molecules move about the MOF (their rate of diffusion) and how these molecules attach and detach from the interior surfaces of the MOF during the diffusion process.  In terms of intellectual merit, these high accuracy fully quantum mechanical calculations provide careful quantitative benchmarks for prior and future studies of MOF systems and how the diffusion process takes place at the microscopic scale of individual atoms and molecules.  Concerning broader impacts, the results generated and their public dissemination at international conferences and workshops will help the broader community of researchers better understand and evaluate this potentially transformative class of materials as well as the new computational methods developed in this project.
