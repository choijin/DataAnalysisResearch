<AbstractNarration>Current interest in distributed sensing and control has led to a very rapid increase in the application of graph theoretic ideas to problems of analyzing and synthesizing a variety of desired robotic team and mobile sensor group behaviors such as swarming, rendezvousing, reaching a consensus, as well as well as a variety of sensing and communication tasks associated with distributed averaging, search and rescue, environmental monitoring, security, etc. While this in-depth assault on these problems using a combination of graph theory and system theory has been underway for about a decade, it is likely to significantly expand in the years to come. One example of this is the resurgence of interest in an old concept called structural controllability and its applications to new problems involving swarming, complex social networks and network security. Another is the explosion of interest in the development of distributed computational procedures for addressing basic numerical problems such as estimating parameters of a linear system, or solving a system of possibly nonlinear algebraic equations. Still another is the recent theoretical work by a number of individuals focused on the coordination of networks of mobile robots and mobile sensors by means of rigidity-based formation control. In broad terms these are the three problem areas within which we propose to work. This project will promoting teaching, training and learning in at least two different ways. First, graduate students involved in the project will be expected to attend and present there results at technical meetings. Second, project graduate students will contribute to and participate in a short course on the topic which we envision organizing and giving towards the end of the project. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In more technical terms, this project will address distributed sensing and control on three fronts. First the task is to characterize in graph theoretic terms a significantly more general notion of structural controllability than the one currently being pursued. Second, task is to develop distributed and asynchronous algorithms for solving systems of nonlinear functional equations including para-contractions across a given network of autonomous agents assuming limited communication between agents and time-varying networks.  The third task is to explore various algorithms for controlling both directed and undirected rigid formations of sensors and mobile robots in a distributed manner. The goal is to address the question of robustness to measurement errors and parameter discrepancies among agents and attempt to find a way to avoid the recently discovered fundamental robustness issue with undirected formation control.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Over the past few years there has been a resurgence of interest in the question of  structural controllability.  Structural controllability is a concept which aims to characterize the controllability of linear systems whose parameters are not precisely defined. The original version of the idea was for linear systems described by coefficient matrices A and B whose nonzero entries are viewed as algebraically independent parameters. In practice, some of the entries these matrices are, in fact, not algebraically independent. Prompted by this, we have broadened the concept of structural controllability to allow for the possibility that a parameter may appear in more than one location in the matrix pair (A,B). Subject to a certain condition on the parameterization, we have developed an explicit graph-theoretic characterization of structural controllability for such matrix pairs.   State estimators such as Kalman filters and observers have had a huge impact on the entire field of estimation and control. Motivated by this, a time-invariant, linear, distributed observer has been crafted for estimating the state of an m &gt; 0 channel, n-dimensional continuous-time linear dynamical system with state x. The state is simultaneously estimated by m agents assuming each agent i senses an output of the system and receives the state of each of its neighbors estimators. Neighbor relations are characterized by a constant directed graph N whose vertices correspond to agents and whose arcs depict neighbor relations. For the case when the neighbor graph is strongly connected, the overall distributed observer consists of m linear estimators, one for each agent; m&minus;1 of the estimators are of dimension n and one estimator is of dimension n + m &minus; 1. Using results from classical decentralized control theory, it is shown that subject to the assumptions that the graph N is strongly connected, the system whose state to be estimated is jointly observable, and nothing more, it is possible to freely assign the spectrum of the overall distributed observer. For the more general case when N has q &gt; 1 strongly connected components, it is explained how to construct a family of q distributed observers, one for each component, which can estimate x at a preassigned convergence rate.   It is known that many distributed computations such as solving a linear equation or minimizing a smooth convex function can be recast as finding a common fixed point of a family of maps, each with the same domain and the same co-domain. In many instances these maps are nonlinear and possess special properties. Prompted by this we have developed a distributed algorithm for finding a common fixed point of a family of m &gt; 1 nonlinear maps Mi assuming that each such map is a paracontraction and that at least one such common fixed point exists. The common fixed point is simultaneously computed by m agents distributed over a network, assuming each agent i knows only Mi, the current estimates of the fixed point generated by its neighbors, and nothing more. Each agent recursively updates its estimate of a fixed point by utilizing the current estimates generated by each of its neighbors. Neighbor relations are characterized by a time-varying directed graph. It is shown that under suitably general conditions on the graph, the algorithm causes all agent estimates to converge to the same common fixed point of the m nonlinear maps.
