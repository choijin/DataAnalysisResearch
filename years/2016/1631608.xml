<AbstractNarration>This is funding to provide partial support for the 2016 International Conference of Mobile Brain-Body Imaging (MoBI) and the Neuroscience of Art, Innovation and Creativity. The conference's goal is to identify the challenges and opportunities for engaging the creative arts to promote novel and innovative approaches for solving complex problems in science, engineering, education and medicine. The meeting, to be held at Live Aqua, Cancun on July 24-27, 2016, is being jointly organized by the University of Houston in Texas and the Technical University of Berlin, Germany. The agenda is designed to examine the state of the art, to promote audience-driven discussions whose content is defined by the participants themselves, and to facilitate collaborations and interactive demonstrations and performances.  A roadmap summarizing the meeting's findings will be prepared and submitted for peer-review as part of a Special Issue in Frontiers in Human Neuroscience, a first-tier electronic open access journal. Graduate students and postdoctoral fellows, taking part in the Doctoral Consortium program at the conference, will capture summaries of the group interactions and final group briefings that describe the challenges addressed and outline the approach(es) identified for solving them, including what research needs to be done to understand the fundamental science behind each challenge, a plan for promoting trans-disciplinary collaboration and innovation, the reasoning behind the plan, and the expected benefits to society. In terms of STEAM (STEM + Art) outreach, conference attendees will represent a wide range of experience and expertise, from graduate students to well-established scientists, clinicians, artists, engineers, media, and industry. The Doctoral Consortium for selected graduate students and postdocs will provide an opportunity for the students to network while exploring and developing their research interests within the context of an interdisciplinary conference, under the guidance of a distinguished group of international researchers, artists and innovators.  The organizers will actively recruit student participants from under-represented groups, including women and minorities, and across institutions, with a maximum of two students per institution (and if two then one must be a female).  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To achieve MoBI's ambitious goals, the organizers will convene thought leaders and innovators from academia, medicine, the arts, and technology to explore the myths, challenges and opportunities of research at the intersection of these disciplines in the context of a 3-day conference in a unique setting selected to foster discussion, interaction and collaboration, leading to a strategic plan that exploits the creative arts to advance science and engineering across critical areas, including: (a) uncovering the basic neural mechanisms underlying aesthetic and creative experiences (reverse engineering of the human brain); (b) the artistic, scientific and engineering challenges that affect collaboration and innovation; and (c) how to design new tools for understanding and promoting innovation and creativity.  The conference will be organized around a number of tracks: Mobile Brain-Body Imaging (MoBI) Technologies; Cognitive, Medical and Pedagogical Applications; and Cognitive and Affective Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs).</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Creativity is a highly variable and individual trait, but can it be measured? And if it can, what does that tell us? Both scientists and artists have worked on the question for years, but there has been no consensus on the answers, or even on what questions to ask. However, technological advances and a burgeoning interest from the general public suggest the field may be beginning to coalesce. An international conference held in Cancun, Mexico, addressed the intersection of the arts and neuroscience, how to promote creativity and innovation, and the need to find common ground.  The question of creativity and the brain isn?t new. But as mobile brain-body imaging (MoBI) technology has advanced, the field has reached a turning point. About 60 neuroscientists, performers, visual artists, engineers and 28 trainees from around the globe converged on a resort in Cancun, Mexico, in late July for the "2016 International Conference on Mobile Brain-Body Imaging and the Neuroscience of Art, Innovation and Creativity," a first-of-its-kind attempt to forge a common purpose by promoting audience-driven discussions whose content was provided by the participants themselves, rather than the traditional agenda aligned with speaker presentations.  The intellectual merit of the unique international meeting was on developing a deeper understanding of how best the creative arts, science and engineering can help and inform each other, and how MoBI technology and innovative experimental protocols conducted in real complex settings can assist neuroscience in advacing understanding of the neural basis of creativity, innovation and aesthetics.  The potential for broader impact is immense: Understanding how the creative arts and aesthetic experiences engage the brain and the mind can lead to better approaches to promote innovation and developing novel art therapy interventions to treat mental disorders and neurological diseases.  Moreover, knowledge can lead to improvements in science, technology, engineering, arts, and math (STEAM) education at all levels. From a regulatory science point of view, MoBI data collected in complex natural settings can provide valuable information about the neural variability and individuality in the general population, which can lead to design of better and safer biomedical devices to treat brain disorders.
