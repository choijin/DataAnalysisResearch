<AbstractNarration>The demand for wireless services and higher wireless throughput continues to grow exponentially. To meet this growth, massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) has been identified as an enabling technology in next generation wireless systems. A challenge in realizing the vision is the estimation of the wireless channel between the transmitter and receiver as the number of transmitting antennas becomes large. The channel modeling and estimation challenge is addressed in this research for a variety of deployment scenarios; frequency division duplex (FDD) systems, time division duplex (TDD) systems, and distributed massive MIMO systems. In addition to having a significant impact on the theoretical foundations and algorithms relevant to next generation wireless systems, this research will involve several graduate students who will be trained in the latest wireless technology and also result in novel tools that have fundamental and wider import.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The channel modeling and estimation research includes the development of line-of-sight channel estimation via advanced sparse signal recovery algorithms like sparse Bayesian learning with the goal of reducing training overhead. The non-line-of-sight environment is considered from a novel dictionary learning perspective to enable low dimensional representations of the channel. These representations along with compressive channel learning will lead to the development of techniques that significantly reduce the feedback overhead for FDD systems. For TDD systems, the research involves the development of data-aided channel estimation techniques to improve channel estimates well beyond what is possible with pilot-only training. In addition, the research includes an in-depth study of the tradeoffs of distributed massive MIMO array design to develop insights necessary for selecting the optimal array configuration.</AbstractNarration>
