<AbstractNarration>Non-technical abstract&lt;br/&gt;Colloids are nano and micrometer sized spheres suspended in a liquid.  The aim of this research is to explore and develop methods to direct, or program, the assembly of these particles into specific ordered crystalline arrangements.  The ultimate goal is to take colloids made from diverse materials such as polymers, glasses, metals, and semiconductors, suspend them in a water (or some other liquid) and cause them to self-assemble into preprogrammed functional microscopic arrangements. The applications are likely to be in technologies as diverse as optoelectronics, microfluidics, filtration, and catalysis, where the precise arrangement of different types of materials on the microscale is key to their functionality.  The research team will use DNA sequences attached to different nano and microparticles, which will be used to program the self-assembly of the microscopic colloidal particles. The team will investigate how these particles move and dynamically arrange themselves to form various crystalline structures and will test theories of how such programmed assembly occurs.  The research will train doctoral and postdoctoral researchers in these emerging state-of-the-art methods of colloidal self-assembly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical abstract&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is to develop a fundamental understanding of the microscopic processes that govern the self-assembly and crystallization of DNA-coated colloids.  The work takes advantage of recent breakthroughs developed in the principal investigator's laboratory for creating new DNA coatings for a wide spectrum of colloidal materials.  The research team will focus on the dynamics of crystallization in one-component and, as time and resources permit, two-component systems.  The experiments will measure the dynamics of phase separation using optical microscopy and light scattering primarily, but will also employ electron microscopy and rheology. The experiments target the different dynamical processes involved in crystal formation at the microscopic (individual particle) level, including nucleation, spinodal decomposition, diffusion, and annealing. DNA-coated colloids represent a new frontier for the self-assembly of advanced materials. Because they possess a number of unique properties, including programmable specific interactions, temperature-dependent pair potentials, and spatially fluctuating surface interactions, they present a number of new scientific challenges related to the frontiers of self-assembly, and modify classical mechanisms of nucleation and growth, anomalous diffusion, and programmable directed diffusion.  The research team will develop quantitative models to describe and understand their observations.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Small spherical particles about 100 to 1000 times smaller than the diameter of a human hair can self-assemble into materials that are useful as for their optical properties, for their ability to coat and protect surfaces, and for many other applications.  Under appropriate conditions, these particles, known as colloids, can assemble into ordered crystalline structures when suspended in water or other liquids.  This can result in remarkable optical properties, as illustrated by the colors of opals, which are naturally-occurring colloidal crystals that have dried out.  The goal of this project was to understand how the self-assembly of these particles can be programmed and controlled by coating them with very short strands of DNA.  Under this project we designed and built a total internal reflection microscope (TIRM) to study the interactions between DNA-coated colloidal particles and flat glass substrates that are also coated with DNA.  The instrument can detect attractive and repulsive interactions between colloids and a substrate over the relavant length scales, which extend from about 2 to 100 nanometers.  In addition to measuring the interactions between the DNA strands on the particles and substrates, the instrument also shows that charging of the particles and the substrate, the concentration of salt in the water, as well as the electric polarizability of the particles and substrate, play key roles in determining and controlling how DNA-coated particles interact and bind to each other.  The project also developed a new and versatile method to synthesize colloidal particles so that only a specific area a particle is coated with DNA.  The area that is coated can be precisely controlled, which facilitates the formation of a diverse set of structures, including small round clusters of spheres, long threads of colloidal spheres, and bilayers of colloidal spheres, many of these being assembled for the first time.  These assemblies serve as models that show how proteins and other biological and non-biological molecules assemble into useful structures.
