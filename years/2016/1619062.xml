<AbstractNarration>As integrated circuits (ICs) have progressed to finer feature sizes and higher levels of integration, interconnect has become a major challenge in IC technology development. Various interconnect solutions developed to date have not yet been able to replace Copper (Cu) interconnects due to their limitations in performance and/or difficulties in fabrication. In this project, novel Copper, Graphene, Transition Metal Dichalcogenide (TMD) hybrid interconnects will be demonstrated and explored by both simulations and experiments, which can compete with Cu nanowires with the same dimensions, and meanwhile have the potential to become the ultimate interconnect solution. The students who participate in this work will be trained with a broad range of skills to sustain future nanotechnology advancement. Education and outreach activities such as inclusive curriculum and culturally relevant teaching, Nano Days in the Birck Nanotechnology Center at Purdue, are also being developed to actively engage women and under-represented minorities into Science and Engineering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The entire physical process that takes place in a Cu/Graphene/TMD interconnect is yet to be fully understood. The challenge is to understand intricate interactions between multiphysics phenomena involving circuits, electromagnetics, materials, electron transport, and thermal diffusion in a broad band of frequencies. Experimentally, a rapid low-temperature process is critical to preserve the structural integrity of the Cu nanowires during deposition and will be studied. To conquer the aforementioned challenges, multiphysics simulation algorithms and experimental methods will be pursued. On the experimental side, a low temperature chemical vapor deposition recipe, along with a plasma enhanced process, will be developed. Electrical and thermal transport measurements will be performed and correlated with simulations.</AbstractNarration>
