<AbstractNarration>This is a proposal to analyze the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS) in order to bring to light important ways in which infrastructures adapt to changing scientific and social knowledge, and how such knowledge changes the way the object of study is understood. The researcher will use both archival and ethnographic research methods in carrying out the analysis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results of this research will be of interest not only to scientists interested in the relatively recent history of HIV/AIDS, but also political scientists, sociologists, organizational theory experts, and a wide-range of health policy experts. The results of the study will have substantial potential to impact science policy by providing insights for improving the design of future research infrastructure investments.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project was an ethnographic and historical investigation of three research infrastructures that support the investigation of AIDS, founded over thirty years ago and continuing in the present. The primary focus was the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS), with additional focus on the Womens Interagency HIV Study (WIHS) and the North American AIDS Cohort Collaboration on Research and Design (NA-ACCORD).  The theoretical goal of this research was to comparatively examine success and failure cases to understand how research infrastructures can withstand dramatic changes to their objects of investigation while continuing to support new science. A more practical goal was to develop an understanding of how to design flexible, resilient and robust research infrastructure.   The primary outcome of this research was the development of an analytical framework called 'the kernel of a research infrastructure,' a framework published as two publications directed at the Science and Technology Studies (STS) and Computer Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW) scholarly communities. The kernel framework focuses on the stable provision of key resources for the investigation of changing objects of investigation over time. For instance, over the past 30+ years, the MACS has sought to generate standardized and comparable data and specimens about HIV disease, and over time has relied on those same data and specimens to investigate a multitude of scientific objects. The kernel framework explains how a research infrastructure that is 'doing the same thing? over time can support the investigation of many scientific objects, even those that were unfathomable at the time of creation of that research infrastructure.
