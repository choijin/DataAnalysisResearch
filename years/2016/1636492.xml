<AbstractNarration>This project will assess the impact of trade reform and globalization on forest biomes in tropical locales that have experienced profound economic changes over the past several decades.  The investigators will analyze how maize (corn) and beef production chains have evolved as a consequence of changing trade policies and global economic forces and will link these factors to changes in the spatial distribution of forest cover across different regions.  This project will provide new insights into the processes through which some forests experience deforestation while other areas exhibit forest recovery in response to evolving geographies of maize and beef production that have been strongly influenced by changing international trade patterns.  The project will enhance basic understanding of the complex forest dynamics in which both deforestation and forest recovery occur simultaneously, and it will demonstrate the impact of trade reform and globalization on forest cover at a national scale, thereby offering an analysis of natural system dynamics during a time of global market integration.  The project will provide education and training opportunities for graduate students, and project results will make available valuable information for policy makers seeking to maintain and enhance environmental quality during times of significant economic change.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;International trade agreement, globalization, and policy reform have reconfigured production systems for important commodities by opening national and international markets.  These changes impact land-use systems, with implications for natural landscapes.  Mexico has experienced trade liberalization and globalization following the General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs and the North American Free Trade Agreement.  Other policy initiatives, such as the privatization of communal lands, have intensified environmental and social impacts.  The investigators will examine how these kinds of reforms have refigured Mexico's land-change regime, which play a critical role as factors influencing the deforestation and forest recovery processes.  Key questions to be pursued by the investigators are (1) How have trade reform and other economic policies affected the territoriality of maize and beef production chains?  (2) To what extent does evolving chain territoriality explain the simultaneous loss and gain exhibited by forest biomes over recent decades?  The investigators will gather data using a range of approaches, including statistical analyses of data on feedlots, spatial land-cover data for different forest biomes, and government census information.  Although the research project will focus on economic and environmental system dynamics in Mexico, project findings will provide new insights for examination of comparable issues in the U.S. and elsewhere, and it will help enhance U.S. domestic and foreign policy.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 7.5pt; margin-left: 0in;"><span style="color: black;">Mexico has evolved from a protected economy to an open one following trade liberalization, induced in large part by the implementation of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). Economists have argued that free trade helps an economy while others argue that it represents a subsidy to capital and the poor suffer consequences. There is also disagreement about how free trade affects the environment. Some argue that the impact is positive given open markets stimulate productivity enhancements in agriculture. The argument is that this encourages land sparing, which in turn reduces rates of deforestation by Borlaug&rsquo;s Hypothesis, named after the architect of the&nbsp;<em>Green Revolution</em>. However, interpreting the implication of three of our project findings leads us to conclude that NAFTA has failed to spare land, in our view the most important outcome of our research. This might appear surprising because Mexico&rsquo;s deforestation rate has declined. Much of the intellectual merit of the project, as well as its broader impacts, stem from the land sparing question.</span></p> <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 7.5pt; margin-left: 0in;"><span style="color: black;">The first finding of relevance to this issue is our determination of the productivity gains in maize and beef production after NAFTA. Between 1990 and 2016, maize production rose from 10.2 to 31.2 million metric tons, while production area decreased 87,000 to 84,000 km<sup>2</sup>. This implies a productivity increase from 1.7 to 3.7 tons/hectare. As for beef, the project showed that today&rsquo;s feedlot system requires 6.98 hectares per animal for 450 days (1.2 years), from calving to slaughter. The pre-NAFTA grass-fed system required 16.3 hectares per animal over 1050 days (2.9 years). These translate into stocking densities of .06 and .14 animals/hectare, a productivity increase &nbsp;&gt;100%. In other words, each animal in Mexico today needs 50% less land than before. Despite this reduction, our second finding of interest is that Mexico&rsquo;s cattle economy now requires more land than before NAFTA, presumably due to export growth and new domestic demand. Pastures have expanded ~120,000 km<sup>2</sup>, swamping the reported decrease in Mexican land under maize from 87,000 km<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;to 84,000 km<sup>2</sup>. </span></p> <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 7.5pt; margin-left: 0in;"><span style="color: black;">Our third relevant finding adds to this difference between expansion and contraction in land use. Specifically, the project established that contraband cattle from Central America play a key role in the Mexican production chain. Using information collected from federal inspection stations, backed up by fieldwork in the State of Chiapas, we determined that ~1.4 million feeder cattle crossed into Mexico from Guatemala (in 2014), 36% of the 4 million feeder animals required yearly by Mexican feedlots. These cattle need ~102,000 km<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;of pasture beyond the borders of Mexico, a number exceeding the ~53,000 km<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;of Mexican deforestation occurring between 1985 and 2014. Although we cannot be sure that the pastures in question are responsible for forest conversion in Central America, their expansion between 1990 and 2016, nearly 4000 km<sup>2</sup>yr<sup>-1</sup>, exceeds the region&rsquo;s deforestation rate for the period. It also exceeds the yearly decline in Mexican deforestation following NAFTA. The project outcome resides in showing through three of our findings that changes in agricultural production systems in Mexico, following trade liberalization, now require more land than before, and have not spared it. Further, any resulting deforestation manifests in Central America as well as in Mexico. The project established this by revealing the complex geography of Mexico&rsquo;s maize-cattle complex, a telecoupled system in which the Mexican beef supply chain relies on transnational inputs (corn from the U.S.; calves from Central America) to meet global demands for beef. Image 1 illustrates these project-discovered spatial connections.</span></p> <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 7.5pt; margin-left: 0in;"><span style="color: black;">The implication of our findings is that trade liberalization may enhance productivity but increase land use at the same time, leading to deforestation. This delineates a project outcome with the potential for broad and significant impact in the policy arena, especially with respect to the Paris Climate Agreement. The Agreement&rsquo;s action steps are based on nationally determined contributions, which makes sense from the perspective of national sovereignty but is limited by myopia. Mexico&rsquo;s national contributions include 0% deforestation by 2030. Our findings pose a question: should this 0% apply just to Mexico or be stretched to the region as a whole including Central America? This question is relevant to all signatories of the Agreement whose national contributions are based, in part, on principles of the UN-REDD Programme. Our project shows that the design of policy to mitigate climate change must carefully account for the transnational nature of contemporary supply chains. Market integration may raise per-capita incomes but it also provides opportunities for the concealment of environmental harms via telecoupling. </span></p> <!-- @font-face  {font-family:"Cambria Math";  panose-1:2 4 5 3 5 4 6 3 2 4;  mso-font-charset:0;  mso-generic-font-family:roman;  mso-font-pitch:variable;  mso-font-signature:-536870145 1107305727 0 0 415 0;}@font-face  {font-family:Calibri;  panose-1:2 15 5 2 2 2 4 3 2 4;  mso-font-charset:0;  mso-generic-font-family:swiss;  mso-font-pitch:variable;  mso-font-signature:-469750017 -1073732485 9 0 511 0;}p.MsoNormal, li.MsoNormal, div.MsoNormal  {mso-style-unhide:no;  mso-style-qformat:yes;  mso-style-parent:";  margin:0in;  margin-bottom:.0001pt;  mso-pagination:widow-orphan;  font-size:12.0pt;  font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;  mso-ascii-font-family:Calibri;  mso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin;  mso-fareast-font-family:Calibri;  mso-fareast-theme-font:minor-latin;  mso-hansi-font-family:Calibri;  mso-hansi-theme-font:minor-latin;  mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman";  mso-bidi-theme-font:minor-bidi;}p  {mso-style-noshow:yes;  mso-style-priority:99;  mso-margin-top-alt:auto;  margin-right:0in;  mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto;  margin-left:0in;  mso-pagination:widow-orphan;  font-size:12.0pt;  font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;  mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";}.MsoChpDefault  {mso-style-type:export-only;  mso-default-props:yes;  font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;  mso-ascii-font-family:Calibri;  mso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin;  mso-fareast-font-family:Calibri;  mso-fareast-theme-font:minor-latin;  mso-hansi-font-family:Calibri;  mso-hansi-theme-font:minor-latin;  mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman";  mso-bidi-theme-font:minor-bidi;}div.WordSection1  {page:WordSection1;} --><br> <p>            Last Modified: 03/06/2021<br>      Modified by: Robert&nbsp;T&nbsp;Walker</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Image         </div> <div class="galControls onePhoto" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation onePhoto" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1636492/1636492_10456197_1614981914123_FinalReport3FigureSpatialLinkages--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1636492/1636492_10456197_1614981914123_FinalReport3FigureSpatialLinkages--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Mexico's Telecoupled Beef Production System"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1636492/1636492_10456197_1614981914123_FinalReport3FigureSpatialLinkages--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Mexico's Telecoupled Beef Production System"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">This image reveals the transnational configuration of Mexico's beef production system following trade liberalization</div> <div class="imageCredit">Mike Waylen</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Robert&nbsp;T&nbsp;Walker</div> <div class="imageTitle">Mexico's Telecoupled Beef Production System</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
