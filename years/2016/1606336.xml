<AbstractNarration>NONTECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;The Division of Materials Research, the Division of Chemistry, and the Division of Advanced Cyberinfrastructure contribute funds to this award which supports computational research, computer algorithm and software development, and education to develop software that will predict properties of materials made from a class of nanoparticles - tiny particles with dimensions some 10,000 to 100,000 times smaller than a human hair and in this case include long chain molecules, such as DNA, in their structure.  The nanoparticles are arranged in regular spatially periodic arrays known as superlattices. Because of the internal structure of each nanoparticle, these nanoparticle superlattices can have unique physical and chemical properties that are difficult or impossible to achieve with ordinary crystals of atoms and simple molecules. Understanding nanoparticle superlattices can lead to the ability to design light but very strong materials, engineer efficient solar or hydrogen cells or identify and destroy cancer tumors, just to name a few.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research focus of this award is to develop a comprehensive theoretical and computational framework for the prediction of the structure, dynamics and properties of nanoparticle superlattices. The PI will combine new theories with start of the art computational tools developed by the PI. The research will include close collaborations with leading experimental groups. The expected impact of the research is to advance toward the capability to predict the properties of nanoparticle materials and to design novel nanoparticle materials and interfaces with new or given properties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI will collaborate with the SUCCESS program of the Des Moines public school system. Students are identified and referred to the SUCCESS program based on the DMPS Early Indicator System which identifies students who are at risk of dropping out of school due to poor attendance, lack of identification to school/behavior, poor or failing grades, and low achievement scores. The PI will organize several STEM activities for SUCCESS kids, both in Des Moines and Iowa State University, and also convey that pursuing a college education is a very valuable goal. Other educational activities include recruitment of high school students for STEM fields, making computational tools available to non-specialists, and mentoring of undergraduate and graduate students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TECHNICAL SUMMARY &lt;br/&gt;The Division of Materials Research, the Division of Chemistry, and the Division of Advanced Cyberinfrastructure contribute funds to this award which supports computational research, cyberinfrastructure development, and education focused on developing a computational framework that makes it possible to design materials made of nanoparticle superlattices. The PI's will focus on nanoparticles that have grafted ligands comprised of hydrocarbon chains or DNA. The research combines theory and algorithms with experiments to develop a realistic description of the dynamics of formation and thermodynamics of nanoparticle superlattice materials. The goals of this project will be achieved by developing HOODLT, software for Graphics Processor Units (GPUs) that facilitates the exact calculation of free energies, which will be in turn used to predict nanoparticle superlattice structure with simple and universal potentials. The PI will also develop HOOSRIS, software for GPUs that will implement a new microscopic theory for the interaction between the capping ligands grafted to the nanoparticles, which determine the actual structure and many of its physical properties. The role of two-body versus many-body potentials will also be investigated. The last goal of the project is the combination of these developments to the prediction of superlattices with given and/or new structural and physical properties. Although the project is mostly focused on nanoparticles where the capping ligands are hydrocarbons, the methods are general and can also be applied to DNA mediated programmable self-assembly or other strategies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI has a long commitment to promoting STEM activities for under-represented groups and minorities. As part of this project, a series of hands-on activities, focused on materials and nanomaterials for airplanes, will be carried out with kids from the SUCCESS program of the Des Moines public school. Rigorous evaluation and assessment on the impact of these activities will be carried out every year, and the activities modified accordingly. Other broader impact activities include making software available to the broader community, both for technical and non-technical audiences. The project will also support and mentor graduate and undergraduate students.</AbstractNarration>

Over the last twenty years there has been extraordinary progress in the fabrication of large numbers of mono disperse nanoparticles, which has allowed the engineering of new materials whose components are these tiny nanoparticles.

This is the challenge that this grant addressed.</p> <p>The most important accomplishments for the grant is the development of a full theoretical approach to predict the precise structure of general&nbsp;nanoparticle&nbsp;materials, the Orbifold Topological Model (OTM), which is outlined&nbsp;in the main figure.&nbsp; Basically, nanoparticles can be regarded as hard spheres, like rigid billiard balls, except when configurations of splayed ligands, the vortices, are present. The situations that lead to vortices&nbsp;has been described and in that&nbsp;case the hard sphere description breaks down and the packing highly exceeds that of hard spheres.&nbsp;</p> <p>Another important accomplishment is the description of long range ordered structures of nanoparticles, i.e. superlattices, in terms of disclinations&nbsp;in a higher dimensional space, leading to Quasi Frank Kasper phases, which also enable to establish a connection with the physics of glasses.&nbsp;As shown in the picture, where the phase diagram of a binary system of Lennard-Jones particles is investigated, we have also developed tools for discovery of new structures. Also, on the right figure shows the excellent agreement between the experiments in the Talapin group at the University of Chicago and the predictions from theory.</p> <p>We have developed a new software, HOODLT, which incorporates the OTM and also simplifies molecular dynamics simulations of nanoparticle systems. Using the software, we have provided a detailed verification of the OTM, as shown in the figure, where the free energy as a function of lattice constant is calculated by integrating the pressure (above plot). The minimum defines the equilibrium lattice constant, which is in excellent agreement with the prediction from OTM. We have also simulated nanoparticles functionalized with other ligands, like&nbsp;Polystyrene, which show a "cascade effect" see the figure, consisting of ligands that wrap around from behind and engulf the nearest neighbor nanoparticle.</p> <p>Dynamics of assembly are also fundamental; it is necessary to understand what are the factors that determine assembly of high quality materials.&nbsp; We have analyzed the case of&nbsp;assembly is solvent evaporation,&nbsp; one of the most successful strategies for assembly, where a stable solution of nanoparticles is slowly but completely evaporated leaving behind an equilibrium structure. Using HOODLT, we have simulated this process and characterized the resulting equilibrium clusters. In the&nbsp; figure a cluster of&nbsp;28 nanoparticles&nbsp;is obtained by solvent evaporation from octane. Our work&nbsp;has also shown how the relaxations slow down significantly in the latest stages of evaporation, proportionally to the number of nanoparticles&nbsp;to the 2/3 power,&nbsp;breaking down the well known Maxwell theory of evaporation, which would imply relaxation times that are independent on the number of nanoparticles.</p> <p>The broader impacts of the grant have had remarkable accomplishments also.
