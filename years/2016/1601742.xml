<AbstractNarration>Hartnell College's NSF Advanced Technological Education (ATE) program will advance and expand agricultural sciences technician training by implementing a food safety technician program and seed science technician program.  The project will enroll 35 students in each new program by year three; achieve an 80 percent persistence rate; and engage at least 125 high school students per year through participation in program activities. It will be implemented through: aligned, articulated and new curricula; secondary school program enhancement; new faculty; intense outreach; hands-on workshops; extensive industry partnerships; academic counseling; cohorts/learning communities; faculty mentors; industry internships; academic and student support services; industry networking; professional development; and evaluation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will address critical current and future needs in one of the world's most productive agricultural regions by: building on current programs and infrastructure to develop two high skill, high demand agricultural science technician programs that will meet current industry shortages; linking the project to high schools using a modified 2+2 structure, with a university transfer option; helping industry better respond to changing environmental and regulatory conditions; building on successful ATE models for high skill science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) technician training programs; helping the nation improve its food production and food safety capabilities; and providing access to STEM careers for a largely low income, underrepresented population. The project will contribute to the knowledge and understanding of effective methods to improve low income and underrepresented student achievement in STEM.  The project evaluation study will use data analytics resulting in qualitative and quantitative data on, and assessment of, program effectiveness. This will support adaptation and replication.</AbstractNarration>

Articulated STEM course sequences and course outlines for two agricultural science technician pathways starting with Dual Enrollment in the rural high schools, into college certificate and degrees in Associate of Science for Transfer Degree in Plant Science with the California State University system and an Associate of Science in Agriculture was updated with an emphasis in Food Facilities Safety and Horticultural Technician (seed development). Transfer opportunities are now accepted at all CSU with employment options at A.S. or B.S. level attainment.  This project integrated new technologies in targeted agricultural sciences curricula to foster a qualified, sustainable, high skill agriculture workforce.  Annually Hartnell College hosted the Salinas Valley Ag Tech Summit, attended by more than 600 people with a stake in technology?s pivotal role in agricultural production. These annual summits underscored the importance of agricultural technology to our mission of education and public service, including the need for innovation to help feed a world population expected to reach 9.7 billion by 2050.  This project helped prepare a new generation of agricultural scientists and technicians to address problems and challenges associated with food safety, security, and supply; climate change; and new regulations by increasing student exposure and participation in AG Summits, field days and conferences.  Hartnell College utilizes a two-tier advisory system.  The Agricultural Steering Committee is comprised of C-level executives that provide visioning for the department.  The Food Safety and Agriculture Production advisory committees assist with identifying skills needed for employment within the particular industry sectors.   The Ag Steering committee recommended that Hartnell College focus on the Associate of Science for Transfer in Plant Science and the Associate of Science in Agriculture with the emphasis in Food Safety and Horticultural Technician.  The acceptance of the Associate of Science for Transfer degree in Plant Science with the guaranteed acceptance to the California State University System and the updating of the Associate of Science in Agriculture Degree with an emphasis in Food Safety and Horticultural Technician, were major accomplishments.  Another accomplishment was the 2+2 program with California State University Monterey Bay.  The Plant Science/Soil Science program will begin during the 2020-2021 academic year with 15 Hartnell College transfer students.   A valuable aspect of this grant is the collaboration along the continuum of high schools, of community college and to university. Dual Enrollment, AB 288, contracts have been signed with every Hartnell district high school.   Hartnell College utilizes many student support initiatives including: Starfish, an early alert program; Panther Learning lab featuring computers, study tables, online and in person tutorials; online, just-in-time, math and English courses targeted to agricultural students; Math Academy to improve math skills; MESA (mathematics, engineering, science achievement) offering tutoring and student support specifically for STEM students.   The Career Prep and Placement Services staffed with a full time Coordinator and a full time Cooperative Work Experience faculty opened at the Alisal Campus. Students were able to access services through workshops, drop-ins, and by appointment.  There were 225 internship placements during the grant cycle.  Project staff worked closely with the Director of Institutional Research to track students. Tracking is still limited, but we are reporting 100% of CTE students into the state reporting system where every student is surveyed by the state.   The timing of this grant aligned well with other resources becoming available to Hartnell College.
