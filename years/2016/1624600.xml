<AbstractNarration>The Kewalo Marine Laboratory (KML) is one of only three marine research facilities in the state of Hawaii, which uses modern molecular techniques along with other laboratory and field-based research to understand basic principles of marine biodiversity, resilience and ecosystem responses.  Faculty, postdoctoral associates, undergraduate and graduate students and visitors are all involved in research of fundamental importance and applied value for academic, environmental, biomedical and conservation science.  Research at the Kewalo Marine Laboratory uses marine organisms to study a variety of biological phenomena and processes that range from molecules to ecosystems.  The common thread in all KML research programs is the important use of molecular techniques that require specific instrumentation to detect, quantify, and manipulate small quantities of rare and precious biomaterials from organisms maintained in a high quality flow through sea water system.  New and upgraded equipment and instrumentation will help KML users keep pace with ever-evolving molecular techniques and associated research opportunities through access to new multi-user instruments and an upgraded flowing seawater system and will enhance and expand research and training capabilities at KML. The instruments will allow students and trainees to employ cutting edge technologies to address fundamental problems in cellular, developmental, evolutionary, and environmental biology of the unique Hawaiian marine biodiversity.  The improvements will also support training programs for Native Hawaiian and Pacific Island students who are highly under-represented in the STEM disciplines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Marine laboratories provide unprecedented access to a diversity of organisms and associated research opportunities unavailable at most research universities.  At the Kewalo Marine Laboratory, uniquely situated adjacent to living coral reefs near downtown Honolulu, researchers and their trainees use modern cellular and molecular approaches to investigate a wide variety of basic biological phenomena using a full range of marine organisms, including molluscs, annelids, flatworms, reef corals and marine microbes. The new instruments and seawater facilities will not only facilitate research by the resident researchers of KML (and their diverse undergraduate, graduate students and postdoctoral fellows), but will bolster the active Visiting Scientist program.  Improvements will be used to support both research and training efforts, allowing a diverse group of students to gain a better understanding of key biological processes that will help in the preservation of unique local and regional marine ecosystems.  Additional details on the facility, and associated research and training programs can be found on the KML website:   http://www.kewalo.hawaii.edu/index.php</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ FSML Outcomes  The funds provided to the Kewalo Marine Laboratory (KML) by the National Science Foundation under the Field Stations and Marine Laboratories program were used to purchase key equipment, upgrade our seawater system and provide dedicated access to the University of Hawaii?s supercomputer, supporting molecular research that requires the application of advanced bioinformatics. These upgrades and improvements have increased the research, training and service capabilities of the facility.  The Kewalo Marine Laboratory is one of the few "urban" marine laboratories in the U.S., situated within a modern city and adjacent to thriving coral reefs and other coastal marine ecosystems.  The KML is a full-time research facility under the University of Hawaii at Manoa, with faculty that study a range of biological phenomena at scales from molecules to ecosystems.  The specific equipment purchased included a real-time PCR machine and a state-of-the-art ultra-centrifuge.  The application of molecular techniques and technologies are at the core of KML-based research, and support studies in microbiology, symbioses, developmental biology, genomics, proteomics and transcriptomics.  The importance of the microbiome in all aspects of organismal biology has recently been recognized as one of the key areas of study for both human and environmental health.  The KML faculty includes world-renowned researchers on the leading edge of marine microbiology.  Genomic studies center on the genetic makeup of organisms and are used to identify biodiversity and changes that may occur naturally or in response to human activities.  Proteomics is the study of proteins that are produced by organisms as a result of their genetics, but that can differ among populations of organisms, among individuals within a population, and within a single organism at different times of its life cycle or in response to environmental changes.  Transcriptomics studies address changes in specific gene expression over space and time.  All of these areas of research provide valuable information that advance our basic understanding of nature as well as data of tremendous practical value in addressing natural resource decline in the face of mounting human pressures on coral reefs and other marine ecosystems.  When data from these studies are applied in a forensic or diagnostic manner, KML researchers can determine cellular and genetic responses to a variety of environmental stressors and use this information to help guide managers and policy makers.   The ultra-centrifuge is shared equipment used by all of the KML research groups as well as numerous visitors, and the real time PCR apparatus is likewise broadly used.  The dedicated nodes to the University of Hawaii?s supercomputer are used by faculty, students and postdocs to analyze the large datasets generated by the ongoing molecular research and provide learning opportunities as part of the research mentoring programs at the Laboratory.  The upgrades to the seawater system, central to all of the marine research performed at KML, have more than doubled water table space, and the replacement of pipes, valves and distribution lines provides critical security for the numerous ongoing experiments and cultivation activities supported by Federal and state funding agencies.   Additionally, the equipment purchased and upgrades provided under this grant will help train our students and postdocs that comprise the next generation of researchers, educators and resource managers, who benefit from KML?s educational programs.  The facility supports numerous undergraduate and graduate students as well as postdoctoral researchers on a daily basis, all of whom have access to the equipment as essential tools to support completion of their studies, theses and dissertations.  KML runs a number of formal educational programs and has a long history of NSF training grants, including past Undergraduate Research Mentoring (URM), and active Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) and Advanced Technological Education (ATE) programs that focus on increasing participation of under-represented minority students in the STEM disciplines, particularly Native Hawaiians, Pacific Islanders and women.  The results of research supported by the new equipment purchases and upgrades will be shared with the scientific community and partnering state, Federal and international agencies in supporting their management, policy and enforcement mandates, as well as the broader community of stakeholders, from fishers to surfers, to meet information needs supporting their quality-of-life concerns.
