<AbstractNarration>1638258&lt;br/&gt;Allen, David T.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Production of natural gas and natural gas co-products has been enhanced dramatically in the United States, enabled by technologies such as horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing of shale formations. This transformation in the production of shale gas and oil is directly impacting US fuel distribution, electrical generation, and water distribution infrastructures, and is expanding fuel exports. These collective changes in water, electricity and fuel infrastructures will also impact agricultural production and air quality. This project will assess the robustness and resiliency of international, interdependent, natural gas infrastructures, infrastructures needed to provide electrical energy, and the interaction of these fuel and electricity infrastructures with water systems, agricultural activity, and air quality. Using the case study of the border between Mexico and the United States, the project will examine the opportunities and constraints imposed on international infrastructures by trade policies and shared water and air resources. The project will employ advanced simulation and visualization tools to assess and communicate information concerning the state of the infrastructures. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will create coupled fuel, electricity, water and air quality models for Texas and eastern Mexico, develop visualization tools to depict the interactions of these multi-layer, multi-resource, multi-timescale, multi-geographical scale models, and use the coupled models to test the resiliency of the multiple integrated systems to natural perturbations and trade policy scenarios affecting water and energy markets. Decision support tools that will help decision-makers will be created and deployed, and new educational materials that promote a better understanding of interdependent fuel, electricity, water and food infrastructures will be crafted. The educational materials will take multiple forms including course modules, videos, radio and television segments and open access courses. Multiple audiences will be targeted including researchers, graduate students, undergraduate students, and the general public. Dissemination avenues will include television, public radio, web, and direct interactions with teachers and the general public. Decision support tools will be applied to examine strategic decisions associated with changing infrastructures.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Production of natural gas and natural gas co-products has increased dramatically in the United States, enabled by horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing of shale formations. This transformation in the production of shale gas and oil is directly impacting US fuel distribution, electrical generation, and water systems, and is expanding fuel exports.  This project assessed international, interdependent, natural gas infrastructures, infrastructures needed to provide electrical energy, and the interaction of these fuel and electricity infrastructures with water systems, and air quality.  Focusing on the United States-Mexico border region, the project examined impacts on shared water and air resources of increased hydrocarbon production.  The project coupled fuel, electricity, water and air quality models for Texas and northern Mexico, and used the coupled models to test the response of the integrated systems to infrastructure and policy scenarios.  Project outcomes included assessments of:  the impacts of increased natural gas production on generation in the Texas electrical grid; these analyses accounted for the limited capacity for electricity transmission to deliver power generated in the hydrocarbon producing regions to the major urban areas where electricity is used the impacts of increased natural gas liquids (ethane, propane, butanes) production on the Texas electrical grid and chemical manufacturing operations; these assessments focused on the competition between electricity generation, liquid fuel production and chemicals production as end uses for natural gas liquids produced in the border region the impact of limited water availability in the border region on the potential for freshwater use in hydraulic fracturing; these analyses mapped regions where insufficient groundwater and water from the Rio Grande is available to support widespread use of fresh water in hydraulic fracturing  onshore and offshore hydrocarbon production in Mexican basins on ozone and fine particulate matter concentrations across Mexico and in Texas and other U.S. border states; an analysis of projected oil and gas development as an outcome of Mexico?s energy reform policies was conducted.        projected changes in Mexico?s electricity grid and fuel mix over a fifteen-year planning horizon on emissions and air pollutant concentrations across Mexico and in Texas and other U.S. border states. gaps in the U.S. National Emissions Inventory Collaborative modeling platform in the representation of Mexico?s energy sector emission sources.      Prior to this work, the impacts of expanded availability and use of natural gas and natural gas liquids on infrastructures and environmental systems in the border region were largely unmapped.  This work has developed a quantitative understanding of the implications of the transformations that increased production of hydrocarbons are driving.     The information resources developed by the project have been integrated with analyses performed for the environmental regulatory agency for the State of Texas and by the operator of the Texas electrical grid.
