<AbstractNarration>This project will use Blue Waters to enable transformative simulations that will answer several compelling science questions in plasma physics.  These questions include: &lt;br/&gt;1. Can laser plasma instabilities be controlled or even harnessed in inertial fusion plasmas? &lt;br/&gt;2. What are the collective processes responsible for the formation of shocks in collisionless plasmas, &lt;br/&gt;3.Can plasma-based acceleration be the basis of new compact accelerators for use at the energy frontier, in medicine, in probing materials, and in novel light sources?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will use a suite of fully kinetic plasma simulation tools developed by the team to answer these questions. In particular, the plasma simulation tools are based on particle-in-cell (PIC) methods which have been successful in exploring a wide range of frontier topics.  Four distinct parallel PIC codes, with varying degrees of physics approximations, will be used in the project.  All the codes are highly optimized on a single processor and have very high parallel efficiency.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In terms of the broader impact of the project, the PIC codes developed by the project could potentially be used to make scientific discoveries that impact diverse fields beyond the current investigation with significant societal impact such as high-energy physics, fusion energy, and reliability of communication satellites. Additionally, the programming abstractions developed for porting scientific codes to future massively parallel architectures will impact many others areas of scientific computing and identifying these abstractions are the first steps for possibly automating the process. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Finally, the proposed research will synergize with the new NSF funded Particle-in-Cell and Kinetic Simulation Software Center (PICKSC) at UCLA and the Institute for Digital Research and Education (IDRE). This will allow results to broadly impact research and education within the plasma particle-in-cell community and the computational science community at UCLA. The PI is currently the director of both PICKSC and IDRE.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Between September 2016 and May 2017, the UCLA simulation group has used Blue Waters resource to study highly linear and kinetic processes that occurred in high energy density plasmas, including plasma based acceleration and laser fusion.  These simulations have resulted in many high impact publications in Physical Review Letters.  In summary, Blue Water resources allow the UCLA simulation group to perform high impact research and train a new generation of plasma physicists capable of performing simulations on current and upcoming world-class supercomputers.     Some highlights from the award period include:     (1) Dr. Xinlu Xu used Blue Waters resource to study the generation of high quality electron beams (with high brightness and low energy spread) using the density downramp injection scheme.  By carefully choosing the parameters of the plasma and the driver, Blue Waters simulations show that electrons with 1GeV energy, 0.2% relative projected energy spread, and &gt;10kA current can be generated in nonlinear plasma wakes which is suitable for X-ray FEL applications which is can provide a compact radiation source for nuclear science.     (2) Dr. Weiming An studied the effects of ion motions on very high brightness beams like those required for future collider design.   In future colliders, which confines electrons within a few nanometer radius, the space charge forces around the beam can pull the plasma ions inward and generate nonlinear focus force inside the wake, which can potentially lead to beam emittance growth.   The self-consistent simulation for this problem remain a big challenge because the simulation box has a transverse size of hundreds of microns but the cell size needs to be a few nano-meters in order to resolve the electron beam, which results in a simulation box with 1011 cells.  The Blue Waters resources (because of its large memory size) is ideally suited to study this particularly demanding problem, and simulations performed on Blue Waters showed that ion motion does no necessarily lead to catastrophic emittance growth.     (3) Dr. Frank Tsung has been working with researchers at Naval Research Laboratory to study the effects of temporal bandwidth (laser smoothing) on laser plasma interactions in laser fusion.  In current inertial confinement fusion experiments, lasers can lose a large fraction of its energy to laser plasma interactions where the laser decay into a backscattered light and a plasma wave.  Our large-scale 2D OSIRIS simulations showed that, given enough bandwidth (in the order of several terahertz), laser plasma instabilities can be suppressed.  Blue Water resources allow our group to simulate, for the first time, the interaction of many speckles in 2D over several pico-seconds with beam smoothing.  The additional realism provided by these Blue Waters simulations will lead to better understanding of laser plasma interactions in current and future experiments in inertial confinement fusion.
