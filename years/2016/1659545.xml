<AbstractNarration>This project is funded from the Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Sites program in the SBE Directorate. As such, it has both scientific and societal benefits, and it integrates research and education. This project is a renewal REU Site at the University of North Texas (UNT). The Department of Political Science at the UNT runs this unique program to provide 30 undergraduate students (recruited from across the country) the opportunity to engage in graduate-level research in conflict management and peace science, in a senior faculty-mentored, in-residence, eight- week, Summer Research Experience that integrates training in civil conflict management with training in Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and geospatial analysis, and research ethics. In this program, student participants develop theoretical propositions that are tested empirically using geocoded data and report their findings in a national professional political science conference.  There is also training on research ethics incorporated as part of the program. Activities include workshops on theory development and research methodology, GIS, and the graduate school application process. There are also activities designed to build a sense of research community among students, faculty and graduate student mentors.  It is important to extend training in conflict management to all students, but particularly to populations historically underrepresented in higher education (which are growing as a proportion of the undergraduate student population). This program seeks to address the need to develop further expertise in conflict management and peace science by providing opportunities to engage in advanced empirical research to students who would not otherwise have such research opportunities. UNT is well positioned, both institutionally and geographically, to provide such access. To that end, the PI-team is cooperating with a Historically Black College/ Universities (HBCU) in Texas, Prairie View A&amp;M University, the American Political Science Association, and the Ronald E. McNair Program at UNT to assist in broadening the pool of applicants to the program, although all students with an interest in this field are encouraged to apply to the program. The growing frequency of civil conflicts in the world and the security concerns these conflicts pose for the United States, the development of human capital that is equipped to deal with these challenges is critical for the national security of the country. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual focus of the program is on civil conflict management and the enhancement of peace. Indeed since 1945 civil conflicts-civil war, revolution, secessionist war, and ethnic and sectarian violence-has replaced interstate war as the most frequent and deadly form of armed conflict in the world. The program seeks to focus on understanding the causes of civil conflict occurrence (or reoccurrence) by examining sub-state data. In particular, the goal is to train students in theory building and empirical analytical skills, which will promote innovative thinking and problem solving skills. Developing skills in geospatial analysis provides undergraduate program participants with cutting edge tools to understand the causes of conflict, and hence better prepare them to devise innovative solutions regarding civil conflict management.</AbstractNarration>

The University of North Texas (UNT) Department of Political Science is uniquely positioned, both institutionally and geographically, to offer such a program.  The program objectives for each year of the project were the following  Ten undergraduate students will engage in graduate      level research in conflict management and peace studies, in a senior      faculty-mentored, in-residence, eight-week, Summer Research Experience      (SRE) that integrates training in civil conflict management with      training in GIS. At least four of those students, or 40% will be      recruited from other colleges and universities beyond the University of      North Texas. At least four of the participants (40%) will be      recruited from colleges and universities that do not offer a Ph.D. in      political science (this is a measure of whether students come from institutions      where participants do not already have access to research opportunities) All participants (or 100%) will produce papers of      graduate level quality All participants ( or 100%) will demonstrate      improvement in the knowledge of the research process and improvement in      research skill The greatest majority of participants (66%) will apply      and gain entrance to graduate school programs.    In terms of overall outcomes of our NSF REU grant program, we had several discernable outcomes that relate directly to six project goals mentioned in our grant  First, we successfully recruited ten participants for the program for each year for a total of 30 participants (we were only authorized ten for each year so we made 100% target of goal 1 in our proposal ). Second, the majority of participants (27 out of 30) were from institutions other than the University of North Texas (thus exceeding the targeted percentage of goal 2 in our proposal). Third, 25 out of 30 (or 75%) were from primarily undergraduate institutions that do not offer a Ph.D. in political science (thus exceeding the targeted percentage of goal 3, or 40%). Fourth, 20 out of 30  students had their proposals accepted and presented research posters at the Midwest Political Science Association Annual Conference each April from 2017-2020 (the MPSA is the second largest political science conference in the country, and is a major international conference, with about 5000 participants annually). However, The Midwest Political Science Association Conference has been cancelled for April because of COVID 19, and not major conferences were held that the final cohort could attend, so unfortunately the final 10 participants were unable to attend and present at a conference. The fifth goal, that 100% of participants would demonstrate improvement in the knowledge of the research process and improvement in research skills, was measured by performance on a pretest/post test listing self assessment of research skills and a pre and post test of whether the participant could correctly identify the essential steps in a political science research project. The average score on the pretest across all 40 participants(which asked the participants to self assess their capacities in statistical analysis, familiarity with commonly used data bases; as well as familiarity with research design, hypothesis testing and writing literature reviews) collectively was a 3.4 on average on a five point scale. The post test scores were significantly higher with an average score of 4.75 out of five. Thus all participants indicated improved research skills as the result of the program Further, participants on average could only identity four of the seven major steps of the research process in the initial pretest. At the end of the program, all of the participants could correctly identify all seven major steps. Thus all participants indicated improved knowledge of the research process. We exceeded our goal for graduate student placement  in that 22 of 30 were accepted and currently attend graduate programs (our goal was that 66% of participants would apply to and gain acceptance in graduate school). This result exceeded the target specified in goal 6 as well.   The program was very successful in realizing its stated goals, and helped prepare undergraduate students for graduate study in conflict management and peace science.
