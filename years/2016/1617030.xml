<AbstractNarration>The Engineering Biology Research Consortium (EBRC) aims to bringing together the US synthetic biology community to develop the future vision for synthetic biology, catalyze leading-edge research and education programs, and promote dialogue about synthetic biology among policy-makers and public stakeholders. Biology is emerging as an important manufacturing platform for the 21st century; the market for genetically engineered products already exceeds the global semiconductor market. EBRC will conduct meetings, programs and workshops that strengthen the research and education communities; articulate compelling research visions and goals aligned with pressing national and global challenges; and engage the research and education communities, and government, industry and public stakeholders to develop and communicate ideas. EBRC will establish a forward-thinking forum at the nexus of these groups through a new non-profit organization and take on a new set of leadership challenges as synthetic biology moves from concept to reality.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;NSF funding during EBRC's initial two years will support: (1) the development of two consecutive annual engineering biology community roadmaps; (2) the development of key white papers addressing needs outlined in the recent National Academies' Industrialization of Biology report; and (3) communication activities coordinated with NSF and other US government agencies to communicate the vision and content of the roadmap and white papers.</AbstractNarration>

This effort aims to guide better-coordinated efforts throughout the U.S. government to fund and expand engineering biology research, to engage new stakeholders, and to inform the research and scientific support community about the challenges and potential of the engineering biology field.   Security and Synthetic Biology: EBRC facilitates government security stakeholder and researcher dialogue and enables processes to advance security.

Efforts are  not limited to a traditional definition of biosecurity, but include  any potential security issues that affect or are affected by engineering biology.

This focus area  serves as a focal point for international engagement, representing the U.S. engineering biology community in key international forums and processes. In the U.S., the group engages directly with government stakeholders to provide insight from the research base to promote the economic value of U.S. leadership in the field.
