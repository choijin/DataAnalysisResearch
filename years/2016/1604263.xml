<AbstractNarration>This award is made as part of the FY 2016 Mathematical Sciences Postdoctoral Research Fellowships Program. Each of the fellowships supports a research and training project at a host institution in the mathematical sciences, including applications to other disciplines, under the mentorship of a sponsoring scientist. The title of the project for this fellowship to Brian Collier is Higgs Bundles and Surface Group Character Varieties. The host institution for the fellowship is University of Maryland, and the sponsoring scientist is Richard Wentworth.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ During my NSF postdoctoral fellowship I completed many projects and started new collaborations. Notable amongst the completed projects where two papers in the field of Higher Teichm&uuml;ller theory (a field generalizing many facets of the classical theory of hyperbolic geometry) and one paper which concerns the interface between mathematics and physics. During this time I used the opportunities provided by my fellowship to furthered my career and am now an Assistant professor at University of California Riverside.  I also developed a close working relation with my postdoc mentor Richard Wentworth and we continue to work on new projects.   The two papers in Higher Teichm&uuml;ller theory were influential in the field. One proved an expanded version of an important conjecture and was joint with Nicolas Tholozan and Jeremy Toulisse. While the other laid the important foundational ground work and was joint with Steve Bradlow, Oscar Garcia-Prada, Peter Gothen and Andre Oliveira. They were published in Duke Math Journal and Invetiones Mathematicae, respectively. During the time of the grant, my collaborators and I have also developed a general program which gives a complete description of so call higher Teichm&uuml;ller spaces using Higgs bundles. This project is now almost complete and we expect it will make a substantial influence in the field.   The other paper mentioned above was joint with my NSF Postdoc mentor Richard Wentworth and was published in Advances in Mathematics. In this work we proved an expanded version of a conjecture made by the physicist Davide Gaoitto who works in quantum theory and string theory. The result states that certain holomorphic Langrangian submanifolds of two important moduli spaces are related by procedure called the conformal limit. Our mathematical approach to this conjecture has been influential for both mathematicians and theoretical physicists. In particular, we expect the work to be important in the study of both Mirror symmetry and the Geometric Langlands program when applied to the moduli space of Higgs bundles. This project has also led to a new collaboration with Laura Fredrickson and Richard Wentworth.   During my postdoc I also gave talks on my research at important conferences, notably at Nigel Hitchin's 70th birthday conference in Madrid, the GEAR senior retreat at Stanford, and at 50 years of the Narisimhan-Seshadri theorem in Chennai India. i was also invited to speak on my research in Germany, China, France, Singapore, and throughout the USA. In addition, I organized two conferences which had the broader impact of bringing together young mathematicians to build new relationships and encourage collaborations.
