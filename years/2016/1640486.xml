<AbstractNarration>The 2016 Gordon Conference on Correlated Electron Systems: New Kinds of Electronic Order in Quantum Materials will focus on current and emergent topics in condensed matter physics (CMP), spanning topics from frustrated magnetism to high temperature conductivity and materials from iridates to heavy fermions. The meeting will enable wide discussion of recent results and emergent prospects in the areas of CMP research, covering both experimental aspects as well as the theory, with a notion that novel approaches are needed in the theory of correlated systems.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Gordon Research Conference on Correlated Electron Systems is an important forum for new phenomena and techniques in the study of "quantum materials", those who electronic properties are difficult to understand from a conventional perspective. The scientific program had a balance between well-established subjects with profound, long-standing mysteries, and emerging areas that show great promise for rapid discoveries. Int he former area, the 2016 meeting included sessions on frustrated magnetism., high temperature superconductivity, and the fractional quantum Hall effect, which have all seen important developments in the past few years. In the latter category, sessions were planned on iridate and heavy fermion materials in which topological concepts are believed to play a central role, interaction effects in transition metal chalcogen materials, which have been "rediscovered" in recent years and are turning up new surprises, and new theoretical and computational approaches which may lay the groundwork for future transformative discoveries. The program reserved a session at the end for late-breaking developments which was filled just prior to the conference start date.  The focus of the Gordon Research Seminar on Correlated Electron Systems was on developments at the frontier of quantum many-electron physics, a rapidly evolving field thanks to recent breakthroughs in materials, new experimental probes, and theoretical methods. Through invited presentations and a poster session, the seminar immersed attendees in the conversation that continued with the Correlated Systems Gordon Conference.  Topics included: topological systems and Weyl semimetals, spin ice materials, complex oxides, interfaces, material design, magnetism, ultrafast behavior and control, and many body localization.
