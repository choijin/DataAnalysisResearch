<AbstractNarration>The team will use a new facility, the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), to measure the motions of gas close to supermassive black holes at the centers of galaxies.  The gas motions will be modeled to obtain precise black hole masses.  Such precision is needed to test puzzling hints that black holes grow in lock step with their host galaxies.  The precise masses will also anchor inventories of black holes in the local universe.  The team will also study the properties of the gas.  Senior team members will mentor junior members drawn from underrepresented groups; undergraduate students from California State Universities and Community Colleges will have research opportunities beyond those available in their own institutions.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The team will use ALMA's exquisite angular resolution to study molecular gas disks deep in the potential well of supermassive black holes.  Their goals are to (1) use initial ALMA observations to identify target systems with high-velocity rotation and (2) use follow-up ALMA observations to constrain the masses of the black holes and the properties of their cold, circumnuclear disks.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Supermassive black holes with masses of millions to billions of Solar masses are found in the centers of all massive galaxies, and taking an accurate census of the population of black holes in nearby galaxies provides essential information for understanding how these black holes grew over cosmic time. The goal of this project was to develop, test, and demonstrate a new method for precision measurement of black hole masses in nearby elliptical galaxies, using observations from the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). ALMA observations have the capability to measure the rotation of dense, cold disks of molecular gas in galaxy centers, at far higher resolution and sensitivity than was previously possible. These disks typically have radii of several hundred light-years, masses of about 100 million Solar masses, and orbit at speeds of up to several hundred kilometers per second. We carried out observations of several nearby giant elliptical galaxies with ALMA and also obtained new observations of these galaxies with the Hubble Space Telescope. The data were used to carry out the first detailed study using ALMA data of the physical properties and stability of these molecular gas disks in elliptical galaxies. New software was written to calculate dynamical models that simulate the orbital motion of these disks and to fit models directly to the ALMA data to determine the masses of the central black holes, and to assess the measurement uncertainties. The best demonstration of this method was the analysis of a high-resolution ALMA observation of the giant elliptical galaxy NGC 3258, where the ALMA data reveal a gaseous disk in the innermost few hundred light-years around the black hole. The disk in NGC 3258 gives evidence of rapid rotation of gas deep within the central black hole's dynamical "sphere of influence", the region in the galaxy's center where the orbital motion is dominated by the black hole's gravitational pull. Measurements and models of the gas disk rotation demonstrate the presence of a black hole of 2.25 billion Solar masses, with a statistical measurement uncertainty of less than 1% and an estimated systematic uncertainty of about 12%. This is the most precise determination of the mass of a supermassive black hole in any elliptical galaxy from any measurement method to date. The method was also applied to carry out measurements of black hole masses in other elliptical galaxies spanning a broad mass range, with black holes ranging from below 1 million to above 2 billion Solar masses. This grant supported two Ph.D. thesis projects (one completed and one in progress) and three undergraduate summer research projects at UC Irvine, representing the first astronomical research experiences for the undergraduate researchers. Undergraduate research projects were carried out in coordination with the CAMPARE summer research program.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 10/13/2020<br>      Modified by: Aaron&nbsp;J&nbsp;Barth</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Image         </div> <div class="galControls onePhoto" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation onePhoto" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1614212/1614212_10434388_1602636872496_nrao19cb04_scienceimage_V3_04012019--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1614212/1614212_10434388_1602636872496_nrao19cb04_scienceimage_V3_04012019--rgov-800width.jpg" title="ALMA detects rapid rotation of cold gas around the black hole in NGC 3258"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1614212/1614212_10434388_1602636872496_nrao19cb04_scienceimage_V3_04012019--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="ALMA detects rapid rotation of cold gas around the black hole in NGC 3258"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Illustration of Hubble Space Telescope and ALMA observations of the gas disk in the center of the giant elliptical galaxy NGC 3258.
