<AbstractNarration>CBET - 1664331&lt;br/&gt;PI: Di Carlo, Dino&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will provide partial support for young US researchers to attend the ninth Gordon Research Conference on the physics and chemistry of microfluidics, which will be held June 3 - 9, 2017 in Lucca, Italy.  Microfluidics refers to fluid handling and chemical processing on micro- and nanoscale dimensions, which, in many cases, provide significant advantages to large scale processing.  Microfluidics can be used to automate complex processes, to perform chemical reactions and separations in arrays of channels, to speed up bioanalytical processes, to process ultra-small sample volumes, to maintain precise control of synthetic processes to produce higher quality products, and to avoid formation of harmful or environmentally hazardous byproducts.  This conference will provide opportunities for US faculty members and graduate students to present their research results to an international audience, to forge new collaborations, and to meet research leaders in the field of microfluidics.  The conference will include a Gordon Research Seminar, which will provide additional opportunities for graduate students to discuss their work and interact with keynote speakers.  The conference will address fundamentals of microfluidic systems with applicability to diverse applications including water and energy sustainability, point-of-care diagnostics, microfluidics of 3D printing&amp;#8232;and biotechnology.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Session topics at the Gordon Research Conference will range from fundamental fluid interface research to more applied topics such as cell separations and analysis. Session topics will include droplet microfluidics, water and energy, point-of-care diagnostics, microfluidics of 3D printing, rare cell capture and analysis, sequencing in confined volumes, wearable and in vivo devices, cell mechanics, and fields, forces, and flows.  Researchers from a variety of academic disciplines including biomedical engineering, chemical engineering, mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, biology, chemistry, physics and materials science are expected to participate.  A special emphasis will be placed on supporting participants from underrepresented groups as well as promoting attendance from researchers at predominantly teaching colleges and universities.</AbstractNarration>
