<AbstractNarration>A request is made to fund Shipboard Scientific Support Equipment for the R/V Hugh R Sharp, a 146 foot Regional research vessel operated by the University of Delaware as part of the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS) research fleet. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The R/V Hugh R Sharp is a state-of-the-art, coastal research vessel that is owned and operated by the University of Delaware. The vessel can carry fourteen to twenty scientists on cruises up to eighteen days in duration, and supports projects from all disciplines of oceanography. The vessel is a regional asset, serving researchers from many institutions throughout the mid-Atlantic. The vessel typically operates in the coastal waters from Long Island, New York, to Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, as well as the Delaware and Chesapeake Bays. Projects occasionally require the vessel to work as far north as the Gulf of Maine, as far south as Florida, and as far offshore as Bermuda. In 2015, the R/V Hugh R Sharp completed 185 days at sea. NSF funded projects accounted for 16% of the total sailing schedule (29 days). In 2016, R/V Hugh R Sharp is scheduled for174 days with NSF days accounting for 14% (24 days) of the total sailing schedule.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Shipboard Scientific Support Equipment requested in this proposal includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mooring winch upgrade $228,180&lt;br/&gt;DGPS upgrades $27,776&lt;br/&gt;AIS upgrade $6,400&lt;br/&gt;  $262,356&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts &lt;br/&gt;The principal impact of the present proposal is under Merit Review Criterion 2 of the Proposal Guidelines (NSF 13-589). It provides infrastructure support for scientists to use the vessel and its shared-use instrumentation in support of their NSF-funded oceanographic research projects (which individually undergo separate review by the relevant research program of NSF).  The acquisition,  maintenance and operation of shared-use instrumentation allows NSF-funded researchers from any US university or lab access to working, calibrated instruments for their research, reducing the cost of that research, and expanding the base of potential researchers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This SSSE award funded the upgrade of the R/V HUGH R SHARP's Automatic Information System (AIS).  The system is part of the ship's suite of safety of navigation equipment.  The upgrade enhances the ship's ability to continue providng safe and effecient support to research missions at sea.  Broader Impacts:  The science projects supported by the Sharp will directly improve scientific understanding of the marine environment, which leads to improvements to the health and wellbeing of people living in the mid-Atlantic region and beyond.  To provide exposure to this important role, the Sharp is an integral part of the public outreach program at the University of Delaware College of Earth, Ocean, and Environment. The Sharp operations are a focal point on the waterfront during the annual "Coast Day" open house at the College, which is attended by several thousand people.   The Sharp is also instrumental in supporting NSF and UNOLS Early Career and STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math) initiatives.  In 2015, the University of Delaware and the Sharp executed a NSF funded Early Career Chief Scientist Workshop and Science Mission that received excellent reviews from the nine participants.  In 2017, the SHARP hosted seven STEMSEAS students and two instructors during a seven-day transit from a project in the Gulf of Mexico to the ship?s home port in Lewes, DE.  The students gained significant experience of what life at sea is like for a researcher, as well as the operation of oceanographic equipment and data analysis.  Many cruises on the ship are manned by undergraduate and graduate students composing the science party. The Sharp also has been available for tours of the ship by high school groups, science classes and middle school groups from the local community and neighboring states.  These efforts promote careers in science as well as general awareness of the importance of science and the ocean and coastal environment to a vibrant and healthy society.
