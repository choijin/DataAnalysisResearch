<AbstractNarration>Islands are fragile ecosystems and endemic species are particularly susceptible to extinction from environmental change and habitat exclusion from exotic species. Understanding human impacts on plant communities on island ecosystems is important because islands are often hotspots of biodiversity. This project seeks to determine the effects of urban proximity on plant species composition and diversity. The research will be conducted primarily on Ulleung Island, a small, isolated volcanic island in South Korea and will focus on understory vegetation. The research will be conducted in collaboration with Dr. Seung-Chul Kim of Sungkyunkwan University in Suwon, South Korea. Dr. Kim studies genetic relationships among plant groups, and has extensive experience conducting phylogentic and population studies on Ulleung Island. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ulleung Island, Gyeongsanbukdo, South Korea, also known as Ulleungdo, is approximately 72.9 sq km in area and hosts 685 plant taxa, including 41 taxa of rare plants and 30 taxa of endemic plants. The high biodiversity of the island makes it an excellent candidate for ecological study. In particular, studying human proximity impacts on biodiversity on Ulleungdo can illuminate the influence of anthropogenic activity from the local population and tourists on ecologically diverse temperate island ecosystems. The project involves sampling understory vegetation in deciduous, mixed, and coniferous canopy forests of varying distances from urban influence. The collected data will serve as the baseline for future study of change over time due to direct human influence (e.g. habitat disruption and exotic species introduction) and indirect human influence (e.g. altered environmental factors due to climate change). In working with Doctor Seung-Chul Kim, this project will link vegetative community research with ongoing phylogenetic research to create a more complete picture of Ulleungdo's unique flora and ecology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award under the East Asia and Pacific Summer Institutes program supports the summer research of a U.S. graduate student and is funded jointly by the National Science Foundation and the National Research Foundation of Korea.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The goal of this project was to determine the effects of human landscape development on the native plant communities in the forest of a temperate island ecosystem. Research was conducted on Ulleung Island, South Korea, during three weeks in the summer of 2016.

Habitat parameters were also recorded for each site, which included elevation, canopy type, canopy cover, canopy composition, trail name and usage, and aspect (slope and direction). The sites were later plotted on a map, from which distances to development, town, and coast were measured. Distances to development and town were the main independent factors of interest for the dependent factors of biodiversity and introduced, native, and endemic species percent cover.</p> <p>Overall, there were four significant results worth mentioning. First, introduced species cover had an inverse correlation with distance to human development, while diversity and native/endemic cover have no correlation. Second, higher introduced species percent cover correlates to lower native species percent cover, but has no correlation with species diversity or endemic species cover. Third, low-traffic trails have higher plant species diversity than medium- or high-traffic trails. Lastly, higher percent cover of the introduced tree species Black Locust (<em>Robinia pseudacacia</em>) correlates to lower species diversity in plots where the tree is present in the understory.</p> <p>While these secondary impacts of human development appear to have some effect on the forest understory of the study island, these effects are still limited and do not appear to be widespread across the island. Therefore, if conservation efforts on this island and similar islands are targeted at reducing habitat destruction, increasing ecological awareness, and limiting potentially harmful introduced species, there may be little need for costly restoration efforts to preserve diversity and at-risk species.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 03/14/2017<br>      Modified by: Desiree&nbsp;K&nbsp;Andersen</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1613885/1613885_10430455_1489543483491_koreareference--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1613885/1613885_10430455_1489543483491_koreareference--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Ulleung Island, South Korea"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1613885/1613885_10430455_1489543483491_koreareference--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Ulleung Island, South Korea"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Reference map of the location of Ulleung Island in the Sea of Japan (East Sea)</div> <div class="imageCredit">Desiree Andersen</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Desiree&nbsp;K&nbsp;Andersen</div> <div class="imageTitle">Ulleung Island, South Korea</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1613885/1613885_10430455_1489543319367_IntroducedSpecies--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1613885/1613885_10430455_1489543319367_IntroducedSpecies--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Introduced Species Map"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1613885/1613885_10430455_1489543319367_IntroducedSpecies--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Introduced Species Map"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">This map shows average introduced species cover at each survey site.
