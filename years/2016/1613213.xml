<AbstractNarration>The aim of this research program is to develop new methods of mathematical analysis and techniques for studying some nonlinear partial differential equations governing the motion of compressible flows and related applications.  Compressible fluids such as gases are ubiquitous in nature. Understanding of dynamics of compressible fluids is a crucial ingredient to prediction and control of important physical processes arising in aerodynamics, atmospheric science, astrophysics, plasma physics, biology and medicine, material science, and others. While the highly idealized one-dimensional problems are rather well understood, the general theory for the real-life multi-dimensional case is mathematically underdeveloped. The project will advance the mathematical understanding of the multi-dimensional equations of compressible flows and related problems in emerging applications. The research program will advance knowledge of the fundamental areas of mathematics and mechanics as well as applications. Graduate students will be involved in this research and trained  on the outstanding problems in the related research fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is devoted to a mathematical study of some nonlinear partial differential equations in multi-dimensional conservation laws and related applications. In particular, the study focuses on the following topics from the theory of inviscid and viscous compressible flows and related applications:&lt;br/&gt;(a) the existence and stability of vortex sheets in multi-dimensional compressible elastodynamics,&lt;br/&gt;(b) the global smooth isometric embedding of surfaces of negative curvature,&lt;br/&gt;(c) the stochastic partial differential equations of compressible flows, and&lt;br/&gt;(d) the active liquid crystal systems in biology/biophysics. &lt;br/&gt;The goal of the research is to develop novel analytic methods and efficient techniques for solving some important problems in multi-dimensional inviscid and viscous conservation laws and applications, to explore new phenomena of the motion of compressible flows, and to gain insights into the general multi-dimensional problems and emerging real-world applications.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The project focused on the  PDE problems in gas dynamics and geometry, as well as related applications. During the project period, the following problems were studied, novel analytic methods and efficient techniques were developed, and new and significant results were obtained:   (1) Isometric embedding and connections with elasticity and fluids: connections of fluids, elasticity, geometry, and the existence of wrinkled solutions; fluids, geometry, and the onset of Navier-Stokes turbulence in three space dimensions; global smooth isometric immersion of surfaces with slowing decaying curvature.  (2) Vortex sheets in compressible flows: linear and nonlinear stability of compressible vortex sheets in elastodynamics and liquid-gas two-phase flows.  (3) Active hydrodynamics in biophysics: global weak and strong solutions to the incompressible and compressible flows of active liquid crystals.  (4) Navier-Stokes-Vlasov-Fokker-Planck equations of fluid-particle flows: global strong solutions and decay for isentropic and non-isentropic flows.  (5)  Stability of supersonic contact discontinuity: stability of supersonic contact discontinuity for two-dimensional steady compressible Euler flows in a finite nozzle.  (6) Vanishing viscosity limit of viscous flows: vanishing viscosity limit to the planar rarefaction wave for the two-dimensional compressible Navier-Stokes equations.  (7) Stochastic PDEs: martingale solutions for the three-dimensional stochastic Navier-Stokes equations driven by Levy processes.  (8) Keller-Segel equations of chemotaxis: Cauchy problem and initial boundary-value problems for a system of parabolic conservation laws arising from chemotaxis in multi-dimensions.  (9) Mach limit, free-boundary with vacuum, energy equality, and micropolar flows: zero Mach number limit of the compressible magnetohydrodynamic equations, well-posedness of nonisentropic Euler equations with physical vacuum, energy equality in compressible fluids with physical boundaries, and global regularity of the three-dimensional fractional micropolar equations.
