<AbstractNarration>This award will support a workshop to promote North American collaborations in coastal reliance between researchers from the United States, Cuba, and Mexico.  The workshop will take place in Havana, Cuba, and will focus on identifying comparative strategies that can be deployed to deal with local impacts of environmental change in the Caribbean region will take place in Havana, Cuba. An interdisciplinary group of ecologists, hydrologists, oceanographers, economists, social scientists, engineers, architects, and stakeholders will discuss potential solutions to coastal resilience challenges in Caribbean communities, with a focus on South Florida, Cuba, and Mexico. The discussions of the workshop will be summarized in a publication on shared best practices and strategies for achieving resilience across coastal communities. In addition, the workshop will result in the creation of an international network of researchers working on coastal resilience across the Caribbean region. By including postdoctoral scholars and early-career researchers in the workshop as both facilitators and participants, they will have the opportunity for professional development.  Furthermore, the pipeline of scientists working on these important societal grand challenge issues will be strengthened. The workshop will engage American, Cuban and Mexican scientists, thus creating a broadly diverse group of researchers working together to develop adaptation and mitigation strategies for achieving coastal resilience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The group will discuss the state of knowledge on vulnerability of critical human and physical infrastructure to impending climate changes and projected sea level rise, as well as the gaps in research that need to be filled to enhance community resilience. The group will also focus on the urban ecology of the major coastal cities of Miami, Havana, and Cancun, with an emphasis on comparative strategies for increasing resilience in different countries. The participants will develop an integrative framework that will include natural processes, engineering/architecture, economy, social processes, and cyberinfrastructure. By using this approach, the participants aim to develop potentially transformative new perspectives to address coastal community challenges under changing climate change scenarios. Specifically, the workshop will seek to develop: 1) an improved understanding of the challenges facing Caribbean coastal regions vulnerable to climate change and sea level rise, 2) an agenda of research needed to improve the resilience and adaption of these Caribbean communities, and 3) a coordinated framework of experts poised to develop and disseminate such solutions to vulnerable communities.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goal of the trinational workshop - Enhancing Resilience of Coastal Caribbean Communities: Mitigation and Adaptation Strategies for a Changing Climate - was to bring together an interdisciplinary group of ecologists, hydrologists, oceanographers, economists, social scientists, engineers, architects, and practitioners/stakeholders to discuss potential solutions to coastal resilience challenges in Caribbean communities, with a focus on South Florida, Cuba, and Mexico. The group was to discuss the state of knowledge on vulnerability of critical human and physical infrastructure to impending climate changes and projected sea level rise, as well as the research gaps that need to be filled to enhance community resilience. The participants were to integrate among physical processes (such as new technologies for more efficient resource utilization), natural processes (such as biogeochemical and hydrologic cycles), biological processes (such as ecosystem structure and productivity), engineering/architecture (such as resilient building design), economy, social/behavioral processes (such as decision making and governance), and cyberinfrastructure systems.  By using this convergent approach, the participants were to develop potentially transformative new solutions to addressing coastal community challenges under changing climate change scenarios.   Specifically, the workshop objectives were to develop: 1) an improved understanding of the challenges facing Caribbean coastal regions vulnerable to climate change and sea level rise, 2) an agenda of research needed to improve the resilience and adaption of these Caribbean communities, and 3) a coordinated framework of experts poised to develop and disseminate such solutions to vulnerable communities.   The workshop?s proposed outcomes included publication(s) that summarize the current state of knowledge on coastal resilience strategies and identification of future research needs, as well as draft proposals for collaborative research.  The workshop took place in Havana, Cuba in September of 2017, in the recent aftermath of Hurricanes Harvey and Irma, and immediately before Hurricane Maria. A tri-national group of 35 invitees from the US, Mexico, and Cuba participated in the workshop, plus 9 organizers/facilitators, spanning a broad disciplinary range of expertise including Biological &amp; Ecological, Social &amp; Anthropogenic, Physical &amp; Coastal Processes &amp; Modeling and Engineering &amp; Architecture.  The workshop format consisted of 3 major sessions - updates from each country on the current status on coastal resilience research and efforts at building adaptive capacity, breakout group discussions on the current state of resilience research from each of the disciplinary perspectives, and cross-disciplinary breakout groups.  The group discussions focused on these 4 convergent, synthesis questions: 1) What are the unique attributes of coastal Caribbean socio-ecological systems, 2) Which adaptation strategies are best suited for coastal Caribbean disturbances, 3) What do we know about the food-energy-water nexus of Caribbean systems, and 4) What methods/tools/indicators are available for assessing resilience and sustainability of coastal Caribbean socio-ecological systems?  The key outcomes from the tri-national workshop include: 1) establishing trust between the participants from the 3 countries, 2) setting up communications pathways that enable collaboration across the cyberinfrastructure challenges faced by the Caribbean participants, 3) outline of plans for publications based on the current state of research on coastal resilience and the research gaps identified, 4) a core trinational writing team established, 5) preparation of a workshop report publication (in press), and 6) research coordination network (RCN) proposal submissions to extend the network to the greater Caribbean region.  The major broader impacts of the project include a) including early career researchers, including postdoctoral scholars, as both facilitators of the workshop and contributors to the resulting publications and proposals, b) establishing a web portal to allow exchange of documents and communications among the trinational participants, c) disseminating major findings through the publication of the workshop report, and d) the proposing a research coordination network that builds on the nascent tri-national community and include researchers from a range of cultural and ethnic backgrounds, countries/island nations, stages of career, and genders, in a broader Caribbean-wide network.
