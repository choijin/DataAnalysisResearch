<AbstractNarration>Thin metallic films of very high quality are required in the manufacture of computer chips and other high technology devices, but current methods for growing these materials are not adequate to the task at hand.  Dr. Winter of Wayne State University and his industrial collaborator, Dr. Ravi Kanjolia of SAFC Hitech, are investigating new molecules and chemical reactions that can enable the growth of thin metal films. They are especially interested in understanding how changes in the structures of the molecules affects their ability to fabricate high purity films.  The team employs a technique known as atomic layer deposition which allows metal films to be grown with precise thicknesses and spatial resolution, even in narrow and deep features required in the manufacture of computer chips. The fundamental understanding gained in this project advances the future design of new molecules to grow films and create new devices. Dr. Winter's research program attracts students at many levels, ranging from undergraduates to postdoctoral fellows, and has broader impact in educating scientists for a well-trained future workforce. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this research program, Dr. Winter of Wayne State University and his industrial collaborator Dr. Ravi Kanjolia of SAFC Hitech are supported by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry (MSN) Program to develop new precursors and deposition methods for the growth of nickel, cobalt, manganese, titanium, aluminum, and magnesium thin films by atomic layer deposition (ALD).  The project entails the synthesis and characterization of metal silyl complexes with optimized atomic layer deposition precursor properties, solution reactions of the metal silyl complexes with complementary metal complexes or organic reducing agents.  The researchers identify reactant pairs that afford metal powders, transform the solution reactions to atomic layer deposition processes, explore of selective metal growth on various substrates, and grow titanium/aluminum alloy films by atomic layer deposition. This project is in collaboration with SAFC Hitech, which enables advanced atomic layer deposition precursor evaluation, large scale precursor synthesis, advanced growth trials, and technology transfer to industry. The broader impacts involve training graduate and undergraduate students, enhancing research and education infrastructure by bringing together a collaborative group under the GOALI program that includes Wayne State University and SAFC Hitech personnel, industrial internships for Wayne State University students at SAFC Hitech, and the potential societal benefits of having new precursors and atomic layer deposition processes for electropositive metal thin films.</AbstractNarration>
