<AbstractNarration>The Environments and Metrics in Biology Education and Research (EMBER) RCN-UBE Incubator Project seeks to generate innovative measures to increase retention and diversity in the Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) workforce by capitalizing on the unique insights and collaboration of interested educators from a multitude of relevant disciplines including biology, education, psychology and sociology. Addressing STEM student retention is crucial to avoid the projected deficit in qualified workers required for a growing STEM-based economy. The US population and workforce are becoming increasingly diverse yet a lack of diversity in STEM fields is stubbornly persistent. Nationwide efforts to boost education in STEM and address the projected deficits in the STEM workforce have had mixed results. Like other STEM disciplines, approximately half of undergraduate students that enter biology majors complete their degrees. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Addressing retention and diversity will require innovative solutions that capitalize on the contributions from a variety of fields including psychology, sociology, education and STEM. The broader impacts of the project lie in forming a network that brings together experts from these fields to study the environment of the current biology STEM pipeline, and establish and assess benchmarks for inclusivity at critical points along this career trajectory. The activities of the EMBER Research Coordination Network include organizing and building a collaborating network of experts by hosting a workshop, developing a website, publishing insights generated in the workshop session, and drafting a full Research Coordination Network-Undergraduate Biology Education proposal. The focus of the project will be on retention in biology degree programs but new metrics and paradigms developed by EMBER collaborators are expected to be broadly applicable to other STEM disciplines and to STEM-based businesses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is being jointly funded by the Directorate for Biological Sciences and the Directorate for Education and Human Resources (EHR), Division of Undergraduate Education as part of their efforts to address the challenges posed in Vision and Change in Undergraduate Biology Education: A Call to Action http://visionandchange/finalreport/. This project is also co-funded by the Division of Human Resources Development (HBCU UP) in the EHR directorate.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[Inclusive Environments and Metrics in Biology Education and Research (iEMBER)  To solve difficult problems in biology, we require a diverse set of perspectives and a range of expertise. This reliance on people to solve difficult problems means that the most talented budding scientists must be recruited, prepared, and set up for success to achieve their own potential, and also to maximize the benefits that their talents can bring to solving problems. This ultimately leads to tangible benefits to society. However, special consideration toward fostering the success of individuals from populations currently underrepresented in biology is needed, to ensure we are setting ourselves up to produce the best possible teams to solve problems. Approximately half of the undergraduate students that enter biology majors either switch majors or drop out before degree completion. The attrition rate for underrepresented students is more severe, despite nationwide efforts to increase diversity among graduates in this field. Research has shown that factors such as bias, stereotype threat, and lacking a sense of belonging are contributing factors to underrepresentation of students in biology.  We have therefore laid the groundwork for the Inclusive Environments and Metrics in Biology Education and Research (iEMBER) network, to examine new ways of thinking about biology education, and to bring about reform. We take the view that education spaces are social interaction spaces and that there is a need to share current research on how social interactions in classrooms can impact students in different ways: their self-efficacy, their performance, their sense of belonging in science and their identity as scientists. There is also a need to discuss barriers to student engagement, and to brainstorm evidence-based strategies to increase equitable participation. The overall goal of iEMBER is to build a sustainable network of education, psychology, sociology and biology researchers, who also connect with with policy and program adminstrators when developing collaborations aimed at improving inclusivity and retention in biology undergraduate programs. The goal of this incubator phase was therefore to lay the framework for a full network by bringing together members of these communities to discuss next steps for our effort. Activities carried out under the iEMBER incubator project to lay the groundwork for a full RNC-UBE-Incubator proposal include: a three day workshop; a subsequent meeting report; sessions at discipline-specific conferences, and a website (iember.org) that shares efforts, invites new participants, and connects interested stakeholders with the iEMBER interaction forum. The meeting and subsequent report identified two critical areas on which to focus our immediate efforts: 1)    the need to break down silos separating these communities of researchers from each other, and from the wider scientific community. 2)    leveraging existing resources and networks through membership and active engagement in professional societies to increase inclusion and broaden participation. Intellectual Merit: The research coordination network we are forming is unique in that its focus is on planning and setting up collaborations for new research initiatives, to promote inclusion and diversity in biology, using strategies and expertise developed by experts in education, biology, psychology and sociology research fields. The network has created a forum for interaction among these researchers, and with policy leaders. This interaction will lead to the development, and execution, of novel research proposals geared toward increasing student retention and addressing the seemingly intractable lack of diversity in biology, with application to other fields in science and technology. Broader Impact: Economic projections suggest that the United States will have a deficit of skilled workers with particular scientific expertise in the coming decades. Minority groups represent a rapidly growing share of the workforce, yet the percentage of minority groups in these fields has remained stagnant or even slightly decreased in the past two decades. In order to ensure that we are able to develop the most talented workforce with the greatest potential to solve problems, we require innovative solutions to improve retention and inclusion in biology that capitalize on the contributions from a variety of fields including psychology, sociology, education and biology.
