<AbstractNarration>Title:  Travel Support for the 19th International Symposium on Field- and Flow-Based Separations Conference&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1655926 Baalousha&lt;br/&gt;The 19th International Symposium on Field- and Flow-Based Separations Conference Series was established in 1989 by John Calving Giddings at the University of Utah, the inventor of the field flow fractionation technique.  Field flow fractionation can be used for molecular and nanoscale separations, including separation of polymers,  proteins,  biomacromolecules,  pharmaceuticals,  drug  delivery  systems,  and natural  and  engineered nanomaterials and  molecules.  These materials are complex, and thus separation, isolation, and purification of these materials is also complex.  A better understanding of these materials and their properties will enable the isolation and commercialization of target materials with specific properties of interest. This conference series  is  unique  and  of  particular  importance  to  new  investigators  as  there  are  no  similar  conferences  that  address  the  broad  topic of field- and flow - based  separation  theory, method  development,  and  applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This international meeting will take place May 14-17, 2018, in Columbia, South Carolina.  Travel funds will enable speakers and students to attend the conference.  The attendees will include various sectors of the research community including academia, industry, and federal research laboratories.   The conference is organized into seven sessions over the course of three and a half days. The last day will include a general discussion symposium to discuss progress in the field and future directions.  A training session will be held the weekend before the formal programming, of interest to graduate students, post docs, and other researchers looking to expand their expertise.  The  conference   aims   to   educate   attendees   on   current   developments in   the   field,   disseminate  recent  results  and  advances in  molecular  and  nanoscale  separations,  and  to  determine future needs and directions in the field.</AbstractNarration>

The FFF2018 conference focused on new developments and applications of all forms of Field-Flow Fractionation (FFF) and related field- and flow separation techniques such as SPLITT, nanoscale flow separations, and electro-, magnetic-, acoustic-, and dielectrophoretic-driven separations. The topics covered by the conference included (1) theory and instrumentation, (2) disease diagnosis and drug delivery, (3) biological macromolecules and particles, (4) pharmaceutical formulation, (5) engineered particles: synthesis, characterization and toxicity, (6) natural nanomaterials, colloids and macromolecules, and (7) polymers and hybrid materials. The conference was attended by approximately 100 delegates from 16 different countries, including researchers from academia (faculty, postdoctoral fellows, and students), federal agencies, and industry.
