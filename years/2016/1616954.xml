<AbstractNarration>Scintillation of the stars is a physical phenomenon that everyone observes and most appreciate as a fascinating and beautiful phenomenon. Albeit well understood from a physical perspective, the phenomenon still is not rigorously described from a precise quantitative perspective. This project concerns an analogous phenomenon that arises in biomedical applications, where one needs to describe how the optical field "scintillates" and is affected by tissue microstructure in imaging studies. High-resolution biomedical imaging is fundamentally important for early cancer detection, monitoring of drug efficiency, computer assisted surgery, and for the evaluation of health of tissue, organs, and bones in general. Monitoring of glucose level, heart rate, blood pressure, and other medical indicators may in the future be optically based, and new drugs that are activated by focusing of optical energy may significantly reduce potential side effects in the treatment of cancer or diabetes.  Biological tissue is typically so complicated that one can only describe the microstructure in a statistical fashion.  In this project the complex multiscale propagation environment will be modeled as a heterogeneous multiscale random field varying in both space and time. The project will support the development of new optically based techniques in biomedical imaging by enhancing our understanding of how the optical field is affected by the microstructure. The project will also support the development of new techniques in other areas of imaging and wave propagation, such as remote sensing and communication through the atmosphere and in geophysical imaging. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the project, specific scaling relations will used to derive asymptotic descriptions of wave field statistics. The descriptions will be used in the development of optimal filtering and imaging techniques that can exploit the vast amount of data that new optical technology provides. Such a description of the wave field will have important applications in a range of areas in optics and imaging, while the focus here is on quantitative biomedical imaging. The project aims at developing new results that allow one to model optical wave propagation in complicated media. This will concern propagation both for paraxial waves and propagation in the sub-diffusive regime, moreover, propagation in the radiative transfer and diffusion regimes. The development is based on stochastic modeling of the multiscale medium and using scaling limits that allow one to characterize the statistics of the wave field. A main technical challenge in this work is the fact that in the context of waves, information flows in all directions due to wave scattering, rather than being an evolution problem as in the classic context of stochastic processes. This situation leads to an infinite family of imbedding problems that couple statistically. Novel imaging and filtering techniques that exploit spectral wave information for multi-point observations of the optical field will be analyzed and developed in the project, using the scaling limit results developed together with random matrix theory and statistical estimation techniques.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The focus of the project has been  on developing a deeper understanding for  how waves are affected by complex and random media. An example where such insight is  important is scintillation of the stars, how can one understand the process whereby the light rays are affected by the turbulent atmosphere?  Another example relates  to understanding  how  optical waves are affected by heterogeneities  associated with tissue in the context of biomedical imaging. Since the propagation media in such examples are   very complex they are   modeled  as random media described by their  statistics. The propagation media  may, moreover,  be time dependent.  In the examples mentioned the time dependence may come from  the atmosphere changing or the tissue moving.      In the project  a rigorous theory was developed that deals with the problem  of how to choose an  optical beam source to focus wave energy through a random medium. This is a problem  that has been the subject of many physical experiments in recent years, but a rigorous theory  was missing. On  the one hand we show how an optical beam can be chosen to focus  through a random medium and  what governs the quality of this  focusing, on the other hand we  show how popular model source beams   compares in their  capacity  to probe through a random medium. In the project a multi-frequency theory  for the statistics  of  the wave-field  was also developed which allowed for a quantitative  analysis of the  so called enhanced backscattering phenomenon. In this situation  a deep understanding of how  wave energy backscattered from a complex medium is distributed over directions allows one to  use observation of backscattered wave energy to infer information about the complex medium, its statistics.  The moment theory developed in the project was also used to develop a novel quantitative description for the performance of the so called  time reversal refocusing  of waves. In this case  waves are captured on a finite measurement aperture and sent back toward their  original source location   and where the quality of the refocusing at the original source is a central issue.   If the propagation medium changes with time then to analytically describe waves  that propagates through  it  is challenging.  In the project a novel theory for such a situation  was developed  when the time dependence comes  essentially from a translation of the complex medium.      Optical waves are  increasingly used in the context of  biomedical imaging and the theory for propagation and refocusing of waves in complex media has applications  in medical imaging.   High resolution biomedical imaging is fundamentally important for early cancer detection, monitoring of drug efficiency, computer assisted surgery, moreover for  the evaluation of health of tissue, organs and bones in general. The  efficient design of such techniques benefits from a deep insight into how the  probing  wave-field is affected by for instance tissue fabric.  A good understanding for how clutter, a complex and random medium,  affects a probing wave-field is also essential for  efficient design of techniques for remote sensing and in communication through the atmosphere,  moreover in geophysical imaging.
