<AbstractNarration>This project brings together US and Japanese networking researchers in a 1.5-day workshop to identify key challenges in enabling Trustworthy Networking for Smart and Connected Communities. The two focus areas of the proposed workshop are: (i) trustworthy optical networking, and (ii) trustworthy computing/networking platforms (e.g., IoT/CPS, edge cloud).  Optical networks are necessary in the core of provider and enterprise networks as data rates increase, while IoT/CPS/edge clouds are expected to dominate future access networks. Funds requested for this workshop will be used to cover workshop expenses and travel costs for only US attendees. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goals of the workshop are to identify key challenges in the focus areas of trustworthy optical networking and trustworthy computing/networking platforms for IoT/CPS and edge clouds. Specific attributes of trustworthiness include reliability, dependability, resilience, survivability and robustness. Attendees will make presentations, participate in breakout sessions to identify key challenges, and then collaborate on a workshop report. The expected outcomes include: (i) A list of key research challenges in the two focus areas of the workshop; (ii) An improved mutual understanding of research interests, research contributions, and testbeds in the two countries; (iii) An improved understanding of processes used in the two countries to enable mutually beneficial collaborations; (iv) Seeding of individual linkages; (v) An identification of research objectives and projects that are missing in one of the two countries with the goal of increasing awareness of unaddressed challenges; and (v) Workshop report.</AbstractNarration>
