<AbstractNarration>Technical Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will establish a new approach for materials simulation and modeling that links informatics methods to Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations.  The discovery of new chemistries of perovskites that possess high Curie transition temperatures are the template for this study; although the computational methodology that is being developed is generic to any class of materials problems. The approach exploits and develops statistical learning and graph theoretic methodologies to discover patterns of behavior among known materials that can be used to generate design rules for identifying structure-property relationships in new compounds; and will serve to guide and target DFT calculations to specific chemistries with the desired properties. Specifically, the project is developing a rule-based design approach, based on informatics, to identify new chemistries of high temperature piezoelectric perovskites by exploring vast chemical space, so large, that it would otherwise have been prohibitive to study by solely experimental and/or computational methods. The intellectual impact of this work will be to transform the traditional use of computational materials science from one of building large data repositories where informatics is primarily used as a search engine for compounds, to one where data science methods are used as a learning engine to uncover new physics and suggest new directions for conducting detailed computations on promising chemistries that would otherwise remain unidentified. The broader impacts of this work is to build a data science cyberinfrastructure (CI) that is called a "Materials Data Foundry" that will include models, materials metadata, and simulation capabilities that will be broadly accessible through a secure cyber infrastructure platform. The project will also involve the multi-institutional, multi-disciplinary training of graduate and undergraduate students, outreach to high-school students and teachers, and inclusion of underrepresented groups in both education and outreach efforts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Non-Technical Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The field of atomistic scale materials modeling makes use of sophisticated theories based on quantum mechanics, called Density Functional Theory or DFT for short, that are implemented in computationally efficient software that are, nonetheless, computationally intensive.   This project makes use of a new and emerging methodology called Materials Informatics that is able to detect and extract structure-property correlations by exploring the statistical nature of data without necessarily utilizing pre-existing theoretical formulas. In this project materials informatics is used  to identify new materials with optimum properties for high-temperature electronic devices without having to carry out  calculations for every possible material structure and composition. The tools developed  will be made broadly available through a cyberinfrastructure platform, we term a "Materials Data Foundry". This web portal will also facilitate joint online courses between Iowa State University (ISU) and the University of Florida (UF), where the students use the tools developed in the project to analyze real data and problems. At UF, outreach will be focused on high school students through the UF Student Science Training Program while at ISU we will leverage the Iowa EPSCoR program to have access to a national network of community and Tribal Colleges. Our plan is use the educational capabilities of the Materials Data Foundry to connect with teachers who in turn will reach hundreds of students over the course of this project.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project established a new approach for materials simulation and modeling that linked informatics methods to Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations.  The discovery of new chemistries of (i) perovskites, (ii) M2AX compounds, and (iii) Co- and Ni-Base Superalloys served as the template for this project.  By designing across multiple platforms, we were able to demonstrate the generic nature of the approach developed.  We developed statistical learning and graph theoretic methodologies to discover patterns of behavior among known materials that were used to generate design rules for identifying structure-property relationships in new compounds; and which serve to guide and target DFT calculations to specific chemistries with the desired properties. Specifically, the project developed a rule-based design approach based on informatics which identified new chemistries for each of the respective material classes.  Through the inclusion of informatics approaches, this project explored the vast chemical space which is so large that it would otherwise have been prohibitive to study by solely experimental and/or computational methods.    This project developed statistical learning methodologies to discover patterns of behavior among known materials that could then be used to generate design rules for identifying structure-property relationships in new compounds, and which will serve to guide and target data intensive calculations to specific chemistries with the desired properties.  DFT calculations are highly accurate and typically are implemented in efficient software.  However, they still remain computationally intensive, as well as requiring some initial energetic description of the material.  We used Materials Informatics to detect and extract structure-property correlations by exploring the statistical nature of data without utilizing pre-existing theoretical formulas.  In this way, we shifted the DFT approach from one of seeking for materials to one of designing materials.  The intellectual impact of this work was to transform the traditional use of computational materials science from one of building large data repositories where informatics is primarily used as a search engine for compounds, to one where data science methods were used as a learning engine to uncover new physics and suggest new directions for conducting detailed computations on promising chemistries that would otherwise remain unidentified.  The following activities addressed this objective:  1)      Development of new informatics driven high-throughput analyses for the development of multi-functional property databases of M2AX phases based on identification of the key elemental characteristics and quantifying their collective impact on material properties.  This provided a framework for developing large ?virtual? material databases.  2)      Discovery of chemical site occupancy-electronic structure-elastic constant correlations.  Through data mining density of states spectra derived from the DFT component of this collaborative project, we developed new design rules for computational design of Ni-base superalloys with targeted properties.  3)      Through linking machine learning approaches for extracting critical information from graphs, images, and tables, we identified 15 previously undiscovered binary metallic glass forming hosts.  By assessing the large amount of thermodynamic data existing and integrating this data with our knowledge base developed in this project, we have introduced a new framework for materials design integrating electronic structure, crystal structure, thermodynamics, and mechanical properties.  The broader impact of this work was accomplished through the new Department of Materials Design and Innovation (MDI) at the University at Buffalo (UB).  The tools and data from this project have been incorporated into the curriculum, particularly in the form of case studies and projects for the students. For example, the informatics tools have been leveraged in the MDI course "Multivariate Statistics and Material Informatics" where the students propose new materials using the informatics tools from this project, while multiple case studies and problem sets are focused on linking electronic structure calculations with informatics in the course "Computational Materials Chemistry and Physics". All students completing a degree in this department understand the informatics approaches, the issues associated with data and databases, and the fundamentals of electronic structure calculations.  Further, through the new department, we had extensive outreach platforms, specifically through the hosting of the inaugural MDI Symposium and the involvement in the Eric Pitman Annual Summer Workshop in Computational Science for high school students.
