<AbstractNarration>The award will support the PI's research on mathematical models of financial bubbles and of insider trading in the stock market. Using mathematical models one can obtain insights not normally available to mere intuitive knowledge of the markets, in rough analogy to how one can see more details and learn new things by looking at the heavens through a telescope rather than with the naked eye. The PI will treat models of credit risk, and methods currently in use by practitioners (for example banks and investment houses) to calculate the risk involved. The research plan makes the informed conjecture that when bubbles are present, the standard approximations used by financial modelers in the US and around the world are in fact significantly worse than is currently believed. The research will draw on delicate techniques in probability theory which have to do with the availability and flow of information under uncertainty; as a consequence, new mathematical results will be established which deepen our understanding of probability. The broader impact which will apply to finance will potentially result in tools available to bankers, investors, and regulators to understand and therefore increase national and global financial stability. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The classical way of looking at mathematical models of financial risk uses reduced-form models and attempts to approximate the hazard rate, which gives the likelihood of imminent default at a given time. The PI intends to investigate how fast numerical approximation methods converge for these reduced-form models in the presence of financial bubbles. This involves the numerical analysis of solutions of stochastic differential equations when the coefficients are neither Lipschitz-continuous, nor have linear growth in the space variable, creating technical challenges which should have significant numerical implications.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  The PI undertook both theoretical and statistical research in the inderstanding of  financial bubbles in the stock market. Using a mathematical model of financial  bubbles, the PI developed a methodology to detect the bubbles, building on  previous NSF sponsored research. This was then implemented to detect bubbles  between 2000 and 2013 for 3,500 stocks. Over 13,000 bubbles were detected,  and the PI was able to compute the empirical distribution of the lifetimes of  financial bubbles.  Primary accomplishments include the computation of the empirical lifetime of  financial bubbles. Another accomplishment is a mathematical analysis allowing  the quantification of the profits of high frequency trading. Attempts were made to  analyze insider trading, and new techniques to do that were developed.  The PI was one of the four main organizers of the 9th World Congress of the  Bachelier Finance Society, meeting in New York, NY for five days in July 2016. In  addition he created and co-organized (with Professors Xin Guo of UC Berkeley  and TL Lai of Stanford) the IMS-FIPS meetings, world wide conferences  concerning Mathematical Finance. He has also begun (with Marcel Nutz and Xin  Guo) a new series of talks, the Columbia-Berkley Seminars. The first one was at  Columbia, and the second one was at Berkely. Finally, the PI is instrumental in  reviving and continuing the Columbia-Japan sequence of Statistics conferences.  The most recent one was at Columbia, and the previous one was in Tokyo,  Japan.             Last Modified: 11/05/2017       Submitted by: Philip E Protter]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
