<AbstractNarration>This award supports travel for participants in the U.S. Statistics and Biostatistics Department Chairs Workshop held July 12-13, 2016 at the American Statistical Association in Alexandria, Virginia. Enrollments in statistics courses as well as statistics degrees awarded are surging across U.S. universities. The numbers of universities granting both graduate and undergraduate degrees in statistics and biostatistics are at all-time highs. At the same time, data science is emerging as an important research program and the demand for data science skills is rapidly increasing in the public and private sectors. Since statistics represents a foundational discipline in data science, statistics and biostatistics department chairs need to ensure statisticians are effective partners in intramural and extramural university data science programs.  This workshop brings together statistics and biostatistics department chairs to address current challenges and learn directly from funding agency and private sector representatives about data science and research funding trends, in order to help statistics and biostatistics departments ensure a comprehensive approach both to data science research and to training graduates with skills that meet workforce demands. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Statisticians and statistics play a very important role in advancing science. This workshop provides an opportunity for statistics, biostatistics, and related department chairs to discuss current trends, challenges, and opportunities relating to surging enrollments, workforce needs, research trends, data science, and other issues. To inform discussions, participants will hear from private sector representatives concerning workforce needs, funding agency representatives on funding programs and trends, academic leaders on statistics and data science education, and university administrators on cross-campus research and educational efforts. Because a goal of this workshop is to equip department chairs to further engage their faculty in cross-campus interdisciplinary research and data science efforts, the workshop has strong potential to improve scientific research. Proceedings of the workshop will be recorded, summarized, and disseminated in a format constructive to the participants and the broader community.

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In July of 2016, forty statistics and biostatistics department chairs gathered at the headquarters of the American Statistical Association (ASA) for a National Science Foundation (NSF)-sponsored workshop featuring a dozen speakers from fields of great interest to the statistics community. The four panels that filled the workshop?s two days were: (i) Workforce Demand and Needs; (ii) Research Funding; (iii) Education and Research in the Data Science Era; and (iv) Support and Mentoring of Junior Faculty. The panelists and attendees discussed the many opportunities and challenges for the discipline of statistics with the emergence of data science and the associated explosion of interest in statistics and biostatistics.  Participants and presenters in the workshop?s four panels developed consensus on key outcomes. These were  the current and future demand for individuals with substantial statistical education and who have the ability to communicate and collaborate. the essential role of statistics, mathematics, and computer science in both the theoretical foundations and applications of data science the need for statisticians to be involved in the proposal review process to ensure the quality of the science that is funded, and the importance of career-long mentoring.   The post workshop evaluation confirmed the benefit of providing chairs opportunities to discuss issues and concerns as perhaps the most important outcome of the workshop.
