<AbstractNarration>Understanding how organisms utilize genetic variation to adapt to new habitats is an open question in evolutionary biology. Land crabs are a group that have repeatedly colonized terrestrial habitats, yet little is currently known about the underlying genetic machinery that has led to the impressive physical and physiological adaptations that have allowed them to live successfully on land. This project will connect the researcher with one of the world?s leading authorities on land crab biology, Professor Peter Ng at the National University of Singapore (NUS), and also with leading researchers in the field of crustacean evolutionary biology at the mid-year meeting of The Crustacean Society (TCS). The researcher will examine crabs housed in the collections at the Lee Kong Chian Natural History Museum (LKCNHM), and will collaborate with Prof. Ng and his research group to learn about the biology and taxonomy of the crabs. The results from this project will serve as a solid foundation for a larger research project that seeks to further understand one of the most important life-history transitions in biology. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For her dissertation work, the researcher plans to explore the mechanisms underlying the marine-to-terrestrial transition exhibited by brachyuran land crabs by integrating taxonomy, phylogenetics, and next-generation sequencing technologies, but prior to undertaking this larger project, she will first construct a solid taxonomic and systematic understanding of the group. For EAPSI, the researcher will be trained in these topics under the guidance of the world?s leading authority in crab systematics, Prof. Peter Ng at the NUS. She will examine and collect DNA subsamples from the land crab specimens preserved at the LKCNHM, which houses one of the largest collection of preserved land crabs in the world. Additionally, she will present at the mid-year meeting of TCS and network with other carcinologists to form additional international collaborations and partnerships.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award under the East Asia and Pacific Summer Institutes program supports summer research by a U.S. graduate student and is jointly funded by NSF and the National Research Foundation of Singapore.</AbstractNarration>

In order to obtain the foundational knowledge of the species that I required to complete my dissertation research, for EAPSI, I proposed to work alongside Professor Peter Ng, who is an internationally recognized authority on crab systematics and taxonomy, and is currently both the Director of the Lee Kong Chian Natural History Museum (formerly the Raffles Museum of Biodiversity Research) and a professor in Biological Sciences at the National University of Singapore.  During the funding period, I: 1) learned the taxonomy and systematics of the crab lineages that I plan to study throughout my dissertation using the most comprehensive collections in the world at the at the LKCNHM; (2) collected DNA subsamples from recently collected ethanol-preserved specimens for future phylogenetic analyses; and (3) established collaborations and professional networks with internationally leading carcinologists both at the NUS and at the mid-year meeting of the Crustacean Society to facilitate future field-based expeditions in this region.  Armed with the expertise, genetic samples, and international collaborative network I acquired from the EAPSI Fellowship, I am well-poised to complete a dissertation that may be critical to our understanding of the predictability of evolution, the nature and evolution of adaptive traits in natural systems, and may also provide insight into how life originally evolved on land many millennia ago.
