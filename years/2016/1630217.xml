<AbstractNarration>This conference and workshop award is jointly funded by the International office, OISE, at NSF and the Algebra and Number Theory program in DMS. The goal of the Building Bridges Summer School and Workshop at University of Sarajevo, July 11-22, 2016, is to provide a means by which mathematicians, primarily early career researchers, can seek to expand their investigations into areas of research beyond that of their previous studies.  The main area of emphasis is current topics in Number Theory. The first meeting in this program was held in Aachen, Germany in 2012, and the second was held in Bristol, England in 2014.  In both instances, the bridges being built were across sub-disciplines of mathematics.  For 2016, the organizers selected Sarajevo in Bosnia and Herzegovina as the venue, thus expanding the program into Eastern Europe.  Sarajevo is a fascinating city of unparalleled historical significance, which the organizers believe will further enhance the appeal and impact of the "building bridges" philosophy. Conference website: http://bb3.efsa.unsa.ba/&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The summer school will consist of three distinct yet related programs:Galois Representations and Diophantine Problems; Explicit L-functions, automorphic forms and Galois representations; and Single and multiple variable Dirichlet series and special values.  Lectures will be given by accomplished mathematicians who will present both introductory material as well as workable problems to motivate the students.  The workshop will consist of lectures on a range of mathematical results which fall under the broad description of number theory and automorphic forms.  As with previous "Building Bridges" events, the organizers will encourage the interaction and collaboration of participants with the prospect of seeing future research teams form and undertake mathematical collaborations.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Building Bridges 3 (BB3) workshop and summer school supported by the funds from this award were both mathematically and financially successful.  Mathematically, the 46 participants of the summer school came from 14 different countries.  For the workshop, there were 40 talks from the 54 participants.  Diversity was an important part of the planning, and 17 of the talks of the workshop were by women.  Financially, the organizers were able to minimize costs in Sarajevo so much so that funds were available for the next installment of the Building Bridges series, referred to as BB4, which was held in Budapest, Hungary, from 9-20 July 2018.   The organizers continue to see the Building Bridges series grow in all regards, including:  the number of students in the summer school, the number of attendees for the workshop, and the number of talks given during the workshop.  For BB4, the organizers needed to plan parallel sessions in order to accommodate all those who asked to speak.  As part of the philosophy of the organizers, each and every participant who requests to give a talk will be provided an opportunity.    The BB4 workshop participants came from more than twenty different counties.  Additionally, the BB4 workshop scheduled a diversity panel and a presentation by an applied psychology researcher who discussed their findings regarding means by which instructors can influence student self-confidence.
