<AbstractNarration>This award supports the collaborative efforts of the National Alliance for Partnerships in Equity Education Foundation, FSG, the Aspen Institute, the Collective Impact Forum, 100Kin10, National Girls Collaborative Project, Women in Engineering Pro-Active Network, MentorNet, Science Museum of Minnesota, Changing Communities, National GEM Consortium, American Society for Engineering Education and the Education Development Center to implement a project to inform the design of the National Science Foundation's (NSF) Inclusion across the National of Communities of Learners of Underrepresented Discoverers in Engineering and Science(INCLUDES)Initiative.  The NSF INCLUDES program supports models, networks, partnerships and research to ensure the broadening participation in STEM of women, members of racial and ethnic groups that have been historically underrepresented, persons of low socio-economic status, and people with disabilities. The purpose of this conference is to inform the most critical design features of the structures and supports needed so that the NSF INCLUDES Alliance mini-backbones and the National backbone can work effectively and build the capacity to transform the STEM ecosystem.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This conference will bring together the most qualified current experts in inter-organizational collaboration, intersectionality and broadening participation in STEM to apply their collective wisdom to the design of the support structures of the NSF INCLUDES Alliances and National Network. Applying the understanding of complexity theory, adaptive leadership, intersectionality and collaboration models to the field of broadening participation in STEM has the potential to disrupt the current system enough to build capacity to create impactful Alliances.  The outcomes of this convening have the potential to advance knowledge for all organizations working to broaden impact in STEM as well as those applying inter-organizational collaboration to the field of social innovation. Using intersectionality as a lens in developing more effective collaborative efforts that are responsive to the organizational partners and the context of the communities they serve can add a critical element to this field. The diverse members of the organizing committee can disseminate the results of this work to multiple networks where the results can impact the practice of inter-organizational collaboration and broadening participation in STEM.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The CoExIST convening brought together 50 experts and practitioners in collective impact, inter-organizational collaboration, and broadening participation in STEM. The primary goal of the convening was to inform the design of the support structures of the NSF INCLUDES Alliances and National backbone, with an explicit focus on intersectionality. Intersectionality promotes an understanding of human beings as shaped by the interaction of different social locations (e.g. race/ethnicity, indigeneity, gender, class, sexuality, geography, age, disability/ability, migration status, religions). The CoExiST convening occurred March 8-10, 2017 in Dallas, TX. Organized by the CoExIST Organizing Committee, led by the National Alliance for Partnerships in Equity and the National Girls Collaborative. The CoExIST convening was a part of the larger CoExIST project, which also included the development of a pre-conference memo focused on collective impact, a crowdsourcing data collection activity, and collection of inter-organizational collaboration resources. In addition to NAPE and NGC, the Organizing Committee included representatives from FSG, the Aspen Institute, the Collective Impact Forum, MentorNET (a division of Great Minds in STEM), American Society for Engineering Education, Science Museum of Minnesota, Changing Communities Consulting, the National GEM Consortium and the Education Development Center.
