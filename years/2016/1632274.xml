<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to create a suite of consumer hardware and software products that provide realistic tactile feedback to users who are touching objects in virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR). As evidenced by the current proliferation of low-cost head-mounted displays and motion tracking systems, three-dimensional interaction technologies are revolutionizing how people interact with computers, media, and each other. Since they are currently limited to vision and audio, endowing consumer-level human-computer interfaces with high-fidelity tactile feedback will vastly increase user immersion, making games more fun, online interactions more effective, and tools more efficient. Consequently, this project has the potential to expand the commercial reach of the burgeoning VR/AR market, opening up myriad opportunities for companies particularly in the gaming, entertainment, and e-commerce sectors. The innovation of this project also promises to enhance scientific and technological understanding of haptic human-computer interaction by establishing a new paradigm that blends minimal wearable hardware with sophisticated software algorithms. Finally, commercializing novel interactive technology also has the potential to help inspire a diverse array of young people to pursue a career in the critical areas of science, technology, engineering, and math.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project aims to advance knowledge of low-cost technology that can provide realistic tactile feedback to a user touching objects in VR or AR: the project?s intellectual merits center on testing a new approach that combines minimal haptic hardware and sophisticated software algorithms. The research objective is to create a fully functional industrial prototype of a wearable fingertip thimble and custom software that embody the proposed approach. When the user's finger moves to touch a virtual object, a platform inside the thimble will initiate contact with the fingerpad and press with a force that varies with penetration distance, to render surface softness. A thermal actuator will convey the object?s thermal conductivity and temperature. When the finger slides along a virtual object, the user will feel its texture via carefully designed platform vibrations. Specific research tasks to be addressed include exploring haptic actuator options, building a library of haptic object properties (HOPs) that can be applied to virtual objects, and creating a communication protocol for exchanging haptic signals among devices. This project is expected to yield a fully functional industrial prototype and developer kits for the wearable fingertip thimble.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ An ocean of passive online content.  Billions of images uploaded every day across the internet where every image tells a unique story.  Half a trillion dollars spent by brands every year to engage users and capture their attention. Yet is more of the same. We explore all this content by touching lifeless glass screens for many hours every day. But what if you could go beyond the glass?  What if you can touch and feel the objects you see on the screen?  Brands are craving new and more engaging content to increase audience engagement, while users are hungry for deeper online connections that compel our humanity and psyche.  Over the life of the grant, the project findings indicate that it is possible to objectively capture, model, and render convincing touch sensations using an operating system-agnostic, embeddable software platform across diverse hardware media and user devices.  Tactai core technology packaged properly makes it possible to substantially enhance the human-machine interaction by engaging the, still largely missing, sense of touch in our online interactions to deliver a richer, more immersive experience.  The sense of touch is an essential system of interaction experienced through the skin, especially the hands, gathering information through the stimulation of the receptors in the skin. The human skin is considered the most important sensory system since it occupies the largest surface area of the human body. For this reason, the sense of touch is more accessible when compared to other sensory systems.  It is through the sense of touch that humans may explore and manipulate everyday objects and collect information on their softness, texture, hardness, weight, size and shape.  Convincing tactile feedback could benefit a wide range of applications where it is shown to drive greater engagement, persuasion, and recall.  During the project, two reference designs were developed driven by Tactai technology to render complex tactile sensations that mirror the real-world equivalents.  The first reference design with embedded Tactai platform is a tablet stylus, the TactaiIndex?, as shown in Figure 1, that displays realistic pen or pencil of paper experience when used with a standard glass tablet without requiring special coatings on the glass surface.  All the electronics and Tactai software an onboard this instrument.  Figure 1. TactaiIndex? Reference design  The second reference design driven by the Tactai platform is a User Interface panel where the soft UI controls such as knobs and sliders feel like their mechanical equivalents.  This is shown in figure 2.  Figure 2: Haptic Panel Reference design  Given that phones and tablets continue to dominate modern consumer lifestyles, driving ravenous appetite for multimedia content, haptics has become a defined need and market opportunity.  We plan to create future reference designs that are based on the Tactai platform that could become the next-generation human-machine interfaces by making touch the basic foundation on which to author new stories.
