<AbstractNarration>This study seeks to improve our understanding of the interaction of weak wind flow in the lowest layer of the atmosphere and generation of turbulence in gently sloping terrain.  An improved understanding of weak-wind boundary layers could potentially lead to more accurate modeling of the formation of cold pools, damaging frost (including impact to local vineyards), fog formation, and dispersion of contaminants. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study seeks to investigate weak-wind boundary layers using detailed spatial-temporal measurements. These boundary layers demonstrate non-stationarity and the turbulence in them is generally in a non-equilibrium state with the mean flow. Previous studies of such boundary layers were mostly limited to temporal data at fixed locations, and therefore could not take into account hysteresis when investigating scaling properties. This study analyzes detailed spatial-temporal data to form a more complete picture of boundary layer structures. The evolution of the structures and the impact of the sub-mesoscale motions will be investigated.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Motions on scales larger than the turbulence, but smaller than mesoscale motions (e.g., thunderstorms, sea breezes), are referred to as submeso motions that are typically anywhere from 10 m to 2 km wide.  Close to the surface, these nocturnal motions include wave-like motions, microfronts and a wide variety of more complicated motions.  For low wind speeds, submeso motions account for much of the generation of turbulent mixing near the surface.  In addition to controlling the mixing, submeso motions can be characterized by significant small-scale time and space variations of temperature and wind.  These variations are relatively unpredictable because little is understood about such motions.  As a result, they largely elude parameterization.  Consequently, damaging frost, fog formation, and dispersion of contaminants are often poorly forecasted.    Our analyses has led to significant improvement in the understanding of both propagating submeso motions and those that are more stationary and attached to terrain features (even if gentle).  Stationary motions are often associated with cold pools in low lying areas and local terrain induced mixing over higher terrain.  We have emphasized shallow valleys because they are common and have been less studied compared to deeper valleys.   A significant fraction of the world's population lives in smaller valleys where poor dispersion is a common problem.   We have also tackled the difficult problem where stationary modes and propagating motions interact.  For example, propagating wave-like motions often modulate surface cold pools and may intermittently eliminate them.  In spite of such progress, much remains poorly understood.  Our research also examined the vertical structure the flow in the lowest 10-20 m.  Such structure is often modified by cold air drainage down slopes.  The work in our study emphasized common, small-scale, gentle slopes on horizontal scales of a few hundred meters with slopes of 10% or less.   Cold air drainage develops over such slopes if the ambient flow is weak or modest.  These flows have received much less attention compared to steeper slopes.  We have uncovered substantial new understanding of their vertical structure and intermittency.  Such cold air drainage is one of several mechanisms that lead to atypical vertical structure of the flow near the surface including wind maxima as low as a few meters above the ground.  Horizontal advection associated with surface heterogeneity also leads to more complex vertical structure.  Such vertical structure can invalidate the usual measurements of fluxes of heat, momentum and other quantities between the surface and the atmosphere. We have assessed the magnitude of such errors.  The above work has already motivated a number of new studies by various investigators.            Last Modified: 10/02/2020       Submitted by: Larry Mahrt]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
