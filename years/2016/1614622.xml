<AbstractNarration>Information processing in the brain is organized and facilitated by the complex interactions&lt;br/&gt;of intrinsic biophysical properties of distinct neuronal types, neuronal morphology, and network&lt;br/&gt;connection topology. These properties give rise to specific types of network oscillations&lt;br/&gt;and other dynamic processes that govern neural information encoding and exchange. This project is &lt;br/&gt;designed to create a detailed picture at unprecedented scale of how the&lt;br/&gt;intrinsic properties of hippocampal principal neurons and interneurons define the network&lt;br/&gt;activity under normal conditions, and how pathological changes in those properties under epileptic&lt;br/&gt;conditions disrupt hippocampal function.  The overarching goal of this activity is to construct&lt;br/&gt;a 1:1 scale, realistic and detailed computational model of the CA1-CA3-dentate gyrus network&lt;br/&gt;in the rat hippocampus and study physiological and pathophysiological network dynamics. &lt;br/&gt;The project will use the Blue Waters supercomputer to execute this detailed model.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additionally, the project aims to achieve broader impact in the neuroscience community by providing the&lt;br/&gt;software infrastructure necessary to put unprecedented petascale computing capability within&lt;br/&gt;reach of neuroscientists regardless of their expertise in high-performance computing (HPC).&lt;br/&gt;The support for GPUs and the Intel MIC architecture being developed in the widely-used NEURON&lt;br/&gt;simulator will enable neuroscientists to fully utilize supercomputing accelerator architectures&lt;br/&gt;and thus catalyze greater research productivity and pave the way for wider use of large-scale&lt;br/&gt;and full-scale detailed modeling of the brain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Furthermore, the neuroscience model code and simulation support software being developed as part of the&lt;br/&gt;research goals behind this proposal will be made publicly available and will remove the&lt;br/&gt;barriers of setting up simulations and managing results data that traditionally have impeded&lt;br/&gt;the utilization of high-performance computing resources.</AbstractNarration>
