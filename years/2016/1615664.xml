<AbstractNarration>This project seeks to understand the genetic mechanisms regulating selfish and cooperative behaviors in animals, using honey bees as a model system.  Previous studies showed that, in honey bees, genes inherited from the father promote selfish behavior, while the genes inherited from the mother promote cooperative behavior.  The current project will use advanced genomic tools to unravel the molecular mechanisms that mediate this conflict between the father's and mother's genes, and provide a framework for understanding how the interactions between these genes generate behavior.  The insights gained and methodology developed for these studies can be easily applied to explore these questions in other social animals.  This project will be used as charismatic platform to increase understanding of social behavior in animals, how genes produce behavior, and why genes may be in conflict with each other, in K-12 students and teachers, the public, undergraduate and graduate students. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project evaluates the function and regulation of intragenomic conflict in mediating social behavior, using honey bees as a model system. The kin selection theory of intragenomic conflict predicts that, in honey bees, patrigenes (inherited from the father) favor selfish behavior while matrigenes (inherited from the mother) favor altruistic behavior. Previous studies provided the first empirical support for this prediction.  The current research will expand on these studies by: (1) confirming that patrigene expression mediates selfish behavior by developing new methodology for allele-specific manipulation of transcript abundance; (2) determining if parent-specific gene expression (PSGE) patterns are labile and vary according to tissue and context, while still corresponding to the predictions of kin selection theory; and (3) evaluating the extent of parent-specific DNA methylation (PSDM) across the genome and its role in regulating PSGE.  These studies will integrate genetic crosses, behavior, physiology, RNAi approaches, whole transcriptome sequencing, bisulfite sequencing, bioinformatics, and statistical genomics, and open the door to examining intragenomic conflict as a pervasive force that can shape a myriad of traits related to fitness in social groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is co-funded by the Genetic Mechanisms Program in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences and by the Animal Behavior Program in the Division of Integrative Organismal Systems.</AbstractNarration>

This phenomenon, referred to as the ‘parent-specific gene expression (PSGE)’, has perplexed biologists for decades. Another term to refer to this observation, especially in mammals and some plants, is ‘genomic imprinting’. In mammals and plants, genomic imprinting is regulated by differential epigenetic marking of the parental alleles. In particular, DNA methylation often distinguishes the paternal and maternal alleles in these species.  The extent of PSGE in the tree of life is still unresolved. A key question regarding PSGE is the underlying evolutionary processes. One hypothesis posits that PSGE arises from the intragenomic conflict between alleles of paternal and maternal origin. This hypothesis is highly relevant in eusocial insects, where the reproductive division of labor and the co-occurrence of complex societies offer fertile grounds for different degrees and representations of intragenomic conflict. It was previously shown, by one of the PIs’ lab, that PSGE is indeed observed in honey bee, an iconic eusocial insects. Given that DNA methylation also exists in the honey bees and was previously implicated in eusociality of this species, we sought to investigate the extent of PSGE in honey bee tissues, and the role of DNA methylation in PSGE.  We utilized the presence of highly divergent strains of honey bees. We performed genetic crosses between these divergent strains to keep track of which allele comes from which parent in offsprings.
