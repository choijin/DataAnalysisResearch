<AbstractNarration>This project will develop an immersive and dynamic multi-player game that addresses a pressing need to provide engaging technologies that prepare students to apply collaborative, cross-disciplinary scientific practices to global societal challenges. In an augmented classroom with their real life peers, students must establish a colony on Mars that is capable of sustaining thousands of refugees from Earth. To successfully achieve their goal, students must use raw materials found on Mars to produce components necessary for life support and building, such as food, water, oxygen, and fuel. In the weeks that this simulation runs alongside their real classroom, students will apply cross-disciplinary STEM knowledge and practices to experience how both individual and collective actions have short- and long-term effects. The game and supporting curriculum will address content from the Next Generation Science Standards and ultimately help adolescent youth understand the need for the integration of science and engineering to tackle critical issues such as the production of clean energy, identification and treatment of disease, the allocation of adequate food and water, and global environmental change (NRC, 2011). Creating educational games that more closely mirror their AAA counterparts provides an opportunity to draw diverse genders and underrepresented youth into STEM-related fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project?' goal is to create "virtual field trips" that augment a classroom and run simultaneous to it, providing applications and experiential learning in a highly engaging social environment. It will build upon previous proprietary technology that enables simultaneous online interactions, complex distributed simulations, and data gathering in shared virtual worlds. This allows the project in its initial phase to focus not only on developing a quality game for students but also on designing and testing high-risk approaches to classroom integration. This game includes the teacher and suggests actions that alter narrative arcs, provide students with key knowledge, or increase or constrain other material resources students have available. Teachers will be able to leverage data collected on student game play to pair small, dynamic groupings of students with high impact mini-lessons to allow the project to actively support teachers as they implement personalized, data-driven instruction. By including a teacher-friendly assessment toolkit, the project can operate within districts' current requirements while experimenting with the future of educational gaming in the classroom. Phase I research will focus on usability and impact on student learning, as well as attempt to understand how willing teachers are to accept and use the teacher support features.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   With this project we successfully implemented a cloud-based virtual world shared by a classroom of students and their teacher, focusing on application of STEM skills in the framework of a Mars colonization effort undertaken by the group. Our first technical objective was "Produce a prototype of the game by implementing our existing architecture". We were able to achieve this by extending the proprietary architecture of our Eco engine. Building on this existing technology, we were able to rapidly construct a multi-user, persistent online simulation of a Martian world, shared in real time by up to 30 students simultaneously. Within this world, we created a suite of objects that players are able to construct and manipulate to successfully create a colony and base of operations. We implemented two major scenarios with this prototype, both requiring the application of STEM skills and collaboration of players along science standards. These two scenarios implemented our second technical objective, "Develop essential cross-disciplinary learning and game mechanics". Students needed to use a variety of tools provided by the game to complete both objectives, mixing application of engineering, chemistry, biology, and statistics to achieve their goals. Simultaneously, players are navigating these problems in a social environment, requiring them to work together, collaborate, and lead one another to succeed. For our third technical objective "Develop systems and materials that facilitate teachers? implementation", we created a web browser interface that involved both players and students. Both could get a high-level overview of the progress of the world, with the game generating dynamic text articles based on the challenges happening in the game. With this project we were able to develop our proprietary in game technology to the point that we can rapidly create an entirely new game, targeting new learning objectives and introducing new mechanics, in a social shared world.
