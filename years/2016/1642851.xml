<AbstractNarration>The proposed work will explore the release of greenhouse gases from Arctic rivers to the atmosphere.  The hypothesis of this work is that land-based organic carbon that gets flushed into rivers does not makes its way to the Arctic Ocean, where it could be deposited in the sediments.  Rather, before reaching the Arctic Ocean, microbes decompose this organic carbon, resulting in a flux of CO2 and CH4, both greenhouse gases, from the rivers to the atmosphere.  The larger concern is that as Arctic peatlands warm and thaw over this century, organic material that has built up over thousands of years in the frozen soils will become susceptible to transport to the rivers, processing,  and then released to the atmosphere in the form of CO2 and CH4.  Currently this is an under-explored research topic, partly because it is so difficult to directly measure the transfer of these greenhouse gases from the rivers to the atmosphere.  The PIs of this project believe that they have developed the instrumentation to estimate these fluxes in a cheap and reasonable way.  The PI intends to do this in a Russian watershed.  As the cruise expenses will be paid by their Russian collaborators, the PIs are asking for a small amount of support funds to develop the instruments and for travel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a relatively small project and only includes for 1 month participation of a graduate student.  However, the collaboration with foreign colleagues is viewed very positively. Moreover, Amon has a good track record with respect to BI and outreach.  In previous work, Amon has trained several graduate students and exposed a number of undergraduate students to Arctic research.  He has organized a data workshop with international participation including several graduate and undergraduate students at the TAMU international study center in Italy and initiated the ?science on the island? series to published short newspaper articles about these research projects in the Galveston County Daily News.  The Program has no reason to believe that this commitment to active outreach and education will cease.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The watersheds of the large Siberian rivers store significant amounts of organic carbon in soils and vegetation.  However, the lateral transport of carbon from Arctic lands to the rivers, the in-stream processing of DOC, and the greenhouse gas evasion from the river networks has not been well determined. In the summer of 2015, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) measured in the Yenesei by Amon and colleagues indicates large differences in upstream and downstream DOC during the freshet period, suggesting 1) significant in-transit losses of DOC and 2) that plant and litter carbon is the predominant source of DOC exported to the Arctic Ocean. The proposed project will measure the concentration and isotopic composition of CO2 and CH4 in surface waters and air, which, together with other measurements, will permit the determination of air/water gas exchange.  This award will allow the PIs to take advantage of an offer to participate in a cruise of opportunity on a 2000 km stretch of the Yenisei River in the summer 2016.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This pilot study showed that it is possible to install an underway CO2 and CH4 flux system on a relatively small non-research vessel with relatively minor modifications and carry out continuous measurements of CO2 and CH4 on a moving ship over an extended period of time (over 15 days in this case) in a remote Siberian location if you have well established collaborations with Russian partners.  The pilot study also showed that it is possible to directly determine the surface water turbulence and derive an approximation of the gas exchange coefficient by using a combination of Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP) measurements and measurements of high frequency temperature sensors, and an extended meteorological station. This was the first time a value for the gas exchange coefficient was directly determined in the field.  The study suggests that the gas exchange coefficient directly determined in this study is at least an order of magnitude higher than gas exchange coefficients derived from wind speed and therefore increases our gas exchange rate between the river and the atmosphere by a factor of 10.  The Yenisei river is a net source of CH4 and CO2 to the atmosphere during the summer period. Spot measurements of CO2 and CH4 concentrations in surface waters during freshet indicate that the river could be a major source of greenhouse gases, potentially in excess of the annual discharge of organic carbon and inorganic carbon by the river.  The across channel variability of CH4 and CO2 is large with elevated CH4 and lower CO2 typically found on the slower flowing western side of the river. This indicates that methane concentrations are driven by particulate organic matter deposition and subsequent methanogenesis in the sediments near western banks with slower flow. Carbon dioxide is influenced by photosynthesis on the "calmer" western side of the channel and seems to be a function of the concentration of dissolved organic carbon in the channel over the seasonal cycle.  Repeating this study during freshet conditions and extending it into the tributaries will be crucial in order to determine the role of Siberian watersheds for the lateral carbon export and greenhouse gas release from these extensive river networks under current conditions.
