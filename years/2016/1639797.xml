<AbstractNarration>The proposed project seeks financial support for graduate students and Post-Doctoral Fellows to help defray the cost of conference registration and related travel expenses for those who will be giving presentations at a conference that will be held July 10-15, 2016 in San Diego, CA, The conference will address the latest advances in Metalorganic Vapor Phase Epitaxy (MOVPE) materials and device technologies. Topics to be addressed include among other Fundamental Studies and Modeling of Epitaxial Processes, Wide-Bandgap Group-III Nitride Materials and Devices, III-V Semiconductors and Devices, Narrow Bandgap Materials and Devices, II-VI Materials and Devices, Growth of Nanowires, Nanostructures and Low-dimensional Structures, There will be both invited talks and contributed presentations. The conference will provide, networking opportunities and intellectual stimulation for graduate students, Post-Doctoral Fellows and all attendees. It is expected that the venue will attract a significant number of members of underrepresented groups in STEM. The proceedings will be published in a journal which receives wide electronic distribution.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Conference will follow the traditions of the previous ICMOVPE, presenting the latest advances in science, technology and applications of MOVPE and related growth techniques. This is the preeminent Conference in the field, and the papers presented represent the leading-edge research done worldwide.   The ICMOVPE-XVIII conference created meaningful opportunities for intellectual challenge, networking opportunities, and intellectual stimulation for graduate students, Post-Doctoral Fellows and all attendees.  This technical and social program further provided many opportunities for communication, brainstorming, and transfer of information as well as the development of collaborations across many institutions and companies.  We had a significant number of members of underrepresented groups in STEM attending this conference.  We also are publishing the proceedings of this conference with the Journal of Crystal Growth, a journal which receives wide electronic distribution in many academic institutions world-wide, making the technical information presented at ICMOVPE-XVIII have a much broader impact than would otherwise be possible.  ICMOVPE XVIII had a total of 216 presentations and of these; there were 70 Student oral or poster presentations.  The funds we obtained for student support from NSF were distributed among the registered students and Post Docs to supplement the full cost of registration of $1,100 each for regular registration to the reduced rate of at $850 each for graduate students and Post Docs.
