<AbstractNarration>A Data Science Innovation Lab workshop focused on Interdisciplinary Approaches to Biomedical Data Science will be held at the UCLA Lake Arrowhead Conference Center, June 15-19, 2016. (See http://www.bigdatau.org/innovationlab/.) This workshop will help generate research ideas and build teams of researchers to explore the challenges associated with big data generated by mobile sensors.  The development of these teams has the potential to transform the use of mobile devices in the biomedical sciences using science driven knowledge. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 2016 Innovation Lab on Interdisciplinary Approaches to Biomedical Data Science will bring together researchers in quantitative and biomedical sciences with a goal of developing new research teams to work on problems in biomedical data science. The teams that are developed will pursue research in the use of mobile devices to collect health data, to deliver health care data to patients and practitioners, and to assist in the monitoring of health care patients. Funds from this award will support travel for participants to attend the workshop.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Overview:  This project requested funding for the 2016 Data Science Innovation Lab on Interdisciplinary Approaches to Biomedical Data Science: Challenges of Wearable and/or Ambient Sensors.  The Innovation Lab entailed participation in an intensive five-day residential workshop in order to facilitate the development of new teams of early-career biomedical and quantitative investigators who generate multidisciplinary cooperative research programs through a real-time and iterative mentoring process.  The goal of the Innovation Lab format was to foster new interdisciplinary collaborations among quantitative and biomedical researchers to address data science challenges arising from the use of wearable or ambient sensors. Wearable or ambient sensors, as defined here, broadly describes the necessary software and hardware which drives internet-connected devices with a health or biomedical research objective.  Upon the conclusions of the Data Science Innovation Lab, inter-disciplinary teams developed, presented, and began the process of undertaking a set of new innovative research projects.   Funds used here covered the travel and accomodation for ~15 quantitative science participants at the workshop.  Intellectual Merit: The Data Science Innovation Lab enjoyed a particular intellectual merit in that it specifically focused on community building by carefully defining the scope of work around the theme of wearable sensors and Mobile Health; allowed attendees to gain cross disciplinary agreement on common language and terminology; shared understanding, expertise, and experience; and to participate in the iterative development of new ideas using creative and innovative thinking techniques. Through the Data Science Innovation Lab, we sought to foster a new multi-disciplinary community built around these biomedical challenges addressed through the use of mathematical, statistical, and computational techniques.  Broader Impacts: Bringing mathematicians, statisticians, and computer scientists together with biologists, physicians, and other data scientists to develop joint projects possessed broader impacts beyond the events themselves &ndash; fostering the development of a new community of researchers with mutual interest in addressing big data challenges and applying them to real large-scale bioscience research and data science outcomes.
