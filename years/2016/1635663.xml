<AbstractNarration>The objective of this project is to enable the improved design of human-machine systems that use virtual and mixed-reality (i.e., "immersive") environments. Immersive environments are used broadly, with applications from entertainment to design. They provide a safe training environment for high-risk scenarios faced by soldiers, pilots, and surgeons. They are also used to assess potentially risky behaviors in human-machine systems (e.g., distracted driving) and potential interventions (e.g., collision avoidance, surgical planning). As immersion varies from purely virtual to purely real, the behavior of the human-machine system changes, particularly when the designed artifact exposes humans to risk. Design decisions focused on preventing human danger are made by using risk-free virtual interactions. As a result, risk compensation and other effects can confound the results of design assessments, training, and remote operator performance. This effort will identify and model these effects, providing guidance to engineers and designers working with immersive technologies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work leverages advances in simulator hardware and data rendering to deeply investigate behavioral changes due to perceived risk within digitally-mediated man-machine systems. To isolate and investigate these behavioral changes, three research objectives are identified. First, determine the degree to which simulated and augmented reality environments are comparable surrogates for predicting risk in live, in-use behaviors. Second, identify the biases in risk perception between different immersion modalities and boundaries where biases are so large that simulations become deficient in evaluating risky behaviors. Third, quantify variance in risk compensation behavior. Collectively, this effort will correlate the effects of using digitally-augmented and/or virtual environments to behavioral changes, with the goal of understanding how immersion changes decision making and performance.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Modern technology is increasingly enabling a sense of presence in situations, even if they are not in-person live experiences. These technologies are mundane as video-conferencing and video-playback of events, to advanced immersion methods such as flight simulators and Virtual Reality (VR) headset displays. With growing automation capability in our factories, vehicles, and other machinery, the human operator is increasingly expected to use immersive technologies, teleoperation, video playback, or similar technologies to assess risk of operation. Virtual immersion, however, introduces a layer of abstraction and safety between the participant and the situation, which includes an associated risk compensation. This project investigates how technology that is used as an intermediary for perception affects risk-taking, particularly comparing risk-taking between virtual and real representations of the environment, between the person as the decision-maker versus decision-confirmer, and between in-presence versus non-present immersions.</p> <p>To investigate these effects in a practical an impactful situation, this work studied risk-taking in driving situations ? motivated by the commonality of this decision, its impact on societal safety, and the growing availability of autonomous and driving-assist systems that require various levels of immersion from the drivers which can include both present and remote operators. Drivers were exposed by risk by either changing the vehicle speed themselves, or assessing another?s speed, during a high-speed curve. Tests included real driving situations, driving situations where the display was a pass-through video feed (with normal latency), driving the same scene outside the vehicle with a virtual (game-like) representation, and driving the same scene outside the vehicle with a photo-realistic representation.&nbsp;</p> <p>The first year focused on in-vehicle experimentation, which was a unique design where the test subject in the passenger seat had access to brake and throttle pedals which set the vehicle?s speed. The driver?s side of the vehicle included a trained test driver who could override subject inputs, but otherwise passed these inputs into the vehicle?s speed setting. The testing methods were split into two parts: the first to determine which assumptions of risk drivers had before exposure to a high-speed curve traversal (e.g. their ?latent? response), and the second was designed to assess their learned response behavior after repeated exposures. The latent response tests consisted of having the participants in the passenger seat assess comfort or discomfort within a vehicle that was driven around a curve at a randomly-chosen value among a selection of test speeds. A trained test driver approached high-speed curves at speeds well above normal driving, but consistent with friction-limited design speeds. Participants were asked to indicate when they felt uncomfortable by pressing a brake pedal that was instrumented to alert the driver, and the point of press, aggressiveness of press, and vehicle speed during brake press was recorded. Next, the learned response protocol assessed the participants for repeated exposures but allowing subjects to use brake and throttle pedals to indicate if they wanted to go faster or slower; these tests included starting the vehicle from a stop prior to the curve, and starting the vehicle at a speed well above the safe traversal speed, forcing the subject to slow down. The goal was to allow participants to iterate toward their maximum comfortable speed. These pedals were instrumented to alert the driver who responded accordingly. Both protocols were repeated across curves of various curvature, across many speeds, directions, and across genders of subjects.</p> <p>The results showed that the participants? uncomfortable speeds were independent of the direction of travel, the driver?s gender, and of the approach speed. No evidence was found of a learning effect by which participants became more comfortable at higher speeds with successive exposures to a curve. Further, the speed settings found in the tests matched those from several decades earlier, used to assess passenger comfort for highway curvature design.</p> <p>A follow-up experiment was then conducted in year 2 that investigated the effect of technology intervention. This consisted of subjects wearing a headset with video pass-through while operating the vehicle (from the passenger?s side). The goal of this was to compare subject?s capability to use technology to form similar assessments of risk. The results of this experiment were mixed and seemed to split the subject pool into two populations ? some participants selected significantly different speeds when wearing the headset, versus without the headset. However, many test subjects did not change behavior in a statistically significant manner. Overall, the headset did not significantly affect the average speed selection and thus overall risk. However, despite actual risk-taking being the same, the subjects self-assessment of difficulty and risk showed that the video pass-through significantly increase the participants? perception of difficulty and risk while traversing the curves. These results show that human subjects, when using technologies to immerse themselves in situations, should not rely on their self-assessment of behavior as this deviated from measured behavior.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 05/11/2020<br>      Modified by: Matthew&nbsp;Parkinson</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1635663/1635663_10439559_1589224122594_Immersion--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1635663/1635663_10439559_1589224122594_Immersion--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Levels of real vs. simulated environments"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1635663/1635663_10439559_1589224122594_Immersion--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Levels of real vs. simulated environments"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">These four environments show different combinations of real and simulated.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Brennan / Parkinson</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Matthew&nbsp;Parkinson</div> <div class="imageTitle">Levels of real vs. simulated environments</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1635663/1635663_10439559_1589225004897_virtualRealEnvironments--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1635663/1635663_10439559_1589225004897_virtualRealEnvironments--rgov-800width.jpg" title="The virtual and real environment"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1635663/1635663_10439559_1589225004897_virtualRealEnvironments--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="The virtual and real environment"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">The figure shows a view of the virtual (left) and real (right) test track.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Brennan / Maddipatla</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Royalty-free (restricted use - cannot be shared)</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Matthew&nbsp;Parkinson</div> <div class="imageTitle">The virtual and real environment</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1635663/1635663_10439559_1589225262460_virtualTrack--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1635663/1635663_10439559_1589225262460_virtualTrack--rgov-800width.jpg" title="The virtual track"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1635663/1635663_10439559_1589225262460_virtualTrack--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="The virtual track"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">A view of the virtual test track.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Brennan / Maddipatla</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Royalty-free (restricted use - cannot be shared)</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Matthew&nbsp;Parkinson</div> <div class="imageTitle">The virtual track</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
