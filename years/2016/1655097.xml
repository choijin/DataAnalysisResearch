<AbstractNarration>Understanding and documenting the world's biodiversity is the first step in biological conservation. Among many biodiversity hotpots around the world, southern Africa is particularly well-known for its diverse and unique plants and animals. Over the past decade, scientists have documented more than 600 species of grasshoppers from this region. Grasshoppers are ecologically and economically important as they are critical components of terrestrial ecosystems, especially grasslands, and include several serious pest species. Despite the years of biodiversity research in southern Africa, scientists have recognized that there is a certain fauna that has never been fully explored - the flightless grasshoppers occupying the mountain forests in South Africa. The forest patches and isolated mountain peaks in this area represent habitat islands, and there is no other land-based system of habitat islands in the world with the number, size, and configurational complexity as the Afromontane zone in South Africa. This project focuses on understanding the total diversity of grasshoppers in this amazing and complex landscape and the processes shaping this diversity. The results from this project will provide critical information about species diversification in complex habitats and help researchers better understand species diversity and distributions in similar habitats in the US and around the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will focus on the grasshopper family Lentulidae, which is endemic to southern Africa, and address the following two questions: (i) What is the total species diversity of Lentulidae in the alpine and Afromontane regions in South Africa? and (ii) What are patterns of speciation and diversification in Lentulidae as related to their geographic distribution? Scientists will explore inselbergs (isolated mountain peaks rising abruptly from surroundings) and adjacent plateaus in the Drakensberg Escarpment and the Afromontane forest patches in South Africa in search of new species. Using modern taxonomic techniques, the scientists will rapidly describe this unique grasshopper fauna and make the resulting specimen-level data digitally available to the public. The project will also reconstruct the evolutionary relationships among the focal taxa to examine how these small flightless grasshoppers have colonized and diversified in isolated inselbergs and Afromontane forest patches. Specifically, genome-scale single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data will be generated using RAD-Seq to estimate phylogeographic patterns as well as for inferring population genetic structures for those species that appear to be widespread. The project will provide hands-on research and mentoring experience for undergraduate students at Texas A&amp;M University and Drexel University.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>In South Africa, there are two parallel chains of habitat islands that harbor enormous yet unknown insect diversity. The first is a thousand-mile arc of alpine habitats consisting of a great mountain massif whose eastern edge has eroded into a line of high precipices and isolated rock fragments. The second is a string of mountain forests constituting perhaps the most complex archipelago in the world, stretching from the tip of the continent four thousand miles to the horn of Africa. This project allowed researchers from the Academy of Natural Sciences of Drexel University, Texas A&amp;M University, and Ezemvelo KZN Wildlife in South Africa to explore these unique habitat islands, which resulted in the discovery of numerous flightless grasshopper species belonging to the genus <em>Eremidium</em>. Using genetic information generated from the field-collected samples, the researchers were able to reveal insights into the diversification and speciation processes underlying the evolution and biogeography of these species.</p> <p>Throughout this project, the researchers were able to conduct four field expeditions (2017, 2018, 2019, 2020) to South Africa to thoroughly sample Afromontane forest patches in KwaZulu-Natal, Eastern Cape, and Western Cape. They were also able to sample isolated inselbergs in the Drakensberg Escarpment by helicopter. A total of 136 sites were surveyed during these expeditions, which yielded more than 1100 pinned specimens and 1700 ethanol-preserved specimens. These field-collected specimens as well as those borrowed from museums were used the basis for descriptive taxonomy, resulting in at least 56 new species and two new genera to science. The specimen data were also incorporated into the OrthopNet Database as well as the&nbsp;Ezemvelo Biodiversity Database for broader dissemination of collection data. The project also allowed generation of genome-scale data (RADseq and target enrichment) for understanding the population genetic structure of <em>Eremidium margaratae</em>, and the evolutionary relationships within <em>Eremidium</em>. The molecular data revealed the presence of several cryptic species, pointing to the incredible diversity of these flightless grasshoppers in the South African habitat islands. Another important outcome of this project was the bolstered collaborative partnership between PI Otte and PI Song, which allowed the transfer of taxonomic knowledge from one generation to the next, which contributed to reducing taxonomic impediment in this fauna.</p> <p>In terms of broader impacts, this project provided summer REU opportunities for two undergraduate students, both of whom went on to pursue graduate degrees in entomology. The specimen-level data generated from this project provided critical information about the species diversity and distribution patterns to the conservation scientists in South Africa so that informed decisions can be made for long-term conservation efforts.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 06/09/2021<br>      Modified by: Daniel&nbsp;Otte</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1655097/1655097_10470867_1623220791085_2018team--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1655097/1655097_10470867_1623220791085_2018team--rgov-800width.jpg" title="2018 expedition"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1655097/1655097_10470867_1623220791085_2018team--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="2018 expedition"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">In front of helicopter heading to inselbergs</div> <div class="imageCredit">Hojun Song</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Creative Commons</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Daniel&nbsp;Otte</div> <div class="imageTitle">2018 expedition</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1655097/1655097_10470867_1623220849027_2017team--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1655097/1655097_10470867_1623220849027_2017team--rgov-800width.jpg" title="2017 expedition"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1655097/1655097_10470867_1623220849027_2017team--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="2017 expedition"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Surveying Afromontane forests</div> <div class="imageCredit">Hojun Song</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Creative Commons</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Daniel&nbsp;Otte</div> <div class="imageTitle">2017 expedition</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1655097/1655097_10470867_1623220958922_RicardoandGregsortingsamples--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1655097/1655097_10470867_1623220958922_RicardoandGregsortingsamples--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Specimen sorting"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1655097/1655097_10470867_1623220958922_RicardoandGregsortingsamples--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Specimen sorting"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Field sampling and sorting</div> <div class="imageCredit">Hojun Song</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Creative Commons</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Daniel&nbsp;Otte</div> <div class="imageTitle">Specimen sorting</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1655097/1655097_10470867_1623221073434_Inserbergfromhelicopter--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1655097/1655097_10470867_1623221073434_Inserbergfromhelicopter--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Inselberg"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1655097/1655097_10470867_1623221073434_Inserbergfromhelicopter--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Inselberg"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Inselberg looking from the helicopter</div> <div class="imageCredit">Hojun Song</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Creative Commons</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Daniel&nbsp;Otte</div> <div class="imageTitle">Inselberg</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1655097/1655097_10470867_1623221171279_Carla--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1655097/1655097_10470867_1623221171279_Carla--rgov-800width.jpg" title="REU"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1655097/1655097_10470867_1623221171279_Carla--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="REU"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Carla De Loera, REU student</div> <div class="imageCredit">Hojun Song</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Creative Commons</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Daniel&nbsp;Otte</div> <div class="imageTitle">REU</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
