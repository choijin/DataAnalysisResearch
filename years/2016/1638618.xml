<AbstractNarration>The scientists identify fair resource sharing methods as a critical concern in the design of smart radio networks.   The researchers note that fair sharing of resources is of fundamental importance in human communities, and propose to apply social network methods to the design of dynamic spectrum access systems.   By applying the experience from a mature field, they plan to solve some of the more complex issues related to spectrum sharing in a constantly changing technical environment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In drawing the connection from the problem of resource-sharing in Cognitive Radio (CR), to models of solutions found within human/animal societies, the proposed research evaluates the extent to which our models of patterns of co-use in biological systems can be profitably leveraged within the context of distributed uncoordinated CR societies to enable individuals and groups to maximize their utility. Of particular relevance to this endeavor is recent ethnographic research on foraging networks of indigenous peoples and human foragers, which has found social relations to be a critical context in which natural selection acts on resource use and co-use behaviors. These findings concerning human behavior lie at the forefront of anthropology, revealing the tensions between sharing networks and optimal strategies and altering our understanding of past human social evolution, and by extension, our vision of the future evolution of artificial CR societies.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Cellphone manufacturers and service providers continue to develop different strategies for managing radio frequency spectrum as they compete for limited customers and bandwidth resources.  The way in which these corporate entities and their technologies share and compete for radio spectrum has many similarities to the resource sharing strategies that anthropologists, archaeologists and zoologists have recorded from early human and primitive animal societies.  In this project, we explored how the etiquette of spectrum sharing among cellphones can be improved by incorporating the data we have on behaviors in contemporary human and animal societies, which have evolved to become efficient over very long stretches of time.  What we found is that over time, as cellphone technologies continue to evolve, we can expect them to begin to forage for spectrum, to form social coalitions amongst themselves, and to create hierarchies as they attempt to maximize their effectiveness.  These results were first determined using computer simulations, and later verified by building hardware prototypes.  What we were able to show is that cellular digital technology and its relationship to limited natural resources (like bandwidth) is not that unlike the relationship that humans have to limited natural resources (like food).  These limitations are what create a pressure for the technology to evolve (in ways that can be predicted), both in terms of its capabilities, and in terms of the social structures that emerge.  Knowing the nature of this evolutionary pressure helps us understand the possible future trajectories that communication technology may take, and thus to accelerate its advancement.
