<AbstractNarration>NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Presently, the majority of polymers are derived from petroleum feedstocks. The development of sustainable, alternative resources for polymers is an open societal challenge. Epoxy resins are an important commercial class of polymer used in a variety of applications such as structural applications, advanced adhesives, aerospace and automotive components, and wind turbine blades. Epoxy resins are derived predominantly from petrochemicals. Additionally, these polymers cannot be recycled after the useful lifetime of the material. Plastic waste which is not recycled resides in landfills, and sometimes in unintentional locations such as waterways. This project will develop new epoxy resins with a reduced environmental impact through implementation of sustainable sources and enhancing the biodegradability of the materials. Two plant-based resources will be examined: vegetable oils and phenolic acids (found in many fruit and vegetable byproducts). Chemical routes will be developed for preparation of these materials, and their physical performance will be investigated. This project will also cultivate knowledge in students, educators and the general public on the impact of polymers on the environment, through the following activities: expansion of the Materials Day at UH program for local K-12 students, development of modules for the Houston Energy Day and Houston Earth Day celebrations, and participation of graduate and undergraduate students in research activities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TECHNICAL SUMMARY:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this project is to develop new epoxy resins which contain sustainable, biodegradable, and non-toxic components, yet maintain the advantageous properties of conventional, petroleum-sourced materials. The research plan is structured around three specific aims. In the first aim, synthetic strategies will be established for epoxy resins containing biobased components. Plant-sourced phenolic acids will be employed to impart desirable mechanical behavior to the epoxy resins (due to the presence of aromatic rings) and soybean oil will be employed to impart biodegradability to the epoxy resins (due to the presence of ester linkages). In the second aim, a detailed understanding of structure-property-function relationships in sustainable epoxy resins will be developed. The functionality of the starting components is expected to have a great impact on the structural parameters of the epoxy network and ultimate macroscopic mechanical properties. The design of multicomponent epoxy resins will be leveraged to develop microphase separated thermoset blends with advantageous properties. In the third aim, hydrolytic degradation and biodegradation of epoxy resins containing soybean oil will be investigated. A key premise of the proposed work is that epoxy resins derived from soybean oil will maintain their properties during the useful lifetime of the products they are utilized in, yet can undergo biodegradation in a compost environment. The expected outcomes from this study are synthetic pathways to epoxy resins from non-traditional sources, characterization of the thermal and mechanical behavior of the newly derived epoxy resins, morphological investigation of microphase separated multicomponent epoxy resins, and hydrolytic and biodegradation mechanisms of epoxy resins which contain ester linkages.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The development of biodegradable or chemically degradable plastics from renewable sources provides a complementary solution to conventional plastic recycling processes. When considering all of the plastics produced in the United States, only 9% are recovered through recycling. Plastic recycling is expensive as the various types of plastics must be separated and sorting techniques are non-trivial. Even more importantly, not all plastics can be recycled, and the recycled plastics often have inferior properties compared to the original materials, limiting their potential applications. Thermoset polymers are highly crosslinked and glassy polymers comprising around 15% of polymers produced in the U.S., with increasing global production. Though thermoset polymers are typically used in durable, longer lifetime applications, such as in aerospace and automotive industries, wind turbine blades, and structural components, their highly crosslinked network structures prevent recycling of these materials. As a result, most thermoset polymers are landfilled or incinerated after their useful lifetimes. Their growing use, and related generation of waste, may present significant environmental challenges in the future.</p> <p>In this project, sustainable thermosets have been developed which were derived from biorenewable resources, such as lignocellulose, vegetable oils, and other plant-based sources. The specific type of thermoset that has been developed is an epoxy resin, which is synthesized through the reaction of a multifunctional epoxide-containing molecule with a multifunctional curing agent (such as an amine or anhydride). The traditional bisphenol A-based epoxy monomer was replaced with plant-based molecules. In the first phase of this project, biobased phenolic acids (salicylic acid and 4-hydroxybenzoic acid) were epoxidized and subsequently reacted with an anhydride curing agent to form epoxy networks. The resulting epoxy resins exhibited comparable glass transition temperatures, moduli and tensile strengths to a conventional bisphenol A-based epoxy resin (cured under similar conditions). Additionally, one plant-based resin exhibited similar elongation at break and tensile toughness as the bisphenol A-based epoxy resin. The second phase of this project focused on the development of epoxy resins from lignocellulose.&nbsp; Lignocellulose is the most abundant global source of biomass. While cellulose has many uses, such as in the paper industry, the lignin component of lignocellulose is an intractable material and often incinerated for energy. There is thus much current interest on how to transform lignin to useful materials. In this project, epoxy resins were derived from vanillic acid, which is a compound produced during the catalytic depolymerization of lignin. The vanillic acid-based epoxy resins showed a high glass transition temperature and excellent mechanical properties. These biobased epoxy resins therefore can also replace traditional bisphenol A-based epoxy resins in applications without loss of properties.</p> <p>A concurrent research theme of this project addressed the end-of-life of epoxy resins. One promising method of addressing epoxy resin and other thermoset waste is through degradation of the material to small molecule byproducts, which can then be subsequently reused to make new materials.
