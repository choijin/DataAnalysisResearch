<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) project is to investigate the feasibility of developing a novel clinical genomics software analysis platform that may help reduce or eliminate some of the most significant challenges associated with genetic testing. In the US, genomics plays a role in 9 of the 10 leading causes of death including cancer, heart disease, stroke, diabetes, and Alzheimer's disease. As such, genetic testing is growing very rapidly, as are some of the associated challenges of scale, performance, cost and quality.  Genomic medicine and genetic testing are key underpinnings of precision medicine, which may help lead to improved diagnosis, treatment, and even prevention of complex diseases and disorders. This feasibility study targets the development of an advanced analysis software platform to address analysis bottlenecks and ultimately improve time-to-treatment. The team will determine feasibility based on prototyping key technologies and methods to address current state limitations and point towards an improved future-state approach.  The study will be done in close collaboration with actual clinical genomics users to deliver clear and compelling benefits to the target market and end-users and to provide a high-value solution to the rapidly growing market segment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This STTR Phase I project proposes to design and prototype a novel genomics software analysis platform.  It will include access to a large work bench of bioinformatics applications and performance optimized clinical analysis workflows running on scalable public cloud-based, HIPAA-compliant computing infrastructure. The platform will be developed following the software-as-a-service model, designed to optimize performance and costs for next generation sequencing (NGS) analysis. The project will entail development of advanced proprietary computational algorithms to parallelize execution of analysis tasks, and the creation of highly optimized genomics analysis workflows. These workflows will result in dramatic time-savings as well as reduced costs compared to current state approaches. Project efforts also will focus on the development of sophisticated resource provisioning logic to exploit scale and cost optimization running on public cloud infrastructure. In addition, the project will include the feasibility of developing a dual-purpose platform for R&amp;D and clinical usage for faster testing and adoption of newer and advanced tools and procedures. The technology will help to improve patient care by delivering results substantially faster, with higher quality and at lower cost. Additionally, users will be able to construct and validate custom analysis workflows that meet HIPAA, CLIA-CAP, and other clinical requirements.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Navipoint Genomics is an early stage company developing a novel genomics analysis platform that provides clinicians and diagnosticians with a high-performance, cost-effective solution to meet the rapidly growing needs in the field of precision medicine.  With a deeper understanding of the genetic basis of complex diseases and disorders, genomics analysis can improve diagnosis and treatment for millions of individuals.  The main goal of our STTR Phase I project was to evaluate feasibility for the development of a novel clinical genomics analysis platform. The objectives of the project were as follows:  Objective #1:  Improve productivity of genetic diagnostic labs by implementing cost and performance optimized analytical workflows to handle growing sequencing data volumes.  Objective #2:  Develop a HIPAA compliant platform that meets CLIA-CAP requirements on public cloud resources (Amazon Web Services) Objective #3:  Develop a dual-purpose platform to support R&amp;D and clinical environments thus allowing clinical labs to test and adopt the latest tools enabling continuous innovation and remain competitive.   In terms of improving the productivity of genetic data analysts and addressing significant challenges faced by clinical diagnostic labs in terms of meeting rapidly increasing volume of genetic tests, we prototyped our cost and performance optimization approaches to significantly improve bioinformatics workflow execution, which is a key bottleneck area in carrying out genetic testing.  We employed various parallelization techniques, cloud-based resource profiling, and intelligent resource provisioning to demonstrate an order of magnitude improvement in both cost and performance of bioinformatics analysis. We also demonstrated scalability by successfully running 800 samples in parallel in roughly the time taken to run a single sample, utilizing elastic compute resources in AWS and our optimized workflows.   It was evident during our customer interviews that demonstrating enhanced data security and achieving HIPAA compliance for our proposed clinical solution was a ?must-have? capability.  This was especially true for a software platform (e.g. Navipoint Genomics) running on public cloud infrastructure. It also became evident that many customers needed software capabilities that also simplify and aid diagnostic labs in meeting CLIA-CAP requirements from the standpoint of clinical certification. With multiple pilot customers utilizing clinical data, we were able to capture detailed requirements in implementing both HIPAA and CLIA-CAP compliant solutions. We successfully demonstrated HIPAA and CLIA-CAP adherence over the course of the Phase I project.  The field of genomics is evolving rapidly and clinical diagnostic labs need to adopt the latest tools and methods to meet a myriad of requirements imposed on their growing portfolio of genetic tests: achieving high quality and clinically reproducible results, accelerating analysis turn-around-time, implementing a scalable and cost-effective approach to retain margins relative to insurance reimbursement rates, and staying innovative by developing new and improved genetic tests.
