<AbstractNarration>A major role of mathematics is to provide a framework or language for scientific research. This mathematical research project centers on the concept of shapes and their evolution, a fundamental object of study in many parts of science. Examples range from the shapes of complicated molecules, such as proteins and enzymes, to the configurations of the solar system. In mathematics, Teichmueller theory is the study of the shapes that a surface can assume. In this project, surfaces, their geodesics (shortest paths), and their evolution will be studied in two different settings. In the first, the surfaces have a geometry in which they are flat and so have zero curvature. In the second, the surfaces have negative curvature. Results of the project will deepen and extend understanding in geometry and topology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project addresses questions in a wide spectrum of mathematics, including the fields of complex analysis, dynamical systems, geometry, and topology. Important examples of dynamical systems are interval exchange transformations and flows on translation surfaces. Important aspects of these dynamical systems are ergodicity and counting problems. The properties of an individual translation surface are intimately related to the study of the moduli space of all translation surfaces. The project concerns questions in both these subjects. The investigator plans to continue study of the mixing properties of the Weil-Petersson geodesic flow on the moduli space of Riemann surfaces. Knowledge of this flow will greatly expand our understanding of the geometry of Riemann surfaces. A fundamental object in topology and geometry is the mapping class group of a surface; the project aims to further understanding by studying the lattice counting problem for the mapping class group acting on Teichmueller space.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The PI has worked in the related fields of mathematics called dynamical systems, flat geometry and complex analysis. In dynamical systems one studies the behavior of objects  as they move according to some rule. In flat geometry one studies surfaces equipped with a geometry that makes them look like the two dimensional plane. In the related field of complex analysis one studies these same surfaces from the different point of view of using complex numbers. They are then called Riemann surfaces.     These fields come together in the study of billiards in polygons in the plane and a  closely related dynamical system called an interval exchange transformation on the real line.  Both billiards and interval exchange transformations can be studied by transforming the problems of studying orbits of points into a study of straight on  flat surfaces.  An important question about any   dynamical systems is whether orbits are equidistributed which means that over a long period, the amount of time spent in any region  is proportional to the area of the region. This property is called ergodicity. One of the major outcomes of the work of the PI, joint with Jonathan Chaika was to show that there are many interval exchange transformations that fail to be ergodic. Another project that the PI is in the process of completing is to study these examples that are not ergodic and to quantify how far from equidistributed they are.  Another project completed under the grant was to study the geometry of random flat surfaces.  That means to take a surface at random and ask about its diameter, the length of its shortest loop and so forth. This work was joint with the mathematicians Kasra Rafi and Anja Randecker.     The PI and his collaborators have contributed to the broader impact by publishing their work in journals and speaking  about it in seminars and conferences around the world.
