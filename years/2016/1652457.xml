<AbstractNarration>The collection of organisms and genetic samples from many countries is fundamental to a wide range of biological research, including ecology, systematics, and evolution.  It is critical that scientists understand the requirements concerning such collections in the countries in which they work.  This workshop will bring together U.S. scientists for the purpose of understanding the research implications of the Nagoya Protocol, which calls for sharing of benefits from the use of genetic resources.  The Protocol aims to create greater legal certainty and transparency for both providers and users of genetic resources by establishing more predictable conditions for access to genetic resources, and helping to ensure benefit sharing when genetic resources leave the country.  Many researchers are unaware of the detailed requirements of the Protocol and the downstream expectations associated with the permits they have secured.  The knowledge gained by the scientific community through this workshop will ensure that research conducted internationally is done in a legally responsible manner. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During this two-day workshop, representatives from diverse professional biological societies will learn about the requirements of the Nagoya Protocol, explore its current effects on research, and identify issues that may affect biological research in the future. Government agency representatives, legal scholars, and researchers with direct knowledge about Protocol implications will present information critical to the biological researchers. The professional society leaders will then convey this information to their members through annual society meetings. Presentations will include not only the requirements of the Protocol and how to respond to them, but also case studies from researchers engaged in the field. Finally, participants will be invited to help develop a series of follow-on communications targeted for particular audiences (e.g., vice presidents for research, museum collections managers and curators, individual researchers) and/or particular topics (e.g., implications for specific subfields of biology), reducing the possibility that research will be hindered by lack of knowledge about country-specific requirements for benefit sharing.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Nagoya Protocol to the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) calls for sharing of benefits from the use of genetic resources, defined by the CBD as "genetic material of actual or potential value." The major goals of this project were to convene a workshop of biological professional society leaders to learn about the requirements of the Nagoya Protocol, explore its current effects on research, identify issues that may affect biological research in the future, and identify future outreach and communications efforts to help researchers navigate the Protocol.  One of the most significant results of this project and workshop has been creating and maintaining an active, engaged community of professionals who are committed to Nagoya Protocol outreach efforts within their institutions, professional societies, and disciplines. This community has been engaged in ongoing discussions on the scope of the Nagoya Protocol and has hosted talks and webinars, authored publications, and has created a learning portal to highlight relevant, trusted resources to support researchers.    The Nagoya Protocol Learning Portal (learnnagoya.com) consolidates information in one place, is organized to accommodate a variety of audiences, and is communicated with clear, transparent language. The portal also creates a community space to share experiences (e.g. specifically sharing stories and experiences with non-monetary benefit sharing) and organizes resources (e.g. use cases and teaching tools) to help ensure people know about the requirements early on and can plan for them accordingly.  The impact of these efforts mean that more researchers are becoming aware of the Nagoya Protocol?s requirements and what they need to do to prepare and comply with country-specific requirements and encourages them to engage in important conversations on the Nagoya Protocol and its future implications in research. As a result, scientists, collections managers, research administrators, museum managers, biological researchers, university professors, students, and early career scientists are equipped with contacts, tools, and opportunities to productively engage in international research that is compliant with the Nagoya Protocol and enriched by international collaborations.  Effective implementation of the Nagoya Protocol offers opportunities for greater international collaboration in biological research, with benefit-sharing potentially including involvement of host country researchers and indigenous peoples in research by U.S.-based scientists.
