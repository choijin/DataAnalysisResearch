<AbstractNarration>The Colleges of Science &amp; Engineering and Graduate Education, and the Metro Academies College Success Program (Metro) at San Francisco State University in partnership with San Francisco Unified School District and the San Francisco Chamber of Commerce develop an integrated approach for computing education that overcomes obstacles hampering broader participation in the U.S. science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) workforce. The partnership fosters a more diverse and computing-proficient STEM workforce by establishing an inclusive education approach in computer science (CS), information technology, and computer engineering that keeps students at all levels engaged and successful in computing and graduates them STEM career-ready. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Utilizing the collective impact framework maximizes the efficacy of existing regional organizations to broaden participation of groups under-educated in computing.  The collective impact model establishes a rich context for organizational engagement in inclusive teaching and learning of CS. The combination of the collective impact model of social agency and direct engagements with communities yields unique insights into the views and experiences of the target population of students and serves as a platform for national scalable networks.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  Project Overview We are designing and aligning a K&ndash;20 pathway to computer science (CS) careers by broadening participation (1) at the K&ndash;12 level; (2) across key transitions between K&ndash;12 and college and at the college level; (3) by coordinating cross&ndash;sector stakeholder support for K&ndash;20 STEM student success, and (4) by aligning K&ndash;12 CS curricula and partnerships to build the framework for establishing the SF CALL K&ndash;20 ALLIANCE. We are selecting K&ndash;20 for BP to provide entry and reentry pathways for careers in computing. In 2016, the NSF awarded San Francisco State University (SFSU) an NSF INCLUDES grant to create equitable K-20 computer science career pathways across the San Francisco Bay Area beginning with strategic partnerships between SFSU and San Francisco Unified School District (SFUSD). At the K-12 level, CSME (Center for Science and Math Education, SFSU) supports SFUSD in becoming the first large urban school district to implement a PreK-12 CS curriculum in their CS for All initiative. CS faculty provide professional development workshops for district teachers, and pedagogical support for CS majors who serve as classroom assistants directly in district middle school CS classes. SFSU CS faculty also collaborate with district staff to develop the K-12 CS curriculum. CSME also supports the development of CS coursework for in-service CS teachers so they can develop their knowledge and add a supplemental authorization to their credential in CS teaching. At the transition from high school to college, the SFSU Metro Academies provide intensive mentoring for at-risk undergraduate students in CS related majors at SFSU and City College of SF, the two most common colleges attended by SFUSD students. In college, SFSU has developed innovative supplemental instruction workshops for difficult bottleneck CS courses. These workshops are taught by pairs of near-peers, successful upper-division students. This model has been proven to increase grades and student success. CS faculty are revising the pedagogy of these courses by infusing more problem-solving and design projects into the CS curriculum. SF CALL also supports the development of student leadership groups to create support communities. Key Contributions    One key contribution is in developing curriculum and teacher professional development to support computer science instruction in K-8, as stand-alone courses in middle school and as classroom modules in elementary school.  Our project makes contributions in the development at the high school level, but many high schools offer at least some CS coursework. To our knowledge, the collaboration between SFSU and SF Unified School District is the first to aim for computer science learning for all students K-12, regardless of class, race and home resources.   We have adapted curriculum from various sources for K-8 and these curricula are being packaged to be shared with other schools.   We have developed a summer institute that accommodates school teachers across K-12, with breakout sessions by level (elementary, middle, high school) and also plenary sessions bringing everyone together.  We have already begun discussions with Alameda County Office of Education and schools in Santa Clara County for more district partners. We have also developed a model of collaboration between university and school district in the development of curriculum and professional development. In California, we are also on the forefront of offering a supplemental authorization for credentialed teachers to specialize in computer science teaching. We are distributing our model to other campuses in the California State University system, the preparers of the large majority of school teachers in California.
