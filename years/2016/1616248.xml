<AbstractNarration>Many real-world problems can be modeled by geometric graphs: systems&lt;br/&gt;of vertices that represent geometric objects and edges that represent&lt;br/&gt;connections or interactions between pairs of these objects. For&lt;br/&gt;instance, the vertices of a road network may represent intersections&lt;br/&gt;or junctions of roads, while the edges represent the segments of road&lt;br/&gt;between two consecutive intersections. Although these graphs are not&lt;br/&gt;planar (a road can cross a bridge without intersecting the road beneath), such crossings are&lt;br/&gt;uncommon, and the project will investigate ways of exploiting that&lt;br/&gt;sparse crossing structure to efficiently solve problems such as route&lt;br/&gt;planning on road networks. Similarly, the project will investigate the&lt;br/&gt;structure of the underlying geometric graphs, and the use of that&lt;br/&gt;structure to develop efficient algorithms, for other problems that&lt;br/&gt;include the visualization of hierarchically clustered networks,&lt;br/&gt;pattern mining in social networks, splitting large scientific&lt;br/&gt;simulations into smaller subproblems with low amounts of interaction&lt;br/&gt;between the subproblems, the analysis of mechanical systems of rigid&lt;br/&gt;parts connected by hinges, the design of maps that distort geographic&lt;br/&gt;areas to display other types of quantitative information, and the&lt;br/&gt;visualization of overlaps between fragments of DNA sequences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project proposes attacks on a large collection of problems from&lt;br/&gt;application areas where sparse geometric graphs naturally arise. The&lt;br/&gt;project suggests a model for real-world road networks in which a&lt;br/&gt;derived graph of edges and their crossings has bounded degeneracy, and&lt;br/&gt;seeks to investigate how sparsity properties of this crossing graph&lt;br/&gt;affect the underlying road graph. The project seeks to determine&lt;br/&gt;whether it is hard to recognize the graphs of 4-polytopes and simple&lt;br/&gt;4-polytopes, and whether a recognition algorithm of the investigator&lt;br/&gt;for a special class of 4-polytopes can be extended to a realization&lt;br/&gt;algorithm. The graphs in this class have small separators, and the&lt;br/&gt;project seeks to determine whether this is true more generally for&lt;br/&gt;certain graphs derived from planar clustered graph drawings. The&lt;br/&gt;project seeks efficient data structures that maintain low-degeneracy&lt;br/&gt;orientations of a dynamic graph and use these orientations to quickly&lt;br/&gt;find features in the graph, needed when fitting social networks to&lt;br/&gt;exponential random graph models. Finite element meshes with bounded&lt;br/&gt;aspect ratio for each element have small separators, but arbitrary&lt;br/&gt;tetrahedral meshes do not. The project seeks intermediate conditions&lt;br/&gt;on the shape of the elements in a mesh that would ensure the existence&lt;br/&gt;of small separators. The graphs arising in kinematic analysis can be&lt;br/&gt;characterized by linear bounds on the edges in each subgraph, and&lt;br/&gt;recognized in quadratic time by a pebbling algorithm. The project&lt;br/&gt;seeks more efficient algorithms to test the rigidity or degrees of&lt;br/&gt;freedom of mechanical structures in subquadratic time. Subdivisions of&lt;br/&gt;rectangles into smaller rectangles have applications in architectural&lt;br/&gt;design, cartographic information visualization, and VLSI design. An&lt;br/&gt;area-universal subdivision is one that can fit any assignment of areas&lt;br/&gt;to its rectangles. The project seeks efficient algorithms to construct&lt;br/&gt;area-universal subdivisions as well as subdivisions produced by a&lt;br/&gt;recursive splitting process. Unit interval graphs arise in modeling&lt;br/&gt;human preferences and in DNA physical mapping. Some problems that are&lt;br/&gt;hard on broader graph classes can be solved efficiently on unit&lt;br/&gt;interval graphs by representing the graph using a binary sequence and&lt;br/&gt;applying a finite automaton to the sequence. The project seeks a more&lt;br/&gt;general explanation of this phenomenon. In graph drawing, styles of&lt;br/&gt;graph drawing on the basis that are somewhere-dense allow all graphs&lt;br/&gt;to be drawn in that style with constant bends per edge while nowhere&lt;br/&gt;dense styles require an unbounded number of bends per edge. The&lt;br/&gt;project seeks a theory of sparsity distinguishing nowhere-dense styles&lt;br/&gt;that require many bends per edge from those that require few&lt;br/&gt;bends. Additional components of the project include questions on&lt;br/&gt;diameter graphs and book thickness.</AbstractNarration>
