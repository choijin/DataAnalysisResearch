<AbstractNarration>Error-correcting codes and point lattices are central primitives in science and engineering (e.g., in communication and storage systems, electronic circuit design, and secure cryptographic systems). These algebraic primitives also have deep connections with fundamental questions in theoretical computer science and mathematics. Despite being intensely studied for their practical relevance, many computational problems on such algebraic objects remain widely open. Consequently, improving our understanding of the power and limitations of codes and lattices in diverse computational models will have a significant impact in many application domains.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The research plan outlined in this project aims to address algorithmic challenges at the heart of modern cryptography and coding theory, by proposing novel approaches and models of computation. The project aims to reveal influential interconnections between codes and lattices, and between the computational problems specific to them, by leveraging algebraic and geometric aspects, together with notions of structure and symmetry. The outcomes of this project will be integrated in new courses, and in undergraduate and graduate research. This project will also help support an active theory group at Purdue University, and help train students to become competitive in their future careers.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Specifically, the proposed project will advance the state of the art of computational problems that can be abstracted as variants of nearest-neighbor search problems in the context of error-correcting codes and point lattices. Efficient algorithms for these problems could play a transformative role in applications to storage systems, and hardness results could impact the security of lattice-base cryptography. The project will also focus on conceptualizing and formalizing models of sublinear computation for lattice problems, with the goal of overcoming known barriers from the study of sublinear models for codes. Super-efficient algorithms for lattice problems could have applications in mathematical optimization, and in lattice-based communication. The project will explore and develop insights from diverse areas including coding and information theory, sublinear algorithms, cryptography, and optimizations.</AbstractNarration>

Specifically, the research makes progress on understanding the complexity of the fundamental question of decoding Reed-Solomon codes, improving asymptotically upon previous NP-hardness bounds. The research also focuses on the analogous objects of point lattices, and on their connection with the classical Nearest Neighbor Search problem: it shows new Locality Sensitive Hashing schemes that are provably efficient, achieve the optimal "LSH exponent", and are based on natural constructions. The PI?s research also initiates the study of sublinear models for lattices, by showing the first algorithms and lower bounds for locally testing several classical families of lattices. These results could have real applicability in many areas where lattices provide the right abstraction, including optimizations, security, communication, machine learning and databases.  Further research outcomes include: advances in the topic of testing Boolean functions, by initiating the study of "k-monotonicity", providing algorithms, separation results, and lower bounds; significant results initiating the study of learning distributions in distributed settings under communication constraints, showing the first complexity results in this area, and proving guarantees for several communication protocols; a suite of results in the area of streaming algorithms for various computational problems on graphs and strings, focusing on fundamental combinatorial problems such as matching, and on detecting structure in noisy streams of characters.  The grant helped support two PhD students who are continuing an academic career.
