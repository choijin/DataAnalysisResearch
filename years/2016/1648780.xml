<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) is a health informatics platform to affect self-management of chronic disease through non-pharmacological interventions. Currently 25% of Americans live with one or more chronic conditions. Yet they consume 86% of the national healthcare resource, which was estimated at $3 trillion in 2015. SIPPA Health Informatics Platform transforms the non-pharmacological intervention delivery model through personalized software services by incorporating a survey feedback loop. This improves patient experience and engagement, and contributes to collecting big data for linking motivation to behavioral therapy --- resulting in an effect essential to improving population health and advancing personalized precision medicine.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project is the development of a health informatics infrastructure --- referred to as SIPPA Health Informatics Platform (SHIP). The objective is to determine the technical feasibility of SHIP for enabling the Information-Motivation-Behavioral skill (IMB) model to link software services to motivational strategies. Our approach is to develop and incorporate (1) a dynamic survey engine that encourages a collaborative approach to engage patients and providers to securely exchange health data, and to communicate clearly the action plan preferences of an intervention, and (2) a data analytics algorithm that will utilize dynamic survey feedback provided by a chronic patient, and the log data of software service usage, to identify critical determinants of motivation. An IRB approved pilot will be incorporated in this research to carry out empirical study to help caregivers gain insights into developing personalized healthcare and intervention plan, and to assist in developing a patient-centered collaborative model of care.</AbstractNarration>

Figure 2 shows the interactive (control panel) display of SIPPA Health mobile app for delivering digital health software services such as reminders for medication adherence, encrypting/decryption health record to gain awareness on health condition, and video chat to enable teleconsultation support for chronic disease self-management. Outcomes  The following is a list of noteworthy findings obtained from the pilot study.  When compared to healthy pilot participants, pilot participants with a chronic condition show a stronger motivation for understanding medications as evidenced by a much stronger interest in researching medication. Pilot participants without a chronic condition show a stronger motivation and intent on consolidating their health records than those with a chronic condition. Pilot participants with a chronic condition show a strong preference (measured by quantifiable motivation, attitude, and ownership) on "video chat" when compared to those without a chronic condition. The attitude towards telehealth and/or social support is positive among pilot participants with a chronic condition.  In comparing to the healthy pilot participants, pilot participants with a chronic condition show a stronger motivation and intention to manage their health. This is evidenced by a strong correlation between their motivation and intent with health record encryption and decryption. An explanation is that individuals with a chronic condition are more concerned about the security of their sensitive health information, and are more likely to need access, thus a stronger intent to act on encrypting and decrypting their health records. During the exit interviews, we asked participants to discuss their experience, their likes, dislikes, feature-preferences, and opportunities for improvement. Among their suggestions participants mentioned the need for additional health and fitness capabilities (e.g., goal setting &amp; tracking), access to health information resources (e.g., articles on grains and nutrition), and improvements to ease of use.  From the tenor of the interviews, it is clear that participants see value in the concept and idea of SIPPA. Interacting with SIPPA stimulated curiosity which is one manifestation of intention and motivation.  Benefits  A benefit of predicting behavior indicators is to inform the design of digital health services. This creates an opportunity for engaging individuals through digital health technology for an improved adherence to action plans for chronic disease self-management. With the increase in the size of the aging population and projected shortage of the primary care physicians, chronic disease self-management could alleviate the stress in the current healthcare system. With even just 1% impact on the patient engagement, this could translate to $2.5 billion saving in the healthcare system for the chronic disease management.  SIPPA Health informatics platform is designed to provide support for stakeholders in  (Home) healthcare. Remote Patient Monitoring. Emergency Medical Service.  TeleHealth Delivery.  Products &amp; services developed in support of this research:  A privacy-preserved means of obtaining participant behavior information using the SIPPA Health app, collecting user attitudes as survey responses and linking response data to behavior constructs. A predictive engine based on the behavior constructs revealing the motivation indicators of an individual for self-health management. A dynamic survey mechanism to engage an individual in interactive self-health management A novel strategy design pattern that incorporates behavior constructs into the software design process; and a proof-of-concept implementation of pedometer (step counting) feature. A revised SIPPA Health mobile app that incorporates feedback and comments from the usability study, with additional features of a pedometer, and unique patient ID generation and verification.  Conclusion  This project has demonstrated the feasibility of developing a tool that aligns actionable health-behavior change with self-monitoring and self-health management of chronic diseases.
