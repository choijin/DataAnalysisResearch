<AbstractNarration>Florida International University and AmLight consortium partners are planning, designing, and defining a strategy for high capacity connectivity research and education network connectivity between the US and West Africa, called AARCLight: Americas Africa Research and eduCation Lightpaths. Science is being conducted in an era of information abundance.  Sharing science resources, such as data, instrumentation, technology, and best practices, across national borders, can promote expanded scientific inquiry, and has the potential to advance discovery. Linking the U.S. and the nations of Africa's researcher and education communities is an increasingly strategic priority. Africa offers research and education communities with unique biological, environmental, geological, anthropological, and cultural resources. Research challenges in atmospheric and geosciences, materials sciences, tropical diseases, biology, astronomy, and other disciplines will benefit by enhancing the technological and social connections between the research and education communities of the US and Africa.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The planning project is largely based on the planned availability of submarine cable spectrum for use by research and education communities.  It creates an unprecedented opportunity for the stakeholders in the U.S., Africa, and Brazil to coordinate planning efforts to strategically make use of the offered spectrum towards serving the broadest communities of interest in research and education. The AmLight consortium partners are the (Brazilian Education and Research Network  (RNP), Academic Network of SÃ£o Paulo (ANSP), Latin American Cooperation of Advanced Networks (CLARA), Chile's Red Universitaria Nacional (REUNA), Florida LambdaRail (FLR), Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy (AURA), and Latin American Nautilus)</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The AARCLight project has created several critical components to revolutionizing U.S. collaboration with the African continent. AARCLight has created a critical mass of connectivity by establishing agreements for spectrum between the U.S. and Luanda, Angola that could last 35 years. AARCLight has fostered critical research collaborations with the nascent and established African regional network consortiums as WACREN and UbuntuNet Connect Alliance.&nbsp; AARCLight has developed a critical connection in partnership with SA NREN to extend 100G connectivity from Angola to South and on to East Africa. AARCLight has further strengthened its partnership with RNP and ANSP to ensure Brazilian collaboration in the operation and the development of U.S.-Brazil-Africa network connectivity.</p> <p>AARCLight has created a critical mass of connectivity by entering into an unprecedented contract with Angola Cable to secure lifetime-of-the-cable access to unlit spectrum on both MONET and on SACS submarine cable systems. This provides a new rising tide that lifts the paths of interconnectivity from the U.S. to Africa in a seamless submarine solution. This time frame, and the flexibility to light at whatever technology is currently available, provides a baseline for planning the next generation of collaborations and major instruments, safe in the understanding that there will be efficient, available, and unmediated connectivity between the continents.</p> <p><strong>Intellectual Merit</strong>: AARCLight has fostered critical research collaborations towards linking the U.S. to the research and education communities in the nations of Africa.

IRNC Backbone project for Latin America, so too will SKA act in that capacity to build out robust redundant network paths between S.
