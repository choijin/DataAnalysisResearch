<AbstractNarration>With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation Program (MRI) and support from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation (CRIF) and the Historically Black Colleges and Universities-Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP) as well as the Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR), Professor Terry Watt from Xavier University of Louisiana and collaborators have acquired a matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometer (MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer). In general, mass spectrometry (MS) is one of the key analytical methods used to identify and characterize small quantities of chemical species embedded in complex matrices. In a MALDI instrument, a laser striking on the unreactive supporting material embedded with the sample, vaporizes the sample and causes it to form charged particles (ions). The ions pass into the mass spectrometer where the masses of the parent ion and its fragment ions are measured. In a time-of-flight instrument the ions are accelerated by an electric field to allow further characterization. MALDI TOF combines gentle ionization (ideal for producing intact ions of peptides, proteins, nucleic acids, carbohydrates, synthetic polymers, and other similarly sized species) with a detection mode that offers an excellent balance between sensitivity and accuracy across a wide mass range. The collision-induced dissociation enables the molecular ions to break into pieces in the gas phase. This highly sensitive technique allows identification and determination of the structure of molecules in a complex mixture. This acquisition strengthens the research infrastructure at the University and regional area. The instrument broadens participation by involving diverse students in research and research training with this modern analytical technique.  The instrument is shared with students at Tulane University. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The award is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels at this HBCU, especially in areas such as (a) characterizing enzyme-substrate interactions of lysine deacetylases; (b) developing aptamers for small molecule detection coupled to glucose oxidase as a biosensor; (c) developing hydrogels using modified nucleobases; (d) using modified nucleobase hydrogels and dendrimers with precisely defined ligand content for targeted and controlled drug release; and (e) identifying transcription factor binding sites and binding partners.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goal of this project was to support projects in a variety of scientific areas at Xavier University of Louisiana by obtaining a MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer.  The instrument was utilized to advance research projects in the following areas: (1) protein biochemistry, by contributing to the identification of molecular features necessary for a group of enzymes to function as well as characterization of numerous proteins used in at least five distinct projects; (2) materials chemistry, by allowing for precision analysis of the size of synthesized polymers; (3) synthetic chemistry, by allowing for the identification of products of chemical reactions; and (4) nucleic acid biochemistry, to study the interactions of nucleic acid polymers.  In addition, the instrument  supported: (1) research training of underrepresented minorities; (2) research training of undergraduate students; and (3) development of advanced projects in upper-level chemistry laboratory courses.  During the award period, the instrument was utilized by 4 research groups at Xavier University of Louisiana, 2 groups at Tulane University, and one group each from Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center - New Orleans, Tulane University Medical Center, and Syracuse University.  8 undergraduate students were trained in the operation of the instrument and successfully acquired data for their projects; an additional 22 undergraduate students worked with data acquired on the instrument in a course-based setting.  Several graduate students, technicians, postdoctoral research staff, and faculty were also trained and directly utilized the instrument.  Data acquired using the instrument has been incorporated into three published peer-reviewed journal articles.  Preliminary results have also been presented, primarily by undergraduate students, in approximately a dozen research posters at national and regional meetings.  These presentations form the basis of additional journal articles currently in preparation.  The capabilities provided by the instrument have led to several new collaborations as well as extensions of research projects into successful independent research funding for faculty.  At the close of this award period, arrangements were made to obtain related instrumentation to build on the foundation enabled by this instrument and significantly enhance overall research capabilities.  Therefore, the MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer is serving as a core instrument that enables additional technologies.  The MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer will continue to serve the Xavier University of Louisiana and greater New Orleans research community for many additional years.
