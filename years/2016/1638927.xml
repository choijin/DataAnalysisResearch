<AbstractNarration>According to a USDA summary circa 2015, there exist 2.08 million farms in the US, spanning a total of 913 million acres with an average farm size of 438 acres. Efficiency and productivity are integral factors in profitability from agricultural operations. Efficiency and productivity critically depend on the level of automation or semi-automation, continuous real-time monitoring, continuous and timely intervention, and our ability to benefit from emerging scientific and technological innovations (e.g. low-cost and high-precision sensors, wireless technologies, etc). As part of previous NSF funded research, this I-Corps team has pioneered efficient localization algorithms for wireless sensor networks. The algorithms offer computational speed and real-time localization accuracy. Motivated by the broader impacts of these algorithms, the team is now interested in evaluating their commercial and technological potential to increase efficiency and productivity in American agriculture. This NSF I-Corps project and its potential outcomes are expected to be of high interest to the US Department of Agriculture. Potential customers include (1) Large agricultural companies; (2) Manufacturers of precision agriculture equipment; (3) Precision farming service providers; and most importantly (4) American farmers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This NSF I-Corps project will enable the team to better understand the market needs for an "electronic localization system," identify competing precision farming solutions, and build a demonstrable prototype. The proposed hardware consists of an array of sensor nodes with calibration and measurement capabilities (e.g. moisture, nitric oxide, sodium, temperature, etc.) that can be deployed throughout a given farmland. Software consists of data fusion and data-2-decision algorithms developed via our previously funded NSF technology (i.e. localization of a node). Functionally, each node is capable of detecting anomalies (e.g. high temperature and low moisture) and sending alert signals to the base station. The system alerts the farmer (or an autonomous vehicle) and offers precise localization and navigation to the concerned site for executing real-time remedial measures. The technology aims to eliminate dependence on global positioning systems (GPS), thereby offering a cost-effective precision farming solution for many rural environments where GPS is either undependable or unavailable. In this proposed I-Corps project, the team will (1) Interact with potential clients; (2) Investigate market needs and market size; (3) Learn about the supply chain and distribution channels; and (4) Talk to potential venture investors about what kind of precision agriculture innovations would be attractive for investment.</AbstractNarration>

The program also assisted us in developing strategies that lead to scalable and sustained impact beyond the typically short life cycle of the initial development.   Outcomes on Identification of Value Propositions  (a)   Innovative quick response oriented wireless sensor network.  (b)   Round-the-clock monitoring and ease in accessibility.  (c)    Advanced data fusion systems (algorithms).  (d)   Compatible and upgradeable.  (e)    Quick alert system.  Outcomes on Identification of Customer Segments   (I)    Outcomes on Identification of Farmer Line of Segment  (a)   Commercial availability of many similar products in the market to the customers.  (b)    Unreliability of product in application.  (c)     Price sensitivity of product.     (II) Outcomes on Identification of Goods Warehousing Line of Segment  (a)   Enhancing the productivity of employees by 10% with installation of mapping, location detection systems with indoor sensors for goods.  (b)   Though the product generated high interest among customers but the size of market is significantly low.  Outcomes on Identifying Challenges in Utilizing the Proposed Technology in Precision Agriculture  The primary pain of farmers (First customer line of segment) is multifaceted, for example California primary pain is "labor", Michigan primary pain is "Weather", Midwest grain industry primary pain is "Market price". Therefore, the application of our product does not converge within the horizon of a primary pain. In addition, availability of similar commercial products in the market, unreliability, price sensitivity and lack of customer interest in product were some of the reasons that held us back from proceeding further.  Outcomes on Identifying Challenges in Utilizing the Proposed Technology in Goods Warehousing   There were many challenges pointed out in the goods warehousing line of segment when it comes to developing and utilizing navigation and mapping network. These issues were summarized as follows: 1) pin point mapping of selected goods in a warehouse, 2) data log maintenance, and 3) ease of accessibility in terms of software platform and simple upgradation.

The importance and relevance of each of these challenges were further developed as part of our project.  The outcomes of I-Corps program efforts have implications for broader community of users who benefit from navigation and mapping network with advanced data fusion systems in goods warehousing.
