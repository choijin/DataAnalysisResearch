<AbstractNarration>Despite regional and national demand for geoscience graduates at all workforce entry points, educational institutions have struggled to increase enrollment, leading to only 240 individuals earning an associate's and only 3,800 earning a bachelor's degree out of roughly 28,000 enrolled undergraduates nationwide (American Geoscience Institute, Status of Recent Geoscience Graduates 2013). Currently accounting for over 50% of the nation's undergraduate population, community colleges are a crucial pipeline to the geosciences workforce. However, several barriers impact the recruitment, retention, and graduation of community college geosciences majors, including the diverse nature of students with respect to academic preparedness, economic standing, sense of support and awareness of career opportunities - making recruitment and persistence challenging for two-year geoscience programs.  To meet the employment demand, an increased number of students must enroll, persist and graduate from two-year geosciences programs. Suffolk County Community College (SCCC) proposes to address barriers to entry to geoscience careers through a new program, entitled GEO CORE (Geoscience Educational Opportunities &amp; Career-Oriented Research Experiences), which will expand evidence-based pedagogical concepts to extracurricular activities in order to allow greater participation for majors and prospective majors of geology, marine, and atmospheric sciences. This project will build on ongoing collaborations by bringing the community college together with three regional high schools, Stony Brook University, the National Oceanic &amp; Atmospheric Administration, the U.S. Geological Survey and private industry partners. This project seeks to increase enrollment and student success in geosciences, particularly for students underrepresented in the discipline, by enhancing student learning experiences, and increasing transfer rates and job placements to support the regional workforce needs. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Suffolk County Community College (SCCC) is developing a new program entitled GEO CORE (Geoscience Educational Opportunities &amp; Career-Oriented Research Experiences). This GEOPATH: EXTRA project will build on ongoing STEM collaborations established through SCCC's highly successful, state-funded Science &amp; Technology Entry and Liberty Partnerships programs, and its NSF S-STEM Scholars Program, by bringing together three regional high schools, Stony Brook University's Department of Geosciences and its School of Marine and Atmospheric Science, the National Oceanic &amp; Atmospheric Administration, the U.S. Geological Survey - Water Resources Division and private industry partners to provide a pathways from high school to college and into the geoscience workforce. The goals of the GEO CORE project are to: 1) increase enrollment within the geosciences, particularly for students underrepresented in the disciplines; 2) enhance student learning experiences and outcomes; and 3) increase transfer rates and job placements to support regional workforce needs. Through the GEO CORE program, SCCC is instituting the following collaborative activities: 1) implementation of a summer institute for graduating high school and first-year community college students led by geoscience professionals and academics that incorporates research-oriented fieldwork experiences that highlight the interconnection between the geosciences and the regional environmental and economic concerns;  2) creating a GEO CORE Student Ambassador Program which prepares and supports second-year geoscience students who serve as peer mentors and academic tutors to foster success among first-year students; 3) establishing a career-based training program that includes hazardous materials training and certification to ensure that graduating geoscience students have the skills necessary for immediate employment and/or success upon transfer to four-year colleges and universities; 4) forming a community of practice for professional and peer networking opportunities among government agencies, industry, higher education institutions and high schools; and 5) encouraging the integration of GEO CORE activities into high school classrooms to serve as a bridge between secondary schools and the community college to help grow the geoscience education pipeline. Project success is being measured by comparing student outcomes to established baselines, and tracking the academic success, graduation, transfer, research experiences and career advancement of each annual cohort served by GEO CORE.</AbstractNarration>

This program targeted high school juniors and seniors as well first-year college students and K-12 educators. During each week of the program, participants visited specific field sites where they learned correct observational and sampling techniques, explored how human activity impacts our environment and how geoscientists work to solve local issues, and explored specific career paths and &nbsp;other opportunities available to students at SCCC. This program ran during the summers of 2016, 2017, and 2018 and enrolled 21 students. Of those enrolled, three students were entering college freshmen and 18 were continuing first-year college students. Of the 18 continuing first-year students, 13 went on to participate in the GEO CORE Ambassador program (described below). &nbsp;</p> <p>Participating elementary, middle, and high school teachers used the information learned to develop place-based active learning exercises for their K-12 courses. Like the student participants, teachers were exposed to the numerous educational and career paths available to students interested in the geosciences. The summer institute enrolled nine teachers who, on average, each serve approximately 650 students per year. Pre- and post-survey data on teacher participants showed that experience within the Summer Institute effectively changed their perception of local geoscience-related careers. Before attending the institute, 88.8% of teachers believed career options were <em>limited</em> to <em>available. </em>Upon completion of the program, 100% believed career options were <em>available</em> to <em>highly available</em>. This change in perception should dramatically impact how these educators advise students interested in the geosciences. &nbsp;</p> <p><span>In fall 2016, the GEO CORE Ambassador program was established to increase student success within geoscience courses and provide academic and career training to majors. Students were required to provide at least six hours each of peer mentoring and tutoring in geoscience laboratories and/or in science learning centers. Ambassadors were assigned to 18 individual marine science laboratories, 20 individual geology laboratories, and seven atmospheric science laboratories. Over the course of the program, ambassadors interacted with 1,080 students enrolled in geoscience courses and success rates in geosciences increased from 72% in 2016-17, 73.4% in 2017-18, 73.8% in 2018-19, and finally 78.6% in 2019-20.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>In addition to rising success rates, geoscience courses experienced an increase in enrollment while overall college enrollment decreased substantially.&nbsp; Since the program inception in 2016, geology course enrollment increased 17.8% and meteorology course enrollment increased by 8% relative to 2016 enrollment. In both areas, peak enrollment occurred in 2018 with enrollment in geology increasing 26% and meteorology increasing 13.8%. After early increases, enrollment in marine science courses decreased by 3.6% relative to fall 2016.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</p> <p><span>Prior to the start of GEO CORE, the geoscience program had similar demographics to other programs across the nation, with baseline data showing 53% of majors identified as male, an exact inverse of college wide data that showed 53% of students identified as female.
