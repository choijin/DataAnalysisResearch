<AbstractNarration>This project, funded by the Chemical Measurement &amp; Imaging Program of the Chemistry Division, supports Professor Terry Gullion of West Virginia University to develop magnetic resonance methods (analogous to those used in magnetic resonance imaging) to determine the structures of proteins in the solid phase.  Proteins are key components in the control of biological processes.  Determination of their structures can lead to better understanding of their biochemical functions.  For example, interactions of proteins on metallic nanoparticles offer potential therapies for targeting cancer cells.  To help communicate this science, Dr. Gullion and his group are developing and presenting chemistry to the public, providing educational opportunities for elementary and middle school students, and developing online tutorials for undergraduate and graduate students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work focuses on the development of magic-angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance (MAS NMR) hardware and techniques.  The first goal is the development of high-stability MAS NMR hardware necessary for long-term NMR experiments.  A controller is being designed to accurately control radio-frequency (rf) power levels as needed for NMR experiments designed to determine molecular structures by dipolar recoupling.  A novel method to control the sample spinning speed during MAS NMR experiments is also being developed.  This enables NMR experiments that require rf pulse trains to be applied synchronously with the sample rotation.  A second goal is to develop MAS NMR 1H-Ag, 1H-Au, 1H-2H dipolar recoupling experiments to determine the structures of peptides chemisorbed on gold and silver nanoparticles and to determine the relative orientation between the adsorbed peptide and the metal surface.  To help undergraduate and graduate students that are just beginning to work in solid-state NMR, a series of educational tutorials describing NMR hardware is being produced and posted online.</AbstractNarration>
