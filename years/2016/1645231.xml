<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project involves large scale asset tagging -- to monitor and track an organization's physical assets.  Potential areas that could be impacted include distribution centers, manufacturing and assembly facilities, ports, and vehicle fleets. This project enables geo-location information to be collected about assets, providing opportunities for data analysis and productivity and movement optimization. A focus on these and other applications will result in faster shipping times, lower fuel consumption, and increased traceability of products.  At ports, for example, a specific impact of the project may include tracking of intermodal chassis (i.e., the wheeled frames used for moving shipping containers), addressing classic problems such as chassis shortages and chassis storage dilemmas, thus enabling faster product movement and shipping times. Additionally, tracking intermodal containers at ports may present opportunities to dimension, in 3-D, entire collections of stacked containers as well as those placed adjacent to each other.  As a result, intermodal container search-time is decreased enabling higher container throughput at the port.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps Project utilizes a novel configuration of low-cost communications technologies, including Bluetooth, GPS, and cellular modules, to support rapid and cost-effective asset tracking coupled with software utilizing complex algorithms.  The combination of these technologies yields real-time direct results including rapid deployment response with a simple user interface. Competing systems often require facility-wide, permanent infrastructure to support deployment that can result in lengthy installation times coupled with very high operating costs.  The system developed for this I-Corps project significantly reduces the amount of infrastructure necessary and can be installed in less than one day for any size facility.</AbstractNarration>

Medium-sized distribution centers are spending over $1,000/trailer/year for on-site tracking. These expenses primarily result from demurrage, stale-outs, missed orders from trailer misplacement, and also hiring additional personnel to compensate for inefficient yard operations. The project team?s yard management solution is fully "plug-and-play" resulting in a fast, flexible setup to track trailers on any size property, even at remote lots.    During the six-week course, the research team conducted interviews with 125 subject matter experts at locations across the United States.

Critical team pivots occurred after interviews in California, Illinois, Michigan, and Georgia. The team also broadened their research scope to include multiple industries including automobile, truck, and food manufacturing, supply chain, and logistics via rail, vessel, and tractor trailer.   Intellectual Merit : For many facilities, this technology could provide in-depth data previously unavailable to distribution and manufacturing/assembly centers at low cost and fast installation time.

Broader Impacts:  In Fall 2016, the team revised two courses on innovation and entrepreneurship at Virginia Tech to include customer discovery and fiscal analysis methods using the business model canvas. In addition, Mr. Evans, in his role as the Virginia Tech Entrepreneur Club President, created opportunities for the club to learn more about I-Corps and executing customer discovery early on in the ideation process.
