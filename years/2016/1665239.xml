<AbstractNarration>The hypergeometric function was introduced and studied in 18th century by Leonhard Euler. Modern versions of that function appear in different mathematical and physical theories (like representation theory, algebraic geometry, gauge theory, statistical mechanics) and are considered in these theories from different points of view. The goal of this project is to develop a unified analysis and geometry of modern multidimensional hypergeometric functions with applications to the above theories. It will lead to better understanding of interrelations between those parts of mathematics and physics as well as to establishing new connections among them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project involves research on representations of quantum groups, algebras of Hamiltonians of quantum integrable systems, quantum cohomology and associated quantum differential equations, Frobenius structures, Bethe ansatz method, theory of arrangements of hyperplanes, singularity theory of critical points of functions. In particular the principal investigator plans to: 1) construct  q-hypergeometric solutions of the equivariant quantum differential equation for the cotangent bundle of a partial flag variety; 2) identify the quantum cohomology algebra of the cotangent bundle of a partial flag variety with the algebra of functions on the critical set of the associated hypergeometric (or q-hypergeometric) master function; 3). use hypergeometric solutions of qKZB equations to define an action of elliptic dynamical quantum groups on elliptic equivariant cohomology of partial flag varieties; 4) find a potential for a KZ-type connection and a Frobenius-like structure on the base of the KZ-type connections; 5) develop a relation between the critical set of master functions associated with an affine Lie algebra and classical integrable hierarchies associated with that Lie algebra; 6) construct hypergeometric solutions of cyclotomic KZ equations in terms of cyclotomic discriminantal arrangements; 7) use the folding relation between the Lie algebras of certain types to geometrize a type of Bethe algebra.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The development of mathematical analysis in the 18th century led to the development of new special functions in addition to polynomial functions and trigonometric functions. In particular, the famous hypergeometric function was introduced and studied in the 18th century by Leonhard Euler and then by the leading mathematicians of their time: Gauss, Jacobi, Kummer, Fuchs, Riemann, Schwarz and Klein. Modern versions of that function appear in different mathematical and physical theories (such as representation theory, algebraic geometry, gauge theory, statistical mechanics) and are considered in these theories from different points of view. The goal of this project was to develop a unified analysis and geometry of modern multidimensional hypergeometric functions with applications to the above theories.   One of the key examples of differential equations in mathematical physics are the KZ equations.  Their solutions are modern generalizations of the Euler hypergeometric function.  One of the outcomes of this project is the construction of polynomials which satisfy the KZ equations modulo high powers of a prime number.  While the true hypergeometric solutions of the KZ equations are highly transcendental functions, the constructed polynomials are elementary functions determined by their finitely many coefficients.  This transition from highly nontrivial hypergeometric solutions to elementary approximattions may allow one to extract information about the hypergeometric solutions which are of importance for enumerative geometry and representation theory.    The notion of stable envelopos is a basis  of the interrelation between the enumerative geometry, where one counts different geometric objects, and representation theory, where one studies symmetries of objects. The formulas for  elliptic and K-theoretic stable envelopes, obtained as a result of this  project, clarify the relations between the enumerative geometry and representation theory.  The formulas for stable envelopes allowed to the PI with coauthors obeserve examples of the 3D mirror symmetry.  Mirror symmetry is one of the most important physics structures that enters the world of mathematics and arouses a lot of attention in the last several decades. Its general philosophy is that a space X should come with a dual space X&prime; which, though usually different from and unrelated to X in the appearance, admits some deep connections with X in geometry. Mirror symmetry in 2 dimensions turns out to be extremely enligntening in the study of algebraic geometry, symplectic geometry, and representation theory.

A mathematical version of the 3D mirror symmetry, introduced in the works by PI with coauthors, could clarify the mirror symmetry phenomenon in the field theory.
