<AbstractNarration>This SBIR Phase I Project explores the approach of teaching fundamental engineering concepts through engaging gameplay using a proprietary platform. The platform consists of tiles that can be put together in different ways in 3 dimensions, acting as an input to a game. The game is implemented on a paired device that can be on a tablet or a computer. The player will be presented increasingly difficult challenges and puzzles within game, and will have to use the physical tiles to assist in constructing the solution. The field of engineering exists in 3 dimensions, and the proposed project aims to explore building the intuition of this field within our youngest learners. The broader impact is in the vision for the platform to exist as a means to introduce different STEM topics in a fun and engaging manner, creating fond memories that could lead to more children with an interest in pursuing STEM related fields in the future. The project also has a mission to remain gender neutral in its design, so as to provide games that foster interest in both girls and boys.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This SBIR Phase I Project will explore, through the use of near field communications, the extension of a proprietary platform that can read and construct data in 2 dimensions to 3 dimensions. There is a given theoretical limit to which near field communications are viable, and this project will explore optimizations and additions to the current proprietary solution to achieve a communications distance closer to the theoretical limit. The proprietary system is highly compact, and the project will be researching ways to prevent self interference while improving the range of the system. The main explorations include a look at optimizing off-the-shelf near field communications inlay designs, optimizing the current antenna design and network, and the potential addition of a signal amplifier to boost the range of the system.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p><span id="docs-internal-guid-06770d93-f1f3-81e3-9849-2b2dcd138d5b">&nbsp;</span></p> <p dir="ltr">Prior to NFC technology, sensing objects in 3D space had remained an unsolved problem. Most systems that attempt to sense the position of objects relied on numerous cameras and computer vision to determine the location and rotation of objects. This is an effective solution, but has numerous drawbacks as well. Computer vision requires numerous, consistent angles of the objects to accurately find their positions. Even with numerous cameras, there is no way of sensing objects that are covered by other objects. This means at best you could scan a shell of the constructed model. This shell would have a decent amount of error as well, especially when using lots of pieces. NFC solves these issues by leveraging the accurate id system of NFC, and combining it with a large number of sensors working together to triangulate all of the pieces. The range on these devices is smaller than alternatives, but the information it yields about the shapes constructed is more detailed than other comparable options. Digital Dream Labs has already succesfully produced the Puzzlet platform, a transceiver array that senses the 2D position of game pieces. Combined with a suite of educational software, Puzzlets is used in schools around the country to teach elementary students.</p> <p dir="ltr"><span>The goal of Phase 1 was to develop new hardware that expanded on the success of our Puzzlet platform by using 3D NFC technology, a new field that is relatively unexplored, and using this technology to teach engineering topics through educational video games. Puzzlets excelled at teaching concepts to younger students, but we found more advanced topics would require more complex forms of input. Adding in the ability to stack pieces adds substantially to the possible inputs for our games, and further adding in the ability to sense the 3D orientation of pieces greatly increases the complexity of systems we can use. One of the main topics teachers are worried about their students struggling in is 3D spatial reasoning, and this hardware teaches that with all of its games. This link between 3D input and the 2D world of our computer screens allows students the ability to freely explore complex topics that do not fit well into 2D structures. To achieve this goal, we needed a new design for our pieces, a new design for our hardware, and drastically improved read distance on our NFC elements. We designed cubes that contain three active tags per device, and interlock with themselves at orthogonal angles. This allows the piece to be sensed no matter which way they are facing, and force the pieces to all be on the same grid. We designed a new hardware system which utilizes a top and bottom reading board, effectively doubling the read range of our device before optimizing any technology. We also redesigned the circuitry around our transceivers, incorporating larger coils and power amplification, increasing our read range by a factor of eight. We surveyed teachers about which topics they felt their students struggled the most. We then created eight game prototypes covering the topics of logic, sound waves, states of matter, density, center of mass, spatial reasoning, gear ratios, and different forms of energy. All of these prototypes were created to utilize the hardware we are developing, and are also fully functioning without the hardware. This lets us test our ideas and go through numerous iterations in parallel with the development of the hardware. At the end of Phase 1, all eight of these game prototypes are fully playable and ready for playtesting with teachers and students.</span></p> <p dir="ltr">&nbsp;</p> <div><span><br /></span></div> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 11/15/2017<br>      Modified by: Bryan&nbsp;Gardiner</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1621536/1621536_10435162_1503078334775_Diagram1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1621536/1621536_10435162_1503078334775_Diagram1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Render of Puzzlets 3D"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1621536/1621536_10435162_1503078334775_Diagram1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Render of Puzzlets 3D"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">A render of Puzzlets 3D, the new hardware created under this grant.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Digital Dream Labs</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Bryan&nbsp;Gardiner</div> <div class="imageTitle">Render of Puzzlets 3D</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1621536/1621536_10435162_1503078508416_MusicGameWireframe-6--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1621536/1621536_10435162_1503078508416_MusicGameWireframe-6--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Gear And Sear"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1621536/1621536_10435162_1503078508416_MusicGameWireframe-6--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Gear And Sear"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Gear And Sear is a game that utilizes gear ratios to cook food at different temperatures.
