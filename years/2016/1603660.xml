<AbstractNarration>Observations made since the turn of this century indicate that the Arctic physical environment and associated ecosystems are undergoing remarkable changes and to predict future changes we need to be able to quantify how much of Arctic climate variability and change is linked to the ocean circulation, how the distribution of sea ice responds to the amplified Arctic warming predicted by climate models, and how primary productivity, species distributions and associated ecosystem structures will change with the evolving Arctic state. Our understanding of the driving mechanisms for these processes depends on our knowledge of the Arctic system and our ability to simulate its time-evolving state in a way that is consistent with observations. This project will employ an advanced approach for synthesizing oceanographic observations to develop a tool that establishes a baseline understanding of the Arctic system. Outcomes of the proposed research will include better quantification of the Arctic system's changes since the turn of the century, and improved understanding of the dynamical causes for these changes. It is likely that the resulting analyzed fields of ocean and sea ice properties will be widely utilized by the community in future research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will bring together hydrographic observations obtained from ship, aircraft and autonomous instruments, sea ice data from in situ buoys, satellites and manned vessels, and boundary-layer meteorology within a state estimation infrastructure to develop a physical and dynamical description of the evolving Arctic Ocean during roughly the first decade of the 21st century. Taking advantage of a growing observational database, the project's two main objectives are: the creation of a dynamically-consistent and comprehensive synthesis of all available Arctic hydrographic and sea ice observations using the adjoint-based Arctic Sub-polar gyre sTate Estimate for the period 2002-present; and scientific investigations, using the synthesis products, of physical mechanisms driving the evolving Arctic system. The team will quantify four key science issues: the time-average, seasonal cycle, and interannual variability of the upper-ocean hydrography and circulation; the interannual changes in Arctic Ocean heat and freshwater (FW) content; changes in the sea ice state and air-sea fluxes; and connections between the Arctic and the Sub-polar gyre, focusing on heat and FW exchanges and feedback. Products generated will be the time-mean, mean seasonal cycle, and time-varying quantities in the Arctic Ocean, its neighboring seas and sub-polar North Atlantic of the full set of variables characterizing the coupled physical ocean-sea ice state, heat, FW, momentum and vorticity budgets, and inferred air-sea fluxes and time-mean oceanic turbulent mixing. These products will be made available to researchers and students, policy makers, industry, and the general public. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A substantial outreach activity will be undertaken, in collaboration the MIT Museum, to assemble diverse multimedia projects that use scientific results, including those from this project, to visualize changes due to ongoing major shifts in the Arctic Ocean. The goal is to engage the general audience interested in the multimedia projects with actual scientific datasets to establish tangible links between the two perspectives. Exhibitions and accompanying events are planned with a goal of creating material that may be readily used for broader dissemination. The project will support two female early career scientists.</AbstractNarration>

Understanding the responsible driving mechanisms hinges on developing knowledge of the Arctic system and demonstrating the ability to simulate its time-evolving state consistent with observations. Taking advantage of the growing observational database, this collaborative research program developed and analyzed a comprehensive synthesis of Arctic and Subpolar North Atlantic hydrographic and sea ice observations using a data constrained state estimate for the period 2002 through 2017.  The state estimate model: Arctic/Subpolar gyre sTate Estimate model (ASTE) was developed by Dr. An T.

She was joined in this project by a team of observational investigators from the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution.

Outcomes of the research yielded better quantification of the Arctic Oceans evolution since the turn of the century, and improved understanding of the dynamical causes of the observed changes.  The main contributions of the WHOI team included providing ocean temperature and salinity observations used to constrain the state estimate, comparisons of ocean observations and model estimates, and analysis of model fields to characterize water property distributions and the time-varying circulation of the Arctic Ocean.  This research culminated in a Masters Degree thesis and submitted peer-reviewed paper that examine the time-average, mean seasonal cycle and interannual variability of Atlantic Water (AW) properties and circulation.  AW forms a subsurface temperature maximum in the Arctic and carries sufficient heat to melt all the sea ice were that heat mixed to the surface.  A surge of AW, marked by rapid increases in mean AW Layer potential temperature and AW Layer thickness, begins two years into the ASTE state estimate period and traverses the Arctic Ocean along boundary current pathways at a speed of 1-2 cm/s.  The surge also alters the AW circulation, including a reversal in flow direction along the Lomonosov Ridge, resulting in a new quasi-steady AW circulation from 2010 through the end of the state estimate period.  The time-mean AW circulation during this latter time period indicates that a significant amount of AW spreads over the Lomonosov Ridge rather than directly returning along the ridge to Fram Strait.  A three-layer depiction of the time-averaged ASTE overturning circulation within the Arctic Ocean reveals that more AW is converted to colder, fresher Surface Layer water than is transformed to Deep and Bottom Water.  ASTE also exhibits an increase in the volume of AW over the study period, with near compensating decrease in Deep and Bottom Water volume.  Observed AW properties compared to ASTE output reveal increasing misfit during the simulated period with the ASTE AW Layer generally being warmer and thicker than in observations.  Future research will refine the model fields and explore the dynamical causes of the circulation changes observed in ASTE.  Ultimately, state estimates such as ASTE will improve understanding of Arctic dynamics and in turn, result in greater forecast skill.
