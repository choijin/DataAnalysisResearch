<AbstractNarration>The main objective of this project is to develop new methodology and theory for statistical challenges motivated by integrative genomics, a collection of quantitative approaches in genomics research that centers around the joint analysis of multiple datasets.  Integrative analysis has tremendous potential to precipitate the next wave of scientific discoveries in genomics and is also a crucial component of emerging conceptions of data science in general. This project aims to develop new analysis procedures for 1) detecting whether two or more datasets share the same significant genomic features, 2) identifying these features, and 3) leveraging them to improve genomic prediction models.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project opens important questions in integrative genomics up to rigorous methodological and theoretical development by framing them in terms of cutting-edge statistical issues, including signal detection, multiple testing, and high-dimensional classification. The proposed methodological research will develop new nonparametric tests and false discovery rate control procedures for detecting and identifying shared genomic features, as well as new nonparametric empirical Bayes approaches for high-dimensional integrative classification and regression. The proposed theoretical research will explore the fundamental limits of these problems. The results of this project will lead to more powerful and rigorous methods and theory for integrative analysis in genomics and elsewhere.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  Integrative genomics is a collection of quantitative approaches to genomics research that centers around the joint analysis of multiple â€˜omics datasets. These analyses have provided numerous insights, and data integration strategies are important in data science beyond genomics. This project had two main goals: to study statistical issues at the core of many integrative genomics methods, and to develop integrative approaches to study of the genomics of social behavior.  The primary outcomes of this project fall into three categories:  1. New analysis procedures for studying genomic features across multiple data sets. Common analyses include a) detecting whether two or more datasets share the same significant features, b) identifying these features, and c) leveraging them to improve genomic prediction models. The project proposed new methods for each of these three tasks. It also showed theoretically and empirically that certain non-integrative analyses that are difficult or impossible in only a single data set are improved by data integration.  2. New results on the genomics of conserved social behavior. This project applied its statistical and theoretical insights to studies of the genomics of certain social behaviors that are conserved across three very different animal species. In collaboration with other scientists, it found evidence for conserved molecular mechanisms of social aggression and social responsiveness.  3. New directions for integrative genomics. The project identified new connections between data integration and two areas of great recent interest in the statistical literature: high-dimensional mediation analysis and empirical Bayes methods. The project proposed new analysis methods derived from these two literatures, and these may constitute new directions for exploring more effective procedures.  To date, the project has resulted in 9 published or accepted publications and 1 publication under revision.       Last Modified: 11/26/2019       Submitted by: Sihai D Zhao]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
