<AbstractNarration>This award provides funding for US participation in the conference "The Dynamics of Algebraic Transformations" that will be held June 12-16, 2017 at the University of Rennes (France.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference focuses on recent developments in Analysis, especially in the fields of several complex variables and dynamical systems. A number of distinguished mathematicians have agreed to attend and speak at this conference. This award gives early career researchers, members of underrepresented groups, researchers not funded by NSF and the like an opportunity to attend and participate in this conference. The organizing committee will strive to make this funding opportunity known to target groups through a number of different activities.
