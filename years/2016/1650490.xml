<AbstractNarration>This award supports a conference entitled "Accelerating Data-Driven Collaboration for Large-Scale Progress" which will support the progress of INCLUDES (Inclusion across the Nation of Communities of Learners that have been Underrepresented for Diversity in Engineering and Science) Launch Pilots toward their broadening participation goals. The issues and challenges affecting the persistence of students of color, students from low-income households, females, and students with disabilities in STEM learning surpass the scope of programs designed to promote awareness of STEM career options. The Launch Pilots will need technical assistance to leverage their strategic plans, become poised for the next level of becoming an Alliance, and ultimately show impact that results in large-scale progress.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference will support the Launch Pilots in their broadening participation goals by providing opportunities to (1) develop innovative new ways to gather data and make evidence-based decisions, (2) connect with best practices on the frontiers of data-driven collaboration, and (3) apply new knowledge and innovations to their projects that address societal needs. The overarching design of Data-Driven Collaboration is to facilitate the sharing of ideas, struggles, and promising practices in a collaborative and participatory manner. This will occur by fostering a network improvement community (within and across Launch Pilots), engaging participants in systems thinking and problem-solving through collaborative modeling, and a 2.5-day Public Support and Engagement Lab conference. Launch Pilots who engage support from Data-Driven Collaboration will have a variety of technical assistance services available between November 2016 and April 2017.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Accelerating Data-Driven Collaboration for Large-Scale Progress was a high-impact technical assistance program designed to support projects to develop innovative new ways to gather data and make evidence-based decisions, connect with best practices on the frontiers of data-driven collaboration and apply new knowledge and innovations to their projects that focus on societal needs. The collective impact field is learning that adaptive social problems need to be addressed by cross-sector networks that engage and include participants from other fields and areas of expertise. The conference team developed an innovative framework for assisting Launch Pilots in their efforts to engage students, community members, and other stakeholders in collaborative modeling. During a two-day Public Support and Engagement Lab, project teams comprised of investigators, community partners, and students, worked on systems modeling and practiced storytelling. They showcased their projects with outside community leaders who gave feedback. Through the conference, participants learned the basics of collaborative modeling and storytelling. The wisdom of INCLUDES is that there are many potential solutions to the complex problem of broadening participation in STEM. To make large-scale progress, we need to employ collective wisdom to the complex issues associated with inclusion. Data-driven Collaboration sought to help Launch Pilots discover what matters to their stakeholders and share their stories strategically in a way that galvanized stakeholders around a common agenda.</p> <p>The Public Support and Engagement Lab focused on highly effective participatory processes, innovative collaborative modeling approaches, and opportunities for participants to refine their message with professionals such as scientists, engineers, and civic leaders. Faculty, students, and community partners representing thirteen NSF INCLUDES Launch Pilot Development Projects participated. At the event, a conference-designated facilitator supported the site teams through finalizing their working version of their models, interpreting their models, addressing knowledge gaps, generating hypotheses, and simulating the impact of change. Before the conference, Kansas City Public Television created a short video about broadening participation in STEM. Conference participants had the option to record their pitch about their Launch Pilot projects to combine with the KCPT video. All conference participants received a copy of the professional KCPT video to use freely to promote their project and gain stakeholder buy-in. Professional storytellers were at the conference to work with each Launch Pilot site on sharing their theory of change and collaborative model with a compelling and useful story. Participants practiced telling their story to students, scientists, university administration, local government officials, foundation officers, and other civic leaders.</p> <p>The design of Data-Driven Collaboration brought together the theory of co-creating knowledge translation (Co-KT) with the evidence of active adult learning.
