<AbstractNarration>Traits of species that evolved to serve one function but were later modified by evolution to serve a new function are known as exaptations. While there are many examples of such traits, the process by which they evolve is still poorly understood. This project will advance our understanding of how evolution reshapes the genetic blueprint of species traits to create new, novel innovations. Traits associated with gliding and flying, like feathers, are some of the most notable examples of exaptations. Unfortunately, most gliding species are already highly specialized, making it difficult to study the process by which exaptation has occurred. Geckos, which are the focus of this research project, are an exception. Geckos have evolved gliding structures multiple times from flaps of skin used in camouflage and there are multiple species that together represent the complete transition from general to highly specialized gliding ability. These evolutionary replicates allow the researchers to test whether exaptation of particular traits follows predictable patterns and also provide a means of measuring how form and function interact to affect rates of evolution. This research will provide research training to undergraduates, graduate students, and a postdoc in genetic, morphological, bioinformatic, and image analysis methods. The public also will be engaged by developing an educational program at the Sam Noble Museum that will feature age-appropriate information and learning activities related to gliding in geckos.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will determine the consequences of gliding-associated exaptations of geckos within a context of evolutionary relationships. Two primary research questions will be addressed: (1) whether gliding structures represent exaptations that evolve in a predictable way, and (2) whether these traits or the associated functional shift represent key innovations leading to shifts in the rate of evolution in the affected clades. The PIs will address these questions by combining field, laboratory, and computational approaches. Fully resolved evolutionary trees will be estimated for gliding geckos and related lineages. Structural variation in gliding and non-gliding geckos will be surveyed using a combination of external observation, diceCT, and histology. Developmental similarities among gliding taxa will be assessed by analyzing embryonic morphology and developmental gene expression patterns in a set of exemplar taxa. Relative cryptic and gliding performance values will be measured by both observing live animals and by experimenting with models to document the functional shift from camouflage to gliding. Phylogenetic comparative analyses will be employed to identify patterns of phenotypic and lineage diversification and their relationships to morphological and functional change in this group. A significant volume of new DNA sequence data; morphological data, including numerous full-body CT scans; and performance data will be produced and be of broad interest and use to the scientific community.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The collaborative research Collaborative Research: RUI: From Exaptation to Key Innovation - Evolutionary Insights from Gliding Geckos is an interdisciplinary project studying morphological adaptations of geckos to gliding.  Gliding behavior has evolved several times among vertebrates and independently in three groups of squamate reptiles: agamids, snakes, and geckos.  Among geckos, adaptations to gliding are expressed in different degrees, from fully adapated (Ptychozoon) where the body is very flat, and has aditional membranous fringes in the neck, body ans tail that serve to attenuate the fall, with intermediate forms with less developed integumentary structures (Luperosaurus), to species that share with these gliders and semi gliders, scansoriality, and arboreality.  Additional fringes have been developed also in other distantly related genera that glide (Cosymbotus platyurus) and these structures might have evolved initiate to enhance crypsis.    We developed a robust morphological background (863 traits analized from whole body microCT data, CT and diceCTand analyze skeletal morphologies using a molecular phylogeny as scaffold. We found that current classification of gliders needs some re-arrangement, which is congruent with results from other research groups that have implemented these changes[1]. Our study have gathered some morphological characters that serve to diagnose those new erected genera.   We found that Indo-Pacific gekkotans share 3 non-ambiguous traits, 1) frontal interorbital/frontoparietal suture width ranging from 36-40%, 2) frontal supraorbital shelf demarcated medially by narrow shallow longitudinal furrow often bearing row of foramina, 3) frontal supraorbital shelf oriented dorsolaterally. The genus Ptychozoon is diagnosed by the lack of contact between the parietal and the supraoccipital, low neural spines, expanded carpus, and extensive body flaps). The node ((((G. badenni, G. grossmanni) G. preticolus) (Luperosaurus iskandari, Gekko vitattus)) Ptychozoon) was supported by having the lumber ribs overlapping the acetabulum. This preliminary study has the potential to provide diagnostic characters required to resolve the taxonomy of this clade of Indo-Pacific gekkotans, and to understand better the morphological changes in gliding geckos.  We are will include more data in the analysis, to produce a matching data set with the ones published, and will combine all the morphological, molecular and behavioral data to understand better the evolution of this group.   Two side projects were produced considering ontogenetic variation of two species, Lepidodactylus lugubris(embryological development, including its neuroanatomy; Griffin et al. 2019) and the development of dermal armor in Tokay geckos (Gekko gecko; Laver et al. 2020).
