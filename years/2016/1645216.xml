<AbstractNarration>NON-TECHNICAL AND TECHNICAL SUMMARY:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This new Gordon Research Conference (GRC) is focused on the emerging area of complex active and adaptive material systems and is being supported by the Biomaterials and Polymers Programs of the NSF Division of Materials Research.  It will serve an important role in pinpointing critical research areas in this broad, interdisciplinary topic and helping guide new scientific efforts.  Areas to be explored include adaptive materials that are capable of sensing, actuation, energy harvesting, locomotion, self-repair, and self-organization.  The need to manipulate the dynamic behavior of energy-consuming elements related to biomimetic systems will necessitate new advances in both modeling and synthetic efforts.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Outcomes of this GRC would involve a whole-systems approach to creating materials/devices that perform useful functions by consuming or transducing energy.  The meeting could help formulate design rules for the next generation of energy-efficient devices that operate in a self-sustained manner.  It will also bring together a broadly diverse group that includes young researchers at the beginning of their careers as well as more experienced and senior participants.  Interactions among these groups could have a lasting influence on the careers of new scientists.  Postdoctoral researchers and graduate students will be encouraged to present posters to promote extensive discussions and scientific interactions.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This meeting brought together materials scientists, physicists, engineers, biologists, chemists, and experts in computational modeling.  This array of expertise was needed to address fundamental challenges at the core of this research are.  The meeting focuses on the design, synthesis, and modeling of dissipative (active) material systems that perform life-like functions.  DIssipation is the physical process associated with the irreversible transformation of energy from one form to another.  The systems that were considered at this meeting are capable of transducing, storing, and/or harvesting energy and using that energy to self-assemble, perform work, or dynamically respond to changes in the environment.  In this sense, the materials are active and adaptive.  Through discussions at this conference, the group attempted to formulate ways of inscribing the vital functions found in biological systems into synthetic materials, and thereby, potentially blurring the lines between living and non-living systems.  The meeting highlighted attempts to establish new design rules for achieving specific biologically-inspired functions or behaviors.  The emphasis was not only on designing material systems (i.e., a composite formed from different constituents), but also on creating "systems of materials" that encompass different components interacting across many scales to achieve a function.  Technological advances in this field will come from iterative interactions between experimentalists and theorists to correlate the components of the system (organelles, reaction cascades, DNA, etc.) to a function (metabolism, motion, etc.).  The outcome of such a multi-disciplinary forum could be a systems-level framework that can enable researchers to create biomimetic materials that exhibit new, useful functionality.
