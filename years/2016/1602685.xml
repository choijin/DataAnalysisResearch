<AbstractNarration>This collaborative award generally aims to establish a new stable sea level site in Mallorca, Spain, through the study of phreatic overgrowths on speleothems (POS) from  littoral caves.   Specifically, the researchers aim to establish age control by precisely measuring overgrowths by Uranuium/Lead U/Pb dating to determine the timing, position, and duration of sea-level high stands in the western Mediterranean basin over the past 5 million years using cave deposits that grow exactly at sea level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Implications of sea-level reconstructions centered on the POS from this island's littoral caves are fundamental for understanding the glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA) in the western Mediterranean basin.  The data generated by this research will better constrain estimates of Pliocene and early Pleistocene sea-level, without being plagued by the large uncertainties associated with proxies available for this time period.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;New data could be used to improve GIA corrections.  This is important because current published sea level highstands during past interglacial climate are significantly above modern sea level and vary widely over time.  The precision of such results are still controversial and accurate data to realistically evaluate potential sea level by the century's end is critical.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project involves training for several graduate and undergraduate students, outreach efforts in Mallorca and in Florida, production of a documentary film on the caves, and strong and meaningful international scientific collaborations.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[The projected rise in sea level due to global warming poses serious concerns to coastal communities globally, thus, there is a genuine urgency for improving our understanding of past, present, and future sea-level variations.  The research supported by this award was designed to precisely establish the timing, position, and duration of sea-level high stands in the western Mediterranean basin over the last 5 millions years.  To do this, our team used phreatic overgrowth on speleothems, a unique type of carbonate encrustation forming in coastal caves of Mallorca at the brackish water table, which is, and was in the past coincident with sea level.  Some of the highlights of our project include: 1) first directly dated (using Uranium/Lead method) sea level indicators of latest Miocene and Pliocene ages; 2) constraints on Miocene sea level (6.54 to 5.86 million years ago; Ma) prior and in the early part of the Messinian Salinity Crisis, a significant geologic event that caused the Mediterranean Sea level to drop almost 2,000 m; 3) document several periods between 4.5 and 3.02 Ma, when Earth was warmer than the pre-industrial period, with global mean sea levels fluctuating between 16.2 and 23.5 m above present; 4) document numerous sea level elevations during the Early and Middle Pleistocene; 5) add sea level elevations in the Late Pleistocene that complement our MIS5a and MIS5e records; 6) reconstruct the pattern of sea level rise over the past 6,000 years (middle and late Holocene); 7) produce one of the most accurate and high-resolution reconstruction of sea level for the last 3,000 years; and 8) interpret the link between sea-level changes and coastal karst evolution in Mallorca between 900,000 and 440,000 years ago.   In terms of broader impacts, the projected supported a female PhD student from Romania and an Italian MS student, and continued successful decade-long collaboration with a Mallorcan-based team.  The project has enabled to directly targeted the societal component, since our sea level reconstructions for two Pliocene warmer-than-present intervals, produced data that are now used in the IPCC 6th Assessment Report to predict future sea-level rise.  These results along with those robustly documenting long-term sea-level stability throughout the last interglacial are of utmost importance for oceanographers, glaciologists, geophysicists, and coastal geologists.  Our presentations at scientific meetings and the results published in Nature, Nature Geosciences, and other mainstream journals provide high visibility to our research.  The team performed outreach activities (presentations at K6 and K9-12 in Florida and Mallorca, respectively, published a booklet (in both Catalan and English) for Art&agrave; Cave, which is visited annually by more than 500.000 tourists, and produced a documentary movie featuring our research, entitled Silently Rising that directly targets both professional and nonprofessional communities.
