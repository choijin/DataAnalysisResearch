<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to establish a precedence for remote, real time assessment of the safety and serviceability of infrastructural assets through the development of a self-powered structural health monitoring system. This piezoelectric fatigue fuse (PFF) will enable the establishment of quantifiable metrics to discern the current state of life as well as projected lifetimes and reparability criteria for assets ranging from bridges, to oil platforms, to ship hulls, and optimistically to any steel structures where fatigue is the primary mode of failure. With the remotely accessible, real time metrics provided by the PFF, asset owners will be able to make informed decisions regarding visual and other nondestructive inspection frequency and thereby reduce overall cost of maintenance, inspection and operation.  Over the course of the design and evaluation of the sensors, an assessment of the underlying effects of fatigue crack nucleation and propagation through designed stress concentrations in coupled electromechanical systems will be performed.  This work will illuminate the material and geometric constraints necessary to optimize piezoelectric transducers to provide adequate power and robust signal to noise ratios for fatigue sensing under real world, dynamic spectrum loading scenarios.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project to design and develop a piezoelectric fatigue fuse aims to address the growing problem of transit asset management in the United States. The recent series of bridge failures in the US exemplifies the public safety risks of ageing infrastructure and    without a method to inspect and monitor fatigue in steel structures with improved accuracy and efficiency, the safety and serviceability of these structures is at an ever-increasing risk. The aim of developing and introducing PFF?s is to provide a measure of loading history that correlates with fatigue crack growth to predict current state-of-life and dictate economic options for future inspection and repair frequency. This will be accomplished by developing a system which transduces the mechanical loading of a structure into electrical energy which is simultaneously used to charge low-power electronics and generate digital data corresponding to the fatigue life of the asset. The key technical results of this program will be the measured electrical response of optimized PFF sensors, an understanding of signal modulation as the mechanical fuses accrue fatigue damage and the requirements of the low power electronics and radios necessary to make these systems truly self-powered.</AbstractNarration>

Commercial aircraft, which operate under similar monetary restrictions, have successfully adopted a damage tolerance design philosophy where they are inspected after a set number of operation specific loading cycles instead of duration alone; this type of maintenance plan has been shown to simultaneously reduce down time and prevent significant in service failures.  The wireless piezoelectric fatigue fuse based system is bringing a version of this approach to civil infrastructure, enabling policy makers to make informed decisions and ensuring that at risk assets receive the preventative maintenance they need or are replaced when necessary.   The Metal Fatigue Solutions (MFS) self-powered wireless piezoelectric fatigue fuse sensor network that is under development is shown in Figure 1.  These enhancements to the base fuse will greatly simplify their use and reduce inspection cost. Each sensor node is self-powered using a combination of piezoelectric energy harvesting and ultra-low power electronics.  The wireless-hub, which synchronizes the sensor nodes and stores their data, will routinely transmit to the cloud for remote data access. This novel approach reduces inspection time and enables continuous fatigue monitoring of in-service loading.

This intermittent interrogation of fuse status enables energy harvesting to continuously charge the battery of a wireless node, creating a self-powered wireless fatigue sensor node.   Figure 2 shows details of the wireless fatigue fuse monitoring system. PZT plates were used to harvest energy from the cyclic loading.  A commercial energy harvester evaluation board was used in the phase I effort.  A low energy electronics system was developed that produces the pitch signal (several sinusoidal cycles at 3 volts) and captures the catch signal using an analog to digital converter.  Wireless transmission from a single sensor node was demonstrated in the laboratory.  Under Phase I, each of the sub-systems was demonstrated in the laboratory to illustrate the feasibility of the envisioned system.  Phase II will involve sub-system refinement and systems integration.          Last Modified: 07/24/2017       Submitted by: Seyedmasoud Malekzadeh]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
