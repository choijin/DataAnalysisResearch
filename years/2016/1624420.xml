<AbstractNarration>As the world's population continues to expand and become increasingly industrialized, there will be a steady if not increasing need to discover new mineral deposits to provide the raw commodities that humans have come to depend on. In the case of gold, several decades of aggressive exploration by the mining industry in the 1970s and 1980s led to a global boom in the discovery of economically mineable gold deposits. However, the rate of discovery of new gold deposits has greatly declined in the past 10 years, partly because of a downturn in the industry, and partly because most of the deposits that are near surface and that fit conventional exploration models have already been discovered. This project will investigate the causative origins of a newly recognized class of hydrothermal gold deposits, referred to as 'iron oxide copper gold' (IOCG) deposits, that has the potential to generate a new cycle of exploration and discovery in the metal mining industry. Despite the fact that the IOCG class includes one of the largest metal deposits in the world - Olympic Dam, Australia - there is no consensus as to how - in a geologic, geochemical, petrologic, or plate tectonic sense - these deposits form. Part of the reason for this lack of consensus is a gap in our understanding at a fundamental, thermodynamic level of how metals such as iron, gold, and copper dissolve and precipitate in high temperature hydrothermal fluids. This project will help fill in this knowledge gap by performing several sets of hydrothermal experiments under controlled laboratory conditions. This type of study will have direct benefits to the mining industry and to society in general, which demands a steady supply of these mineral commodities. As for any scientific study that generates new, high-quality thermodynamic data, the results will also be useful to scientists in other disciplines to further understand the processes that have shaped the ancient and present-day Earth. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Most researchers agree that the fluids that form IOCG deposits were hot, saline brines that were unusually oxidized: beyond this the ore deposit models diverge. This project will examine the solubility of iron oxide and gold in acidic, oxidized, saline brines at temperatures of 100 to 350 degrees C, and at oxidation states that are buffered near the aqueous ferric (Fe3+)/ferrous (Fe2+) boundary. The project will generate new thermodynamic data on the stability of aqueous ferric-, ferrous-, and gold-chloride complexes. The new data will be used to develop more accurate geochemical models for how IOCG deposits (and other types of Au-Cu-Fe deposits) form.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The main objective of NSF award 1624420 was to perform experiments that would generate new thermodynamic data on how hematite, a common iron-oxide mineral in the Earth?s crust, dissolves in high temperature, acidic waters. This topic is important because it helps to understand how certain types of mineral deposits?such as ?iron-oxide-copper-gold? (IOCG) deposits form. These deposits form in a hydrothermal environment, where hot waters circulate through the rocks. The recently discovered Olympic Dam IOCG deposit in South Australia is one of the largest accumulations of copper, hematite iron-ore, and uranium in the world.  Many different theories have been proposed about how Olympic Dam formed, but it is not yet possible to determine which model is most likely. It is important to sort this out, both to understand the geology of this world-class mineral deposit, and also so that mining companies can more effectively explore for new, undiscovered IOCG deposits.   Iron has two dominant oxidation states, ?ferrous? or ?reduced? iron, and ?ferric? or ?oxidized? iron.  Both types of iron play important roles in the geochemistry of surface waters, especially in water that is acidic due to oxidation of pyrite and other metal-sulfide minerals, or volcanic gases.  However, very little is known about how oxidized iron dissolves into high temperature (up to 300 degrees C), geothermal waters.  The few published studies disagree as to the chemical form and thermodynamic stability of the dissolved ferric compounds.  To address this knowledge gap, three sets of hydrothermal experiments were performed.  The results were successful and are being used to generate new thermodynamic data on hematite solubility and the stability of dissolved ferric iron complexes in salty brines up to 300 degrees C.  Above about 200?C, the most stable dissolved complex is the tetrahedral FeCl4- molecule.  The solubility of hematite as FeCl4- increases rapidly with increase in temperature, increase in salinity, and decrease in pH, and concentrations of dissolved Fe above 100 mg/L are attainable at conditions that are possible in nature.   Another important role for FeCl4- is that it is a powerful oxidant in deep geothermal systems where dissolved oxygen derived from the atmosphere is absent.  Dissolved FeCl4- is capable of oxidizing sulfide minerals and releasing their contained metals into solution to create ore-forming fluids.  These fluids can then migrate to shallower depth to form hydrothermal mineral deposits, including IOCG deposits.     Preliminary results of this study were presented at the 2017 meeting of the Society for Geology Applied to Mineral Deposits in Quebec City, Canada, and at the 2018 V.M. Goldschmidt meeting of the Geochemical Society in Boston, Massachusetts.  The PI anticipates submitting two journal papers soon, one summarizing the experimental results and derivation of thermodynamic data, and the second emphasizing the geologic applications.  This NSF-funded project has had a positive impact on research at Montana Tech, a primarily undergraduate institution in an EPSCoR state.  The grant provided two years of support for graduate student Nick Allin, who performed many of the hydrothermal experiments, and who successfully defended his M.S. thesis in 2019.  Nick is now working as a geochemist for an environmental consulting company.          Last Modified: 01/06/2020       Submitted by: Christopher H Gammons]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
