<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this project lies primarily in its contribution to the rehabilitation robotics, assistive technologies and collaborative robotics fields. Technologists engaged in developing devices and products in these fields are greatly benefiting from the lower prices of electronics brought on by the growth of the telecommunications industry, but those same technologists don?t have ready access to compliantly controlled actuators that make physical robot-human interaction safe. Developing such actuators is costly, it takes a long time, and it requires very specific and rare expertise.  The introduction of a new line of inexpensive (as compared to existing technologies), highly backdrivable linear actuators onto the market will enable a new breed of robotic rehabilitation and assistive products, as well as co-robots and perhaps even gaming interfaces with haptic feedback.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will focus on developing a proof of concept of the compliant force control module (CFCM), for converting simple linear screw-driven actuators into highly backdrivable, force-controlled actuators.  There is great interest and opportunity in co-robots, but in order for these devices to safely manipulate objects and interact haptically with humans, they must be inherently safe.  Compliant force-controlled actuators can render such co-robots safe, but due to their novelty such equipment is not commercially available.  A proprietary force sensor design will be implemented and research will be performed on various methods for achieving high performance with sufficient stability margins in both hardware and software.  Research will be performed on control algorithm approaches for minimizing the effects of mechanical play, stiction and inertia.  The use of visco-elastic materials as the compliant element to replace the purely elastic elements (springs) will be investigated for the potential to mitigate the mechanical issues found in economical mechanical transmissions.  The ultimate goal of the proposed effort is to demonstrate the improved force-control performance of an off-the-shelf linear actuator when equipped with the CFCM technology.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>During this SBIR Phase I project, we set out to develop a proof of concept of a self-contained, plug-and-play, force-controlled actuator. Actuators are the most critical and most expensive components of robotic arms and many other robotic systems. They generate motion in such systems and they are critical to their performance. Robotic arms have found widespread use in manufacturing, especially in auto manufacturing, where they perform precise assembly operations, welding, painting, material handling and others. Today, we are witnessing an increasing adoption of robots for automation of tasks beyond the factory floor, outside of manufacturing. These new uses requrire a new set of qualites from robotic systems. High precision is no longer needed in the great majorty of these new use cases. When used in public or non manufacturing spaces, robots cannot be fenced off from people any more, so they must be inherently safe. Robots used by the disabled must also be affordable. Such new uses require new actuators, which can give these robots the required qualities: safety, smooth operation, affordability, ease of use. At AndrosRobotics we have developed a proof of concept of just such an actuator, which will enable a new breed of products not economically feasible thus far. Engineers working at startups and major research institutions are tackling a variety of technological challenges to bring on a widespread use of robotic technologies for the benefit of the society. They are working on aritificial inelligence, motion planning, grasping. Yet, there is one major part of the equation missing from this effort: affordable, human-safe actuators which could power these robots. Engineers today must rely on industrial-grade hardware like arms from Universal Robots, ill-suited for the intended tasks, due to lack of other suitable products. This is about to change. The CFCM Actuator uses our patent-pending design of the Compliant Force Sensor (CFS) to achieve high-fidelity force-control at an affordable price point. In the not too distant future we expect to see a widespread use of our CFCM Actuator in collaborative robotic arms in warehouses and in public spaces. They will be light-weight, flexible and compliantly controlled (thus safe) and intelligent, helping us retrieve items from the top shelf (with their long reach) and performaning mundane or dangerous tasks.</p> <p>Our Actuator will find its first immediate use (2018-2019) in a robotic device for administering physical therapy and rehabilitation to stroke patients and other neurological and orthopedic patients at hospitals and clinics. There are almost 800,000 strokes every year in the U.S. alone, and about 350,000 of stroke victims have the potential to improve their function through therapy. Gait training (walking therapy) is critical to helping patients return to leading independent lives, but at the same time gait training is very challenging to administer for the clinicians, due to the risk of patient falls, and due to the physical strength requried. Robotic solutions availabe on the market today (such as lower body exoskeletons) have found a very limited adoption, mainly due to their very high cost and complexity, as well as risks to the patient. A novel affordable robotic product developed by AndrosRobotics previously to address these issues (the R-LAD product) has been licensed out to a major supplier of such therapeutic equipment, and this device will be powered with our CFCM Actuators. The unique performance offered by our CFCM Actuator, coupled with its affordable price (at least 75% lower cost vs. existing products!), is expected to result in a widespread adoption of the R-LAD product at rehabilitation hospitals and clinics in the U.S. and abroad. This is only the first example of a game-changing product which is possible today because of the availability of this completely new offering, the CFCM Actuator.
