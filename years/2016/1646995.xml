<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project includes: 1) development of novel encryption and authentication technology to improve cybersecurity and 2) the reduction of economic loss due to data breaches.  The larger societal need for new technologies in the cyber arena has been well documented over the past 10 years.  With the growing dependence on computers in practically every aspect of modern life, use of social media, large industries moving towards high performance (faster) computing networks and the coming era of the Internet of Things (IoT), the market for cyber technology is expected to grow at a steady rate of as much as 15% annually.  This project will create a high speed, parallel and Truly-Random Number Generator (TRNG) with signal embedding capabilities.  With an optical core, the device will have advantages over many of the currently available, pseudo-RNG devices based on silicon chip technologies that have been shown vulnerable to hackers.  Additionally, this device will provide a framework for continuous development and possible online authentication features to compliment the hardware.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will result in development of a prototype device to assess the feasibility of a commercial product.  The basis of the innovation is the use of quantum phenomena in optics to create randomness, also known as noise.  Quantum mechanics has proven to be the underlying mechanism for noise processes used the world over in encryption of data.  In this case, the process of creating noise can be adjusted, oscillated at some frequency, to produce embedded signals overlaid with the random output.  This gives the final design applications well beyond encryption.  With the rise of high performance computing networks in scientific simulations, health care patient tracking, financial institution accessibility, education, etc., the ability to use the embedding feature to track authentication credentials and perform continuous monitoring of equipment accessing a network becomes paramount to securing networks as well as data.  During this project the basic design will be refined with the aim of producing a rescaled, commercial product.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ NSF SBIR &ndash; Phase I Project Outcomes: Quantum Random Walking to provide a TRNG for HPC, AI and Cyber Security                 Axion Technologies LLC received an NSF &ndash; SBIR Phase I grant to develop a Truly-Random Number Generator (TRNG) based on a quantum mechanical, controllable noise.  Currently, most random numbers generators (RNGs) use computer algorithms, which means they are inherently pseudo-RNG (PRNGs); that is to say they produce numbers that are not truly random, are prone to cyclic behavior and in some cases have shown vulnerabilities.   Such devices have documented weakness, particularly as we move into the era of quantum and high speed computing.  On the market, along side the PRNGs, are several devices that use quantum principles to produce Quantum-RNGs also known as TRNGs.  The latter are often too slow to meet industrial needs and, for the goals of this project to supply randomness to High Performance Computing (HPC) simulations, lack the flexibility to be of use for many scientific goals.  This work proved feasibility of solving the problems of both low speed TRNGs and pseudo-RNGs using a novel, patented technique based on optical phenomena.                 The project involved both experimental and simulation research to demonstrate the feasibility of designing a sufficiently high speed, parallel ability to provide randomness using optical birefringence.  The work began on Dec. 15th, 2016 and concluded on October 28th, 2017.  The final design, achieved the stated goals of speed, parallelism as well as being rescaled to minimize the physical footprint.  Simulations revealed the possibility of providing as many as 250+ streams of random numbers from a single unit, with a 1GHz output per stream.  Simulations also showed the possibility of developing a chip level device that could be used with personal devices.  Finally, to fully take advantage of the natural parallelism of the system, a new optical distribution mechanism was also developed.  This distribution mechanism has been detailed in a third patent application associated with this work.                  The core system for developing a TRNG, in the present work, involves use of continuous beam splitting leading to bifurcation and eventually random walking of photons.  The method had not been previously attempted, though use of birefringence for RNG devices was previously explored.  What makes this method distinct: 1. it enables use of an entire photon beam over other birefringent techniques which rely on single photon interactions, 2. the noise can be controlled by the setting of the individual elements allowing for a type of microscopy that can in turn be used for identification, 3. the larger numbers of photons available allow for feeding into parallel streams not possible with single-photon devices and 4. the larger numbers of photons allow for high speed readout.  These advantages over other systems using birefringence allow the current project to serve the needs of HPC simulations performed, in many cases, on thousands of cores simultaneously.  This work will also find application in large server farms where significant numbers of customers now turn to meet their workload demands.                 The final project has proven feasible the core mechanism for TRNG.  The final device has been rescaled from a larger, "table-top," research experiment to a smaller footprint for integration into HPC systems.  The mechanism to distribute large numbers of parallel streams of truly-random numbers to multiple circuits and/or cores was also developed over the course of the Phase I project and has resulted in a third patent application.  Simulations suggest that the work can be further rescaled to meet the needs of personal electronic devices in the coming era of quantum and other high speed computers.  Thus the project has met its stated objectives of proving feasibility for using a novel optical technique for new tools in encryption and cyber security.
