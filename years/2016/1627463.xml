<AbstractNarration>In recent years, social scientists have devoted increasing attention to understanding the causes and consequences of grassroots political mobilization and changing notions of citizenship. However, most of their research has been conducted in urban locations, often emphasizing the role played by the experience of urban living and access to global connections in fostering political engagement. The research supported by this award seeks to answer a complementary question: If urbanism and globalism are so important, why is it that rural communities also produce politically active citizens? It is an important question whose answer will help to better understand the functioning of participatory democracies throughout the world. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To address this question, Rutgers University anthropology doctoral student, Nada El-Kouny, with the supervision of Dr. Becky Schulties, will undertake 12 months of multi-sited research in a rural hamlet and nearby town in Egypt, a country well-known for political activism and thus a particularly appropriate site for investigating these issues. The researcher will focus on infrastructure provisioning as a primary avenue through which rural areas are connected to often faraway government offices and officials. El-Kouny will use a mix of social science methods to gather data, including archival research to investigate the study hamlet's history and government interactions, such as road building projects, school construction, the coming of electricity, and improved access to water. She also will map hamlet social, kin, and mobility networks; conduct a hamlet census; and hold focus groups. In the town, she will interview key informants to learn more of the town's history. Findings from this research will improve understanding of citizenship and political activism of rural people through the lens of the mundane infrastructure through which politics is experienced in daily life. Findings will also be of interest to policy makers concerned to explain political mobilization wherever it may occur.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Seventeen months total were spent conducting archival and ethnographic fieldwork for this doctoral dissertation research, The Role of Infrastructure in Rural Political Engagement in Egypt. The project explored how marginalized citizens enact their citizenship and rights, as well as how states produce themselves through infrastructure. By focusing on two rural Nile Delta governorates, the research shifted from an urban-centered analysis of political contention in Egypt that dominated the political and scholarly analysis with the January 25 Revolution, 2011 and its aftermath. The research also moved away from studying how citizens challenge state control from performative rights-claims, such as calls for social justice, to the way it is enacted through material forms and the physical built environment. Infrastructure is the main avenue through which the research addressed this topic since it reveals how marginalized citizens enacted their citizenship and sought to be seen by people in the centers of control. The project therefore is of interest to anthropology, geography, history, political science, rural and development studies in thinking about how state policies, as well as citizens political actions are enacted and contested. The broader impact of the project is an attempt to provide marginalized citizens an opportunity to find the right avenues through which they can have their complaints reach the centers of power. The project likewise can provide policy makers a resource to use in developing and improving services to citizens.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 01/21/2019<br>      Modified by: Nada&nbsp;El-Kouny</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
