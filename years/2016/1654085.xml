<AbstractNarration>Concerns about privacy continue to pervade large-scale deployments of technologies including big data, cloud services and the Internet of Things. The main purpose of the proposed work is to build a community of academic researchers and industry practitioners to address research priorities identified in the newly released National Privacy Research Strategy. By engaging industry stakeholders with researchers and advancing new thinking, research, best practices and practical tools, this work will prompt industry action and advocate privacy-aware approaches to collecting and processing personal information in a manner that respects individual privacy, equality and fairness. This project aims to enhance opportunities for innovation, provide meaningful protections for personal information across industry sectors and institutions, inform the public debate on privacy, and contribute to the development of systems and products used to help society realize the benefits of networked information technology without sacrificing privacy and individual rights.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will undertake major activities such as an inaugural launch conference and a series of academic workshops and networking opportunities. Issues for discussion will include mechanisms to encourage and support multi-disciplinary research along a continuum of privacy challenges, including how to increase transparency of data collection and use; to ensure data flows are consistent with privacy rules; and to reduce privacy risks of analytical algorithms. Its emphasis on engagement of industry practitioners with academic researchers furthers the development of a community of privacy researchers working across disciplines and sectors and dedicated to the promotion of new knowledge, techniques and practices to better protect individual privacy.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Privacy Research and Data Responsibility Research Coordination Network (RCN) cultivated a community of academic researchers and industry practitioners focused on addressing research priorities identified in the National Privacy Research Strategy ("Strategy"). Under the leadership of the FPF Education and Innovation Foundation (FPF EIF), the RCN fostered new partnerships, incentivized and distributed research, and promoted discussion of privacy issues prompting action toward technological innovation while protecting individual privacy. Drawing on its relationships with industry chief privacy officers, academic researchers, regulators, lawyers, social scientists, civil rights advocates, social philanthropists, and government actors, FPF EIF convened the RCN regularly to facilitate communication and sharing of information and ideas. The RCN presented  the latest advances in privacy research and helped identify high impact research questions, answers and directions that will have significant operational and policy implications.   The RCN focused its priorities on the following three key topics identified in the Strategy:   1. Increasing transparency of data collection, sharing, use, and retention  2. Ensuring that information flows and use are consistent with privacy rules  3. Advancing progress on practical de-identification techniques and policy and reducing privacy risks of analytical algorithms  FPF EIF supported the goals outlined in the project through three main activities: 1) a series of academic workshops incorporating both new and established academic programs; 2) exposure of industry professionals to academic scholarship via FPF's working groups that cover topics such as the Internet of Things, education, connected cars, smart cities and health as well as meetings of the FPF Advisory Board; and 3) ongoing communications and networking opportunities among RCN members and beyond.

On another important level, the RCN has furthered the development of a community of privacy researchers working across disciplines and sectors to promote new technologies, techniques and practices to better protect individual privacy.  Several components of the RCN to connect academic researchers with industry leaders will be continued under a new Applied Privacy RCN to support and accelerate the transition of promising privacy research to commercial practice.
