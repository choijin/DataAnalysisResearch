<AbstractNarration>NON-TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION: Multilayered composites, designed to combine the properties of reflective metals and transparent dielectrics, have the potential to revolutionize optical microscopy, control emission of molecules, and even to enable cloaks of invisibility. However, until now the advantages achieved with multilayered structures have been limited. Decreasing layer thickness, reducing absorption, and implementing optical gain have been named as some of the possible ways to advance the optics of multilayered media towards its revolutionary potential. In this project, our collaborative team will aim to understand, through carefully designed experimental, computational, and analytical studies, the optical response of free-electron plasma that underlines the photonics of multilayered composites. Of particular interest will be the limits of small layer thickness where quantum-mechanical effects are expected to manifest themselves, and the interaction between optical gain and loss. The program will present new opportunities for engaging students in interdisciplinary research and thus improve competitiveness of the US high-tech workforce. The team members will also implement a number of outreach events to broaden participation of school-aged and undergraduate students in STEM. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION: Plasmonic metamaterials -- nanostructured composites with tailored optical response resulting from metallic or highly doped semiconducting components -- promise to revolutionize our understanding of light-matter interactions, enabling new applications that include perfect light absorbers, invisibility cloaks, sub-wavelength imaging, focusing, and guiding. In this project the team will perform a comprehensive interdisciplinary study of semiconductor layered metamaterials, with a vision towards understanding the fundamentals of light-matter interaction in heterogeneous mesoscale plasmonic systems. Of particular interest will be (i) understanding the optical response of plasmonic systems where the motion of the free charges is confined by the geometry, leading to nonlocal electromagnetism and to (ii) fundamentals of light propagation, emission, and absorption in coupled nonlocal nanoplasmonic systems. The developed description of active nonlocal plasmonics will be applicable to multiple material platforms operating throughout optical spectrum. The proposed program will provide multiple opportunities for educating the next-generation interdisciplinary workforce and will serve as a platform for outreach activities targeting undergraduates, school students, and school teachers.</AbstractNarration>

In the proposed material platform, highly doped semiconductor layers play the role of ?designer metals?, plasmonic media whose plasma frequency can be tuned by adjusting their effective mass and/or free charge concentration. The effort comprises teams from Princeton, Purdue, UT Austin, and is led by UMass Lowell.&nbsp; Together, the team has expertise in analytical and numerical techniques, material growth, fabrication, and characterization.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Intellectual Merit:</strong> The platform investigated offers an opportunity to bring subwavelength optics, driven at visible frequencies by the noble metals, to the important mid- to far-IR frequency ranges. Furthermore, since the materials used for the ?designer metals? studied in this work are identical to the materials used for quantum cascade lasers (the state-of-the-art mid-IR semiconductor light source), the proposed platform enables ?active plasmonics? where optical losses (and optical response in general) in complex metamaterial composites can be dynamically tuned with DC current. &nbsp;The goals of this program are to (i) understand the transition between the quantized and classical response of multilayer arrays as their thickness is reduced to the ~5nm scale (where the effects of quantum confinement begin to dominate optical response) and (ii) understand the interplay between plasmonic loss and optical gain in the active plasmonic structures, with the ultimate goal of understanding and approaching the limits of light molding with composites. Importantly, since the mid-IR response of doped semiconductor multilayers is driven by free electrons, similar to the visible-frequency response of noble metals, the results of this program are expected to be directly applicable to future studies of other plasmonic platforms, starting from noble metals at visible frequencies, to transparent oxides at near IR frequencies, to doped 2D materials at far-IR and THz frequencies.</p> <p>Perhaps the most significant result from this program is the demonstration of ?Ballistic Metamaterials?. We were able to associate the classical to quantum transition in the electromagnetic response of a doped-InGaAs/InAlAs metamaterial system with a new phenomenon of ballistic resonance that comes from the interplay between a time-periodic driving field (incident light), the oscillating free charges inside the material, and the onset of the geometrical confinement of charge in the thin conductive layers.&nbsp; This work demonstrated plasmonic behavior in the metamaterial stack at frequencies well above the plasma frequency of the bulk constituent materials.&nbsp; We followed this by subsequently demonstrating the same resonance in an InAs/AlSb metamaterial system, showing metamaterial like behavior up to ~3 micron wavelength, easily the highest frequency demonstration of epitaxial semiconductor hyperbolic metamaterials.</p> <p>We also demonstrated ?photonic funnel? structures, conical systems with metallic walls isolating their cores from the environment, and cores fabricated from the material platform developed in this program. We have experimentally demonstrated individual funnels and arrays of funnels with output diameters as small as 1/35 of the free-space wavelength, as well as transmission of light through these structures. Our numerical analysis proves that the funnels provide a flexible platform for linking the diffraction-limited world with subwavelength areas. In particular, we demonstrated high-efficiency confinement of propagating light and high-efficiency outcoupling of light from nm-scale areas.</p> <p>Finally, our team was able to demonstrate the integration of our doped semiconductor materials with active semiconductor emitters.&nbsp; First, we demonstrated enhanced long-wave IR emission from type-II superlattices grown on highly doped epitaxial semiconductors, and analyzed the observed enhancement as convolution of the Purcell effect coupled to a leaky cavity system.&nbsp; We also demonstrated electrically-driven, enhanced mid-IR emission from epitaxial quantum dot LEDs grown on our design metal platform.</p> <p><strong>Broader Impacts:</strong> This project advances the disciplines of optics, optical materials, and optoelectronics by exploring, understanding, and demonstrating a novel material system with unique optical properties not available in bulk materials.&nbsp; Moreover, because of the all-epitaxial nature of the material system investigated, we can envision its integration into an array of novel optoelectronic device architectures for mid-IR applications. &nbsp;In addition to the technical output of the program, the PIs made significant efforts in education and outreach, despite the challenges associated with the Covid-19 pandemic in the final year of the program.&nbsp;
