<AbstractNarration>Multiple astronomical observations have established that about 85% of the matter in the universe is not made of normal atoms, but must be otherwise undetected elementary "dark matter" particles that do not emit or absorb light. Deciphering the nature of this so-called Dark Matter is of fundamental importance to cosmology, astrophysics, and high-energy particle physics. A leading hypothesis is that it is comprised of Weakly Interacting Massive Particles, or WIMPs, that were produced moments after the Big Bang. If WIMPs are the dark matter, then their presence in our galaxy may be detectable via scattering from atomic nuclei in detectors located deep underground to help reject backgrounds due to cosmic rays. Direct detection of WIMP dark matter would solve a fundamental mystery in particle physics and cosmology, providing a unique window to learning about the primary matter constituent of the Universe and of physics beyond the Standard Model of particle physics. This award will fund the continued participation of this group in the DarkSide-50 (DS-50) Dark Matter experiment at the Gran Sasso underground national laboratory in Italy. A detailed understanding of the DS-50 backgrounds and performance is key to the design of future liquid argon (LAr) dark matter detectors with substantially better sensitivity for heavy WIMPs. The UMass effort is centered on studies of radon, alpha-decays, and surface backgrounds to maximize the DS-50 physics output and to understand scale-up implications for such future, larger detectors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI has a diverse population of students, graduate and undergraduate, working in his lab on hardware and software projects. Their work reaches beyond the UMass walls, as they experience research at the forefront of particle physics in most cases for the first time. Fully involved in international research collaborations, they have the opportunity to travel to prime science laboratories and institutions, meet fellow students and scientists of international renown, and have hands-on experiences on leading experiments. The PI has an established track record for promoting diversity in his research group.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;DS-50 searches for WIMPs with a dual-phase liquid argon Time Projection Chamber (LAr TPC) in which WIMPs could deposit energy into both scintillation and ionization signals. Exploiting the different time profile ("pulse shape") of the scintillation light of nuclear and electron recoils, DS-50 has demonstrated beta/gamma background suppression of 1.5x10^7. The continued run of DS-50 will include the full information of ionization signals in a background-free dark matter search with spin-independent WIMP-nucleon cross section sensitivity of ~Â­10x^-45 cm^2 for 100 GeV mass WIMPs.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This award, "A Search for Weakly-Interacting Particle Dark Matter with DarkSide", supported the participation and the contributions of the University of Massachusetts, Amherst group to the DarkSide experimental program searching for dark matter with earth-bound experiments using liquid argon as target and detrection medium. The program is searching for weakly interacting, massive particle (WIMP) dark matter, one of the well-motivated candidates to explain the missing dark matter, whose existence is so-far exclusively inferred from observed grvitational effects at various scales, from galactic to cosmic, in the universe.  During the award period, the UMass group comprised of two graduate students (Alissa Monte and Matthew Downing) and the PI (Andrea Pocar), in addition to several undergraduate students.  Intellectual merit:  Understanding what dark matter is represents a central goal for contemporary science. DarkSide is searching for dark matter in the form of weakly interacting particles that would interact with atomic nuclei. It is pioneering the liquid qrgon technology that allows a "background-free" search for these elusive signals.  DarkSide has demonstrated excellent ability to scale its experiments up quickly, using the "dual-phase" time projection chamber technology. Liquid argon allows one to obtain exquisite identification and discrimination of the signals generated when argon nuclei are hit by WIMPs and recoil, releasing tiny amounts of energy in the detector. DarkSide has operated a first experiment called DS-50 at LNGS, Italy. It is now constructing a much larger detector with several tens of tons of argon called DS-20k, also at LNGS.   DS-50 has achieved milestone results. At the time of publication, it had set the best limits obtained with an argon target for WIMP dark matter heavier than a few times the mass of the proton. This result motivated the design of the DS-20k detector. Most notably, DS-50 has also set the best limits to-date for WIMP dark matter with lighter mass, 2-6 times that of the proton, a region that has seen an increasing experimental investigation in recent years.  The UMass group supported by this award has contributed directly to these results. Graduate student Alissa Monte performed a detailed study of trace alpha radioactivity in the DS-50 detector.

The PI contributes to the extraction of low-radioactivity argon from underground wells in Colorado and to the development of low-background design solutions for DS-20k.  Broader Impacts:  The DarkSide activities, including those supported by this award, contribute to the training of the scientific and technical workforce of the country, as well as of the nuclear and particle phsyics scientists in academia and national laboratories. The techniques developed for the detection of dark matter are rather directly applied to the monitoring of nuclear fuel cycles at nuclear power plants and reactors, as well as in medical imaging technology.  The DarkSide investigations, which required the use of low-radioactivity argon extracted from underground CO2 wells in Colorado, allowed the commercially-viable extraction of Helium from the same source.
