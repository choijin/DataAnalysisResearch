<AbstractNarration>NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION&lt;br/&gt;GEOGRAPHY SPATIAL SCIENCES (GSS) PROGRAM&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1615154&lt;br/&gt;Allan James&lt;br/&gt;John Kupfer&lt;br/&gt;University of South Carolina&lt;br/&gt;This rapid-response research project will delineate and quantify the effects of large floods that occurred in early October 2015 on numerous rivers and streams in South Carolina.  Extreme flooding generates considerable erosion and sedimentation and provides an excellent opportunity to study how a severe flood can modify channels and floodplains. The ephemeral data collected soon after the flooding ended will improve basic understanding of sediment transport and deposition dynamics during these large, rare floods as well as their importance in the sedimentary record.  In particular, the duration of stream power above a threshold value will help predict where and how much bank and floodplain erosion will occur and when the rates of change in stream power will coincide with patterns of sedimentation.  Project findings will enhance basic understanding of the magnitude and nature of geomorphic adjustments to large floods.  They will help guide policy makers at city, county, state and federal levels and at local watershed associations, and they will enable research scientists to develop more effective watershed management plans for urban streams.  The project also will guide the development of graduate and undergraduate students from underrepresented groups in science and engineering and will build STEM capacity by incorporating undergraduate and graduate students into the research process through their involvement in field-based data collection and analytical procedures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The researchers will investigate the use of longitudinal variations in unit stream power and stream gradient index (SGI) as potential indicators for reach-scale changes in sediment flux that identify sites that are vulnerable to future flooding.  Using state-of-the-art mapping techniques including global positioning systems (GPS), unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), and light detection and ranging (LiDAR), the investigators will map and measure channel adjustments to test theories, explain patterns, and develop predictive models of river erosion and sedimentation.  While modern mapping technologies will help identify, locate, and recognize patterns of channel and floodplain change, UAVs will acquire low-altitude aerial imagery, which will be used with "structure-from-motion" (SfM) photogrammetric techniques to develop high-resolution, large-scale maps of selected sites. Spatial patterns of erosion and sedimentation measured by these methods will be compared with patterns predicted by analysis of stream power to test theories based on the duration of critical power and spatial changes in stream power.  Improvement in the ability to predict channel erosion and deposition and subsequent changes in flood stages has enormous socioeconomic implications that will help guide future flood-mitigation efforts.</AbstractNarration>

The primary goal was to document spatial patterns of erosion and sedimentation of a very large flood that occurred in October, 2015 in central South Carolina. &nbsp;A great scientific interest in geomorphic changes associated with dam removal and post-dam stream restoration has grown in recent years, which has spawned an interest in the geomorphic effects of dam failures.&nbsp; In the first week of October, 2015, a stalled frontal boundary near the Atlantic Coast combined with the slow moving Hurricane Joaquin off shore, generating record rainfalls in central South Carolina that exceeded thousand-year, three-day intensities. &nbsp;This study took this opportunity to study geomorphic changes associated with the flooding and, in particular, changes associated with several dam failures caused by the floods (Figure 1). &nbsp;The study also tested a new set of mapping technologies for sites with limited clearing under dense forest canopy.&nbsp; These techniques included image acquisition from unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs or drones) and Structure from Motion (SfM) photogrammetry (developing 3D data from many overlapping images) for large-scale topographic mapping.</p> <p>Detailed field sampling and systematic image analysis documented geomorphic adjustments at four failed dams within Gills Creek watershed, an urbanized basin with numerous lakes and ponds. &nbsp;An additional four failed dams in rural settings with less urban infrastructure were also examined. &nbsp;Despite extreme flooding, geomorphic effects were limited and localized, occurring primarily at dam failure sites and not extending significantly downstream, especially along Gills Creek, where the combination of intact dams, frequent urban infrastructure roughness elements (e.g., embankments at bridges), thick floodplain vegetation, and numerous wetlands suppressed substantial morphologic adjustments or major deposition. A significant effect of the dam failures was the rapid transition from an initial braided channel to a single thread channel within the emptied reservoirs within the first few months.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Study results indicate that sediment transport in urbanized watersheds has unique characteristics in response to frequent hydraulic choke-points&nbsp; and roughness elements that impede flows and encourage sediment deposition. &nbsp;This poorly documented characteristic of urban streams is shown clearly on Gills Creek, where local sediment deposition was encouraged by (1) backwater from downstream reservoirs, wetlands, road embankments, and bridges as well as by (2) high channel roughness from vegetation and large woody debris. Consequently, downstream sediment transport on Gills Creek was moderate and sediment tended to be deposited on floodplains close to erosion sites. &nbsp;The high frequency of flow impediments is clearly demonstrated on longitudinal profiles of Gills Creek that show much of the stream covered by artificial lakes and urban infrastructure, such as bridges, road embankments, and dams (Figure 2). The effects of local sedimentation were documented at a specific site where sand splays formed on the floodplain very near the source of the sediment.&nbsp; In this example, UAV imagery and SfM photogrammetry provided maps of sand splays, including an orthophoto mosaic (Figure 3) and a detailed map of an individual sand splay (Figure 4) from which geometric dimensions and sediment volumes were derived.&nbsp; The SfM imagery is at a scale that would not have been detected by most other aerial mapping methods such as airborne LiDAR.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In summary, this project documents geomorphic change processes that are distinctly different in urban areas and that are relevant to urban floodplain evolution and anticipating the results of dam removal and dam failure.&nbsp; Application of new mapping technologies (the combination of UAV and SfM) was shown to be effective for generating large scale maps under dense forest canopy.&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 10/03/2017<br>      Modified by: Allan&nbsp;James</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1615154/1615154_10407285_1502043781186_Fig.1_Dams_Regionalmap--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1615154/1615154_10407285_1502043781186_Fig.1_Dams_Regionalmap--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 1.

The SfM imagery is at a scale that would not have been detected by most other aerial mapping methods such as airborne LiDAR.               In summary, this project documents geomorphic change processes that are distinctly different in urban areas and that are relevant to urban floodplain evolution and anticipating the results of dam removal and dam failure.  Application of new mapping technologies (the combination of UAV and SfM) was shown to be effective for generating large scale maps under dense forest canopy.
