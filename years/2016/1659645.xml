<AbstractNarration>This project will support a three-year Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) site at Oklahoma State University (OSU). The project is a ten-week summer institute for ten undergraduate students who are rising juniors or seniors in two-year colleges and four-year universities in Oklahoma and neighboring states. During the summer institute, the participants will engage in research in big data analytics; including, data collection, data cleansing, data analysis, data interpretation, and data visualization, under the mentorship and guidance of the Principal Investigator and other faculty mentors. The proposed REU site will impact the training of the 21st century workforce by broadening participation in computing research, exposing minority students to the research process, influencing their career decisions and increasing diversity with-in the field. Contact will be maintained with the participants after the summer institute through a virtual community site; this will encourage community-building within the whole cohort and support the participants' efforts to build their identity as researchers. The participants will also be exposed to research activities in industry through field trips and presentations from external speakers. The targeted institutions for recruitment have a high percentage of underrepresented minority undergraduate students, such as African Americans and Native Americans.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will support ten students each year as they engage in research in big data analytics. They will learn how to use machine learning algorithms such as neural networks, visualization techniques, such as isometric feature mapping, and statistical techniques such as regression and Gaussian processes. It is expected that participants will not only gain technical skills such as programming, but also develop broad abilities in abstraction and computational thinking. They will be introduced to all aspects of big data analytics in real-world projects, such as collecting and analyzing social media data. The participants will work as a cohort and will be included as co-authors in publications stemming from their work. The students will work in small groups while interacting with other groups and with graduate students, assisting each other to collect, schematize, structure, visualize, and learn from large-scale data sources. The proposed REU site will contribute towards the training of the 21st century workforce and broaden participation in computing research, especially in big data analytics, which is an important and swiftly-growing area for research.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ We are in an age of big data gathered from a wide variety of sources, including web pages, social networks, broadcasting, the Internet of Things (IoT) and health. We send hundreds of billions of messages through social media and upload millions of videos daily across the Internet. This year, according to one estimate, humanity has produced 40 trillion gigabytes of data, most of which is never analyzed and therefore produces no value.  Our nation needs computer scientists who are proficient in big data analytics. At the same time, the number of women and underrepresented minorities achieving Computer Science degrees is relatively small, and even fewer of them are ever exposed to research or learn about opportunities for graduate studies. Our REU site recruited and provided a quality research experience for undergraduates -- especially women and minority students -- in computing fields, particularly big data analytics.  The recruitment effort focused on two-year colleges and four-year universities in Oklahoma and neighboring states (primary target population is Oklahoma) with limited research capabilities in computer science and a high percentage of underrepresented minority undergraduate students, such as Native Americans and students at HBCUs.  Thirty such students participated in a ten-week summer research institute, where they were introduced to all aspects of big data analytics in real-world projects with different types of data such as social network, text, image and health data. They learned how to use machine learning algorithms (e.g., neural networks), data mining methods (e.g., clustering), and statistical techniques (e.g., regression and Gaussian processes), with applications to graph theory, text mining, robotics, image processing, bioinformatics and healthcare. Participants will not only gained technical skills such as programming but also developed broad abilities in abstraction and computational thinking.  In addition, of course, participants contributed to cutting-edge research in various aspects of big data.  The participants have published papers and presented research at conferences in fields as diverse as predictive analysis of social network behavior, recommendation systems, computer security and human-robot interaction.  Finally, and perhaps most importantly, the program has led to significant workforce development among students who otherwise would have had a much more difficult time finding the resources, contacts and exposure to further a research-oriented career in data science.  Of the thirty undergraduate participants (70% of whom were from underprivileged populations), twelve have begun or confirmed plans to begin graduate studies in the field, and a further five have found internships or full-time work in some aspect of data science.
