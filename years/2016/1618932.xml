<AbstractNarration>Rapid advances in location based applications are leading to increased concern about location privacy.  Current mobile operating systems only provide users with rudimentary location access controls - either to block or allow location access - which are inadequate and inefficient in mitigating privacy threats.  Most existing location obfuscation mechanisms are based on syntactic privacy models that do not consider mobility and are hence vulnerable to inference attacks.  The goal of this project is to develop rigorous and customizable privacy notions and location perturbation mechanisms for individual location sharing in location based applications, and study their impact in the context of location based queries and geospatial crowdsourcing.  Building privacy mechanisms that can be directly used by mobile users will minimize unnecessary disclosure of their precise locations and trajectories to location based applications and other possibly malicious third parties.  By addressing the spatiotemporal privacy barrier, this project promises significant impact in enabling and promoting adoption of location based applications while ensuring individual privacy.  The project also includes a set of integrated educational activities including hackathon events, involvement of graduate and undergraduate students, and encouragement of participation by women and minorities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project has several objectives: 1) Develop rigorous privacy notions based on differential privacy and its variants for location protection while accounting for spatiotemporal correlations of a user's locations through mobility modeling, and to investigate optimal and heuristic perturbation mechanisms to achieve privacy guarantees with optimal utility;  2) Extend privacy solutions for protecting a trajectory or a sequence of time-location pairs; and 3) Develop customizable privacy solutions for location and trajectory protection through policy graphs, considering user  preferences, spatiotemporal semantics, and privacy-utility tradeoffs.  Privacy-utility tradeoffs using perturbed locations are studied in the context of location based applications such as predictive range queries and k-nearest neighbor queries as well as geospatial crowdsourcing.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More information on this project can be found at http://www.mathcs.emory.edu/aims/stprivacy</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The collection and use of mobility data present increasing opportunities to enrich user experiences (e.g. point of interest search, ride sharing) and benefit society (e.g. traffic monitoring and contact tracing). They also lead to increased concern about location privacy. Most existing location obfuscation mechanisms are based on syntactic privacy models that do not consider mobility and are hence vulnerable to inference attacks. The goal of this project is to develop rigorous and customizable privacy notions and location perturbation mechanisms for location-based applications.  The key outcomes of the project include: 1) rigorous privacy notions based on differential privacy and its variants for location protection while accounting for spatiotemporal correlations of a user's locations through mobility modeling; 2) rigorous privacy notions extending differential privacy for protecting complex spatiotemporal events that goes beyond a single location presence; and 3) customizable privacy solutions that allow specification of privacy policies and support different use cases in terms of individual queries and aggregate location analytics.  For location protection, we developed a new privacy notion extending differential privacy by explicitly modeling the temporal correlations between consecutive locations of a moving user. Prior work not addressing the temporal correlations either are subjective to inference attacks or lead to inferior utility.  Our privacy notion achieves rigorous privacy and the perturbation mechanism achieve optimal utility of the perturbed location given a privacy requirement.  For spatiotemporal event protection which generalizes the problem of location protection, we consider the secret to be protected as a sequence of time-location pairs, e.g., staying in a hospital for a period of time, or moving from hospital to pharmacy. We formally defined a spatiotemporal event as a Boolean construct and proposed the notion of spatiotemporal event privacy by extending differential privacy.  We also developed a framework for converting state-of-the-art perturbation mechanisms designed for location protection (e.g., geo-indistinguishability) into one protecting spatiotemporal event privacy.   For customizable privacy solutions to support individual utility (e.g., point of interest search, contact tracing), we developed a new location privacy notion based on policy graph which allows customizable privacy policies.  We showed that the prior location privacy notions are instantiations of this generalized notion.  We then designed an end-to-end location trace release framework that achieves the privacy given any policy graph.  We also demonstrated the policy graph can be customized to better support a variety of applications such as epidemic surveillance and contact tracing.    For customizable privacy solutions to support aggregate utility (e.g., regional population density monitoring for pandemic surveillance), we developed new privacy notions and mechanisms based on local differential privacy which provide an input-discriminative protection to reflect the distinct privacy requirements of different inputs (e.g., some locations are more sensitive than others).  In addition, we designed mechanisms with enhanced privacy-utility tradeoff for optimizing utility for both individual queries and aggregated analytics simultaneously; and for aggregating key-value pairs (e.g., location and length-of-stay at the location), where the frequency of keys (e.g., frequency of each location) and mean of values for each key (e.g., mean length-of-stay for each location) can be estimated simultaneously.  Besides the privacy notions and mechanisms, we also studied and evaluated the techniques for practical location-based applications, such as spatial crowdsourcing to protect the locations of both workers and tasks (e.g. drivers and riders for ridesharing), and digital contact tracing.  Our empirical studies on real-world datasets showed that it is feasible to obtain reasonable utility with rigorous privacy protection of users.   Building privacy mechanisms that can be directly used by mobile users or service providers will minimize unnecessary disclosure of users’ precise locations to location-based applications and other possibly malicious third parties. By addressing the spatiotemporal privacy barrier, this project enables and promotes location-based applications to enrich individual lives as well as the use of mobility data to benefit society, while ensuring individual privacy.
