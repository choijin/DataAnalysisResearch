<AbstractNarration>This award provide support for the International Beacon Satellite Symposium that will be held at the International Centre for Theoretical Physics in Trieste, Italy on June 27 to July 1, 2016 (BSS2016). This meeting is one of the more important focused workshop conference meeting within the discipline of radio science. The award would provide travel support and participant expenses for 10 students (4 US and 6 from developing countries). The Beacon Satellite Symposium provides a unique opportunity for US scientists and students to meet scientists from all over the world to share knowledge on the ionospheric effects on radio propagation and space weather. Beacon Symposia have historically focused on ionospheric electron content and scintillation. With more recent developments in ionospheric imaging, remote sensing, tomography, occultation techniques, assimilation models, distributed arrays of ionospheric measurements, monitoring natural hazards from space, national and international space weather activities, and satellite based navigation and communication systems; these studies have gained new momentum and perspectives. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This symposium is a unique opportunity for US scientists and students to gain a worldwide perspective on the state of the art of these research topics. This award has significant broader impacts by creating opportunities for international research collaborations and enhancing research in the United States. International research collaborations yield opportunities to share and deploy ionospheric sensing equipment to far away lands where ionospheric behavior and effects are not well studied or understood.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The 19th International Beacon Satellite Symposium (BSS2016) was held on June 27 &ndash; July 1, 2016 at the Abdus Salam International Centre for Theoretical Physics (ICTP) in Trieste, Italy.  This triennial event is primarily organized by the Beacon Satellite Group of the International Union of Radio Science (URSI) Commission G. The Beacon Satellite Group is interdisciplinary, servicing science, research, application and engineering interests. These interests include all aspects of satellite signals observed on the ground and by receivers on-board satellites.  This meeting provides a unique opportunity for ionospheric scientists from all over the world to meet and collaborate on the ionospheric effects on radio propagation and space weather.    The Beacon Satellite Studies Group was originally formed in 1972, with the first Symposia at Graz, Austria. Symposia have continued to meet approximately every three years with meetings held at various worldwide locations. From the beginning, the two main areas of interest in Beacon Satellite Studies have been Ionospheric Electron Content and Scintillation. With more recent developments in ionospheric imaging, remote sensing, tomography, occultation techniques, assimilation models, distributed arrays of ionospheric measurements, IHY and IPY activities, space weather and satellite based navigation and communication systems; these studies have gained new momentum and perspectives.    The 19th International Beacon Satellite Symposium was extraordinarily successful. It attracted nearly 200 participants from 48 countries. The presentations were of high quality and the organization and venue were impeccable.  One of the most notable differences from prior symposia was the unprecedented number of participants from developing countries. This is attributed to the generous support of our sponsors and the attraction of the ICTP as a driving force behind global efforts to advance scientific expertise in the developing world (http://www.ictp.it/about-ictp.aspx)  The technical sessions included innovative presentations on Total Electron Content (TEC), ionospheric irregularities and scintillation, monitoring natural hazards from space, polar effects on GNSS, data assimilation modeling, ionosphere-thermosphere modeling and validation, ionospheric effects on satellite based navigation systems, radio occultation techniques and measurements, and space weather.  An impressive poster session was also held with nearly 60 posters presented on all of the relevant sessions.  All of the presentations and the ensuing discussions initiated many international collaborations and interests.  Numerous remarks were made on the quality and excellence of the presentations during this symposium.  In addition, with the inclusion of many participants from developing countries in Africa, participants had the opportunity to learn of research efforts in countries not represented in earlier Beacon Symposia.  The International Beacon Satellite Symposium 2016 was a very successful event.  The number of participants exceeded all prior symposia and they included many people from developing countries in Africa, South America and Asia.  Remarks throughout the symposia; the significant level of sponsorship; and the large number of young scientists were evidence that Beacon Satellite Studies continues to be a strong focus for scientific study and exploration.  Copies of the final program, abstracts and presentations are available for download on the website: https://isrconferences.bc.edu/beacon/index.html.  The Beacon Satellite Studies group of URSI Commission G look forward to the 20th Beacon Satellite Symposium that will be hosted by Dr. Andrzej Krankowski at the University of Warmia and Mazury in Olsztyn, Poland in 2019.  More details on this meeting will be released as they come available.                Last Modified: 12/06/2017       Submitted by: Patricia H Doherty]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
