<AbstractNarration>Territoriality is fundamental to understanding human societies as it relates to the emergence of property rights, land tenure, warfare, and socioeconomic inequalities. However human societies have not always been territorial and many questions remain as to the timing and conditions under which territoriality emerges. It is only through the discipline of archaeology can social scientists evaluate the emergence of and changes in territoriality across thousands of years.  Anthropologists have theorized that territoriality emerges as a trade-off between benefits and risks of defending land using the Economic Defensibility Model (EDM). The EDM will be evaluated through the study of archaeological materials from the Texas Coastal Plain using geochemical methods. This project involves collaboration with The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department, and the Center for Archaeological Research at the University of Texas at San Antonio. This research contributes to the training of a minority graduate student in archaeological and geochemical methods. It will also contribute to a publicly available geochemical dataset that will be useful to multiple disciplines, including geology, ecology as well as archaeology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The EDM considers resource density, territory size, and modes of defense to posit the conditions under which territoriality emerges. While this model has been effective in understanding ethnographic examples of different types of territoriality, it has yet to be systematically evaluated in archaeological contexts. This project addresses this gap by examining territoriality during the Late Archaic period (2000 BC-AD 800) on the Texas Coastal Plain (TCP). The Late Archaic was a period of climatic amelioration and during this point in time population density peaked as hunter-gatherers made use of freshwater resources, white-tail deer, pecans, and tubers.  They returned to central locations for rituals and to bury their dead however, the scale of their population movements is unknown. Researchers argue that as hunter-gatherer populations on the TCP increased, there was a decline in mobility that may have led to increasing territoriality. The investigators will utilize strontium (87Sr/86Sr) stable isotope analysis to evaluate the presence of territoriality.  As an ecological tracer, 87Sr/86Sr levels in human bone can potentially tie individuals to particular locations and therefore allow inferences regarding territoriality. The 87Sr/86Sr of tooth enamel of over 50 individuals from the archaeological site of Loma Sandia will be measured.  In addition, the bioavailability of 87Sr/86Sr from seven geologic regions in the TCP will be evaluated through examination of modern faunal samples. These datasets will be analyzed to evaluate the degree that humans are tied to particular locations. This project will contribute to the rigorous assessment of the Economic Defensibility Model and advance our understanding of the causes and conditions for the emergence of territoriality.</AbstractNarration>

The project examined territoriality during the Late Archaic period (ca 4000-1200 BP) in the Texas Coastal Plains (TCP) focusing on the site of Loma Sandia in Live Oak County, Texas. The Late Archaic period is characterized by high population densities as indicated by an increase in habitation and mortuary sites, which researchers have argued to be signs of emerging territoriality. The development of territoriality in human groups is important to understand because it is the foundation for many facets associated with social complexity such as land tenure, trade networks and socioeconomic inequalities. The TCP is a little studied region despite a long period of human occupation and current research indicates a change in social structures during the later half of the Late Archaic. The results of this project have a strong potential to contribute to the knowledge of hunter-gatherers in the TCP and the change in social structure during this period.</p> <p>&nbsp;To achieve the goals of this project the investigators utilized strontium isotope ratio analysis to compare strontium signatures between prehistoric humans and geologically tied bioavailable strontium of modern artiodactyls with limited home ranges within the TCP. NSF funding was used to <strong>1) </strong>travel to several wild life management areas and private hunting ranches throughout the TCP to collect artiodactyl tooth samples, <strong>2) </strong>travel to The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, <strong>3) </strong>run 103 artiodactyl samples and 54 human enamel samples for strontium ratio isotopes and <strong>4) </strong>send 6 wood charcoal samples from Loma Sandia for AMS dating.</p> <p>The results of these analyses were useful but unexpected. Bioavailable strontium data from the modern artiodactyls did produce patterns between geologic regions, however there was significant overlap between several regions within the coastal and riverine zones of the TCP and a fair amount of variability within geologic zones. The exact cause for this variability within geologic regions is unknown but several hypotheses have been produced that would make excellent avenues for continued research. Human data was more homogenous. While this can be seen as an indicator of territoriality, the human data ranges are within the areas where geologic bioavailable data overlaps. This means that these individuals could have originated from any of these overlapping areas. The human data was distinctly different from geologic bioavailable data that came from areas further away from the gulf coast, with the exception of one individual. This does indicate that peoples in the Late Archaic period were not utilizing inland resources. This paints a picture of some territoriality being present separating inland peoples from people who resided along the coast and rivers, but a possible high degree of interaction between peoples from the coast and rivers. Due to overlapping geologic bioavailable data, this latter point is less clear but the former still provides an important clue towards understanding territoriality and hunter-gatherers in the Late Archaic TCP.</p> <p><span>The dissertation produced by this project will aid in the completion of a doctoral degree in Anthropology for the Co-PI, a female Hispanic graduate student at The University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA). This project also contributed to UTSA's goals of becoming a tier-one research institution. During the course of this project the Co-PI developed methods at the Center for Archaeological Research-UTSA, that show promise for future strontium stable isotope research at UTSA. The results of the project will also be added to a database of isotope studies being developed for Texas at UTSA. As this is the first project of its kind in Texas, the data generated by this project also lays the foundation for developing a regional strontium isotope database that can be utilized by other researchers and the unexpected results of the data produced by this project can also be used to develop new research projects and improve our understanding of bioavailable strontium variability. The Co-PI also fostered relations between Texas Parks and Wildlife Department wildlife biologists and local private ranch owners, both whom were important assets in collecting artiodactyl samples, opening the possibility for continued research.
