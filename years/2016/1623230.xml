<AbstractNarration>The Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP) through Targeted Infusion Projects supports the development, implementation, and study of evidence-based innovative models and approaches for improving the preparation and success of HBCU undergraduate students so that they may pursue science, technology, engineering or mathematics (STEM) graduate programs and/or careers. The project at Alcorn State University seeks to improve STEM learning by training faculty in active learning methods and developing a cohort of student peer leaders to support the use of the methods.  The activities and strategies are evidence-based and a strong plan for formative and summative evaluation is part of the project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project has the goals of developing faculty expertise in active learning instructional practices and developing a STEM Learning Resource Center for implementing peer led teaching and learning into the STEM curriculum.  These will be done by recruiting and training two cohorts of STEM faculty in best practices through workshops, conferences, and an ongoing faculty learning community.  The Learning Resource Center will be led by STEM undergraduate students and supervised by STEM faculty.  Along with being a repository for STEM career information, the space will be used for course workshops, project and homework assistance, exam preparation and assistance with using resources such as software and library databases.  The evaluation and dissemination of this project should be useful in developing models of student and faculty support for STEM majors at other institutions.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The ultimate goal of the project entitled "Targeted Infusion Project: Infusing Evidence-based Instructional Practices into the STEM curriculum at Alcorn State University" was to produce graduates with deeper understanding of scientific principles and better critical thinking, laboratory, and instrumentation skills who are better prepared for the STEM workforce.  To accomplish this goal, faculty developed expertise in active learning instructional practices (including flipped classroom, project-based learning, concept mapping, problem-based learning, and peer-led team learning) and a STEM Learning Resource Center was formed for implementation of peer learning strategies and to provide other needed resources in support of STEM courses; faculty development included attending active learning workshops, conferences, participation in a faculty learning community, and implementation of a pilot program in which active learning strategies were employed in selected STEM courses (General and Honors Biology lecture and lab, Genetics lecture and lab, physical Chemistry, Organic Chemistry, Instrumental Methods of Analysis Laboratory, College Algebra, Statistics, Computer Science, and Modern Physics).  The project outcomes, broken down into short-term, mid-term, and long-term outcomes, were evaluated by an external evaluator, using program and course data, faculty and student surveys and focus group reports.  According to the report, the project made significant strides toward the following short-term and mid-term intended outcomes: improvement in faculty pedagogical skills, more effective classroom instruction, stronger collaborations among STEM departments, greater engagement of students in STEM courses, improved retention of STEM concepts by students,  greater retention of students in STEM majors, and increased graduate school attendance.  In addition, the instrumentation acquired through the grant has contributed to the chemistry program accreditation efforts.  Project evaluation also led to lessons learned, which include the following:  (1)   Peer leaders, students who support faculty in the implementation of active learning strategies, must receive adequate training in facilitation of active learning techniques, in addition to receiving course-specific training.  It is also worth noting that peer leaders should train and learn with cohorts.  Therefore, a project coordinator would have been a useful component of the project.  (2)   Active learning strategies require well-organized and well-planned activities.  Therefore, faculty implementing these strategies in their courses must receive proper training and continue to make improvements so that they become more comfortable and more effective at implementing these strategies.  This is important as some faculty have identified time constraints as a challenge when incorporating active learning in their courses.  The project impacted over 800 students, mostly underrepresented, 10 faculty participants, and 10 peer leaders.  Faculty participants plan to continue to use the active learning strategies that they developed and implemented during this project due to the success that they have observed in their courses.  Based upon the project meeting intended short-term and mid-term outcomes and faculty dedicated to continuing to use active learning strategies, it is highly likely that the project will lead to the ultimate goal of producing a better prepared STEM workforce.
