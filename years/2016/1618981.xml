<AbstractNarration>"Divide and conquer," a time-honored technique in computer science and&lt;br/&gt;mathematics, partitions a problem into smaller pieces to make it&lt;br/&gt;easier to solve. This project deepens the study of partitioning in two&lt;br/&gt;directions, both in the context of semi-algebraic geometry -- which is&lt;br/&gt;the study of geometric and topological properties of sets defined by&lt;br/&gt;real polynomial equalities and inequalities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first direction is to systematize polynomial partitioning, which&lt;br/&gt;has recently become a powerful tool capable of tackling many&lt;br/&gt;long-standing open questions in the area of incidence geometry. In&lt;br/&gt;computational geometry, the space or sets being partitioned are often&lt;br/&gt;complex but partitioning is by simple objects: splitting by planes or&lt;br/&gt;cutting into trapezoids.  Polynomial partitioning allows high degree&lt;br/&gt;cutting polynomials, necessitating more precise degree-based upper&lt;br/&gt;bounds on the topology of semi-algebraic sets and real varieties than&lt;br/&gt;the ones known before, and leading to a very fruitful interaction&lt;br/&gt;between the fields of real algebraic geometry and discrete geometry.&lt;br/&gt;The PI will develop new techniques in semi-algebraic geometry to meet&lt;br/&gt;the new demands imposed on the field by the developments in discrete&lt;br/&gt;geometry, and develop a new theory of polynomial partitioning that can&lt;br/&gt;systematize their study and lead to new applications as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The second is to generalize quantitative and algorithmic&lt;br/&gt;semi-algebraic geometry to a much more general and geometric setting&lt;br/&gt;-- the category of constructible sheaves.  Constructible sheaves come&lt;br/&gt;with an underlying semi-algebraic partition (on whose elements the&lt;br/&gt;stalks of the sheaf are locally constant).  Kashiwara and Schapira&lt;br/&gt;proved a fundamental theorem on the stability of this category under&lt;br/&gt;the six standard sheaf operations (analogous to Tarski-Seidenberg&lt;br/&gt;principle for semi-algebraic sets). The PI will study the quantitative&lt;br/&gt;and algorithmic questions related to constructible sheaves. The&lt;br/&gt;complexity upper bounds and algorithmic results would have wide&lt;br/&gt;applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will have impact in several areas of mathematics and&lt;br/&gt;computation -- including quantitative and algorithmic semi-algebraic&lt;br/&gt;geometry, discrete and computational geometry, computational&lt;br/&gt;complexity theory and quantitative study of the solutions to linear&lt;br/&gt;systems of partial differential equations.  The project will train a&lt;br/&gt;graduate student and a postdoctoral researcher in quantitative and&lt;br/&gt;algorithmic real algebraic geometry and its modern applications.</AbstractNarration>

Since semi-algebraic  sets are ubiquitous in real life (inside and outside of mathematics)  study of their quantitative and algorithmic properties are increasing every day. Unfortunately, in general the basic algorithmic problems in semi-algebraic geometry tend to have high complexity  -- to solve them exactly usually require algorithms whose complexity in the worst case is singly exponential in the dimension. This is related to the fact that semi-algebraic sets while being easy to define can become topologically  complicated quite quickly. This feature sometimes restrict the application of the rich algorithmic theory of semi-algebraic sets and it is thus important to concentrate on special situations of practical relevance where the complexity is better controlled.   The results obtained during this project has led to deepening of our understanding of the topological complexities of semi-algebraic sets as well as to the development of more efficient algorithms for computing topological as well as representation-theoretic invariants of semi-algebraic sets. In particular, semi-algebraic sets  defined by symmetric polynomials were studied from the topological, representation-theoretic,  as well as  algorithmic viewpoints.  Several new results were obtained.  We obtained an  algorithm with polynomial complexity  for computing the equivariant Betti numbers of such sets (joint work with C. Riener).  We also obtained very general bounds on the Betti numbers of semi-algebraic sets unifying several different  prior results under a single framework (joint work with A. Rizzie).

Finally, we initiated the study of complexity in a categorical  setting and proved several results on functor complexity (joint work with Umut Isik). This work can potentially unify different notions of  "complexity" -- such as Turing complexity, Blum-Shub-Smale complexity etc. under a single categorical framework, and provide categorical analogs for some of the basic open problems in complexity theory (such as P vs NP).   The results obtained in this project lie at the boundary of real algebraic geometry, symbolic algorithms, model theory, complexity theory  and combinatorics -- and have the potential to have impact on each of these fields.
