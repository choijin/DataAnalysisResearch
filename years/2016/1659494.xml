<AbstractNarration>This award supports a new Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site at the University of Utah. The site will support eight students for ten weeks of summer research in topics in Physics and Astronomy.  The Department of Physics and Astronomy at the University of Utah currently offers a wide variety of research opportunities and has a history of developing and managing high-quality, cohort-based summer research programs both for its own students and those visiting from other institutions. The objectives of the University of Utah Physics and Astronomy REU site program are to:&lt;br/&gt;1. engage students in full-time active research;&lt;br/&gt;2. provide professional development opportunities for students and mentors;&lt;br/&gt;3. motivate students towards science and STEM careers by constructing an engaging, inclusive, and supportive cohort experience; and&lt;br/&gt;4. improve students' science literacy and oral and written communication skills.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Students who participate in this site will engage in a variety of activities that encompass: 1) rigorous and diverse research projects; 2) professional and career development workshops; 3) introduction into the scientific community culture; 4) community building; and 5) personalized mentorship.  Students may also find research projects at Telescope Array (Delta, UT); VERITAS (Tucson, AZ); Frisco Peak Observatory (Milford, UT); and HAWC (Sierra Negra, MX).</AbstractNarration>

Physics and Astronomy Research Experiences for Undergraduates site were to engage undergraduate students from around the country in full-time active research; provide professional development opportunities for students and mentors; motivate students towards science and STEM careers by constructing an engaging, inclusive, and supportive cohort experience; and improve students? science literacy and oral and written communication skills.&nbsp; The program fully or partially supported a total of 32 students over 4 years, including a fully remote cohort in the Summer of 2020.&nbsp; These students all worked closely with faculty mentors, as well as graduate students and postdoctoral fellows, to pursue state-of-the art research projects across multiple sub-disciplines including astronomy, astrophysics, biophysics, condensed matter physics, particle physics, and physics education.&nbsp; All students presented their work at an end-of-summer research symposium that typically features about 150 undergraduate presenters each summer, and some presented their work at additional research conferences after the summer program concluded.&nbsp; Several of the students served as co-authors on articles published in scientific journals, and a few students are still working on manuscripts with their mentors.&nbsp; All students engaged in various professional development workshops during the program, including GRE preparation, poster and oral presentations, research ethics, data management, writing abstracts, literature reviews, citation management, and resumes &amp; personal Statements.&nbsp; All students participated in a Graduate and Professional School Admissions Mini Expo, which included sessions on writing a personal statement, building a resume/CV, various career opportunities in science, how to apply to graduate school, how to ask for letters of recommendation, and developing strong interview skills.&nbsp; The program achieved very diverse cohorts in terms of student demographics and institution types.&nbsp; For example, of the 32 students, 17 identified as female, 14 were from primarily undergraduate institutions with limited access to research opportunities, and 8 self-identified as people of color.&nbsp; All of the students from these cohorts who have graduated have been accepted to post-graduate programs.</span></span></p><br> <p>
