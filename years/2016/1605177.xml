<AbstractNarration>1605177&lt;br/&gt;Nerenberg&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is recognized in environmental technology and processes that bacterial biofilms play an important role. However, the understanding of how they are formed, their mechanical strength, and, in many cases, their contribution to actual changes which are observed in the environment, are poorly understood. To gain a better understanding of bacterial biofilms, this research will characterize the mechanical properties of biofilms, especially counter-diffusional biofilms relevant to the ZeeLung Membrane Aerated Biofilm Reactor from GE Power and Water, to allow prediction of biofilm deformation and detachment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Biofilm deformation and detachment remains a black box, where there are no reliable and mechanistic means to predict them. Also, few researchers have considered the viscoelastic behavior of biofilms. This research will determine the mechanical properties of heterotrophic, nitrifying, and combined heterotrophic and nitrifying biofilms, considering their viscoelastic behavior. It uses a unique, in-situ micro-scale technique to assess the spatial distribution of mechanical properties. In addition to studying pure-culture biofilms, this study will be the first to address the mechanical properties of a co-culture biofilm, where a known nitrifier and heterotrophs co-exist. The pure and co-culture results will be compared with an environmental biofilm at GE. The composition of the extracellular polymeric substance matrix will be determined in-situ and related to mechanical properties. The properties will be assessed as a function of time and shear stress, and also will assess the effect of an extracellular polymeric substance disruptor on mechanical properties. This is the first research to address the micro-scale spatial variability of biofilms relevant to environmental systems. It will also address a special type of tubular, sheath structure observed in heterotrophic, counter-diffusional biofilms, leading to dense, gelatinous biofilms. The research will develop novel information on the spatial and temporal variation of mechanical properties in biofilms under several environmentally relevant conditions, and will relate these properties to extracellular polymeric substance  characteristics. It also will use a novel phase-field model to predict deformation and detachment, and the impact of spatial heterogeneity. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will train one doctoral student, several undergraduate researchers and research experiences for undergraduate students, and partially support a post-doctoral researcher. It will provide an on-site experience at GE for a grad student or post-doc. Workshops between Notre Dame and GE will disseminate knowledge on biofilm research and process development at a global membrane process company, and promote local workforce development.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Biofilms are aggregates of microorganisms in a self-produced, slim-like matrix.  They are ubiquitous in natural, clinical, and engineered systems, and are considered the most common form of microbial growth. Biofilms can be beneficial, as in engineered biotreatment systems, or detrimental, as membrane fouling, dental plaque, and human infections.  Cell killing can temporarily suspend biofilm growth, but does not remove the fouling. It therefore is important to remove detrimental biofilms.  For this, a better understanding of their mechanical properties is needed.  Biofilms behave as complex viscoelastic materials, and they are hard to characterize mechanically.  Even when characterized, there are few tools that can predict biofilm deformation and detachment.  The goal of this research was explore ways to better characterize biofilm mechanical behavior, and to develop a mathematical model that can help predict biofilm deformation and detachment.  This could help researchers develop better strategies to manage biofilms.  We used two tools to study the mechanical properties of biofilms: magnetic tweezers and shear rheometry.  Magnetic tweezers can provide the spatial distribution of mechanical properties within a biofilm, but require special capillary flow cells, with addition of fluorescently-tagged magnetic particles, and a specialized microscope. Shear rheometry is much simpler, but only provides averaged parameters, and usually requires the biofilm sample to be removed from its native environment. Using both tools, we explored the mechanical properties of synthetic biofilms, pure culture biofilms, and mixed culture, biofilms growing in an engineered bioreactor.  We showed that the mechanical properties can be highly spatially variable within the biofilm, and thus bulk assays, such as shear rheometry, may not be adequate in some cases.   We also developed a phase field (PF) model that incorporates mechanical properties and predicts biofilm deformation and detachment under fluid flow. The mechanical properties, determined by shear rheometry, were used as inputs for the model, and the model was validated by experimentally monitoring biofilm deformation under fluid flow using optical coherence tomography (OCT). This is the first time a PF model was developed and validated experimentally.  We showed that the PF model that can accurately predict biofilm deformation, if the mechanical properties are known.  This research provides experimental data on the mechanical properties of biofilms, and also a novel modeling tool that can predict biofilm deformation and detachment.  This research can enable new research on the promotion of beneficial biofilms, and removal of detrimental ones.
