<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is a significant increase in the efficiency of hospital procedure scheduling.  The project analyzes the sources of inefficiencies in the planning, staffing, coordination, and execution of the various phases of surgeries and associated procedures.  Preliminary analysis of hospital data shows that the throughput of surgical units can be increased significantly with the same staffing while reducing the delays and improving the working conditions of the personnel. Delays in obtaining and communicating updates on the status of surgeries and on actions that personnel should perform are major causes of inefficiency, as is the randomness of the duration of tasks. We expect the methodology to be widely applicable to the coordination of teams in services and transportation industries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project is based on a machine learning approach to the optimization of real-time messaging tuned using actual hospital data. The technical novelty is a formulation of the real-time policies that incorporates the messages between the main actors and enables the use of machine learning to optimize the policies.  The approach combines new parametric models of real-time scheduling, stochastic gradient descent, and infinitesimal perturbation analysis. In this formulation, perturbation analysis computes the gradient of the objective function with respect to the timing of messages and results in an efficient algorithm.  The algorithm discovers the best time to send messages to optimize a combination of operating room efficiency and patient waiting times.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The initial goal of our project was to test the benefits of a real-time update system for the scheduling of tasks in a hospital.  Our starting hypothesis was that resources are wasted because of sub-optimal corrective actions when facing delays, cancellations, emergencies, or other unforeseen events.  For instance, an operating room may become idle when a surgery is cancelled or when an earlier surgery completes ahead of schedule. Also, a surgeon may face a long delay if the operating room she is waiting for is occupied longer than planned.  We believed that real-time tracking of events combined with optimized schedule adjustments and efficient notifications would improve resource utilizations and the operations both for the personnel and for the patients.  These improvements would result in increased efficiency, more revenues for the hospital, less stress and frustration for the personnel, and greater patient satisfaction.     As we interviewed over one hundred doctors, nurses, and hospital administrators to test our hypotheses, we discovered that many obstacles impede the implementation of our vision.  The key obstacle is that it requires a modification of the workflow of the personnel.  For instance, nurses would have to signal specific events as they occur, and they would have to respond to notifications.       Because of these impediments, we refocused our work on improvements of staffing.  The importance of this issue became clear through our numerous discussions with hospital staff. The problem is two-fold: 1) determining suitable shift times and their staffing levels; 2) assigning the personnel to these shifts.  For the first aspect, we developed a tool that analyzes the workload over previous months and we combine that analysis with an optimization algorithm that identifies the optimal shifts.  For the second aspect, we designed a matching algorithm that captures the complex staffing constraints and personnel preferences and determines who should be working when.  Our system offers an interface that the manager uses to adjust the shifts that our system computes to reflect novel information about specific days. The system also provides an interface that the nurses use to specify their schedule preferences and time off.     At the outset, we realized that to be adopted, a staffing system has to deliver a complete staffing that respects all the constraints.  A partial solution that requires many adjustments would not be acceptable.  This realization implied the necessity of understanding all the details of the real-world constraints.  To achieve this understanding, we chose to focus our development to a specific department in one hospital.  We were fortunate to find collaborators who believed that we could improve their complex operations and who generously engaged in detailed meetings to discuss the many aspects of the problem.     Our system is currently being used for the recovery rooms (PACUs) of UCSF Benioff Children?s Hospital in Oakland, California.  The initial findings are that the staffing optimization enables the hospital to better match the staffing to the workload.  This results in savings but also in improved work satisfaction as the periods of overload are greatly reduced and the nurse preferences are more detailed and are respected by the assignment algorithm. As we develop extensions of the system to cover other departments of the hospital, we expect our impact to become even more significant.
