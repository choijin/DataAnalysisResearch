<AbstractNarration>This REU Site award to the University of Pittsburgh, located in Pittsburgh, PA, will support the training of 10 students for 10 weeks during the summers of 2017-2020. This Training and Experimentation in Computational Biology (TECBio) REU program is housed in the Department of Computational and Systems Biology and focuses on multiscale modeling, simulation, and systems-level analyses for biological discovery. TECBio students can expect a challenging and fulfilling experience that prepares them for graduate school and other STEM careers. Rising sophomores, juniors and seniors from the life, physical, and computer sciences and engineering are encouraged to apply. TECBio students pick from 40 diverse research mentors in five major research areas. Students will also participate in a journal club, attend research and career seminars, learn the ethical and responsible conduct of research, present their work at a Pittsburgh-wide symposium, participate in a number of cohort-building and networking events, and experience the various social and cultural activities available in Pittsburgh.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;A total of 40 students, primarily from schools with limited research opportunities and/or underrepresented backgrounds, will be trained during this award cycle. TECBio students will interact with students from other programs in and around campus. Students will work on their own research projects, hone their scientific communication skills, and take part in a tiered mentoring and training framework offering multiple mentorship opportunities and the chance to be a mentor for younger scientists. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TECBio students will also enhance the program through their feedback. A common web-based assessment tool used by all REU Site programs funded by the Division of Biological Infrastructure will be used to determine the effectiveness of the training program. Following completion of the program, TECBio alumni will receive continued mentoring by program directors and mentors, who will track and maintain contact with students to help them establish their careers. Students will be asked to respond to an automatic email sent via the NSF reporting system. More information about the program can be found at www.tecbioreu.pitt.edu, or by contacting the PI (Dr. Joseph C. Ayoob, jayoob@pitt.edu), the co-PI (Dr. Chakra Chennubhotla, chakracs@pitt.edu), or the Program Coordinator (Ms. Leah Russell, llr19@pitt.edu).</AbstractNarration>

As one of the ?New Biologies?, Computational Biology uses quantitative approaches and the power of computing to answer questions in many fields of science. Our TECBio program reaches out to students from a wide range of academic disciplines, from ethnic and racial backgrounds underrepresented in the sciences, and from schools with limited research opportunities to give them a primary research and training experience in this highly interdisciplinary field. Almost 90% of the 115 NSF-funded students who have gone through our program over the past 11 years were from either of the aforementioned groups, with 43% hailing from underrepresented groups.&nbsp; These students were all integrated into our department?s ?tiered mentoring? framework, which both gave them access to a team of mentors and provided them with the opportunity to mentor younger scientists. In addition to performing cutting-edge computational research in bioimage analysis, genomics, structural biology, and systems biology, TECBio students also participated in other academic and professional development enrichment activities, such as introductory classes in computational biology, mentee training workshops, research and career seminars, responsible conduct of research training, and numerous writing and presenting opportunities, all of which were geared to help prepare our students for success in graduate school and other STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics)-related careers. To this end, the overwhelming majority (over 85%) of our program alumni who have completed their undergraduate degree have gone on to pursue further education and careers in STEM fields. The majority of these students (62% of all alumni) have enrolled in graduate programs. Our students have also distinguished themselves through the research contributions that they have made through their projects?students made contributions to 25 research papers and conference proceedings?as well as by garnering research fellowships after the program?9 won the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship with 3 Honorable Mentions. &nbsp;We are encouraged by the success of our program in helping to prepare the next generation of scientists, science educators, and ambassadors for science. The TECBio REU @ Pitt looks forward to continuing our efforts to equip tomorrow?s scientific leaders who will be at the forefront of interdisciplinary scientific research and continue to push the edge of discovery.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 06/25/2021<br>      Modified by: Joseph&nbsp;C&nbsp;Ayoob</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1659611/1659611_10473250_1624592545425_1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1659611/1659611_10473250_1624592545425_1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="TECBio REU @ Pitt students - 2018"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1659611/1659611_10473250_1624592545425_1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="TECBio REU @ Pitt students - 2018"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">2018 TECBio REU @ Pitt students in their self-designed program T-shirts.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Adam Kohlhaas</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Joseph&nbsp;C&nbsp;Ayoob</div> <div class="imageTitle">TECBio REU @ Pitt students - 2018</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1659611/1659611_10473250_1624592560638_2--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1659611/1659611_10473250_1624592560638_2--rgov-800width.jpg" title="2020 TECBio REU @ Pitt students using VR"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1659611/1659611_10473250_1624592560638_2--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="2020 TECBio REU @ Pitt students using VR"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">2020 TECBio REU @ Pitt students participating in a research seminar in Virtual Reality.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Adam Kohlhaas</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Joseph&nbsp;C&nbsp;Ayoob</div> <div class="imageTitle">2020 TECBio REU @ Pitt students using VR</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1659611/1659611_10473250_1624592929343_3--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1659611/1659611_10473250_1624592929343_3--rgov-800width.jpg" title="2020 TECies in VR"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1659611/1659611_10473250_1624592929343_3--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="2020 TECies in VR"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Virtual Reality avatars of TECBio REU @ Pitt 2020 students participating in a Virtual Reality Poster Session.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Adam Kohlhaas</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Joseph&nbsp;C&nbsp;Ayoob</div> <div class="imageTitle">2020 TECies in VR</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1659611/1659611_10473250_1624593017144_4--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1659611/1659611_10473250_1624593017144_4--rgov-800width.jpg" title="2020 TECies discussing a poster in VR"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1659611/1659611_10473250_1624593017144_4--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="2020 TECies discussing a poster in VR"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">TECBio REU @ Pitt 2020 students discussing a poster in our Virtual Reality Poster Session.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Adam Kohlhaas</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Joseph&nbsp;C&nbsp;Ayoob</div> <div class="imageTitle">2020 TECies discussing a poster in VR</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1659611/1659611_10473250_1624593119813_5--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1659611/1659611_10473250_1624593119813_5--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Updated TECBio REU @ Pitt logo"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1659611/1659611_10473250_1624593119813_5--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Updated TECBio REU @ Pitt logo"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">An updated version of our program logo that features the TECBio Biomouse, which embodies the fusion of the computational and life sciences.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Adam Kohlhaas</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Joseph&nbsp;C&nbsp;Ayoob</div> <div class="imageTitle">Updated TECBio REU @ Pitt logo</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
