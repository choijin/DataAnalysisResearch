<AbstractNarration>Today, water resources are threatened by a complex mixture of chemical pollutants, many of which are poorly removed by traditional water and wastewater treatment technologies. These include potent pharmaceutical classes including synthetic steroids, whose bioactivity can persist in the environment despite their transformation through natural and engineered processes. In this project funded by the Environmental Chemical Sciences Program of the Chemistry Division at the National Science Foundation, a collaborative team of researchers at the University of Iowa, University of Washington at Tacoma and Seattle, University of California at San Diego, and Stony Brook University develops a predictive framework to help catalyze more robust water regulations and improved chemical risk assessment. Ultimately, outcomes of this project moves society toward more safe and sustainable water supplies, particularly as society becomes more reliant on reuse of treated wastewater to bridge the widening gap in supply and demand. The broader impacts of this work include advancing undergraduate education by enabling the participation of under-represented groups in research activities, integrating modern computational tools into student learning, and promoting scientific literacy in non-technical audiences through general education coursework development.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This work represents a new paradigm in water quality management. Focusing on a widely utilized abiotic treatment process, chlorination, and ubiquitous but understudied pollutant classes, potent synthetic progestins and glucocorticoids, this project will develop a high-throughput framework built upon computational and experimental methods for the a priori prediction of high risk, bioactive transformation products. This approach integrates (i) theoretical calculations to identify probable chlorination products using descriptors for both parent (partial charges, oxidation potentials) and likely product (thermodynamic stability) species. (ii) Potential product species are prioritized based on bioactivity (i.e., risk) using high throughput virtual ligand screening.  Once identified, formation and yield of high risk products are evaluated (iii) in bench-scale experiments across a range of chlorination conditions and (iv) via high resolution mass spectrometric detection in wastewaters and receiving waters. Research outcomes ensures that when emerging pollutant classes are inevitably regulated, a more holistic approach is available that also addresses risks posed by their bioactive products. This collaborative project provides transdisciplinary training of 2 graduate students, 2 postdocs, and several undergraduates at the interface of environmental chemistry, computational chemistry, and biochemistry.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Over the course of this project, we have used computational modeling to predict what happens when steroids found in wastewater are exposed to the chlorination process common in wastewater treatment plants.  The steroids studied include hormones used in the farm industry to control estrus (altrenogest) or promote growth (trenbolone) and steroids commonly prescribed for human use for birth control (gestodene, dienogest), as anti-inflammatories (cortisone, prednisone) or to affect primary sex traits (testosterone).  These steroids, and many others, are not fully metabolized and find their way into wastewater.  Steroids such as those in this study are very potent, so even very small amounts found in drinking water could pose a public health risk.  It is essential that we understand what happens to the steroids during the wastewater treatment process.  If these steroids survive the process intact, they could remain in drinking water supplies and be unknowingly consumed by billions of people and animals around the world. Even at very low doses, this could lead to unintended consequences.  One of the primary treatment processes for wastewater is chlorination.  The primary purpose of chlorination is to kill microbes and pathogens, but the chlorinating agents used can also react with molecules such as steroids.  Complete reaction between chlorine and steroids could destroy the steroids, removing the threat of inadvertent consumption.  However, incomplete reaction could lead to one or more chlorine atoms being incorporated into the steroid molecules, leaving the steroids modified but otherwise intact.  This could make the situation worse since organic molecules (such as steroids) containing chlorine atoms can be carcinogenic.  If chlorinated steroids survive the wastewater treatment process and make their way into the drinking water supply, consumption could pose a significant long-term risk.  Through our computational modeling, we have discovered that testosterone, gestodene, prednisone and cortisone are resistant to chlorination under the conditions typical of a wastewater treatment plant.  These four steroids will survive the chlorination process largely intact.  In contrast, altreonogest, dienogest and trenbolone are all predicted to partially react with chlorine and incorporate one of more chlorine atoms into their structures, yielding potential carcinogens.  In other words, all of the studied steroids are predicted to survive the chlorination process without being completely destroyed.  It is important to emphasize that we did not model any of the other processes used in wastewater treatment as part of this study.  Even if these steroids survive the chlorination process, they may be destroyed by other processes.  Additional studies would be required to understand the true fate of steroids during wastewater treatment.  Nevertheless, this study shows that steroids found in wastewater may pose a lingering health risk even after wastewater treatment.  More work must be done to establish to true severity of this risk.  We believe that the findings from this study are generally applicable to many pharmaceuticals found in our wastewater, including not just other steroids, but also commonly used antibiotics and analgesics.  Understanding this chemistry and its ramifications has a broad impact on billions of people around the world.  Future studies should explore the chemistry of these other pharmaceutical agents.  To understand the complete ramifications of our findings, other scientists should look for our predicted products in water as it exits treatment plants, and then do studies to determine whether our predicted products pose an actual health risk or not.  This study has provided but one piece of the puzzle.  Only by exploring the entire wastewater treatment process will we see the complete picture.
