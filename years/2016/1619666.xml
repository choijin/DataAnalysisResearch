<AbstractNarration>Non-Technical Description:&lt;br/&gt;Given the ever-increasing pace of innovation in the 21st century, a workshop to identify emerging areas in ceramic and glass science is warranted.  A two-and-a-half-day forum brings together 45 researchers in glass and ceramic materials to share both expertise and vision to define outstanding materials challenges. In preparation for the meeting, participants suggest and evaluate discussion topics on-line to outline the meeting agenda.  In order to ensure that the workshop report has the most comprehensive influence in and beyond the ceramics community, the Journal of the American Ceramic Society, one of the top ceramic science journals, has agreed to publish the workshop report, as an open access publication. The workshop will be held in the D.C. area from Sept. 12-14, 2016. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Details:&lt;br/&gt;The Workshop on Emerging Opportunities in Ceramic and Glass Science focuses on the most recent research ideas in four material classes: amorphous materials, oxides, non-oxides, and composites. Based upon presentations and discussion by 45 materials professionals, critical research challenges are defined. The role of computational techniques for material design and property prediction is highlighted. In addition, strategies of data mining are explored as a tool for identifying new areas of study and opportunities for crosscutting research. Participants for the workshop are selected from academia, industry and national laboratories to provide the broadest possible input for identifying emerging opportunities in ceramic and glass science.  These include underrepresented groups and a balance of participants over all career stages. Among the 45 are researchers from outside the materials discipline included to highlight crosscutting opportunities. The workshop report, slated for publication in the Journal of the American Ceramic Society, provides the Ceramics Program and related programs within the NSF's Division of Materials Research with a compendium of needs, opportunities and activities in ceramic and glass science.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ More than 40 glass and ceramic science experts met in September 2016 at a National Science Foundation-sponsored workshop to identify emerging research challenges and opportunities in ceramic and glass science. Eight research challenges were selected by consensus during workshop discussions, each describing the fundamental science required to advance the basic understanding of ceramics and glasses. The challenges are (a) Ceramic processing through programmable design and assembly, such as 3D printing; (b) The defect genome, which comprises understanding, characterizing, and predicting defects across time and length scales; (c) Functionalizing such defects for unprecedented properties; (d) Defining structure-property relations in two-dimensional ceramics; (e) Discovery and design strategies for ceramics in extreme environments of temperature, pressure, or radiation flux; (f) Behavior of multi-material systems in extreme environments; (g) Understanding and exploiting glasses and melts under extreme conditions; and (h) Rational design of functional glasses guided by predictive modeling. The challenges are described in detail in the open-access workshop report published by the Journal of the American Ceramic Society in May 2017. The report proved to be one of the most downloaded papers from this journal in 2018, and was used, in part, to inform the recent National Academies of Science, Engineering and Medicine Decadal Survey on Frontiers of Materials Research. It is anticipated that the reported challenges will provide inspiration for research in the ceramic and glass communities, enabling progress in multiple sectors including energy, environment, manufacturing, security, and health care.  Two independent follow-on meetings in 2018, the International Symposium for Applied Ferroelectrics and the Gordon Research Conference on Solid State Studies in Ceramics, provided forums for continued discussion on emerging research challenges. Their technical programs, consistent with the scope of the original workshop, afforded opportunities for training and professional development of women, underrepresented minorities and other students and young professionals in a conference setting.
