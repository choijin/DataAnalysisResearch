<AbstractNarration>This is a conference organized by the American Psychological Association. It is a convening of 30 assessment experts in psychology meeting in a workshop format to identify best practices in assessment of the undergraduate psychology major. These assessment experts are being drawn from both associate and baccalaureate degree-granting psychology programs. Their primary focus will be on identifying evidence-based assessments.  Their secondary focus is the development of a plan for disseminating these best practices and innovations to undergraduate psychology programs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The American Psychological Association has promulgated goals and learning outcomes for the psychology major for more than a decade. However, there have been only modest efforts to provide evidence-based assessment practices. This project will align improved assessment tools with the carefully laid out standards of performance embodied in the APA Guidelines 2.0, written in 2013.  These Guidelines specify five major goals of the psychology major, including scientific inquiry and critical thinking. These guidelines provide a modern foundation for department planning at the associate and baccalaureate level.</AbstractNarration>

The first outcome is the development of<strong> Project Assessment </strong>which is a beta site for testing and reviewing assessment tools and practices created during APA SNAP.&nbsp; These assessment tools and practices are aligned with the <em>APA Guidelines for the Undergraduate Major in Psychology</em> (2013) (herein referred to as <em>Guidelines 2.0</em>). Findings from the 2014 Undergraduate Study in Psychology reveal that 88% of associate programs and 94% of baccalaureate programs in psychology are aware of <em>Guidelines 2.0</em>&nbsp; (Norcross, J.C., Hailstorks, R., Aiken, L. S., Pfund, R.A., Stamm, K.E., &amp; Christidis, P., 2016). This outcome is significant in that undergraduate psychology programs will be able to access and review assessment tools to determine what students know and can do at the foundation level and at the completion of the undergraduate degree in psychology.</p> <p>The second major outcome of APA SNAP is the community of practice that evolved from the participants at APA SNAP who are psychology educators and assessment experts. Forty-five participants from associate and baccalaureate degree granting institutions met for three days at the University of Wisconsin-Green Bay to share, create, and review best practices in assessing the five learning goals and outcomes&nbsp;outlined in <em>Guidelines 2.0. </em>APA SNAP participants are continuing to review and adapt these assessment tools for use by undergraduate psychology teachers and programs. These participants have been successful in disseminating the results of APA SNAP at local, regional, and national meetings and teaching conferences.</p> <p>The third major outcome of APA SNAP is the recognition of the need for a national summit on introductory psychology to enhance the teaching, learning, and assessment of approximately 1.5 million students enrolled in this course annually. While several of the assessment tools created during APA SNAP address specific goals and learning outcomes, the primary focus of this summit was not on the introductory psychology course. According to the 2016 Undergraduate Study in Psychology survey, the introductory psychology course serves multiple purposes--an introduction to the major, a general education requirement, and as a vehicle for increasing the public's understanding of psychology as a science (Pfund, R.A., Norcross, J.C., Hailstorks, R., Stamm, K.E., &amp; Christidis, P, 2017). In spite of the importance of the introductory course, APA has not identified course learning outcomes for this course. It would serve the discipline well to have a national summit to develop the core learning outcomes for introductory psychology, create assessment tools to align with these outcomes, and to share strategies for teaching scientific literacy in this course.&nbsp; Many of the students enrolled in introductory psychology course may never take another science course during their undergraduate studies.</p> <p><strong>Merit of the Proposed Activity</strong></p> <p>APA SNAP served as an important initiative for undergraduate psychology teachers and programs.

Broader Impact of Proposed Activity  Project Assessment will be a valuable resource for psychology faculty and program chairs at more than 3,500 accredited associate and baccalaureate degree granting institutions; it may also have an impact on other STEM disciplines as they seek to assess critical thinking and scientific literacy among their undergraduate majors.  Project Assessment will assist APA in providing a portrait of what students know and can do through an undergraduate education in psychology. References American Psychological Association. (2013).
