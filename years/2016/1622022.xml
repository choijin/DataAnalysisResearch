<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to improve imaging systems used in surveying and surveillance. Specifically, the project intends to overcome the long range resolution problems created by air turbulence which is the primary limitation on resolution at long distances. The project anticipates creating a light weight, ultra-high resolution camera system deployable on land, sea and air drones to speed search &amp; rescue, identify crop diseases, improve oil and mineral exploration success, rapidly identify infrastructure problems and improve homeland security operations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses the limitations placed on long range imaging by air turbulence using a novel non-classical approach. Using sun as the light source, this camera may achieve a spatial resolution of 200 micrometers for any object on Earth, which is insignificant for short distance imaging, however, taking a picture of a target at 10-kilometer, a classic camera must have a lens of 90-meter diameter to achieve a theoretical 200-micrometer resolution. Thus, the turbulence free camera will provide "panoramic" photographs with micron-level resolution at large distances. The research will convert a successful lab scale camera system performing non-classical imaging into a fully functional prototype for use in real world environments.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The aim of Tarsier Optics? NSF Phase I SBIR program was to prove that a quantum camera, a camera based on quantum optics, could be reduced to practice using a pixelated detector in a size, weight and power form factor that could form the basis of a commercially viable product.  We were successful in our goal and constructed a camera utilizing two 127 x 127 pixel high speed arrays that we operated in a real world environment.  The theory was proven at UMBC using a single pixel moved by hand; each image took hours to generate.   From start to finish under the program, Tarsier identified an appropriate detector, built a system on a lab bench to validate the detector using laser light and then white light- something which had not be done before, and used the lessons learned to construct a camera that could operate off of the bench in a real world environment.  The advantage of quantum imaging is that the resulting images are both heat haze turbulence free and achieve a higher resolution image relative to the classical image- quantum imaging is able to go beyond the limitations of classical optics, set by the Rayleigh limit.  Heat haze turbulence is the major impediment to long distance imaging, and the cost of a system is driven by the need for large optics to obtain high resolution images.  With our camera, we are able to shrink the optics, driving down the cost of long distance imaging system, while simultaneously overcoming the turbulence limitation.  The merits of the camera are two fold- on the level of pure curiosity we showed that quantum imaging is possible, and solved a problem many of our customers had given up on solving.  On a practical level, our camera will allow for striking long distance images, whether from satellites looking down to capture images of our planet, from a ship looking to the horizon, or by driving down the cost of long range imaging systems to allow for greater coverage of our planet.  Our technology will revolutionize long distance imaging across sectors from remote sensing, defense applications, and consumer cameras.  The user will be able to see things that were previously blurred.  The images below highlight some of our results.  The first image is taken with a cell phone camera, the building of interest is the hotel in the middle one mile away.  The 2nd image is a zoomed in image of what we are trying to image, the "H" on the hotel.  The final two images show a classical image and a quantum image taken with our camera.  In the quantum image the H is visible.  As we scale to larger imaging arrays we expect to achieve HD images with our camera.
