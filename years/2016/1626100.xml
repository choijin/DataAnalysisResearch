<AbstractNarration>This award from the Major Research Instrumentation Program will fund the acquisition of a liquid chromatography/supercritical fluid/mass spectrometer (LC/SFC/MS) for both environmental and energy research at Lafayette College and proximate universities.  The LC/SFC/MS will enable the quantification and identification of components in these systems.  The enhanced understanding of each system would allow for the development of strategies to mediate negative implications and optimize for beneficial outcomes related to energy and environmental applications.  Additionally, the use of the LC/SFC/MS by neighboring institutions will further these goals and provide outreach opportunities for training in both the use of the instrument as well as green chemistry and engineering.  The instrumentation will be used by multiple groups for research and provide educational experiences for undergraduate student researchers.  When appropriate this instrumentation will also serve as an advanced teaching tool in multiple classes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The LC/SFC/MS is a combined system that will transform the research capabilities at Lafayette College.  The instrument is capable of high definition and accurate analyses with sufficient versatility for use in many applications. The unique combination of LC and SFC will make both reverse- and normal-phase separations accessible to our faculty and student researchers for a wide range of target analytes. MS coupled to a chromatography system is a robust technique possessing the ability to perform unknown molecule identification and compound isolation from complex matrices while providing ample sensitivity for quantification and identification of components with a wide spectrum of volatilities that range from polar to nonpolar.  This instrumentation will be used to advance high impact faculty-led research relevant to energy and environmental applications with specific projects as follows: 1) CO2 mediated reactions for selective and sustainable biodiesel production, 2) Selective extraction and recycling of valuable co-products from microalgae using green solvents, 3) Product identification and mechanism elucidation of atmospheric aerosol growth pathways, and 4) Understanding of the production and fate of thiols in freshwater systems.</AbstractNarration>

The instrument has so far directly led to data for the publication of 4 peer-reviewed research articles as well as a large number of presentations at  national conferences.  Regrading aerosol pathways, the papers have developed methods for the use of this instrument for atmospheric systems and identified heterocyclic products of reactions occurring between small carbonyls and ammonium salts ubiquitous in atmospheric water systems that can be difficult to separate with traditional methods.  Currently, the instrument is being used to study reaction products in previously unidentified carbonyl reaction systems as well as photolysis products of complex compounds often found in atmospheric particles.  In the biofuel research, the instrument was used to quantify intermediate and reaction products in a novel fashion that significantly reduced the sample prep time and potential errors.  One on-going study has quantified bio-based monomers that have been extracted from biomass for renewable polymer production and will be used for a funded collaborative grant.

The results of this research have been communicated via peer-reviewed publications and scientific conferences for information dissemination and to develop student communication skills.  Students are co-authors on all publications and have presented the majority of the conference presentations.  Within the PIs' reesearch groups, 13 students have used the instrument, with 9 of the students being women.
