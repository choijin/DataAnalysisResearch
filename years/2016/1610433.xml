<AbstractNarration>The objective of this project is to organize a workshop to formulate a long-term strategic vision for the discipline of Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE).  The workshop will be held on January 20-21, 2016, at Georgia Tech Hotel &amp; Conference Center in Atlanta, GA.  The PIs, comprising of five ECE department chairs, will invite ECE leaders from a diverse group of universities to formulate: (i) an intellectual vision for ECE for the next fifty years, (ii) an advocacy model to advocate the discipline to government decision-makers and industry, and (iii) a national branding effort to inspire students to pursue a career in ECE.  The resulting action plan from the workshop will be presented to the ECE Department Heads Association and disseminated to all ECE departments.  The intellectual merit of the project is that the workshop will lead to the development of a long-term strategic vision for ECE.  This vision will help shape future research and education in ECE departments across the nation.  An advocacy model will also be developed to increase the visibility of the discipline to government funding agencies and industry. The broader impacts of the project will come from the proposed branding effort to excite more students to pursue a career in ECE.  A larger and more diverse workforce in ECE will be produced from such an effort.  This will in turn create significant economic impact, as intellectual capital is steered toward future challenges for the nation.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The outcomes from this NSF Workshop on Vision, Branding, and Advocacy are several and significant.  First, a series of updates and sessions were held at the ECEDHA Annual Conference in March 2016 where the organizing team reported the acitivies and findings of the Workshop to the ECE community.  About 250 ECE department heads were engaged in the conversations. The ideas developed at the Workshop in the areas of Community-building and Branding were very well received by the ECE community.   There was strong consensus on both fronts:  the ECEDHA community strongly supported continuing the efforts in both Community and Branding.  Additional members from the ECEDHA community were added to each effort.  Second, it was decided that a planning grant to be submitted to NSF was the next step for the Community effort.  The planning grant is close to being finalized by the Community group and it is expected to be submitted to NSF by July 15, 2016.  This planning grant will cover approximately 6-12 months worth of activities toward the development and funding of a new effort to more significantly engage the ECE community is defining research and educational priorities and trajectories.  In the area of Branding, a number of efforts are on going, including the formation of a repository of media and material developed by member ECE departments.  The purpose of the repository is to make those resources more broadly available to the entire community.    Overall, the Workshop was a great success and it has catalyzed a number of very important discussions and actions that are strongly supported by the ECE community.
