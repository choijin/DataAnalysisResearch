<AbstractNarration>Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) provide support to design, implement, and assess strategies that can lead to comprehensive institutional efforts to increase the number of students receiving undergraduate degrees in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) and enhance the quality of their preparation by strengthening STEM education and research. This project seeks to establish the foundation for a program for "Data Science and Analytics Advancing STEM Education at North Carolina A&amp;T State University".  The goal of this integrated, multidisciplinary undergraduate program is to use data science and analytics to train undergraduate students in data science and analytics through computationally intensive tools and global research and education experiences. This project seeks to transform teaching and learning through evidence-based STEM gateway course reform.&lt;br/&gt;   &lt;br/&gt;Activities that are part of this project are: broadening student access and participation in data science education; strengthening undergraduate research experiences in data science; engaging faculty in research and scholarship; and developing an educational research pilot project. The project will be guided by an on-going evaluation and external and internal steering committees. Since African Americans are severely underrepresented in this field, the project can have great impact on diversifying the workforce.</AbstractNarration>

The ACE planning project has (1) offered numerous activities to increase student awareness of and interest in data science and analytics (DSA) education and careers; (2) hosted workshops, conferences, and retreats to encourage faculty collaboration and facilitate research development; (3) provided training on student success initiatives and teaching and learning scholarship; (4) provided students with valuable research experiences in DSA that have enhanced their research-related and communication skills; and (5) conducted an education research pilot study to better understand faculty members&rsquo; attitudes about engaging in scholarly activities related to teaching and learning. As a result of implementation of the planning project activities at NCA&amp;T, a statistical computing laboratory was configured and a statistics and analytics consulting center was established in the summer 2017, a statistical modeling course and a network science course were piloted in the spring 2017 with infusion of data science and analytics contents into the course instruction, and four capstone projects were tested in the spring 2017 with integration of big data analytics into senior design projects. Over the one-year funding period, eleven STEM undergraduate students were engaged as undergraduate research trainees and they produced ten project reports and made six poster presentations and nine oral presentations; six more STEM students were supported to participate in the 2017 ASA DataFest at Duke University. Four Data Science and Analytics Colloquium lectures were offered through the collaboration with the departments of Mathematics and Computer Science at NCA&amp;T. Two lunch and learn faculty development workshops were offered in the fall 2016, one regional STEM education research conference was hosted in partnership with NCA&amp;T STEM Center for Active Learning and NC PKAL Network, a one-day writing and research bootcamp was held in collaboration with NSF ADVADNCE IT program and STEM Center for Active Learning in the spring 2017; and these faculty development events attracted nearly 300 faculty members from NCA&amp;T and other 21 institutions and organizations. The planning project also conducted a preliminary education research study to explore faculty motivation for engaging in scholarly teaching and other high impact educational practices that purport to increase success of students from underrepresented groups in the STEM fields, and sixty-eight NCAT faculty members participated in the pilot study.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 12/22/2017<br>      Modified by: Guoqing&nbsp;Tang</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
