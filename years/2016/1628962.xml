<AbstractNarration>Soft magnetic materials have use in power conversion, conditioning, distribution, and generation technologies, including transportation (electric vehicles), renewable energy (solar inverters), and aerospace (power converters and inductors) sectors. The term "soft magnet" refers to a magnetic material that easily changes magnetic pole directions using small magnetic fields. With over 20 percent of all generated electricity in the US being consumed by industrial electric motor drives, a mere 1 percent improvement in energy efficiency would result in significant financial and environmental benefits. The magnetic components are a major source of energy loss in the above-mentioned applications, motivating the need for soft magnets with better energy efficiency. The design cycle for new soft magnetic materials has so far been informed mainly by direct human engineering intuition and historic knowledge and bias, with materials development occurring by trial-and-error approaches. This Designing Materials to Revolutionize and Engineer our Future (DMREF) award supports research to establish, demonstrate, and validate a computation-guided framework for accelerated discovery of new, better performing soft magnetic materials. This approach will use computational materials science tools to guide alloy design, with the synthesis and experimental validation of properties performed for down-selected new alloys.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recently, new alloys with microstructures comprised of an amorphous matrix and nanocrystalline grains have revolutionized advanced soft magnetic materials by enabling smaller hysteresis than has been achieved in traditional magnetic materials. This award supports research on the design of new alloys of this type using hierarchical, multi-scale, magneto-structural modeling with input from density functional theory calculations of structural and magnetic properties for single-crystals. Micromagnetic theory will provide the constitutive law for the continuum-level model for optimization of realistic microstructures consisting of an amorphous matrix surrounding nanocrystals. The continuum-level modeling represents a fundamental advancement that will provide much-needed insight into the interplay between the microstructure effects and the magnetic properties of the crystalline phase in determining small hysteresis, as well as an operational understanding of the applicability limits of the currently-prevalent random anisotropy model for coercivity. Structural considerations will be evaluated by continuum thermodynamics modeling and resulting magnetic performance characteristics will be evaluated by micromagnetics modeling. Down-selected alloy compositions - as optimized by these computational approaches - will be synthesized using rapid solidification with subsequent annealing and characterized using state-of-the-art structural and magnetic characterization tools.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit.  The main result of this research at the University of Minnesota was a predictive understanding of the origins of magnetic hysteresis in conventional magnetic materials.  Typical results can be seen in the attached figure showing the coercivity (i.e., width of the hysteresis loop) in the iron-nickel system based on fundamental material constants.  It can be seen that these results give an accurate prediction of the composition of Permalloy, which (by far) has the lowest hysteresis in this system.  The second figure shows a heat map of coercivity vs. the fundamental anisotriopy and magnetostriction constants.  We predict low hysteresis in materials with large magnetostriction, as long as it is tuned to match a corresponding value of anisotropy.  This goes against conventional wisdom and provides an unexpected new route to the discovery of new exceptionally soft magnetic materials.    This work can be considered as a definitive solution of two longstanding open problems in magnetism: 1) the "Permalloy Problem" and 2) the "Coercivity Paradox".   Conventional magnetic materials refers to typical magnetic materials; the other route to soft magnetism involving nanocrystalline materials was studied by our collaborators in this DMREF program.  With regard to the overall goals of DMREF, our results are in a form that can be directly used as the basis for alloy development programs.  Soft magnetic materials are a critical component in emerging technologies, such as in induction motors for electric automobiles and in the proposed all electric airplane.   Broader Aspects.  James participated in NanoDays at the Science Museum of Minnesota (not in 2020).  He also engaged 3 REU students in his group that participated in this research, and parrticipated in weekly group meetings. James also spoke about this research at several DMREF meetings organized for the applied mathematics community.
