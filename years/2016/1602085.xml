<AbstractNarration>This PFI: AIR Technology Translation project focuses on translating a robotic exoskeleton technology to deliver physical therapy to stroke subjects. Stroke is a leading cause of long-term disability in the US with nearly 80% of all stroke survivors experiencing some form of upper limb paralysis. Prior work by the PI has led to the development of a sophisticated exoskeleton for upper limb rehabilitation, called HARMONY. This PFI:AIR-TT award will support a novel controls framework for HARMONY that holds potential to improve the rehabilitation outcomes of not only stroke patients but also those with upper extremity neurological and musculoskeletal impairments. Currently there is only one robot commercially available for delivering physical therapy to the upper body. HARMONY offers improvements over this system through the following features: i) HARMONY can power entire shoulder movement; ii) HARMONY is bimanual, so it can simultaneously deliver therapy to both arms, which opens up possibilities for novel bimanual therapy; and iii) HARMONY allows for customization of the robot's force is at each joint which is critical for physical therapy. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will develop a new controls framework that ensures patient involvement and provides the appropriate amount of assistance so that subjects can complete the desired task. To achieve this objective, the following two specific aims will be pursued: Aim 1) Develop and test novel controls framework for multi-DOF, bimanual human-exoskeleton interactions and Aim 2) Demonstrate the efficacy of the adaptive controllers through experiments with healthy subjects. The team, involving two participants with business and commercialization expertise, will advance understanding of the business aspects, including IP, regulatory issues and market need, and will generate a commercialization plan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With mentoring from personnel with business and commercialization experience and the focus on developing a commercialization plan, this project will create a unique opportunity for educating the academic participants in the process of translating basic research into deployed technology. Successful completion of this project will aid in the development of the next generation of innovators and business leaders.</AbstractNarration>
