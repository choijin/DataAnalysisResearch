<AbstractNarration>With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation Program (MRI) and support from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program (CRIF), Professor Sarah Tolbert from the University of California Los Angeles and colleagues Louis Bouchard, Greg Carman, Jane Chang and Alexander Spokoyny have acquired a cryogen-free, state-of-the-art, superconducting quantum interference device (SQuID) magnetometer. This instrument consists of two superconductors separated by very thin insulating layers. Such a magnetometer is capable of detecting very small magnetic fields including those produced in living organisms. The magnetic flux is controlled by voltage variations using either direct (DC) or alternating voltages (AC). To be able to measure such small variations in magnetic fields, the instrument operates at very low temperatures achieved with the use of liquid helium, a limited resource. To avoid waste of such a valuable element, this instrument recycles the helium making it cryogen (coolant) free. This magnetometer is placed in a user facility and plays a role in the development of human resources in scientific research. It enriches the research experience of many graduate students, postdoctoral fellows and undergraduate researchers. It serves as a resource for users across the California State University System which is heavily populated by underrepresented students. In general, magnetometers have very diverse applications, ranging from locating submerged metal-containing ship wrecks and submarines to measuring Earth's magnetic fields to measuring tiny magnetic fields in the brain or heart.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The award is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels, especially in areas such as (a) understanding thermogravimetric materials for thermal energy harvesting; (b) studying magnetic states in condensed matter systems; (c) studying boron-rich clusters as building blocks for molecular and organic magnets; (d) exploring the use of multiferroic materials for spintronic devices; (e) studying single molecule magnets; (f) studying quantum anomalous half effect and topological superconductors, and (g) applying multiferroics as new materials.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Magnetic properties of new materials, such as coercivity (related to magnetic memory), saturation field, or magnetic-phase transition temperatures are figures of merit that determine the efficiency of these materials in modern electronic devices with varied applications including energy conversion and storage.  Miniature samples such as ultrathin films, nanoparticles, or nanodot arrays require an ultra-sensitive detection tool like the Superconducting Quantum Interference Device (SQuID) magnetic moment detector.  The main goal for this project was the acquisition of a new state-of-the-art SQuID spectrometer for the analysis of magnetically active materials. The spectrometer is housed in the UCLA Molecular Instrumentation Center (MIC), which is a campus-wide, integrated facility that provides access to shared, sophisticated instrumentation for the broader research community at UCLA.  For the past 2 years, the new Quantum Design MPMS 3 spectrometer has been producing high quality data to help advance science in close to 20 research groups that work at several Academic Departments at UCLA and the California Institute of Technology. Over 15 peer-reviewed publications presented data acquired with this instrument.  For example, the group of Kang Wang, from Electrical Engineering, studies conventional and novel materials like topological insulators (TI). The ideal TI has a bulk interior characterized by an electrically insulating material, while the boundary exhibits a conductive surface (metallic states). The metallic properties of these edge and surface states display new and unexpected physics. This group uses the SQuID to determine the saturation magnetization, that is used to calculate the critical current densities in TI bilayer structures.     The Ni Ni Physics group also works with topological insulators.  Using the SQuID, they have experimentally confirmed antiferromagnetism in the TI candidate MnBi4Te7, which is predicted to show Quantum Anomalous Hall Effect at low temperature.     The Richard Kaner group, in the division of inorganic chemistry, focuses on metal borides, which are of scientific interest due to a range of physical properties including superhardness and superconductivity. Niobium based monoboride systems were determined to be superconducting with measured critical temperatures in the 8-9.5 K range.     The Materials Sciences group of Professor Yu Huang looked at Palladium hydride nanoparticles for energy storage, fuel cell applications, and as candidates for high temperature superconductivity. They determined that the magnetic memory of these materials was dependent on shape, size, and to the amount of hydrogen absorbed into the core structure of the palladium lattice. The pure Pd nanostructures present a strong paramagnetic behavior that transforms to ferromagnetic and diamagnetic as a function of Hydrogen content (PdHx).     The California Institute of Technology also uses our instrument.  Professor Agapie?s project probes the effect of small structural changes on the spectroscopic and magnetic properties of Manganese complexes relevant to the Oxygen Evolving Complex of Photosystem II.     The Tolbert group research, in the department of Chemistry, focuses on nanocrystal-based magnetoelectric composites and mesoporous thin film composite materials.  Very small amounts of ferromagnetic material inserted into pores of a thin film require the high magnetic sensitivity provided by this instrument.     The Zink group designs stimuli-responsive core-shell nanoparticles with superparamagnetic iron oxide core in a mesoporous silica shell. Confirmation of superparamagnetic behavior of the doped iron oxide is critical, and achieved by measuring ZFC/FC experiments to determine the transition temperature from a magnetically blocked state to a superparamagnetic state.
