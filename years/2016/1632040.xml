<AbstractNarration>One of the most striking features of human communication is our ability to use words in flexible and creative ways: We often use the same word to mean multiple different things. For instance, we hammer using a hammer, and drink from glasses that are made of glass. These flexible uses of words provide expressive power, but seem likely to be difficult for children to learn. Hearing the same word used in multiple ways may lead to confusion and slow down the learning process.  Surprisingly, recent research suggests that flexible uses of words do not impede children from learning words, but actually appear to facilitate the process. The goal of the current project is to understand how children master flexible language so easily by studying children in structured study environments and by observing how parents and children use these words in their everyday lives. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will involve both tightly controlled experimental approaches and annotation and analysis of transcripts of parent-child speech. First, the project will explore how children are exposed to flexibility in their conversations with parents, and how this might vary across different languages. Second, the project will assess how children between 2- and 4-years old manage to learn the different meanings of flexible words, while at the same time keeping these meanings distinct in their heads. Investigators Srinivasan and Rabagliati will also conduct experiments to explore how children learn to use flexible words in creative ways that they could not have heard before. The final series of studies will examine what the consequences of flexibility are for children's cognitive development more generally. In particular, studies will explore whether the ways that flexible words are used in a language can teach children about the world more generally. This project is being funded jointly through a partnership between the National Science Foundation and the Research Councils of the United Kingdom.</AbstractNarration>

For example, most preschoolers already know thousands of words. This is a particularly impressive feat because it is not easy to learn a new word. Words are typically spoken in complex scenes, such that a new word could have many possible interpretations. This problem appears to be even more difficult when we factor in that most words are actually <em>polysemous</em>: they can be used with a family of distinct but related meanings.

According to most theories in language development, the answer should be &ldquo;yes&rdquo;. For example, one prominent theory holds that, to simplify the difficulties of learning a new word, children may initially assume that each word only has a single meaning. Polysemous words, of course, violate this assumption, because they carry multiple meanings.

Moreover, our studies show that children use their knowledge of one meaning of a word to learn other, new meanings for that word. For example, in one study, we show that if children have learned that a new word refers to a kind of material (&ldquo;some <em>dax</em>&rdquo;), and then learn that the same word can refer to an object made from that material (&ldquo;a <em>dax</em>&rdquo;), children assume that the object word will refer only to objects made from that material, similar to how we use &ldquo;glass&rdquo; to label drinking vessels that are made of glass. In another study, we show that although children struggle to learn a new word for pitch (e.g., that &ldquo;daxy&rdquo; refers to a high pitch), they are much better at doing so when they have first learned that the word refers to space (e.g., that &ldquo;daxy&rdquo; refers to a high location in space). Finally, we find that children can use their knowledge of one meaning of a word to spontaneously guess that the word will have an additional meaning.
