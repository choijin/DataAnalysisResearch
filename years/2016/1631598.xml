<AbstractNarration>NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The development of innovative polymeric materials possessing unusual combinations of chemical functionalities and useful physical properties is crucial in their myriad applications as high-strength structural materials, water and gas purification membranes, components in organic photovoltaic cells, and materials for high power lithium-ion batteries. Within a highly interdisciplinary research environment, this project will challenge undergraduate and graduate students to conduct hypothesis-driven, crosscutting research at the interface between chemistry, chemical engineering, and materials science. By using modern methods in synthetic polymer chemistry to generate new materials and by characterizing their structures and attendant physical properties, this project will aim to uncover new tools for designing innovative, functional polymers with unusual morphologies and novel properties for a variety of potential applications. An undergraduate polymer chemistry lab and two polymer-oriented lecture demonstrations will be developed for use in general chemistry instruction and in public outreach lectures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Applications of commodity and specialty block copolymers rely on their useful combinations of properties, which stem from covalently linking two or more dissimilar homopolymer segments into a single macromolecule. By virtue of their thermodynamically driven self-assembly into complex yet well-defined nanoscale morphologies, block copolymers are useful as thermoplastics and thermoplastic elastomers, advanced molecular separations membranes, and new templates for fabricating next-generation microelectronics. Modern polymerization techniques enable access to a plethora of copolymers containing unusual combinations of chemical functionalities with useful physical properties, at the expense of introducing significant segmental dispersity into one or more blocks of the copolymers. However, the role of broad segmental dispersity on block copolymer phase behavior is not well understood. This project will directly investigate the effects of mid-segment polydispersity on the phase behavior of ABA-type triblock copolymers. Model polydisperse triblock copolymers with varying segmental interaction parameters will be synthesized by tandem polymerization techniques for studies of their composition-dependent phase behavior, using small-angle X-ray scattering, electron microscopy, polymer rheology, and various transport measurements. Characterization of samples near the order-disorder transition (ODT) will help to identify the variables that parameterize the phase behavior of these multicomponent block copolymer mixtures. Ultimately this study aims to transform segmental polydispersity into a new tool for manipulating the morphologies of block copolymers with technologically useful bulk properties.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Project outcomes report          While polymers ("plastics") are ubiquitous in our everyday lives, the development of polymers with unusual combinations of physical and chemical properties offers potential access to new, lightweight and high strength plastics, better membranes for purifying water, and safer materials for use in commercial lithium-ion batteries. Block polymers are one candidate set of materials that offer opportunities for the design of innovative, functional polymers, with exquisite periodic structures at length scales 1/1000th the width of a human hair. The nanoscale structures formed by these materials crucially govern their unique physical and chemical attributes.     Intellectual Merit:       Economical methods for making block polymers at commodity scales introduce molecular-level imperfections into them, which have long been thought to disrupt nanoscale structure formation. We specifically focused on understanding the propensity for imperfect block polymers, with broad chain length and chemical composition distributions, to form periodic nanoscale structures with useful properties. We used a powerful suite of materials science characterization techniques including synchrotron X-ray scattering, electron microscopy, and measurements of the temperature-dependent flow properties of these materials (melt rheology) to understand the states of order and disorder in these polymers. These fundamental scientific studies suggest scenarios in which designing molecular-level imperfections into economically produced polymers can produce unexpected, exciting, and useful properties. Research results from this project have been disseminated through peer-reviewed journal publications and scientific presentations at national conferences.     Broader Impacts:       This project provided substantial educational opportunities for a diverse pool of nine graduate and three undergraduate students in interdisciplinary research at the crossroads between chemistry, chemical engineering, and materials science, including five female students, of which two were minorities typically under-represented in STEM disciplines. This collaborative research project served to train a new and diverse generation of young scientists in contemporary polymer science, evidenced by the awarding of three Ph.D. degrees, and three Master?s Degrees.
