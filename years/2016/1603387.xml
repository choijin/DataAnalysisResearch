<AbstractNarration>This award provides funding to help defray the expenses of participants in the "Fourteenth East Coast Operator Algebras Symposium" that will be held October 1-2, 2016, on the campus of Loyola University of Chicago.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This conference is the fourteenth installment of the East Coast Operator Algebras Symposium (ECOAS), a series that annually brings together a diverse group of mathematicians whose primary research interests are in the theory of operator algebras. The main foci of the 2016 event are the following: deformation/rigidity theory; noncommutative geometry; subfactor theory; operator algebras and geometric group theory. The conference program provides ample opportunity for graduate students, postdocs, and other young scientists to present their work. More details about the conference will be available at http://www.math.vanderbilt.edu/~ncgoa/conferences.html.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ We had 12 operator algebraists speaking at a weekend symposium attended by 57 participants.  They presented original research in pure mathematics which makes connections to physics and engineering, among other topics.  Informal activities, like coffee and a conference dinner, offerer the opportunity for networking among the participants.  Many of the attendees were graduate students, who learned some mathematics outside their immediate field of study, had a chance to meet and talk to more senior mathematicians, and learned about mathematical communication by watching excellent talks by more senior mathematicians.  The senior mathematicians who spoke had the chance to spread their ideas throughout the mathematical community and hopefully plant some seeds in students' thoughts.    The speakers and talks were:  Ionut Chifan, "Rigidity in group von Neumann algebra."  Robin Deeley, "Group actions on Smale spaces and their C*-algebras."  Elizabeth Gillaspy,"Irreducible representations of nilpotent groups generate classifiable $C^*$-algebras."  Sebastian Hurtado Salazar, "Zimmer's Conjecture."  Vaughan Jones, "Pythagorean representations of Thompson groups."  Kate Juschenko, "Cycling amenable groups and soficity"  Hung-Chang Liao, "Rokhlin type theorems for simple nuclear C*-algebras"  Henri Moscovici, "Primary and secondary invariants of algebras of pseudodifferential symbols."  Yunxiang Ren, "Classification of Thurston-relation subfactor planar algebras."  Yasuhiko Sato, "Automorphisms with the Rohlin property on nuclear C*-algebras."  Paul Skoufranis, "A Brief Overview of Bi-Free Probability."  James Tener, "Geometric construction of conformal nets."
