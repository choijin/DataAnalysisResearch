<AbstractNarration>The broader impact and commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to treat chronic back and lower limb pain more effectively using a novel stimulation active paddle electrode technology.  Lower back pain affects more than 100M Americans.  While spinal cord neuromodulation is successful for about 60% of patients, many people remain untreated and suffer from chronic pain.  Low-back pain is the most difficult to treat due as conventional electrode technology cannot selectively deliver energy to these fibers due to the bulky paddle electrode volume associated with the legacy manufacturing processes.  Furthermore, to achieve maximal pain relief, neurosurgeons must wake the subjects during an operation to verify if the patient senses pain relief as the electrode is positioned.  Many subjects undergo multiple operations due to inaccurate electrode alignment or movement of the electrode over time due to physical activity.  The proposed active grid electrode technology will double the therapeutic surface area, including providing therapy to low-back fibers which are not accessible by conventional electrodes.  The technology will improve low-back pain relief, as well as use wireless programming to alter the therapy in the event of electrode movement, avoiding the need for re-operation.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project seeks to double the area of the spinal cord which can receive therapeutic benefit, by developing an active stimulation-grid electrode technology.  By positioning a tiny electronic circuit within the paddle electrode, we can create a 48 or 96 channel stimulation grid which can be programmed to deliver precision therapy.   To accomplish these goals, we will perform three critical tasks including:  (1) design of the paddle electrode using electric field simulations to current-steer therapy to low-back pain fibers, (2) develop a prototype of the active stimulation grid lead using a tiny ceramic hermetic package and micro-circuit, and (3) validation of the recruitment of low-back pain fibers in the spinal cord.  The goal of the project is to develop proof-of-concept data to show that active-lead technology can improve delivery of therapy to low-back pain fibers.  Validation will be performed by recording the evoked potentials across the surface of all dorsal columns while stimulation is selectively applied to lateral electrodes caudal to the recording electrodes.  Electromyography control electrodes will be positioned within adjacent muscles to verify that dorsal roots are not activated.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Project Outcomes  Our NSF Phase I project focused on developing critical technology associated with a high-density implantable human neurostimulation therapy.   We created passive high-density electrodes (Goal 1) and performed surgical evaluation of these implanted devices.  We designed and fabricated a medical device module and developed techniques for putting tiny electronics within the waterproof package (Goal 2).  We developed approaches for attaching a small medical device electronics package to a high-density electrode array (Goal 3).    Goal 1:  We worked with a neurosurgeon to design a spinal cord electrode with 48 therapy sites to fit within the epidural volume of the spinal column.  We focused on developing two important features:  (1) a soft and flexible electrode, and (2) a very thin and flexible geometry to enable the electrode to be positioned easily within the lateral edges of the epidural space around the spinal cord.   We created a prototype design and performed surgical evaluation.  The prototype high-density electrodes were inserted into the epidural space and the stimulation patterns were swept medial to lateral to verify output stimulation.   Goal 2:  For this aim, we created an active electrode array which included an electronics module which allowed a large number of electrodes to be connected using a smaller number of control wires.  We developed a prototype electronics package.  We demonstrated that the device could deliver therapeutic pulses through the programmed therapy contacts using an LED array to verify function.   We developed an external pulse generation device and a simple software interface to demonstrate the high-density electrode technology prototype.   Goal 3:  We identified and performed evaluation of methods to connect an ultra-thin electrode to a high-density electronics module.  We explored micro-bonding approaches and identified a method which will be reliable and which could be performed in a medical grade environment.   Technical Summary:  We successfully created a prototype electronics high-density electrode.  We developed a novel approach and identified future electronics and long-term reliability challenges which must be addressed during Phase 2.  We have overcome most of the Phase 1 challenges and developed a physical proof-of-concept which is being configured for benchtop testing.     Overall Summary:  Our Phase 1 development has expanded our technology capability and informed our commercialization development plans.  Firstly, the analysis of computer simulation data of therapy pulses applied to the spinal cord indicates that our technology may enable a new therapy to uniquely target a population of people suffering from low-back pain.  Secondly, these results were validated by an experienced neurosurgeon who implants neurostimulators and treats numerous patients for chronic pain.  The results of the project enabled us to secure an experienced neurosurgeon as our clinical advisory board chairman.  Thirdly, the creation of a high-density active electrode technology appears to be feasible based upon the prototypes we deveoped.
