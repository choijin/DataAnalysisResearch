<AbstractNarration>The Synergistic Environments in Graduate and Undergraduate Education (SEGUE) in Atmospheric Instrumentation and Measurement Training is a collaborative project to design, develop, and openly distribute a series of interactive, multimedia, online modules that can be effectively integrated into courses on instrumentation, measurement, and observing systems to supplement traditional pedagogies and enhance blended instruction. This project addresses the need captured in a National Research Council report that concluded, "concrete steps must be taken to enhance the availability of collaborative tools for university instruction in observing techniques to foster continued development of cutting-edge instruments and to increase the general literacy among atmospheric scientists on the subject of instrumentation and observational data."  SEGUE brings together the intellectual capital of the scientists and engineers of National Center for Atmospheric Research Earth Observing Laboratory as subject matter experts, the artistic talents and instructional design acumen of the COMET program, and the project leadership, vision, teaching expertise in instruments and observational science at Millersville University; all with the purpose of developing high quality, content rich learning modules that will elevate the scientific literacy and technical competency of undergraduate and graduate students creating a robust workforce.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The result of this effort will be the creation of a robust set of open educational resources that will be available to the entire atmospheric science and meteorological community for instrumentation education and training programs, addressing topics such as principles of instrumentation and measurement to the theory and practice of measuring a host of meteorological variables.  Topics such as instrument performance characteristics, temperature, pressure, humidity &amp; water vapor, wind speed &amp; direction, and precipitation will be covered by the developed modules.  Learning objectives for each module will be determined through needs analysis that engages both a broad spectrum of the university community as well as subject matter experts.  The project will impact the atmospheric science community by fulfilling a need for contemporary, interactive, multimedia guided education and training modules integrating the latest instructional design and assessment tools in observational science.  Module development will engage graduate students in the testing of modules.  The modules may serve as an alternative to observational research training and assist schools that lack the resources to stage a field- or laboratory-based instrumentation experiences.</AbstractNarration>
