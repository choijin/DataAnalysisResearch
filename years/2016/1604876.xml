<AbstractNarration>PI:  Leftwich, Megan&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: 1604876&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The focus of this proposal is to determine the mechanism for high-performance swimming that is used by sea animals that move their flippers in a periodic manner. It is proposed to take real life experimental data for the motion of sea lions at the Smithsonian National Zoological park (SNZ) in Washington, DC, and to mathematically describe the maneuvering motion of these swimmers in order to design robotic prototypes. These prototypes will then be used in a laboratory setting to take detailed measurements of the flow around them. Findings from this research could lead to energy savings because of flow control around submerged objects (e.g., ships, submarines, unmanned robotic vehicles). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To understand the hydrodynamics around a large animal, one must first characterize its kinematics. Previous efforts to do so, which inform this work, do not include quantitative descriptions of the relevant parameters for a detailed, controlled hydrodynamic study. At this time, it is proposed to conduct a comprehensive field study at the SNZ in Washington, DC. This study will provide a digital catalog of sea lion maneuvers and a detailed mathematical description of them. The study will initially focus on steady swimming behavior (the "clap") before progressing to include turning, accelerating and other advanced maneuvers. Both two- and three-dimensional data will be obtained using three synchronized digital cameras. This required significant development of markerless three-dimensional tracking techniques for large free-swimming bodies. While methods exist for small-scale motion (insects) or highly predictable motions (human walking), these tools are not available for general locomotion with an unknown trajectory. Once the kinematic data are in place, a replicate will be crated that will be a hydrodynamically quiet unsteady propulsor in a laboratory setting. While observational data of swimming sea lions offer insight into such propulsion, it is not sufficient to understand its hydrodynamic effects on the surroundings. The work proposed here will lay the foundation for the design and construction of a robotic sea lion fore flipper. Finally, high-magnification images of the propulsive surface will allow the investigation of its natural flow control abilities. Educational initiatives involve graduate, undergraduate and high school students. In addition, through the Friends of the National Zoo (FONZ) program, the PI will participate in educational programs at the SNZ including lectures and the creation of educational displays and interactive modules within the California sea lion exhibit. Finally, recent and ongoing media interest in this work provides a platform for dialogs about fluid dynamics with the general public.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Bio-inspired efficient pulsatile locomotion     The objective of this project was to determine a mechanism for high-performance jet-like swimming based on the California sea lion, a highly maneuverable aquatic mammal that produces thrust primarily with its foreflippers.  To understand sea lion hydrodynamics, we first characterized its kinematics by conducting a comprehensive field study the Smithsonian National Zoological park (SNZ) in Washington, DC.  This study will provided us with a detailed mathematical description of sea lion?s maneuvers (Fig. 1: Sea lion foreflipper three-dimensional kinematics).  This required significant development of markerless three-dimensional tracking techniques for large free-swimming bodies.              Once we gathered the kinematic data, we created a robotic model to study in a laboratory setting (Fig. 2: Sea lion foreflipper robotic model).  While observational data of swimming sea lions offers insight into such propulsion, it is not sufficient to understand its hydrodynamic effects on the surroundings. This robotic platform was used to investigate the flow patterns generated by the swimming sea lion through flow-measurement techniques such as particle image velocimetry (Fig. 3: Velocity field of robotic flipper model).  This study found that the main propulsive jet that the sea lion produces draws fluid largely from the external surface of the flipper, as opposed to ?squeezing? the fluid between the flipper and the body.   Finally, high-magnification images of the propulsive surface inspired us to investigate its natural flow control abilities.  As mammals, sea lions are covered in hair.  On the foreflipper, the main propulsive surface, the amount and type of hair varies significantly with location, we explored the connection of these structures to the flow in these areas with regard to drag reduction and flow control by measuring the boundary layer development over samples of excised sea lion skin in a water channel (Fig. 4: Sea lion skin and fur boundary layer profiles).     Intellectual merit:  This project had a strong scientific contribution, both in the physics that were explored and the methods developed. The main method development is markerless, three-dimensional tracking of a large, freely swimming object. While methods existed for small-scale motion (insects) or highly predictable motions (human walking), these tools are not available for general locomotion with an unknown trajectory. The physics explored, the efficient, pulsatile swimming of the sea lion, described and illuminated another paradigm of high performance biologically inspired locomotion. Finally, by exploring the surface features of the foreflippers and connecting them to the active and passive flow control of those structures, we provided insight into the complex connection of micro and macro scales in unsteady propulsion.     Broader impact:  This program supported significant broader impact activities.  In addition to partiall funding the PhD of one student and completely funding the MS degree of another, it provided several summer research experiences for undergraduate students (supplemented by the GWU SEAS Summer Undergraduate Program for Engineering Research) and high school interns.   Finally, through the Friends of the National Zoo (FONZ) program, the PI participated in educational programs at the SNZ including lectures and the creation of educational displays and interactive modules within the California sea lion exhibit.  Finally, ongoing media interest in this work provided a platform for dialogs about fluid dynamics with the general public in venues such as CNN, the New York Times, Wired and more.
