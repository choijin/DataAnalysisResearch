<AbstractNarration>Increased computing capacity coupled with the availability of large data sets have emphasized the need for improved network infrastructure to support research in varied data intensive sciences. While researchers have domain-specific needs for storing, accessing, managing and curating their data, the underlying networking needs remain the same. The Advanced Research Computing in the Humanities Engineering and Sciences (ARCHES) network facilitates research in fields of computational inquiry by helping address the continuously evolving challenges of managing scientific data. The main features of the project include (a) deploying an aggregation router to improve connectivity to Internet 2;  (b) enhancing the current data transport capabilities around campus laboratories, computational clusters and the digital humanities media laboratory; (c) deploying perfSONAR to monitor network traffic; and (d) assess the impact of cyberinfrastructure in building novel collaborations between scientific research and educational groups. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ARCHES network design improves on successful implementations of similar networks and finds an appropriate balance to simultaneously address network security, research, and educational needs. The network enables educators to adopt new pedagogical approaches and technologies, and to provide students with an enhanced educational experience. With its emphasis on workforce development, ARCHES provides pathways for development of new curricular material and supports research experiences for undergraduate students and schoolteachers. The network provides new opportunities for researchers, students, and educators alike, thus having a significant impact on a number of research domains.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    Researchers at the University of New Orleans (UNO) were hampered by an outdated networking infrastructure that is unable to address the continuously evolving challenges of managing scientific data. To facilitate research in fields of computational inquiry, we implemented the implementation of the Advanced Research Computing in the Humanities Engineering and Sciences (ARCHES) network, a Science DMZ at the University of New Orleans (UNO). The ARCHES network at UNO will bring together researchers from diverse fields who identify the central role of computing in research and education. While each domain has specialized needs on how they store, access, manage and curate their data, the underlying networking needs remain the same. Working in collaboration with the Louisiana Optical Network Initiative (LONI), the project enhanced the current data transport capabilities around campus laboratories and clusters via dedicated  network connections and improved support for educational and instructional activities enabling student success.
