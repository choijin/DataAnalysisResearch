<AbstractNarration>Is it necessary to know what types of microbes are present in a system in order to understand and predict ecosystem processes?  This is a fundamental, yet unanswered, question. This project will address hypotheses regarding the relationship between community assembly processes, environmental parameters and ecosystem functioning following a disturbance.  Soil microbial community structure and function will be tracked in soils at various times after forest fires. Phylogenetic and genomic approaches will be employed to explore the factors controlling how microbial communities develop, and the relative roles of different controls in structuring microbial communities.  This work will also focus on describing the temporal and spatial dynamics of the well-documented changes in nitrogen cycling that are observed following wildfires. This research is expected to build a better understanding of the contributions of microbial community structuring to these important soil processes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study will focus on how soil communities recover from burning at a time when fire frequency and severity are escalating across the American West. The project will also facilitate the development and refinement of new bioinformatics approaches to analyze the large data sets required to study the dynamics of complex microbial communities.  Broader impacts include the training of graduate students and a post-doctoral scholar, and the development of a course to integrate undergraduates directly into the planned research.  Additionally, outreach will be conducted at a local high school with a high proportion of at-risk students&lt;br/&gt;.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The major goal of this research was to study how ecosystem functioning and microbial communities recover following major disturbances such as forest fires and flash floods.  These sorts of disturbances are increasing in frequency as a result of climate change, especially in the already fire- and flash flood-prone Rocky Mountains.  The research was conducted at several recently burned sites in the Colorado Front Range, one of which was subsequently hit by a severe flash flood.  This research is important because it will help land managers (e.g. the U.S. Forest Service) better understand the link between the assembly (development) of soil microbial communities and ecosystem processes (such as nutrient cycling) that affect the loss of nutrients, erosion, and the rate at which plants can recolonize burnt areas.  The rate at which plants can stabilize the ground is extremely important in preventing severe erosion following severe thunderstorms that are becoming increasingly frequentin this region.  This research broke new ground in understanding how microbial communities (bacteria, fungi, small soil animals, and photosynthetic microbes) form communities and function in soil following forest fires and extreme rain events.  For example, it was found that with increasing time since the forest fire, the relationship between the soil environment and microbial enzyme activity became stronger. That is, late successional forest-soils showed strong connections between enzyme activity and environmental factors, whereas in the first few years after a fire enzyme activity was not predictable based on environmental variables.  Thus, this work emphasizes the relevance of successional stage (time since fire) in predicting nutrient availability and nutrient cycling, especially as disturbances become more frequent in a rapidly changing world.  In addition, this research revealed that previously burned landscapes are more susceptible to a subsequent extreme rain event via shifts in bacterial community structure, enzyme activity, and soil pH, whereas unburned soils are not.  Thus, this research demonstrates how compounding disturbances (fire and flood) can drive distinct changes compared to systems experiencing a single disturbance and suggests that changes in bacterial communities may underlie these responses.  This project provided opportunities for the training of 6 graduate students, 6 undergraduate students (including one minority student), and 1 post-doctoral scholar. Three PhD dissertations were mostly or partially funded through this grant.       Last Modified: 07/08/2019       Submitted by: Steven K Schmidt]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
