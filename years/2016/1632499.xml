<AbstractNarration>The project will fund a workshop on the social aspects of data science using historical, philosophical, and social scientific methods.  It will be held at Cal Poly in the fall of 2016. The workshop will bring together historians, philosophers, anthropologists, and sociologists of data science. They will work together to design a science and technology studies research agenda for data science. Faculty and students engaged in social, historical and ethical studies of data science will be invited to participate. The workshop will contribute to the advancement of knowledge about data science. It will further understanding of social and cultural aspects of data science. It will professionalize and train students. The workshop's publications will increase society?s understanding of data science by discussing the how, what, who, where and why of data science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop will establish of a multi-disciplinary, multi-generational, and multi-institutional science and technology studies (STS) research agenda on data science. It is designed to be an agenda-setting workshop involving both experts and the general public to produce a research strategy and agenda. The workshop will focus on data science's communication patterns, tools, styles of work, analytical habits, standards, visual strategies, and professional ethics. Presentations will document the emerging social facets of data science research cultures by using historical, philosophical, and social scientific methods. The workshop will offer an opportunity for STS to apply its methods to a new scientific profession and  provide STS with a chance to situate itself as a key stakeholder in the professionalization process. The workshop will increase the documentation and understanding of data science beyond the technical profession.</AbstractNarration>

More than 100 undergraduate students and faculty from Cal Poly attended the various public lectures that were organized in conjunction with the workshop or participated in interactive breakout sessions. In addition, Cal Poly students from the undergraduate Science, Technology &amp; Society (STS) program and the undergraduate Data Science Club led one of the workshop&rsquo;s main sessions, which focused on the definition of data science.

The primary outcomes of the workshop were the identification of "Next Steps" for research into data science and its social facets, as well as the identification of research gaps in particular need of federal research funding. Data science is restructuring knowledge creation as well as knowledge reception by integrating tools and methodologies that range from machine learning to design thinking. These developments have the potential to affect nearly every segment of the U.S. science and engineering workforce. In particular need of research funding are studies that investigate the changing culture of scientific explanation; studies of when the numerous kinds of rote and expert work consolidated under the rubric of "Data Science" are perhaps more effectively approached and supported as separate practices; and studies into how data scientists ask and answer research questions. Also needed is deeper research into the metadata dimensions of data science; research into the growing role of expressive technologies in the creation of data science research products; context-specific research into data science research impact and use (e.g., predictive medicine, predictive policing, predictive maintenance); and research into the role that data science plays in creating the evidentiary foundation on which new and emerging conceptualizations of world historical developments are based (e.g., the "fourth industrial revolution" or 4IR).
