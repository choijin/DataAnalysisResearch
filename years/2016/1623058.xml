<AbstractNarration>This award supports travel, registration, and accommodation expenses for US researchers, including students and post-doctoral scholars, to attend the 14th Meeting of the Canadian Number Theory Association (CNTA XIV), which will be held at the University of Calgary, Alberta Canada, on June 20-24, 2016.  The conference website is here: http://www.ucalgary.ca/cnta2016/.  The CNTA meetings are held bi-annually, and are among the largest number theory conferences world-wide.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to contributed talks, invited talks, and plenary lectures on current research in number theory, there will be a special session honoring the many contributions of Richard Guy, as we celebrate his 100th birthday. Topics covered by the conference traditionally have included algebraic number theory, analytic number theory, computational and algorithmic number theory, arithmetic geometry, diophantine approximation, combinatorial number theory, and any other areas related to or belonging to number theory.</AbstractNarration>

The bi-annual CNTA meetings are among the largest number theory conferences world-wide. CNTA 2016 had 172 attendees, with 106 active contributors to the scientific program.   The conference showcased the latest developments in the field and attracted researchers and students from across the globe, with the additional aim of exposing junior researchers to cutting-edge research in the field.

Twenty-nine junior participants also attended the summer school on explicit methods for abelian varieties hosted by the PIMS CRG of the same name at the University of Calgary just prior to the conference (6 additional summer school participants were unable to stay on for CNTA).   A special session devoted to Richard Guy celebrated the outstanding and numerous contributions to number theory by this most remarkable researcher and educator. This session included a public lecture that generated excellent publicity for the field of mathematics, the University of Calgary, and the conference sponsors (including PIMS).      Ten particpants from the US were funded with proceeds of this NSF grant.         Last Modified: 09/17/2017       Submitted by: Jonathan Webster]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
