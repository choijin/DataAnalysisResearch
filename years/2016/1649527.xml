<AbstractNarration>Title: Student Travel Support for the PPoPP 2017, CGO 2017, and HPCA 2017 Symposia Colocated in Austin, Texas&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will support student travel to three co-located conferences: the ACM SIGPLAN Symposium on Principles and Practice of Parallel Programming (PPoPP 2017), the International Symposium on Code Generation and Optimization (CGO 2017), and the International Symposium on High-Performance Computer Architecture (HPCA 2017). The conferences are being held in Austin, Texas during February 4?8, 2017. These conferences are top-ranked in the fields of parallel programming, compilers, and computer architecture. Supporting student travel to attend professional conferences and workshops is a very important mission of the NSF. Broader impacts include fostering the next generation of researchers in these research areas, as well as providing international experiences to build a globally-aware workforce. In particular, students will have the opportunity to learn state-of-the-art methodologies, be exposed to novel techniques, and to interact with senior researchers in their areas of expertise. The student selection process takes into account both merit and financial need, and requires support letters written by academic advisors. A strong emphasis is put on supporting women and underrepresented groups.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ ACCOMPLISHMENTS  The International Symposium on Code Generation and Optimization (CGO 2017), The International Symposium on High-Performance Computer Architecture (HPCA 2016), and the ACM SIGPLAN Symposium on Principles and Practice of Parallel Programming (PPoPP 2016) were jointly and successfully held February 4-8, 2017 in Austin, TX.

The SJSU Research Foundation administered the grant funds without overhead, and all the funds were divided evenly among the three symposia.  These symposia are leaders in their respective fields, and each traditionally has had high rates of student attendance and participation. Co-location in Austin, TX offered unique opportunities for U.S. students to interact with international students, senior researchers, and developers in these fields. Such interactions improved mutual understanding and created opportunities for future collaborations.  All the students supported by this grant attended U.S. universities when they applied. Each student submitted a cover letter stating his or her reason for attending one of the symposia, a resume, a description of his or her research interests, and a letter from the student's advisor that confirmed the student's eligibility and recommended that the student attend the symposium.  The selection process by the symposia organizing committees considered each applicant?s level of participation (paper author and presenter, poster session, or organizer), how closely the student's research interests matched areas covered by the respective symposium, and the advisor's endorsement of the student's potential for research.     IMPACT  At the symposia, students attended workshops and talks given by both industry and academia. Some of the presenters were students, and students also participated in poster sessions. There were numerous informal meetings during breaks.  Student opinions of the symposia were overwhelmingly positive. They reported that they gained valuable insights and contacts to further their research, and they were highly appreciative that the NSF helped to enable them to attend.
