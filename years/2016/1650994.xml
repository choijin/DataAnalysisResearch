<AbstractNarration>This project aims to determine if the human brain has sufficient self-adaptivity, called plasticity, to operate brain-controlled robotic devices in performing tasks that require continuous coordination and synchronization with the person's natural limbs.  These tasks are those where the action of one hand (or limb) depends on that of the other, here extended to include a robotic device, such as an unattached artificial "third hand."  Besides advanced human prosthetics, application domains include co-robots as aides supporting emergency responders in hazardous environments performing complex manual operations in the field, in space and undersea, particularly where they need to perform independently without the assistance of other persons. The results are potentially transformative for human-computer interaction and cyber-human systems research and applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research performs a set of non-invasive human subject experiments to determine whether the human brain may have sufficient neuroplasticity to enable "asymmetric dependent" operation of a detached robotic "third hand" (those in which the action of one hand depends on that of the other) through a brain-machine interface, or whether it may be limited in that capability by 2.5 million years of hominin evolution of our limbs and their extremities. This is a critical consideration as we explore the many issues of augmenting human physical capability with control implemented through brain-machine technology.  Designs combining varying degrees of robot autonomy with human-machine verbal and gesture communicated control are also considered as supplements or alternatives to direct brain-control.</AbstractNarration>
