<AbstractNarration>Magneto-dielectric devices, such as microwave and radio frequency lenses, are indispensable to communication systems, needed for example, for radar, mobile, cyber security and internet-of-things applications. Similar to glass lenses, which focus light, these devices allow for focusing or otherwise manipulating radio and microwaves. In particular, devices with spatially varying magnetic and dielectric properties offer exciting and innumerate possibilities for electromagnetic wave shaping but remain to be realized due to lack of practical fabrication techniques. Inkjet printing provides a promising approach to manufacturing such devices: inks of different composition (e.g., containing magnetic and dielectric nanoparticles) can be dispensed in varying ratio within the volume of the device to implement the desired spatial gradient in magneto dielectric properties. The goal of this industry university collaboration is to demonstrate devices, fabricated by 3D inkjet printing, with tailor-made spatial variation in magnetic and dielectric properties to achieve wave shaping as needed by a given application. The demonstration will pave the way for advanced devices such as antenna lenses that beam radio or microwave signals only to a specific WiFi enabled machine or within the perimeter of a specific room to mitigate the risk of signal interference or interception. The project will also create a unique educational and professional development opportunity for participating students, who will acquire expertise and industry experience, via internships, in advanced manufacturing, an area of significant economic importance to the U.S. Further, in partnership with a local library, talks aimed at public education in 3D printing technologies will be presented. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This collaborative GOALI project seeks to demonstrate the fabrication of microwave and radio frequency magneto-dielectric devices, with specifically designed, spatially varying electric permittivity and magnetic permeability. The project will combine transformation optics techniques for design of electromagnetic media with 3D inkjet printing for digitally directed device fabrication. Graded index microwave lens antennas, with individually customized radiation patterns, will be printed in proof of concept. The devices will be printed in a layer-by-layer sequence with polymerizable inks containing high permeability magnetic and high permittivity dielectric nanoparticles. A key challenge, due to particle loading constraints when jetting inks, will be attaining the requisite range of permeability and permittivity in the printed composite medium. Inks formulated with commercial nanoparticles will be used to conduct a rapid survey of electromagnetic properties possible in the composites. The results of the survey will guide subsequent ink design with custom nanoparticles. The size, dispersion and loading of the nanoparticles in the inks will be optimized for ink-jettability and range of electromagnetic properties achieved in the printed composites.</AbstractNarration>
