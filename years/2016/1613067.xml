<AbstractNarration>1613067&lt;br/&gt;Groppi&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award, made in response to a EArly-Concept Grants for Exploratory Research (EAGER) proposal submission, provides funds to allow for the acquisition of key electronic components necessary to develop a proof-of-concept microwave radar system ultimately intended to study volcano plumes. The so-called WAMS (Water and Ash MM-Wave Spectrometer), would be a two-antenna, active-passive system. The low frequency system would function as a water vapor radiometer, using the 22 GHz emission line, while the high frequency system would estimate water vapor temperature (via radiometry at 183 and 232 GHZ), and also function as a radar to study the ash.  The investigators at Arizona State University have experience in the design and construction of similar instruments for radio astronomy. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A successfully developed WAMS instrument with a dual antenna active-passive radar capability for imaging volcanic plumes offers the potential to measure path-integrated water vapor in a volcanic plume concurrently with measurement of ash concentration in near real time and thus might contribute to fundamental advances in our knowledge of basic volcanic conduit processes leading to eruption.  This support will allow for development of a prototype instrument that will be laboratory tested by an ASU graduate student.  The potential of a realized WAMS instrument to yield a better understanding of volcanic ash plume dynamics and evolution (e.g., particle aggregation dynamics and transport) may have benefits for mitigating air traffic hazards from volcanic activity.   Coupled with the student training in electronics testing that will be fostered by this award, these two aspects support NSFs mission of promoting the progress of science and advancing the national welfare.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;*** &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The EAGER project would directly engage a graduate student in laboratory testing of the prototype WAMS instrument.  The potential of WAMS for better understanding volcanic ash plume dynamics and evolution (e.g. particle aggregation dynamics and transport) may have benefits for mitigating air traffic hazards from volcanic activity.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Millimeter-wave remote sensing technology can significantly improve measurements of volcanic eruptions, yielding new insights into eruption processes and improving forecasts of drifting volcanic ash for aviation safety. Radiometers can measure water vapor density and temperature inside eruption clouds, improving on existing measurements with infrared cameras that are limited to measuring the outer cloud surface. Millimeter-wave radar can measure the 3D mass distribution of volcanic ash inside eruption plumes and their nearby drifting ash clouds. Millimeter wavelengths are better matched to typical ash particle sizes, offering better sensitivity than longer wavelength existing weather radar measurements, as well as the unique ability to directly measure ash particle size in-situ. In this project, we obtained the critical millimeter-wave radar hardware and performed laboratory characterization of it's peformance. We then performed extensive simulation of out millimeter-wave instrument concept using these measurements to show that its performance can achieve the science goals we claim. These results were published as an article in a peer reviewed journal. In addition, we designed a novel, compact ortho mode transducer for this project. The OMT was simulated with realistic fabrication tolerances and alignment errors. These simulations show that the OMT will meet the needs of the project. Next, we plan to fabricate the OMT and test it with the radar transmitter and receiver. This work will result in a proposal to NSF in the near future to build a complete instrument based on this concept.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 05/11/2017<br>      Modified by: Christopher&nbsp;E&nbsp;Groppi</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
