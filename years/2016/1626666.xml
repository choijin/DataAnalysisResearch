<AbstractNarration>This Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) grant will enable the acquisition of a three-ion-beam microscope, the ORION NanoFab system, from Carl Zeiss Microscopy. This tri-beam system can provide unprecedented resolution, precision and versatility for the fabrication and characterization of materials and devices all the way down to the nanometer scale (roughly a few times the atomic spacing).  The ORION NanoFab system is expected to make a significant impact on interdisciplinary nanoscience research, particularly in the areas of quantum matter and technology, medical and bio-engineering, photonic and optoelectronic research, meta-materials, and renewable energy science.  The tri-beam system will be located at the Kavli Nanoscience Institute (KNI) of the California Institute of Technology (Caltech), which provides laboratories with state-of-the-art infrastructure and houses centralized nanofabrication and nano-characterization facilities for researchers at Caltech, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), and corporations and other institutes in the greater area of Southern California.  As this form of tri-beam microscopy is only in its infancy, Caltech will also be partnering with Zeiss in a technical outreach effort to bring experts together to advance new ideas and applications of the tri-beam tool.  This collaborative outreach plan includes: hosting annual workshops at Caltech with industrial and global research-community users of the ORION NanoFab to exchange information on research highlights, technical challenges, and new technical developments and applications.  As part of outreach effort there is also a plan to offer nanoscience "demo days" for K-12 students in which the advanced instrumentation of the ORION NanoFab and other tools in the KNI can be used to explore the nanoscopic world, as well as lectures and lab tours at Caltech to local high school students and teachers on topics of nano-science and technology (nano-S&amp;T) and applications of modern microscopy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) grant will enable the acquisition of a three-ion-beam microscope, the ORION NanoFab system, from Carl Zeiss Microscopy.  The ORION NanoFab is a three-ion-beam nano fabrication and microscopy system capable of an imaging resolution of 0.5 nm and a cutting resolution of &amp;#8818;2nm, virtually independent of material. The system is designed to seamlessly switch between gallium, neon and helium beams, so that one has the option of employing the gallium focused ion beam (FIB) to pattern materials at the micro-scale, taking advantage of the powerful yet gentle neon beam for precision nano-machining with speed, or using the helium beam to fabricate delicate sub-10 nm structures that demand extremely high machining fidelity and/or cutting of delicate materials (such as graphene) that are prone to damage by high-energy electrons or heavy-element ion beams. Its capability of maskless nano-patterning also minimizes possible contamination due to the multiple steps required in processing and removing masks.  The ORION NanoFab system is expected to make a significant impact on interdisciplinary nanoscience research, particularly in the areas of quantum matter and technology, medical and bio-engineering, photonic and optoelectronic research, meta-materials, and renewable energy science.  The tri-beam system will be located at the Kavli Nanoscience Institute (KNI) of the California Institute of Technology (Caltech), which provides laboratories with state-of-the-art infrastructure and houses centralized nanofabrication and nano-characterization facilities for researchers at Caltech, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), and corporations and other institutes in the greater area of Southern California.  In partnership with Zeiss we also plan to bring together the industrial and global research-communities in a series of annual workshops at Caltech designed to help advance the technology and applications of multi-beam microscopy and nanofabrication.</AbstractNarration>

The NanoFab is utilized across multiple disciplines at Caltech, including: Applied Physics &amp; Materials Science, Electrical, Mechanical &amp; Medical Engineering, and Physics. Additionally, working with KNI staff and a Caltech professor, a Temple University undergraduate completed a summer internship project using the NanoFab. In a recent seminar, an early NanoFab adopter from Intel highlighted how the instrument is used in industry.</span></strong></p> <p><strong id="docs-internal-guid-87979f8a-0020-0895-d6c7-de0c84da5540" style="font-weight: normal;"> </strong></p> <p><strong id="docs-internal-guid-87979f8a-0020-0895-d6c7-de0c84da5540" style="font-weight: normal;"> </strong></p> <p><strong id="docs-internal-guid-87979f8a-0020-0895-d6c7-de0c84da5540" style="font-weight: normal;"> </strong></p> <p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;" dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-87979f8a-0020-0895-d6c7-de0c84da5540" style="font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">(2) Integrate with existing cleanroom instrumentation to synergistically improve the usefulness of that equipment and the NanoFab itself:</span></strong></p> <p><strong id="docs-internal-guid-87979f8a-0020-0895-d6c7-de0c84da5540" style="font-weight: normal;"> <br /> <p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;" dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">The driving force of the KNI is high-energy, high-resolution electron beam lithography, a patterning technique central to rapid prototyping of nanoscale devices. The marker of success for the NanoFab in the KNI is determined by how well it can integrate and improve processes carried out on KNI's two electron beam lithography systems. As such, KNI has collaborated with Zeiss and Raith to integrate a Raith ELPHY MultiBeam pattern generator onto the NanoFab. The first installation of its kind, the project involved troubleshooting communication issues between the two platforms. Now with successful integration, KNI users can shuttle their devices between the lithography instruments and the NanoFab, alternately executing intricate patterning steps with electrons and helium, neon and gallium ions. The KNI is the first facility to integrate the use of these four beams in such a way. This project allows Zeiss and Raith to offer similar capabilities to facilities around the world, and in turn may lead to future KNI collaborations with Zeiss, Raith and other industry partners to develop and test new system capabilities.</span></p> <p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;" dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span></p> <p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;" dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">(3) Enable traditional scanning beam functions (e.g. imaging and milling) at smaller length scales:</span></p> <p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;" dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span></p> <p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;" dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">The NanoFab is being applied to work that could not otherwise be executed without it. For imaging, a scanning helium ion beam provides advantages over a traditional scanning electron beam. Firstly, the smaller probe size (0.4 nanometer diameter for He ions compared to 2 nanometers for electrons) and optics configuration allow for better imaging resolution and depth of field, respectively. This leads to richer, more detailed images of three-dimensional nanomaterials, as shown in the comparison of tangled carbon nanotubes (Image #1). Secondly, the NanoFab is more successful at imaging non-conductive materials than an SEM (Image #2 compares suspended silicon nitride structures). This allows researchers to better visualize nanoscale features on devices whose electrical properties are vital for operation but otherwise not optimal for use with traditional electron microscopy. </span></p> <p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;" dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span></p> <p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;" dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">For milling, the NanoFab's helium and neon ion beams can directly etch features smaller than possible with traditional techniques (e.g. multi-step lithography). In Image #3, the helium ion beam cut a 10-nanometer gap in a thin gold pad, bisecting it to form an electron field emission device; the feature was made more simply and several times more narrowly than on past device generations. In Image #4, the neon ion beam etched a spiral pattern into aluminum, creating a 500-micrometer-long inductor wire, relevant to superconducting quantum circuits; the wire thickness is three times smaller than previously best achieved with traditional techniques. Both are examples of miniaturizing device features to better access quantum vs. classical physics regimes.</span></p> <p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;" dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span></p> <p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;" dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">(4) Gain two new beam species in the lab, helium and neon ions, in order to study the new physics that comes from having them interact with nanotechnologically-relevant materials:</span></p> <p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;" dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span></p> <p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;" dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">The KNI is committed to understanding the mechanisms by which improvements in nanotechnology can be achieved, furthered and exploited. In collaboration with researchers from the University of Manchester, helium ions are used not just for imaging and etching sub-10 nanometer features, but for lithography, as well. As stated above, the KNI already practices high-resolution lithography with electron beams. By exposing novel lithographic materials (provided in this case by Manchester) to both electrons and, separately, to helium and neon ions with the NanoFab, the subsequent experimental differences, resulting from the different physics associated with each high energy beam species, can be used to tease out mechanisms by which such materials work best. Crucially, understanding those mechanisms can lead to the creation of better next generation lithographic materials and, ultimately, to new techniques and technologies.</span></p> </strong></p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 11/27/2017<br>      Modified by: Oskar&nbsp;Painter</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1626666/1626666_10452443_1511831299492_NSF_Outcomes_Imaging_Image1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1626666/1626666_10452443_1511831299492_NSF_Outcomes_Imaging_Image1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Image 1"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1626666/1626666_10452443_1511831299492_NSF_Outcomes_Imaging_Image1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Image 1"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Multi-Walled Carbon Nanotubes, imaged with scanning electron microscope (left) and scanning helium ion microscope (right)</div> <div class="imageCredit">D.

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   The Zeiss ORION NanoFab is a focused ion beam system capable of generating helium, neon and gallium ion beams for use in micro- and nanoscale fabrication and characterization. It was acquired for the Kavli Nanoscience Institute's (KNI's) cleanroom facility to achieve the following outcomes:       (1) As the first academic installation of its kind in Southern California, provide access to this novel nanotechnology platform to Caltech and surrounding academic and industrial institutions:      The NanoFab was introduced to the Southern California research community with a one-day symposium at Caltech; invited speakers from UC Berkeley, UC Riverside, Zeiss and Raith attracted over 50 attendees from the Greater LA area, resulting in project work with the University of Southern California, Jet Propulsion Laboratory and UC Riverside. The NanoFab is utilized across multiple disciplines at Caltech, including: Applied Physics &amp; Materials Science, Electrical, Mechanical &amp; Medical Engineering, and Physics. Additionally, working with KNI staff and a Caltech professor, a Temple University undergraduate completed a summer internship project using the NanoFab. In a recent seminar, an early NanoFab adopter from Intel highlighted how the instrument is used in industry.          (2) Integrate with existing cleanroom instrumentation to synergistically improve the usefulness of that equipment and the NanoFab itself:     The driving force of the KNI is high-energy, high-resolution electron beam lithography, a patterning technique central to rapid prototyping of nanoscale devices. The marker of success for the NanoFab in the KNI is determined by how well it can integrate and improve processes carried out on KNI's two electron beam lithography systems. As such, KNI has collaborated with Zeiss and Raith to integrate a Raith ELPHY MultiBeam pattern generator onto the NanoFab. The first installation of its kind, the project involved troubleshooting communication issues between the two platforms. Now with successful integration, KNI users can shuttle their devices between the lithography instruments and the NanoFab, alternately executing intricate patterning steps with electrons and helium, neon and gallium ions. The KNI is the first facility to integrate the use of these four beams in such a way. This project allows Zeiss and Raith to offer similar capabilities to facilities around the world, and in turn may lead to future KNI collaborations with Zeiss, Raith and other industry partners to develop and test new system capabilities.   (3) Enable traditional scanning beam functions (e.g. imaging and milling) at smaller length scales:   The NanoFab is being applied to work that could not otherwise be executed without it. For imaging, a scanning helium ion beam provides advantages over a traditional scanning electron beam. Firstly, the smaller probe size (0.4 nanometer diameter for He ions compared to 2 nanometers for electrons) and optics configuration allow for better imaging resolution and depth of field, respectively. This leads to richer, more detailed images of three-dimensional nanomaterials, as shown in the comparison of tangled carbon nanotubes (Image #1). Secondly, the NanoFab is more successful at imaging non-conductive materials than an SEM (Image #2 compares suspended silicon nitride structures). This allows researchers to better visualize nanoscale features on devices whose electrical properties are vital for operation but otherwise not optimal for use with traditional electron microscopy.    For milling, the NanoFab's helium and neon ion beams can directly etch features smaller than possible with traditional techniques (e.g. multi-step lithography). In Image #3, the helium ion beam cut a 10-nanometer gap in a thin gold pad, bisecting it to form an electron field emission device; the feature was made more simply and several times more narrowly than on past device generations. In Image #4, the neon ion beam etched a spiral pattern into aluminum, creating a 500-micrometer-long inductor wire, relevant to superconducting quantum circuits; the wire thickness is three times smaller than previously best achieved with traditional techniques. Both are examples of miniaturizing device features to better access quantum vs. classical physics regimes.   (4) Gain two new beam species in the lab, helium and neon ions, in order to study the new physics that comes from having them interact with nanotechnologically-relevant materials:   The KNI is committed to understanding the mechanisms by which improvements in nanotechnology can be achieved, furthered and exploited. In collaboration with researchers from the University of Manchester, helium ions are used not just for imaging and etching sub-10 nanometer features, but for lithography, as well. As stated above, the KNI already practices high-resolution lithography with electron beams. By exposing novel lithographic materials (provided in this case by Manchester) to both electrons and, separately, to helium and neon ions with the NanoFab, the subsequent experimental differences, resulting from the different physics associated with each high energy beam species, can be used to tease out mechanisms by which such materials work best. Crucially, understanding those mechanisms can lead to the creation of better next generation lithographic materials and, ultimately, to new techniques and technologies.
