<AbstractNarration>This project supports student participation in the 25th International Meshing Roundtable conference will be held on September 27-30, 2016 in Washington DC.  Meshing is the decomposition of complex objects into simple parts for design, display, and analysis. As technologies change in computing and computer-aided design and manufacturing the demand for meshing seems only to increase. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The IMR conference includes four short courses, four invited speakers, and presentations of reviewed papers, research notes, and posters, and a professional development session particularly targeting students and postdocs. This award will support registration and some travel expenses for a dozen students (undergraduate to postdoctoral, coming from U.S. universities, national labs, or non-profit research organizations) to exchange ideas with experts from around the world, fostering collaboration and recognition that can help them launch their careers. (For selection criteria, see the conference web site http://www.imr.sandia.gov/25imr)</AbstractNarration>
