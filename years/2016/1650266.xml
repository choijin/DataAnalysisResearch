<AbstractNarration>Plate tectonic processes on Earth control the location and timing of major volcanic eruptions and earthquakes, and over longer time scales, the location of mountain belts. Some of the most active tectonic regions occur where plates converge, typically with one plate moving ('subducting') under another, such as the Himalayan Mountains where the Indo-Australian Plate is currently subducting under the Eurasian plate. Subduction zones are important regions of mixing. For example, surface materials and fluids are commonly pulled or dragged into Earth's deep mantle and mantle materials can be brought to the surface. In order to better understand the mechanics of critical processes that occur at subduction zones, it is important to recognize and investigate ancient subduction zones. In particular, it is essential to recognize rocks and fluids that were present at the Earth's surface, were carried hundreds of kilometers into the mantle, and then were returned to the surface. The goal of this research is to develop tools to identify and characterize rocks and fluids (or melts) that were once brought to great depth in subduction zones, and to ultimately use these far-traveled materials as recorders or indicators of the processes that occur in major subduction zones today. This project is co-funded by the Petrology &amp; Geochemistry and the EPSCoR (Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research) programs and represents a collaboration between Bowdoin College, Maine and the University of Massachusetts. The study will provide an opportunity for undergraduate students from Bowdoin College to interact with graduate students from UMass and for students from both institutions to carry out high-level research using modern analytical instruments.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although it is widely accepted that surface materials were subducted to high- and ultrahigh- pressures in many plate tectonic collisions, especially in Phanerozoic time (&lt; 500 million years before present), the actual evidence of ultrahigh-pressure metamorphism ('UHP metamorphism') is commonly obscured by younger events. The primary objective of the proposed research is to determine what factors favor the preservation of evidence of extreme metamorphism. The ultimate goal is to unravel the effects of overprinting on UHP rocks, gain insight about the mechanics of UHP tectonism, and potentially develop new methods to identify rocks that were metamorphosed at UHP conditions, but now retain little to no evidence of this transformation. This insight may improve our ability to identify evidence of UHP metamorphism in older tectonic settings. Five relatively accessible localities within the Rhodope Metamorphic Complex, Bulgaria and Greece, have been chosen for detailed study. The five localities have all experienced UHP metamorphism, but the geologic evidence has been overprinted and obscured to varying degrees. Through fieldwork, a 10-week summer research institute, and collaborative research over the next two years, student and faculty researchers from Bowdoin College and UMass will characterize the petrologic, microstructural, and geochronological evidence for high- and ultrahigh-pressure metamorphism and highlight the structural and petrologic processes that overprint and obscure this record.</AbstractNarration>
