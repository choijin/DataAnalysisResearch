<AbstractNarration>This award provides funding for US participation in the conference "Midwestern Workshop on Asymptotic Analysis" that will be held at Indiana University-Purdue University Fort Wayne on October 7-9, 2016.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This conference focuses on recent developments in Analysis, especially in the fields of approximation theory, potential theory, complex analysis and applied analysis.  A number of distinguished mathematicians have agreed to attend and speak at this conference.  The award gives early-career researchers, researchers who are members of underrepresented groups, and researchers not funded by NSF an opportunity to attend and participate in this conference.  The organizing committee will strive to make this funding opportunity known to target groups.

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Our goals for the Midwestern Workshop on Asymptotic Analysis (MWAA) in 2016 were to foster cooperation among mathematicians in certain areas of analysis represented in the midwest, and to expose attending graduate students to different areas of analysis.  There were eleven talks at the October 2016 conference in Fort Wayne, IN, given by researchers in approximation theory, mathematical physics, potential theory, and several complex variables.  Five of the speakers were recent PhDs and three were women, and there was a student research poster display.  There were 39 participants altogether, including 15 graduate students from Indiana, Michigan, and other states.  A specific example of the success of the workshop is that it started a collaboration between one of the organizers and an attending graduate student.  Their joint work on orthogonal polynomials was presented by the graduate student to a meeting of the American Mathematical Society in April 2017.  Workshop funding also supported a follow-up research visit and talk at the IPFW campus by a co-author of one of the other organizers.  The MWAA series was previously at Indiana University in Bloomington in 2015, and continued in 2017 at the IUPUI campus.  Abstracts and slides from the talks and posters from students are available through the Workshop web site, http://mwaa.math.iupui.edu/          Last Modified: 02/13/2018       Submitted by: Adam Coffman]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
