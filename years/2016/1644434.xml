<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project it to help implement networks that are less likely to fail or can recover more quickly under failure, thus providing a more reliable networking infrastructure. The project targets software-defined networks, which promise improved network functionality, but have seen slower-than-expected deployment due to the lack of network management solutions. Bringing a novel fault detection and traceback system to market may have significant impact on the software-defined network management business.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project aims to develop a commercialization plan for a network management and troubleshooting tool for software-defined networks. The technology aims to provide network operators with improved network visibility. Software-defined networks are very dynamic, which provides network operators with the capability and flexibility to program the network, but at the cost of more complex troubleshooting. The methodology used in our technology uses network state in such a way that enables operators to visualize the evolution of their network, resulting in faster root cause analysis when network faults occur.</AbstractNarration>
