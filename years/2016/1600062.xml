<AbstractNarration>This research examines the potential for achieving sustainability in coastal systems where natural resources are impacted by both climate change and human responses to climate change.  Chesapeake Bay shorescapes (a shoreline zone which includes riparian, intertidal, and near-shore shallow water areas) are used as a test bed because sea level rise creates risks for shoreline property owners and shoreline marshes.  Property owner perception and response to the risk varies and their choice of a shoreline protection approach (armoring, living shoreline, do nothing) has consequences for the capacity of shoreline marshes to continue to provide ecosystem services. Impacts on marsh services that include supporting fisheries and improving water quality affect the larger estuarine system, with consequences for the many users of that system.  This leads to regulation by government officials, who have their own perception of all these issues. Modeling the decision-making process of shoreline property owners, the ecological consequences of shoreline management decisions, and the perceptions of officials developing or implementing natural resource policies will discover opportunities and options for managing the combined human and natural system to desired outcomes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the project is to discover the elements of the shorescape social-ecological system  that have the greatest influence on attainment of sustainable outcomes. The research describes the trajectory of Chesapeake Bay shorescapes in terms of changes in amount, distribution, and character of shoreline types.  The primary drivers of these changes are rising sea levels and actions of shoreline property owners to combat erosion.  An analysis of existing information on shoreline conditions, property owner characteristics and property management decisions is used to model future shoreline management choices.  A series of field investigations comparatively quantify multiple ecosystem functions (habitat provision, primary production, nutrient and carbon storage) of living shorelines and natural marshes along a continuum of estuarine shorescape settings and project future shifts in function under varying management scenarios.  This information is compiled in a marsh function model that can use input from the shoreline management model.  Future outcomes then are forecast under scenarios with alternative sea level rise and management conditions.  Surveys of government officials responsible for policy development and implementation document the operative feedbacks from the ecological consequences of property owner decisions.  Synthesis of this information identifies the characteristics of shorescape socio-ecological systems that enhance or detract from their ability to achieve sustainable outcomes.  Formal guidance for coastal managers and policy makers will be developed using the results of this integrative approach to sustainability in Chesapeake Bay shorescapes.</AbstractNarration>

This project applies a social-ecological systems approach to investigate the linkages and feedback between human and natural components by describing the various interactions between the <strong>Bay system</strong>, <strong>shoreline resources</strong> (marshes), <strong>resource users</strong> (property owners), and <strong>governance of resource usage</strong> (local and state policy makers and resource managers) to inform decision-making for sustainability and enhancement of ecosystem services. In doing so, this project advances knowledge about the how the natural system is driving user behavior, and what changes in user characteristics and/or governance systems might result in different decision choices.&nbsp;For example, the project examines how different actors ? property owners, environmental nonprofits, contractors, and local and state regulators ? perceive environmental changes, incorporate these perceptions into the decisions they make about development that affects the shorescape, and interact with other actors in the regulatory process affecting shoreline development. &nbsp;</p> <p>The results of this project also provide a way to characterize the shorescape social-ecological system to determine the elements of this system that have the greatest influence in maximizing coastal ecosystem services in Virginia. This social-ecological system includes governance and public management structures that play a role in social-ecological resilience, and encompasses actors from across government, business, nonprofits, and civic sectors. The work of the Old Dominion University policy researchers that are part of the project team have further advanced knowledge in the environmental management and policy discipline by (1) improving understanding of how policy and management aspects of shoreline regulation can influence the social-ecological resilience of shorescapes such as that of the Chesapeake Bay, (2) building new knowledge about the role of actors from multiple sectors in shoreline regulation that impacts the shorescape, and (3) developing a model for the interplay between actors from multiple sectors to allow for assess ent of how social-ecological resilience can be improved.</p> <p>The project?s findings also have broader impact that benefits society.
