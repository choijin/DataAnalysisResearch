<AbstractNarration>This award supports participation in the conference "1st Northeastern Analysis Meeting" to be hosted by The College at Brockport, State University of New York, Brockport, NY, from October 14-16, 2016.  The purpose of the conference is to disseminate and exchange the latest ideas and developments in analysis, very broadly defined.  It is designed to promote communication between people from different branches of Analysis.  The organizers hope to establish an ongoing conference series which will meet in the fall of every year and compliment the Southeast Analysis Meeting which occurs in the spring of every year.&lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;The scientific focus of the conference will cover the following topics: Differential Equations, Probability, Dynamical Systems, Wavelets and Analysis Methods in Image Processing.  The conference will have thirteen plenary talks, a large number of twenty minute time slots for contributed talks and two open problem panel discussions.   More information can be found on the conference website: https://www.brockport.edu/academics/conferences/northeastern_analysis/</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ We have received the grant to organize the first Northeastern Analysis Conference.  Since there was no major analysis conference in the Northeastern part of United States since 1995 we decided to try to revive this tradition. Another goal was to bring together mathematicians from different araeas of analysis, which have become rare in the last decades when the area of research covered by a conference got to be narrower and narrower. A third goal was to bring together mathematicians from different backgrounds and age groups, to offer a platform for further projects and collaboaration.  We succeeded in these goals.     The conference was attended by 78 participants (21 students, 8 postdocs, 15 untenured faculty, 31 tenured faculty and 3 retired faculty; 15 women and 63 men). Besides mathematicians from United States and Canada, there were mathematicians from China, Romania, Saudi Arabia, and Spain).     There was a second Northeaster Analysis Meeting in 2017 and two people agreed to organize another one in 2018. There fore the tradition seens to have started. One other thing is that many participants at the first one returned for the second.     We also succeeded in bringing together people from different sides of analysis. Besides the usual complex analysis, functional analysis, and operator theory talks the one can find at such a meeting, we had a section on fluid dynamics and one on dynamical systems. There were also some PDE and applied math talks.     In an attempt to nurture the younger generations, we organized a panel discussion on How to get a tenure track - job. It was attended by all most students and postdocs, and the initial presentation lead to many vivid questions.     One outcome of the coneference is the fact that some people that did not know eachother before this conference ended up working on common projects. We know of two such cases. Moreover, being exposed to some new directions of research influenced some participants to consider new approaches in their work.     One last outcome of the conference is the publication of proceeding, which does not involve funds from the grant.
