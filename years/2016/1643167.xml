<AbstractNarration>The tropopause region separating the troposphere and the stratosphere plays an important role for a range of atmospheric processes. This region includes the bands of maximum wind speed (the jet-streams), which act as a waveguide for large-scale atmospheric disturbances (Rossby waves) and govern in part the development of mid-latitude weather systems. It also couples the dynamical evolution of the stratosphere to the circulation near the Earth's surface on sub-seasonal and seasonal time scales. Chemical species of distinct tropospheric and stratospheric source regions are sporadically exchanged through the tropopause. The goal of this project is to study the dynamics of large-scale wave coupling near the tropopause waveguide, how this wave coupling is influenced by the background atmospheric thermal structure, and how it modifies the exchange of chemical constituents between the troposphere and the stratosphere. Different approaches will be used, including theory, observational data analysis, and numerical modeling.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results from this project will advance our understanding of climate- and weather-relevant processes in the tropopause region, including the processes behind the two-way coupling between the troposphere and stratosphere. In particular, the project will lead to a better understanding of what drives planetary scale circulation variability in the stratosphere and how this circulation variability impacts weather near the Earth's surface. The project will furthermore improve our understanding of how the background atmospheric thermal structure near the tropopause influences exchange processes between the troposphere and the stratosphere. An improved understanding of the tropopause region is expected to ultimately lead to improved fidelity of models for weather and climate with corresponding societal benefits. The project will provide training as well as teaching and research experience for a graduate student and a postdoctoral fellow, which will help prepare them for continued careers in science and/or education. The project PI will continue his outreach activities from past NSF support, related to conveying stories of great discoveries in atmospheric science to middle and high school students.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The project had three primary goals: 1) To improve our understanding of the physics of dynamical coupling between the troposphere and stratosphere; 2) To improve our understanding of the impact of the tropopause inversion layer on transport and planetary wave coupling in the upper troposphere / lower stratosphere; and 3) to improve our understanding of eddy-mean flow interactions relevant for the strength and position of the subtropical jet. All three goals had widespread implications for understanding and interpreting climate variability at Earth's surface and thus for various ecosystems and society. Marked progress was made in all respects.      The project provided support for 14 research papers published in the peer-reviewed literature. These papers led to new insights into: 1) the key role of the tropopause region in dynamical coupling between the troposphere and stratosphere; 2) the importance of stratospheric transport in regulating the ozone resorvoir in the lowermost stratosphere; 3) the critical role of eddies in determining the Hadley cell response to climate change; 4) the role of radiative damping on the extratropical circulation, including its importance for stratospheric variability; 5) the importance of wave/mean flow interactions for understanding the linkages between tropical heating and the Hadley Cell; 6) the importance of climate sensitivity for stratosphere/troposphere coupling; 7) the importance of the tropopause inversion layer for stratosphere/troposphere coupling; and 8) downstream suppression of baroclinic activity following periods of large eddy activity.      The project also provided training for several graduate research assistants and one postdoctoral researcher. The training included research supervision, mentoring through both Drs. Thompson and Birner, presentations at group meetings, support for travel to domestic and international meetings, and graduate-level classes at CSU. Specifically, the project provided primary support for career development and graduate student research by Luke Davis; primary support for career development and postdoctoral level research by postdoctoral researcher Lina Boljka; and various levels of support for graduate students Nick Davis, Shim Yook and Chloe Boehm.      The most important contributions of the project to our understanding of the climate system included improved understanding of the response of stratosphere/troposphere coupling to external forcing, including that associated with the ozone hole; an improved understanding of the dynamics of the coupled troposphere stratosphere system, including the role of sudden warmings on surface weather in both hemispheres; an improved understanding of transport in the extratropical tropopause region, a region where radiation and dynamics both play a central role in climate variability and change, and where variations can impact near surface air quality; an improved understanding of the dynamics of extratropical storms; and an improved understanding of the linkages between climate sensitivity and extratropical dynamics.      The broader impacts of the project included the training of graduate student and postdoctoral researchers for careers in the climate sciences; insights into the processes that govern weather prediction on subseasonal timescales; and insights into the role of ozone depletion in surface climate on climate change timescales.
