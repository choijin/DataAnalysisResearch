<AbstractNarration>Postdoctoral Fellow: Aaron Olsen&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposal number: 1612230&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology for FY 2016, Research Using Biological Collections. The fellowship supports a research and training plan for the Fellow to take transformative approaches to grand challenges in biology that employ biological collections in highly innovative ways. The title of the research plan for this fellowship to Aaron Olsen is "How the biomechanics of suction feeding has shaped the diversification of body forms in ray-finned fishes." The host institution for this fellowship is Brown University and the sponsoring scientist is Dr. Elizabeth Brainerd.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the Fellow's research is to understand the functional morphology underlying the ability of some animals to engage in behaviors that require a large amount of power, using the feeding behavior of fishes as a model system. Some of the most spectacular behaviors among animals, such as flying, leaping, and sprinting, require a large amount of power, or the release of large amounts of energy in a short period of time. Suction feeding in fishes is one of the most powerful animal behaviors, with many fish capable of expanding their mouths in less than a tenth of a second to capture prey items. The relatively small muscles of the head are typically insufficient to generate the high power required for suction feeding, so most fish draw power from trunk muscles that run along most of the body. These muscles indirectly expand the mouth by activating a cranial linkage mechanism, consisting of over a dozen interconnected, mobile bones in the head. Even more impressively, the same trunk muscles that power mouth expansion also power swimming. For these reasons, suction feeding in fishes provides an ideal system for discovering how force and power are transmitted through different functional units within a biomechanical system. The Fellow's research uses XROMM (X-ray reconstruction of moving morphology) to record high-speed, three-dimensional motions from four species of live ray-finned fish during suction feeding. The results of these experiments are being used to build computational models to test how force and power are transmitted between the trunk and head for high-power behaviors. These models are being applied to a diverse sample of ray-finned fishes, using collections at the Museum of Comparative Zoology at Harvard University, to predict the suction capacity of fish with different body forms and test how the evolution of coordinated functional units is influenced by overall system performance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Fellow is being trained in live animal motion analysis, muscle modeling, CT (computed tomography) scanning, and in the mentoring of students. To broaden participation in science, the Fellow is conducting hands-on 'design challenges,' implemented in collaboration with teachers at the Paul Cuffee school, a K-12 public charter school where 77% of students qualify for free or reduced lunch. Students work in teams, using basic computer programming and engineering, to design mechanisms that accomplish a particular task. These challenges are paired with 3D-printed fish models and high-speed videos of suction feeding to compare biological and engineered mechanisms. The results of this research are also being shared via YouTube videos, open-source software, and a motion analysis database, to help build a public repository of biomechanical system designs and provide inspiration for biologically inspired robotics.</AbstractNarration>

This NSF fellowship supported a research project that sought to answer the question: how do fish capture and swallow food items underwater using suction and how do the performance requirements of suction feeding influence the different body forms we see among fishes?</p> <p>Fish skulls have more moving parts than any other vertebrate and this high mobility in their skulls enables them to rapidly expand their mouth and throat underwater to draw in food. To better understand how fish suction feed, Dr. Olsen and Professor Brainerd (in collaboration with Professor Patricia Hernandez and Dr. Ariel Camp) used high-speed X-ray motion capture to record how the skull expands and changes shape in two species of fish: channel catfish and common carp. And to understand the diverse forms among suction-feeding fishes, Dr. Olsen worked with undergraduates at Brown University to collect data from CT scans of different species of catfishes. In addition, Dr. Olsen began a collaboration with Prof. Brainerd and Dr. Camp to analyze previously collected motion data from largemouth bass.</p> <p>These datasets and analyses led to multiple new discoveries. Dr. Olsen and colleagues discovered a type of 3D four-bar linkage in the skull of largemouth bass that they use to open their lower jaw when they suction feed; this finding was featured by New York Times ScienceTake. Dr. Olsen and colleagues found that channel catfish use at least two distinct motor coordination patterns during suction feeding: one for capturing prey and one for swallowing prey. And Dr. Olsen and colleagues discovered an 11-bar linkage in the skull of channel catfish that enables catfish to expand and change the conformation of their head in at least 5 different ways. These results have revealed how the channel catfish skull works mechanically are currently being used to construct virtual and physical models of the catfish skull to predict how catfish with different head and body shapes suction feed.</p> <p>This project funded the development of new, open-source and freely available software in the R language for motion analysis, 3D interactive browser-based animation using WebGL and the three.js library, mechanical linkage modeling, and stereophotography. This project provided funding for the mentorship of eight undergraduates, who received training in computer programming, medical imaging, and motion capture. Lastly, this project helped provide funding for Dr. Olsen to participate in an 11-week after-school science club at a local public high school in Providence, RI the Paul Cuffee High School, where over half the students qualify for free or reduced lunch. The after-school club gave students exposure to natural history collections, human and animal anatomy, marine ecology, and an introduction to basic physics principles such as buoyancy.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 03/11/2019<br>      Modified by: Aaron&nbsp;M&nbsp;Olsen</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1612230/1612230_10439328_1552338790656_Catfishtreehoriz--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1612230/1612230_10439328_1552338790656_Catfishtreehoriz--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Catfish cranial diversity"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1612230/1612230_10439328_1552338790656_Catfishtreehoriz--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Catfish cranial diversity"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Skulls of three catfish species investigated as a part of this project.
