<AbstractNarration>Most objects in nature are non-smooth; in other words, they have singularities. Mathematics has had tremendous success in dealing with smooth objects--for example, surfaces or more generally manifolds. In this project, the PI proposes the study of calculus on singular spaces and in particular the study of maps between such spaces that are optimal in the sense of minimizing energy. From this, the PI will deduce properties of symmetries of such spaces that are of interest in mathematics and applications. The project also has an education component in which the PI plans to advise graduate students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI will study several questions dealing with harmonic maps between singular spaces. The main goal is to prove that, despite the singularities of the ambient spaces, harmonic maps have sufficient regularity so that geometric rigidity holds. Several applications to geometric group theory, character varieties, measured foliations, and Teichmuller theory will be pursued. These questions are a continuation of the PI's work on geometric super rigidity via harmonic maps.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ A natural notion of energy for a map between geometric  spaces  is defined by  measuring the total stretch of the map at each point of the domain and then integrating.  Harmonic maps are critical points of the energy functional. They can be seen both as generalizations of harmonic functions in complex analysis and a higher dimensional analogue of parameterized geodesics in Riemannian geometry. Harmonic maps are perhaps the most natural way to map a given geometric space  into another.   The  work of Eells-Sampson in the 60's launched an explosion of research for harmonic maps between Riemannian manifolds.  Many important applications were found, particularly in minimal surface theory and rigidity questions. More recent development is the harmonic map theory for non-smooth spaces.  The seminal work of Gromov-Schoen and Korevaar-Schoen  studies energy minimizing (harmonic) maps in  the case when the target is an NPC space (i.e. a complete metric space with non-negative curvature  in the sense of Alexandrov).   The PI studied several problems in  harmonic map theory for singular geometry and applications to other fields, in particular Teichmueller theory and geometric group theory. The long-term goal of the PI is to develop a general theory of harmonic maps in singular geometry with applications to topology.
