<AbstractNarration>Gamma-rays are the highest energy form of electromagnetic radiation.  Observations of astrophysical gamma-rays serve as probes of physical conditions and processes in the most extreme environments throughout the Universe, and can be used to test fundamental physics.  This award supports scientists at the University of California Los Angeles to carry out gamma-ray astrophysics research using an operating observatory and participate in the planning and development of the next generation gamma-ray observatory.  The Very Energetic Radiation Imaging Telescope Array System (VERITAS), located in southern Arizona, is designed to perform high sensitivity pointed observations of both galactic and extragalactic sources.  The University of California Los Angeles group will contribute to the operation and maintenance of VERITAS and work on analysis and interpretation of the scientific data.  The group is also involved in the development of the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA), an international gamma-ray observatory currently in planning stages.  The group leads the development of the Schwarzschild-Couder Telescope (SCT), a new technology to be implemented on CTA.  They will operate a prototype SCT at the VERITAS site. The group will continue their existing education and outreach activities to high-school students with hands-on research involving data from VERITAS and the prototype SCT.  They will also develop a citizen science program that will engage the public in exploring the data from the prototype SCT.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The University of California Los Angeles group will use VERITAS to study Galactic sources, focusing on the Cygnus region and the Galactic Center, and to search for magnetic fields in cosmic voids.  They will operate the prototype SCT alongside and in coordination with VERITAS to characterize and improve its performance.  The group will continue to be involved in the definition and leadership of CTA through the technology development and top-level project management roles.</AbstractNarration>

Based on the analysis of approximately 150 hours of data taken over a five year period, we produced a detailed skymap of the Galactic center region (Figure 1) that shows a wealth of distributed emission.&nbsp; At the center of the region is the strong source J1745-290 that is associated with Sgr A*, the supermassive black hole.&nbsp; The other sources include the supernova remnant G0.9+0.1 and diffuse emission along the Galactic center ridge (black circles).&nbsp; In this work, we measured the source spectra to higher energies than ever achieved by any previous instrument and confirm the hypothesis that the region contains a PeVatron, a source capable of accelerating particles to 1 PeV (10^15 eV).</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Another important study related to the Coma galaxy cluster that has a large angular extension of 6 degs by 8 degs.&nbsp; There are major difficulties in studying such an extended object given the VERITAS field of view of 3.5 degs.&nbsp; With detailed knowledge of the VERITAS instrument, we developed an original and non-conventional data analysis method that did not confirm the claim made by independent researchers of gamma-ray emission from a ring-like region exceeding a 1 deg radius.&nbsp; The putative emission could be consistent with the virial shock in the Coma cluster.&nbsp; Although we do not confirm such virial shock emission, we see some evidence for gamma-ray emission from the inner 1.5 deg region of the cluster using recent data taken by VERITAS after a significant upgrade in sensitivity.&nbsp; This evidence warrants further investigation by VERITAS.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>UCLA scientists are also working on the development of a future gamma-ray observatory called the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA).

The project aims to build two large telescope arrays (one in each hemisphere) to achieve up to an order of magnitude improvement in sensitivity over VERITAS. The principal investigator of this award serves as the Co-Spokesperson of CTA and led the effort to define the science case for CTA.&nbsp; This work resulted in the publication of a book "Science with the Cherenkov Telescope Array" in 2019 (Figure 2).</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The Schwarzschild-Couder Telescope (SCT) is novel two-mirror telescope that is being proposed as a medium-sized telescope for CTA.&nbsp; The work on the 9.7m prototype SCT (pSCT, Figure 3) supported by this award made it possible to develop an elaborate software suite for the alignment of the optical system (OS) of the pSCT, which has unprecedented complexity among any existing instruments, with two segmented mirrors of 48 and 24 mirror panels, 76 microcomputers, 444 actuators, 306 mirror edge sensors, 8 CCD cameras, 2 autocollimators and 2 lasers. The UCLA group was the lead institution on the pSCT construction project and successfully led the pSCT alignment efforts to achieve the optical on-axis point spread function (PSF) satisfying specifications (Figure 4) with the potential to further improve it. Alignment of the pSCT OS subsequently enabled the detection of the Crab Nebula, which has served as a critical milestone in the validation of the pSCT technology for ground-based gamma-ray astronomy and for CTA in particular.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>UCLA scientists were involved in numerous outreach activities to make their research more accessible to the general public and to contribute to the general scientific literacy of the country. These activities included tours of the VERITAS site in Arizona, public talks at schools and organizations in the Tucson and Los Angeles areas, participation in science fairs, and participation in the major Exploring Your Universe outreach event at UCLA.&nbsp; Another significant effort was Muon Hunter, a citizen scientist project that classified a large database of images from VERITAS for use in machine learning training.&nbsp; More than 1.2 million classifications were performed by over 8,000 volunteers and a valuable dataset was produced where muon rings were identified and characterized (Figure 5).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 09/11/2020<br>      Modified by: Rene&nbsp;Ong</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1607491/1607491_10435919_1599795943722_Fig1_Gal_Center--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1607491/1607491_10435919_1599795943722_Fig1_Gal_Center--rgov-800width.jpg" title="VERITAS skymap of the Galactic center region"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1607491/1607491_10435919_1599795943722_Fig1_Gal_Center--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="VERITAS skymap of the Galactic center region"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">VERITAS skymap the Galactic center region showing the gamma-ray significance(color scale) as a function of Galactic coordinates.

The funding supported scientists involved in the ground-based telescope VERITAS (Arizona, USA) that studies astrophysical sources of gamma rays, or very high-energy light.

UCLA scientists made significant contributions to all aspects of VERITAS, including the upkeep of telescope hardware, observing shifts, software and analysis development, and the production of scientific results. The science results led by the UCLA group include a survey of the Cygnus region of the Galaxy, the discovery of a new gamma-ray binary system (PSR J2032+4127), a deep study of the center of the Galaxy, and a search for extended emission in the Coma galaxy cluster.     One significant study carried out by UCLA scientists related to VERITAS observations of the region at the center of our Galaxy. Based on the analysis of approximately 150 hours of data taken over a five year period, we produced a detailed skymap of the Galactic center region (Figure 1) that shows a wealth of distributed emission.  At the center of the region is the strong source J1745-290 that is associated with Sgr A*, the supermassive black hole.  The other sources include the supernova remnant G0.9+0.1 and diffuse emission along the Galactic center ridge (black circles).  In this work, we measured the source spectra to higher energies than ever achieved by any previous instrument and confirm the hypothesis that the region contains a PeVatron, a source capable of accelerating particles to 1 PeV (10^15 eV).     Another important study related to the Coma galaxy cluster that has a large angular extension of 6 degs by 8 degs.  There are major difficulties in studying such an extended object given the VERITAS field of view of 3.5 degs.  With detailed knowledge of the VERITAS instrument, we developed an original and non-conventional data analysis method that did not confirm the claim made by independent researchers of gamma-ray emission from a ring-like region exceeding a 1 deg radius.  The putative emission could be consistent with the virial shock in the Coma cluster.  Although we do not confirm such virial shock emission, we see some evidence for gamma-ray emission from the inner 1.5 deg region of the cluster using recent data taken by VERITAS after a significant upgrade in sensitivity.  This evidence warrants further investigation by VERITAS.     UCLA scientists are also working on the development of a future gamma-ray observatory called the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA). CTA is a large, worldwide effort involving scientists from 31 countries. The project aims to build two large telescope arrays (one in each hemisphere) to achieve up to an order of magnitude improvement in sensitivity over VERITAS. The principal investigator of this award serves as the Co-Spokesperson of CTA and led the effort to define the science case for CTA.  This work resulted in the publication of a book "Science with the Cherenkov Telescope Array" in 2019 (Figure 2).     The Schwarzschild-Couder Telescope (SCT) is novel two-mirror telescope that is being proposed as a medium-sized telescope for CTA.  The work on the 9.7m prototype SCT (pSCT, Figure 3) supported by this award made it possible to develop an elaborate software suite for the alignment of the optical system (OS) of the pSCT, which has unprecedented complexity among any existing instruments, with two segmented mirrors of 48 and 24 mirror panels, 76 microcomputers, 444 actuators, 306 mirror edge sensors, 8 CCD cameras, 2 autocollimators and 2 lasers.

These activities included tours of the VERITAS site in Arizona, public talks at schools and organizations in the Tucson and Los Angeles areas, participation in science fairs, and participation in the major Exploring Your Universe outreach event at UCLA.  Another significant effort was Muon Hunter, a citizen scientist project that classified a large database of images from VERITAS for use in machine learning training.  More than 1.2 million classifications were performed by over 8,000 volunteers and a valuable dataset was produced where muon rings were identified and characterized (Figure 5).
