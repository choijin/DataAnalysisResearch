<AbstractNarration>The purpose of this proposal is to convene scholars at a two-day conference to closely examine validity-related measurement issues, create a guidelines for the field of mathematics education research that addresses key ideas (e.g., validity, validity arguments, evidence for validity and measurement at-scale), and set a clear pathway for scholars to discuss quantitative measurement within mathematics education. Invitees will include a mix of young, older and diverse scholars in mathematics education research.  Products include refereed journal articles along with a website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop will engage the Mathematics Education, Policy, Statistical, Psychometrics and other education research communities in examining and critiquing measurement validity evidence of mathematics education research with the long-term goal of increasing the quality of quantitative inference in mathematics education research (to include improvements in the training of doctoral students).</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Our first outcome was bringing together 34 individuals from around the world with a diverse background (mathematics education, mathematics, special education, psychometrics, and psychology) from both higher education (graduate students, instructors, and faculty) and industry. This meets our broader impact aims of involving a wide array of scholars, preparing graduate researchers, and bridging the gap between fields of mathematics education and all others working with validity arguments. A second outcome was supporting attendees&rsquo; development of validity arguments specific to their assessments. Attendees crafted validity arguments, which will be used for greater understanding of how to select and use assessments within mathematics education contexts. Again, this meets our broader impact aims because V-M<sup>2</sup>ED has published (or submitted) manuscripts in peer-review journals, led conference presentations internationally and nationally, and developed instruments and measures available for K-20 school and universities, as well as industry experts.&nbsp; A third outcome was creating an assessment compilation, which is available to the public (<a href="https://goo.gl/oYm1FG">https://goo.gl/oYm1FG</a>). This was created, in tandem with V-M<sup>2</sup>ED, and is linked to work from V-M<sup>2</sup>ED. A fourth outcome is a special issue of Investigations in Mathematics Learning, a mathematics education journal, exploring validity within mathematics education contexts. V-M<sup>2</sup>ED leadership served as editors and associated editors for a collection of three manuscripts (20% acceptance rate) that ignite others&rsquo; thinking about validity arguments. A fifth outcome was several presentations related to V-M<sup>2</sup>ED work. These include 2017 and 2016 presentations, and conference proceedings, disseminated at the annual meetings of the Psychology of Mathematics Education &ndash; North America. This outcome, like others, addresses intellectual merit aims to foster basic research activities focused on measurement and instrument development and use. It also functions as dissemination of work from V-M<sup>2</sup>ED thus acting as a broader impact. A sixth outcome includes two books, scheduled to be published by Routledge. The titles, <em>Quantitative Measures of Mathematical Knowledge: Researching Instruments and Perspectives</em>, and <em>Assessment in Mathematics Education Contexts: Theoretical Frameworks and New Directions</em>, include peer-reviewed chapters from a diverse set of authors that include V-M<sup>2</sup>ED attendees. The books are edited by Jonathan Bostic, Erin Krupa, and Jeff Shih (three of four V-M<sup>2</sup>ED leaders). Jonathan, Erin, Jeff, and Michelle Carney (the fourth V-M<sup>2</sup>ED leader) serve as collaborative authors for four chapters across the two books. These books serve as evidence of both intellectual merit and broader impact. Regarding intellectual merit, the chapters aim to inform and shape assessment practices and applied research within mathematics education contexts into the future, drawing upon new ideas generated from the V-M<sup>2</sup>ED conference. Regarding broader impact, the books aim to support scholars and industry experts current work. A related aim is to inform graduate-level education across psychometrics, applied measurement, and mathematics education contexts. The books were reviewed by experts prior to acceptance by Routledge and both reviewers commented that the books should be used as part of graduate-level education and in their own programs (and both noted as Very High Research activity according to the Carnegie Classification System). In sum, the funding from the National Science Foundation for V-M<sup>2</sup>ED has led to many significant outcomes that support broader impact and intellectual merit aims. We are incredibly thankful for this support and look forward to moving future projects on related topics to V-M<sup>2</sup>ED forward for consideration. <em>&nbsp;</em></p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 07/18/2018<br>      Modified by: Jonathan&nbsp;Bostic</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
