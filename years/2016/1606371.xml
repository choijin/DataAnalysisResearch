<AbstractNarration>This award is made as part of the FY 2016 Mathematical Sciences Postdoctoral Research Fellowships Program. Each of the fellowships supports a research and training project at a host institution in the mathematical sciences, including applications to other disciplines, under the mentorship of a sponsoring scientist. The title of the project for this fellowship to Kyler Siegel is "Fukaya categories, symplectic field theory, and symplectic flexibility." The host institution for the fellowship is Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and the sponsoring scientist is Paul Seidel.</AbstractNarration>

In the initial period I polished up work related to my doctoral thesis, resulting in the papers "Subflexible symplectic manifolds" and "Squared Dehn twists and deformed symplectic invariants".I then initiated a new project related to constructing symplectic capacities via higher homotopical algebra structures in Floer theory and symplectic field theory. This project has produced several papers addressing foundational and computational aspects of this endeavor. These include "Higher symplectic capacities", "Computing higher symplectic capacities I", "Counting curves with local tangency constraints", and "Higher symplectic capacities and the stabilized ellipsoid into polydisk problem". New results include a general framework for constructing symplectic capacities from higher algebraic structures, proof of concept results showing that these capacities give new obstructions which are often optimal, new algorithms to count pseudoholomorphic curves with local tangency constraints, a general calculus for computing higher symplectic capacities for a wide family of domains, a proof of many new cases of the stabilized ellipsoid embedding problem, and computer implementations of various algorithms for computing these symplectic invariants.Different parts of this work have been presented at several seminars and conferences, both domestic and abroad. In addition, further research conducted during this period is still being written up and I anticipate several additional research papers in the coming months. I also supervised a number of undergraduates on summer projects related to higher symplectic capacities and other computational aspects of symplectic geometry. Among other things, this resulted in a noval computer optimization approach to constructing symplectic embeddings between domains in Euclidean space.
