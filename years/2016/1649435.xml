<AbstractNarration>Iron is an essential micronutrient for marine phytoplankton, which plays a key role in the global carbon cycle and marine ecosystems, and there is a need to better understand the sources and sinks of this essential micronutrient in the oceans. Iron isotopes are a recently developed tracer of iron biogeochemical cycling, and new iron isotope results indicate that iron-binding ligands may play a critical role in the isotopic fractionation of dissolved iron. At present, however, the quantitative importance of iron dissolution or biological iron uptake in the isotopic fractionation of dissolved iron in the oceans is not well-known. In this study, researchers from the University of South Carolina and the Bermuda Institute of Ocean Sciences will collect and analyze samples from the Bermuda Atlantic Time-series Station (BATS) in order to; 1) measure the rate and isotope fractionation of iron dissolution from natural aerosols and oxic sediments in the presence of natural iron-binding ligands, and; 2) examine how phytoplankton fractionate iron isotopes during biological uptake. Results from this study will advance the development of iron isotopes as a tool for tracing iron biogeochemical cycling in the oceans.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The project will provide scientific training and development to undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral students. Results of the study will be used to raise public awareness of biogeochemical science via a webpage, outreach activities, and public tours at the Bermuda Institute of Ocean Sciences.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Iron is an important micronutrient for all living organisms. Within the oceans, low concentrations of iron often limit the growth of algae, which are the base of the marine food chain. Iron is made up primarily of two isotopes, Fe-54 and Fe-56, which differ in the number of neutrons contained within the nucleus. It has recently become possible to measure the ratio of these two isotopes with great accuracy in many Earth materials. There are now thousands of measurements of iron isotopes (denoted &delta;<sup>56</sup>Fe) in rocks, seawater, and living organisms. This project aimed to measure a small number of key Fe isotope fractionation factors experimentally, in order to better understand the processes which lead to natural variations in &delta;<sup>56</sup>Fe. Our work included a study which showed that iron isotope ratios remained constant for dissolved in seawater, colloids (extraordinarily small particles), and larger particles in the South Pacific, helping us to understand that iron does not easily move between these particles and the dissolved iron pool. Similarly, in a glacial river we found that iron isotopes did not change much during a nearly 1000-fold decrease in iron concentrations, showing that iron was lost by a physical mechanism such as small colloidal particles coagulating to form larger particles which sank, rather than by chemical reaction. Additionally, we have completed the largest-ever set of experiments on the fractionation of Fe isotopes during reduction of Fe(III) to Fe(II), finding that the isotopic fractionation depends on the pH of the solution, the reductant used, and the organic complexation of the iron atoms. With this information we are building models of how Fe redox chemistry affects the availability of Fe in the oceans, and how that affects the growth of algae and other organisms higher up the food chain.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 11/29/2018<br>      Modified by: Seth&nbsp;G&nbsp;John</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Image         </div> <div class="galControls onePhoto" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation onePhoto" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1649435/1649435_10257537_1543535012450_2018experimentalfinalfig--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1649435/1649435_10257537_1543535012450_2018experimentalfinalfig--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Experimental iron isotope fractionation compared with observations"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1649435/1649435_10257537_1543535012450_2018experimentalfinalfig--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Experimental iron isotope fractionation compared with observations"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Natural observed dissolved [Fe] and &#948;56Fe in glacial rivers (Zhang et al., 2015) and a hydrothermal plume (Fitzsimmons et al., 2017), compared with predicted [Fe] and &#948;56Fe if Fe loss were governed by Rayleigh distillation and isotope effects equal to those measured here.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Seth John</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Seth&nbsp;G&nbsp;John</div> <div class="imageTitle">Experimental iron isotope fractionation compared with observations</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
