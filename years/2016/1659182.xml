<AbstractNarration>The University of Guam (UoG) is partnering with two leadership institutions, the University of Hawai'i (UH) and the Network Startup Resource Center (NRSC) at University of Oregon to develop an advanced network designed to support research, education, and scientific discovery at the University of Guam. Together with UH and the NSRC, this project supports the implementation of an advanced campus network with a 10 Gigabit per second network connection between UoG and Internet2, capable of supporting high-speed exchanges of very large scientific data sets between Guam and other US research institutions. This project leverages two other NSF projects including the UH IRNC PIREN: the Pacific Islands Research and Education Network (ACI-1451058), and the NSRC's IRNC ENgage: Building Network Expertise and Capacity for International Science Collaboration (ACI-1451045). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The success of this Campus CyberInfrastructure project will lead to the creation of critical networking infrastructure and a skilled cyber-team capable of connecting the University of Guam to the global and regional research and education networking fabric. Over the long term, this project enables Guam to participate as a Trans-Pacific Research and Education Networking Hub for the Pacific Island Region, one of the most underserved regions worldwide. This investment advances the university's research and education mission by enabling UoG to participate with its national peers and improve the productivity and opportunities of its faculty.</AbstractNarration>

To accomplish these goals, UOG used a three-pronged approach working with leadership institutes to implement best practices, to establish ultra-high-speed global research and education network (REN) connectivity through the Guam Open Research &amp; Education eXchange (<strong><span style="font-weight: normal;">GOREX</span></strong>), and to develop the skills to implement and use CI best practices. This award directly supported the connection of the UOG campus to GOREX, a consortium providing high-speed internet connectivity of research networks between the US mainland, Asia, and Oceania. Connecting UOG to this network provides high-speed 10G fiber connectivity to the campus. UOG has become a key partner in GOREX, participating in weekly meetings with other participants to discuss network performance and necessary maintenance. Having access to this high-speed gateway, connecting to national and international research and education networks provides UOG&rsquo;s research community  the necessary connectivity for big data analyses and data sharing. In addition to networking connectivity upgrades, this CC* award supported UOG's Chief Infomration Officer and members of the Office of Information Technology to attend and organize training workshops nationally and internationally. These training and collaboration opportunities built UOG's cyber capabilities and network of collaborators. Building the cyber team increased support of research computing at UOG. For example, the cyber team lead the CC*-funded implementation of wireless connectivity upgrades at the Marine Laboratory and campus libraries.
