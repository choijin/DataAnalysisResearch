<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is the potential to bring a disruptive neutron detector technology to market, filling an urgent demonstrated need for real time, portable and wearable radiation detectors. Successful commercialization of the innovative Cerenkov BoroSilicate Glass (CBSG) technology will serve a broad customer base in the nuclear detection and verification industry. Market research indicates large scale potential, in the billions of dollars. This market is currently well served with gamma ray and x-ray detection devices, but the capabilities for portable and wearable neutron detectors are not as well established. The proposed technology will close this gap and is anticipated to have a very broad impact. The Cerenkov detector technology can also be transformative in enabling new kinds of directional arrays for neutron imaging and portal detectors, helping to make the nation's borders more secure against illicit nuclear materials and providing improved tools for nuclear safeguards and verification.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project aims to commercialize an innovative neutron detector module based 100% on solid-state technology. The overall objective of the project is to build on the successful Cerenkov BoroSilicate Glass (CBSG) detector prototyping in Phase I/IB to develop a small, low cost, modular neutron detector which can be integrated with existing gamma detector technologies to 1) form a comprehensive, scalable, networked solution to the problem of Special Nuclear Material detection; 2) enable inexpensive in-house and third party integration of neutron detection technology into radioisotope identification devices and personal radiation dosimeters; and 3) allow for  further testing and advanced product development relating to directional neutron detector networks, direct fast neutron detectors, and neutron spectroscopy. The research objectives include a thorough quantitative assessment of the detector front-end material response to neutron radiation and evaluation of its optoelectronic characteristics. In particular, in collaboration with a specialty glass manufacturer, the isotopic composition of glass front-end will be optimized for fast neutron detection. The anticipated result is a novel and disruptive neutron detection approach.</AbstractNarration>
