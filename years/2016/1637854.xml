<AbstractNarration>Despite vastly slower "hardware" and "wetware," human dexterity vastly out-performs modern robots. This project studies apparently-simple tasks - managing the kinematic constraint on hand motion required to open a door; and dealing with the dynamic complexity of liquid sloshing in a cup of coffee - that profoundly challenge robots but humans perform with ease. The key idea is that humans manage skillful physical interaction with these objects by exploiting clever combinations of primitive dynamic actions that do not require continuous intervention. A novel theory to describe the effectiveness of this approach is developed and tested by experiments with human subjects. The theory is applied to transfer comparable skill to robots, despite manifestly different hardware. If successful, these robots will be more capable, more comprehensible, and more collaborative partners with humans.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The central experimental challenge is to determine the essential strategy underlying humans? remarkable competence in physical interaction tasks. Three hypotheses reflecting major themes in contemporary motor neuroscience are tested: Humans 1) develop models of object dynamics sufficient to pre-compute and execute required hand motions (similar to modern robot programming); 2) choose forces and motions to minimize muscular effort (similar to optimizing efficiency); or 3) exploit dynamic primitives to robustly achieve satisficing (good-enough) performance. The theoretical challenge is to formulate a coherent account combining the information-processing of brains (or computers) with the "energy-processing" of physical objects and their interactions. Classical equivalent circuit theory is re-purposed to define a neo-classical equivalent network theory, combining dynamic motion primitives with mechanical impedances (interactive dynamics). Mechanical impedances enjoy a key property, compositionality, that overcomes the curse of dimensionality.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[Towards Robots with Human Dexterity It is probably self-evident that humans vastly out-perform robots, especially in tasks requiring dexterity, contact, and physical interaction with the world (as required in tool use). It may be less obvious that human ‘hardware’ (e.g. muscles) and ‘software’ (e.g. neural signals) are orders of magnitude slower and more noisy than those of modern robots. How do humans achieve their extremely skilled performance despite these limitations? The overarching goal of this collaborative research project was to improve robot performance and facilitate seamless human-robot physical collaboration. The way we approached this goal was:   first, to study how humans perform simple physical interaction tasks that robots typically find challenging;  second, to test a quantitative mathematical theory of how humans accomplish their superior performance; and  third, to demonstrate that a low-cost robot programmed according to this theory could successfully perform tasks requiring contact and physical interaction.   The tasks we studied included: managing kinematic constraints (as when opening a door);  and managing complex dynamic interactions (as when transporting a cup filled with sloshing liquid).   The quantitative theory we tested is that humans accomplish tasks like these by using a repertoire of well-learned and stereotyped ‘primitive’ dynamic actions which can be evoked by the central nervous system. The essence of this theory is that these ‘dynamic primitives’ require minimal central intervention as they ‘play out’ and produce behavior, thereby ‘working around’ the slow and noisy response of the neuromechanical system.   Intellectual Merit  Our first key finding was that humans seek to establish stability of their movements. Examining the control of a complex (nonlinear, underactuated) object, we showed that humans seek to make their movements stable. Using contraction analysis, we showed that humans learn movement strategies that make significant portions of their trajectories convergent, i.e., stable. The advantage is that convergent trajectories reject small perturbations from external sources or from internal neuromotor noise. This finding may guide possible control strategies for robot control.     Our second key finding was that humans exploit initial conditions to make interactions with complex objects stable. When starting movements from rest, humans necessarily go through a transient, unstable phase. Our experimental results show that humans learn optimal initial conditions that shorten start-up transients to arrive at a stable steady state as fast as possible. These results have implications for robotics: rather than designing locally stabilizing control policies to eliminate the effect of initial conditions, it is also possible to control a dynamical system by appropriately setting its initial conditions.

Interestingly, while this is beneficial (a ‘feature’) because it mitigates the need for precise control of either force or motion, we showed that it is also a drawback (a ‘bug’) insofar as humans are unable to control force independent of motion.     Our fourth key finding was that robot programming based on primitive dynamic actions is remarkably effective. We showed its ability to manage:   control of a robot arm where the desired endpoint behavior is not sufficient to define joint motions; coupled ‘closed-chain’ operation of 2 arms (without solving for joint motions compatible with contact); seamless operation in and out of singular configurations (where conventional motion-control lacks a mathematical solution); rapid motions and seamless transition into and out of contact (without switching between motion and force control);  guaranteed stable interaction with a poorly-modeled object.     Broader Impact  This research provided new insight about how the human neuromuscular system achieves its remarkable performance.
