<AbstractNarration>This doctoral dissertation research project investigates the work required from civilian communities in building peace during prolonged armed conflict between state and non-state armed groups. It offers four important contributions: (1) Perspectives and ideas provided by this project will be useful to many civilian communities affected by armed conflicts around the world in implementing community-led peacebuilding strategies; (2) Analysis on community-led peacebuilding will be useful to international peacebuilding practitioners, government officials, and policy-makers in the US and globally in designing and implementing bottom-up peacebuilding projects; (3) Data on indigenous processes required in protecting civilian lives during war will be useful toward understanding indigenous peacebuilding, an emerging theme at the United Nations (UN); (4) Research methodology and instruments provided by this project will be useful to civilian communities, civil society organizations, and scholars in evaluating community-led peacebuilding projects. As a Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement award, this award also will provide support to enable a promising student to establish a strong independent research career.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Given the limits of international peacebuilding interventions in sustaining peace in many places around the world, peace scholars and practitioners have focused on local peacebuilding practices in the last fifteen years. However, while this focus on local efforts in peacebuilding reveals the significance of practices and actors beyond the international level, most research remains focused on national actors and processes rather than grassroots peacebuilding practices. This project investigates one form of grassroots peacebuilding: the phenomenon of community-led peace zone. Through ethnographic methods of participant observation, semi-structured in-depth interviews, and archival research, this project examines (1) the daily work required from civilian communities in maintaining the peace zone; (2) the histories, values, and norms that the community draws upon to do so; and (3) the strategic relationships and interactions among civilians, state, non-state actors, and civil society organizations that allow communities to build and sustain peace. At stake in this project is a reconceptualization of peace beyond its dominant definition of the absence of violence, and peacebuilding as a state-led, expert-driven, and technical project of conflict resolution. Although this doctoral dissertation research project will focus on local peacebuilding in the Philippines, the research will provide new insights and approaches for maintaining peace at the local civilian level in areas with chronic armed conflict in many places, including localities in the United States.</AbstractNarration>

As a Political and Cultural Geographer, Macaspac was interested in understanding the phenomenon of the peace zones and the ways in which civilian communities sustain their legitimacy in the context of a  prolonged and active armed conflict between state and non-state actors.

More broadly, in his dissertation, Macaspac examined the ways in which civilian communities can protect their lives during an active war between state and non-state actors and the spatial practices of doing so. Macaspac traveled to the Philippines to study the community-led peace zone established by the indigenous community of Sagada, a municipality in Mountain Province in the Cordillera Administrative Region (CAR)  in northern Philippines. Through mixed qualitative methods of in-depth interviews and participant observation along with archival research, he examined the processes through which the indigenous community of Sagada maintains the legitimacy of the peace zone in the context of an active armed conflict between the Government of the Republic of the Philippines and a Maoist rebel group, the New People?s Army (NPA). Macaspac interviewed fifty (50) interlocutors comprising of municipal officials, community leaders and members, professionals, church officials, women, among others. These semi- and unstructured interviews lasted between thirty minutes to over two hours. Macaspac also interviewed fifteen (15) of my interlocutors at least three (3) times for over two hours per interview.  During interviews Macaspac asked open-ended questions regarding the socio-political, economic, cultural, and historical context that led the indigenous community to make Sagada a peace zone, key challenges and achievements of community initiatives in protecting civilian lives throughout almost fifty years of active armed conflict between the GRP and NPA, daily life in the community, individual and collective understandings of peace, individual and community aspirations, person-specific and community concerns. Other topics included indigeneity, insurgency, counterinsurgency, economic and community development, human rights, indigenous peoples? rights, land and land use, agriculture and other sources of livelihood, and migration.  Further, in Sagada, Macaspac grounded himself in two institutions. First, the Office of the Sangguniang Bayan (SB) or the legislative council of the municipal government of Sagada. SB is presided by the municipal vice mayor and composed of 12 municipal councilors including an appointed Indigenous Peoples Representative to the SB. Macaspac observed a number of weekly meetings of the SB as well as the consultations and interactions between SB councilors after the meeting.

MRDC also facilitates grassroots organizing among community elders, women, youth, and professionals in Sagada and facilitates community negotiations with state institutions and other NGOs. To better understand the emergence of the peace zone and the community-led efforts to protect their own lives in the context of the broader political and historical conditions in the last thirty years, Macaspac also  examined foundational documents of the peace zone including municipal resolutions, community petitions and transcripts of community meetings, and dialogues with the military and rebels kept in the SB office to which he was accorded access by the municipal government. Overall, the activities Macaspac had undertaken were consistent to most of the activities planned in the research proposal and as informed by preliminary research and early stages of fieldwork.  Further, his time in the field allowed him to better understand that the processes of maintaining the legitimacy of the peace zone of the indigenous community of Sagada are contingent upon the shifting processes and intermittent violence and violations of the regulations set by the community in regards to the conduct of the armed conflict within their municipality. Macaspac formulated the term insurgent peace to capture these dynamic processes of peace that tend to be obscured within the dominant understanding of peace as the absence of violence. Having accomplished data collection in the field throughout all stages of fieldwork, he presented his initial findings and analysis to key interlocutors as the final activity in the field.
