<AbstractNarration>This award will support student and postdoc attendance at the Conference on Chaining Methods and their Applications to Computer Science (CMACS), which will take place June 22 - 23, 2016, in Cambridge, Massachusetts.  The conference's technical content and professional networking opportunities are particularly valuable to students and postdocs.  This award will provide partial support to approximately 16 attendees to defray costs of registration fees, shared hotel rooms, and travel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chaining is a method for bounding the maximum of a collection of dependent random variables that can be much more efficient than performing a simple union bound.  Within computer science it has a diverse array of applications to problems related to coding theory, random walks on graphs, dimensionality reduction, compressed sensing, manifold learning, dictionary learning, streaming algorithms, and more.  This conference aims to popularize chaining in the theoretical computer science (TCS) community by having invited speakers both from the pure probability community and from TCS.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The PI in June 2016 co-organized the conference "Chaining Methods and their Applications to Computer Science" at Harvard University, with Assaf Naor (see https://toc.seas.harvard.edu/cmacs). Slides and videos are publicly available at the conference website.     Chaining is a specific way of thinking, related mostly to maximal inequalities and multiscale considerations, for bounding the maximum of a collection of (dependent) random variables. In short, it is a method that is often much more efficient than performing a vanilla union bound. Chaining dates back to work of Kolmogorov, but since then has been further developed by Dudley, Fernique, Talagrand, and many others. Today, within computer science it has found a diverse array of applications to problems related to coding theory, random walks on graphs, dimensionality reduction, compressed sensing, manifold learning, dictionary learning, streaming algorithms, and more. In this conference, a mixture of probabilists and computer scientists were invited to speak and share both the theory behind chaining, as well as applications to problems in computer science.     The number of conference attendees was 145, not including 12 additional speakers. CMACS was immediately after STOC 2016, also in Cambridge, MA, which helped to attract many attendees. STOC is one of the two premier annual conferences in theoretical computer science.  Some statistics about the attendees: 73.1% grad students, 12.2% postdoctoral fellows, 11.5% faculty. Two attendees identified as research scientists, one as an undergraduate, and two as other.  Of registrants, 68.6% identified their home community as theoretical computer science, 14.1% as machine learning, 6.4% mathematics, 3.2% statistics, 2.6% signal processing, and 5.1% as none or other.     This NSF award was used to support attendance (transportation and accommodations) for 14 graduate students (one of whom was also a speaker), as well as two postdoctoral fellows.
