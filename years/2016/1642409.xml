<AbstractNarration>This project will support the continued development of the Cooperating Computing Tools (CCTools)software, which provides scientists with the ability to distribute existing simulation and analysis software codes to large numbers of computers in commercial clouds, advanced supercomputers, or both.  As a result, research in fields such as physics, biology, and chemistry can be accelerated, in some cases, by a hundred- or even a thousand-fold.  Staff and students involved in this project will develop new software capabilities and work closely with scientific communities to improve their productivity in advanced computing facilities.  The project will also help to develop a technical workforce by training graduate and undergraduate students in advanced software engineering skills.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Today's computational scientist has access to an extraordinary range of computing facilities, including thousands of cores and petabytes of storage drawn from commercial cloud providers, university clusters, or national computing resources. However, end users often want to connect these systems in ways that the designers did not anticipate. They may wish to access data at one facility, run software at a second facility, and store the results at yet another. However, combining infrastructure is much harder than it ought to be, because most resources assume that their users only live within that particular closed world. Programs built in one environment may not run in another; data stored in one system may not be accessible in another; specialized programming models may be fast on one machine, but useless on another machine. Researchers do not want to be tied down to a single system; rather, they want standard programs to execute easily across all environments. This project will create new features and support users of the Cooperating Computing Tools (CCTools) software which provides scientific users with the ability to harness large scale cyber-infrastructure for data intensive scientific applications. The key components are the Parrot virtual filesystem, the Makeflow workflow system, and the Work Queue application framework. These components can be used separately or together to take existing POSIX applications and scale them up from a single laptop all the way to national scale infrastructure. This project will advance the development of the CCTools software to meet the changing technology landscape in three key respects: exploiting container technologies, making efficient use of local concurrency, and performing capacity management at the workflow scale. This grant will support a small team of students and staff who will engage user communities to understand their needs, sustain and extend the software on current cyberinfrastructure, and perform outreach and education to users both new and old. The project will focus on active user communities in high energy physics, which rely on Parrot for global scale filesystem access in campus clusters and the Open Science Grid; bioinformatics users executing complex workflows via the VectorBase, LifeMapper, and CyVerse disciplinary portals, and ensemble molecular dynamics applications that harness GPUs from XSEDE and commercial clouds.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This grant supported the continued development of the Cooperative Computing Tools (CCTools), a open-source software toolkit for distributing computing.  This software simplifies the process of harnessing large scale computing systems such as high performance computers, university clusters, and cloud computing systems.  By making use of this toolkit, end users are able to write applications that scale up to tens of thousands of processors.  A unique element of this software is that it is designed to run with ordinary user privileges, and is therefore easily installed and deployed by end users without requiring help from administrators.  The software is deployed through common open source channels (Conda) and is downloaded and installed thousands of times per month by users worldwide.  Intellectual Merit -  This project advanced the fields of computer science and cyberinfrastructure by providing new ways of expressing complex scientific applications and improving the efficiency and reliability of those applications when run on very large facilities.  We developed a new workflow language (JX) that allows for the compact representation of a large number of tasks without repeating common elements.  We created techniques for transforming tasks as they pass from stage to stage, so that they can be specialized to local circumstances.   We developed new techniques to ensure that each component of an application is given sufficient resources (cores, memory, and disk) so that it is able to run successfully without taking resources away from other parts of the application.  We developed new techniques for detecting and handling complex software dependencies within applications, so that they can be easily moved from site to site, and not fail due to missing dependent software components.   Broader Impacts - This software enabled advances in productivity and discovery in a variety of allied scientific fields, including high energy physics, bioinformatics, climate studies, agricultural studies, and machine learning.  Undergraduate and graduate students employed by the project received practical training in software engineering techniques of value to industry.  We developed and delivered training classes and seminars on distributed computing to students at Notre Dame, the University of Arizona, the University of Wisconsin, and the XSEDE and PEARC conferences.
