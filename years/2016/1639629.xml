<AbstractNarration>In computational complexity theory, the performance of an algorithm is traditionally defined by its worst-case resource usage as the size of the input tends to infinity. In practice, this asymptotic worst-case measure may be inappropriate for several reasons: the worst-case performance may occur only for contrived instances that never occur in practice; the instances occurring in practice may have special structural features; the average-case performance of the algorithm may be much better than its worst case; or heuristic algorithms may empirically be observed to perform well. The workshop will focus on these non-worst-case phenomena. It will explore probabilistic models of the input distribution, structured classes of inputs such as planted models, and empirical measurement of performance. The goal will be to provide tools best suited for the practical evaluation of algorithms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop will enhance communication among the mathematics, computer science, statistics and operations research communities. It will be open to all potential participants, and the workshop findings (including video recordings of presentations) will be distributed to the public for comment and engagement. The organizers will encourage students to attend the workshop, and will actively recruit scientists from a diversity of backgrounds to contribute to a wide range of applications.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This workshop entitled "Learning, Algorithm Design and Beyond Worst-Case Analysis" was the second in the thematic semester on Algorithms and Uncertainty.  The workshop took place the week of Nov 14-18, 2016 and was organized by Nir Ailon, Maria-Florina Balcan, Avrim Blum, Ravi Kumar, Kevin Leyton-Brown, and Tim Roughgarden. The workshop was devoted to bringing together researchers from different areas to explore ways to bridge the gap between the pessimistic predictions of worst-case theoretical analysis and the more positive experience of empirical studies surrounding what are commonly viewed as computationally hard problems.  Themes of the workshop included the design of well-motivated non-worst-case approaches to the analysis of algorithms and problems, the development of techniques that can take advantage of underlying structure in instances, lessons based on empirical algorithmic performance, and approaches for using techniques from theoretical and applied machine learning in order to design methods for both algorithm configuration and algorithm selection.   Workshop speakers were drawn from multiple research areas including algorithms, learning theory, and AI, as well as application areas including auction design, hardware and software verification, and sustainability.  The workshop took place over the course of five days, and was designed in each day to mix theoretical and application-oriented investigations.  For example, the first day contained several theoretical talks on non-worst-case models for analyzing graph partitioning and clustering algorithms (along with a survey of non-worst-case theoretical models) followed by two application-focused talks: one on scheduling problems and one on Mixed Integer Programming.   Similar mixing of theoretical and application-oriented talks occurred on the other days as well.  The workshop also contained a significant machine learning component.  This manifested itself in two distinct ways.  The first was analysis of computational problems arising from machine learning applications, such as nearest-neighbor search, semantic hashing, clustering, and non-negative matrix factorization.  The second was the use of machine learning ideas for the design of algorithms that automatically adapt to the distribution of problem instances that arise in a given application domain, or even to the individual instances themselves.  This latter direction was both explored theoretically and demonstrated empirically to produce significant algorithmic benefits.  The afternoon of the middle day of the workshop contained a substantial discussion period, where participants discussed relations among different talks and asked questions of the earlier speakers. One lively discussion topic concerned properties of Satisfiability instances arising from application domains that seem to be making them easier to solve than worst-case analysis would suggest.  For example, in many application domains, the variable incidence graph exhibits significant community structure, which seems to explain some but not all of what makes them easier to solve. Another lively discussion topic concerned machine learning-based approaches to algorithm design.  Each evening of the workshop included an optional social event where participants who wished could continue research discussions in an informal and relaxed setting.  Participants reported these events being a valuable and enjoyable component of their workshop experience.           Last Modified: 11/13/2017       Submitted by: Richard M Karp]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
