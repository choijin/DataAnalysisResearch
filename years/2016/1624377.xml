<AbstractNarration>With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation Program (MRI) and support from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program (CRIF), Professor David Blauch from Davidson College and colleagues Durwin Striplin, Cindy Hauser and Nicole Snyder have acquired a liquid chromatograph mass spectrometer (LCMS) equipped with electrospray-ionization (ESI) and atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI) sources coupled to the liquid chromatograph. Mass spectrometry (MS) is an analytical technique used to identify the chemical composition of a sample and to determine its purity by measuring the mass of the molecular constituents in the sample. Chromatography is an isolation technique that precedes the mass spectrometry analysis. It separates a mixture of components in a liquid into its several constituent chemicals which are then analyzed and identified by the mass spectrometer.  The electrospray produces an aerosol of ions by applying a high voltage to the sample. These are some of the most widely used analytical instrumentation techniques used to identify and quantify the chemical composition of a sample. The acquisition strengthens the research infrastructure at the University and regional area. The instrument broadens participation by involving diverse students in research and research training with this modern analytical technique and also and also supports research efforts from two other local universities, Queens University of Charlotte, a masters-level regional university, and Johnson C. Smith University, an HBCU.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The award is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels, especially in areas such as (a) developing chromophores and redox assemblies for solar energy conversion; (b) synthesizing and profiling complex carbohydrate constructs with proteins and other biomolecules; and (c) examining the reactivity of non-innocent ligand-metal complexes.</AbstractNarration>

The LC-MS has also supported the research of Prof. Bradley Wile (chemistry) at Ohio Northern University.  As a result of their experience with this advanced instrument, students are better prepared for professional school and for employment as members of a global scientific workforce.  The ways in which the LC-MS have been used in research are summarized below.  Prof. David Blauch (PI) has identified products resulting from the oxidation of amines bound to the metals.  This research expands our understanding of how metals can be used catalyze chemical transformations. Hookah smoking is a popular social activity for college-aged students.  Analysis of the toxicity of hookah smoke has focused on compounds found in cigarette smoke.  However, the smoking methods and material are quite different.  Prof. Cindy Hauser (Co-PI) uses the LC-MS to perform non-targeted analysis of the chemical composition of particulate matter in hookah smoke, that display differences in toxicity using acellular and cellular assays, to identify potential toxicants that are unique to hookah.  The LC-MS is critical instrumentation that advances Prof. Nicole Snyder?s (Co-PI) research on the identification and characterization of novel glycoconjugates for studying fundamental processes at the interface of chemistry and biology.  Prof. Durwin Striplin (Co-PI) has determined the structures of polyproline chains containing molecular units for absorbing light and transferring electrons.  This project seeks to develop new materials for capturing and using solar energy.  Prof. Jeff Myers (chemistry, Davidson College) has used the LC-MS to confirm the identity of human protein alpha synuclein and chemical modifications of this protein.  This research examines the fibrillation of alpha synuclein and its role in Parkinson?s disease.  Prof. Mitch Anstey (chemistry, Davidson College) has obtained structural information to track and confirm synthetic methods for preparing new compounds for use in redox flow batteries, which is an important energy-storage technology.  Prof. Malcolm Campbell (biology, Davidson College) uses programmed evolution to produce cells that synthesize specific metabolites of practical value.  The LC-MS has been used to detect and identify metabolic products.  Lignin is a major waste product from the paper industry.  Prof. Aaron Socha (chemistry, Queens University of Charlotte) is developing new ionic liquids that are derived from lignin or are effective in dissolving and processing lignin.  The LC-MS has been used to confirm the identities of new ionic liquids and to track and refine synthetic routes to ionic liquids.  Prof. Scott Weir (biology, Queens University of Charlotte) has identified and quantified rodenticides and pesticides as part of his work in environmental toxicology.
