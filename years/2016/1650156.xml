<AbstractNarration>Large-scale, caldera-forming volcanic eruptions, for example those characteristic of Yellowstone National Park, owe their explosivity and widespread impact to the composition of molten rock called magma that fuels their plumbing systems. Yet, the generation of such magma plumbing systems, and how the erupted volcanic rock rhyolite is related to the unerupted magma that crystallizes at depth to form plutons of rock called granite that makes up the continental crust which we live on, remains unknown and highly controversial among earth scientists. Our study focuses on the formation of a plutonic body of granite in the southern Andes in Chile that preserves a record of processes required to generate large quantities of potentially explosive volcanic rhyolite.  We will map spatially distinct rock types, measure their compositions, and determine the compositions of the constituent minerals that comprise this very young, and exceptionally well-exposed pluton. A multidisciplinary approach using modern geochemical methods, geochronology, and numerical modeling will then be used to interpret the processes, timescales, and thermal history of magma that are preserved in this pluton.  We aim to bring the discipline of igneous petrology one step closer to a universal model of magma dynamics that incorporates both the plutonic and volcanic realms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;High silica granites are hypothesized to form via crystal-melt fractionation in the shallow crust yet, the resulting crystal residues are rarely identified and can be difficult to distinguish from plutons whose compositions plot along liquid lines of descent. Bulk rock compositional mass balance in the late Miocene Risco Bayo-Huemul plutonic complex in the Southern Andes of Chile suggests that lithological differences reflect crystal concentration in response to melt extraction. We aim to combine field observations with U-Pb petrochronology of zircon and titanite, 40Ar/39Ar thermochronology, compositional and isotopic measurements of whole rocks and minerals within the plutonic complex, and thermal modeling to: (1) establish the rates and mechanisms of emplacement, (2) identify individual magma batches and assess any interaction between them, (3) determine the timescales of crystallization and cooling of individual magma batches and system-wide, (4) establish petrogenetic relationships between the Risco Bayo and Huemul plutons including subdomains within each, and (5) evaluate whether eruptible rhyolitic melt may have formed within this system. This young plutonic complex preserves a detailed record of a process commonly associated with the formation of rhyolite that has propelled large silicic eruptions during the past million years within the adjacent Andean subduction zone.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project focused on understanding the conditions under which magma accumulates in the upper crust and evolves to form large batches of melt that can erupt in catastrophic volcanic events.  The field area included the Risco Bayo and Huemel plutons, in central Chile, which expose cross sections through an upper crustal magmatic system of variable compositions.  Our approach to studying this system was to carry out detailed field work to understand map patterns and relative ages between the different rock types, examination of textures and compositions across each rock type, determine absolute ages through U-Pb zircon geochronology, calibrate the thermal histories of the plutons using Ar-Ar thermochronology, and to integrate these datasets with 4D numerical thermal modeling. The resulting hypothesized model for the evolution of the system includes the intrusion of several discreet batches of magma of mafic to intermediate composition at about 7 million years ago, followed by the intrusion of a felsic batch of magma hundreds of thousands of years later, which then formed a crystalline magma mush during cooling that resulted in high-silica granitic melt that was extracted from the mush and ponded in an upper crustal magma reservoir.  Zircon and whole-rock compositions from the residual cumulate and extracted melt are consistent with geochemical modeling for a system involving crystal-melt separation.  Furthermore, dynamic thermal numerical modeling for magma crystallization, melt extraction, zircon saturation and crystallization and ultimately cooling are consistent with the petrochronological constraints determined through U-Pb and Ar-Ar geochronology.  This model informs a hypothesis for generating moderate- to large-volume high-silica, explosive volcanic eruptions fed by upper crustal magma chambers that accumulated and segregated from a crystal mush on timescales of less than a few hundred thousand years.  These timescales are similar to those estimated by crystal populations and geochronology of similarly sized high-silica eruptions in a host of geologic settings and therefore may be a more generally applicable model for volcanic centers.    This project directly funded one PhD student and was carried out with another PhD student involved in the fieldwork.  The analytical campaign included multiple academic laboratories and industry laboratories and involved the training of the PhD students, undergraduates and lab personnel.  It also brought together multiple PIs and students in the field in Chile, where they discussed volcanic and plutonic magmatic processes in subduction zone systems with North American, European, and Chilean scientists.  Our findings are published in several peer-reviewed journals and have been disseminated as well at international scientific meetings.
