<AbstractNarration>Classical probability theory was built largely upon modeling systems with no or weak correlations; random matrix statistics, on the other hand, provide essentially the only known general laws for highly correlated systems. The central question for random matrix theory is to determine to what extent random matrix statistics prevail in random systems. Mathematically, this question is generally referred to as the universality conjecture, which asserts that random matrix statistics are independent of the distributions of the matrix elements. The investigator and collaborators previously studied special cases of this conjecture. This project will develop this direction further and will study applications of the universality conjecture to statistics, combinatorics, mathematical physics, and computer science, bringing together researchers from probability theory and these other fields. The project is likely to result in fruitful collaborations with statisticians and computer scientists on the analysis of large random matrices. The project will also support the training through research involvement of mathematics graduate students working on cutting-edge topics in probability theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wigner's vision that the local spectral statistics of large correlated quantum systems are modeled by random matrix statistics is a groundbreaking idea in probability theory and statistical physics. The investigator and collaborators previously proved the universality of the local spectral statistics for both Wigner and beta ensembles. These results are important first steps in understanding Wigner's vision. The project's goal is to extend this understanding to random matrices that have significant physical properties. The following four projects will be addressed: 1. Optimal relaxation time for Dyson Brownian motion. 2. Universality of spectral statistics of d-regular graphs for small d, which is a highly important topic in statistics, computer science, and large data analysis. 3. Quantum unique ergodicity and universality of band matrices. This project seeks to show that quantum unique ergodicity and universality appear essentially concurrently. 4. Local density fluctuation and linear statistics of Coulomb gases.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[     Intellectual Merits:  We have developed technique  to extend the recent  universality theory of mean field  random matrices   to non-mean field models such as random band matrices. One key tool in our method results in  a proof of  a strong form of  probabilistic  quantum unique ergodicity regarding  probability distributions of the eigenvectors.  In a different direction in random matrix theory, we made major progresses in understanding  the role of sparsity in random matrices.  In particular,  we  discovered a Gaussian to Tracy-Widom  transition in  the edge spectral statistics of the adjacency matrices of sparse Erdos-Renyi graphs. However, this transition is completely eliminated in the d-regular graphs. The highlights of results supported by this grant   are summarized  in the following.       1. Edge eigenvalue statistics of Erdos-Renyi. We consider the statistics of the extreme eigenvalues of sparse random matrices, a class of random matrices that includes the normalized adjacency matrices of the  Erdos-Renyi graph G(N,p). Tracy-Widom fluctuations of the extreme eigenvalues for p&gt; N^{-2/3} was proved by Lee and Schnelli recently. We prove that there is a crossover in the behavior of the extreme eigenvalues at p around the size of  N^{-2/3}.  Under a mean zero condition and when p=CN^{-2/3}, we find that the fluctuations of the extreme eigenvalues are given by a combination of the Gaussian and the Tracy-Widom distribution. These results show that the eigenvalues at the edge of the spectrum of sparse Erdos-Renyi graphs are less rigid than those of random d-regular graphs  of the same average degree.     2. GOE Statistics for Levy Matrices.  We establish eigenvector delocalization and bulk universality for Levy matrices, which are real, symmetric, N by N random matrices  whose  entries are independent, identically distributed alpha-stable laws. If alpha is between 1 and 2,   we show that every eigenvector  is completely delocalized and that the local spectral statistics   converge to those of the Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble (GOE) as N becomes large.            Broader Impacts: Our result on the   Gaussian to Tracy-Widom  transition in  the edge spectral statistics for the  sparse Erdos-Renyi graphs suggests that the principal component method widely used in large data analysis should be carefully adjusted when the noise is sparse. In addition, the PI have co-organized several workshops (e.g., the Charles River Lectures, Ahlfors Lectures, Annual Big Data Conference) jointly with  the statistics,  economics and  computer science  departments of MIT,  Harvard  and Microsoft Research.  The PI  also supervised  several graduate students and post-doctors, and  served as an undergraduate thesis adviser for several students.
