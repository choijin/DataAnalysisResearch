<AbstractNarration>Modern processing of signals is almost always performed on the digital (discretized) version of the original signals, which is obtained by sampling the signals on a discrete set. One of the fundamental issues when converting an analog (continuous) signal to a digital (discrete) one is the following question: Can the original signals be recovered from the samples, and if so, how accurately? The answer, of course, depends heavily on the nature of the signals that are being processed. For example, signals that are more complex (oscillatory) in nature require more samples for accurate reconstruction. The precise mathematical relationship between the rate of oscillation and the required rate of sampling is surprisingly delicate, especially when the samples are non-uniform. This project is centered on the problem of understanding precisely this relationship, including several other mathematical questions that arise naturally from it. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Analytic function spaces have always played an important role in the mathematical theory of signal processing. One natural class of such spaces that is particularly useful when studying non-uniform sampling is the class of de Branges spaces. Introduced in the sixties, the theory of de Branges spaces encompassed a great deal of mathematical analysis knowledge at that time, and it continues to play an important role in modern mathematics, providing a setting for the interplay of various areas of mathematics, including Fourier analysis, spectral theory, operator theory, random matrix theory, analytic number theory, and mathematical physics. The main research objective of this project is to conduct a deeper analysis of de Branges function spaces, and use the resulting findings to attack and resolve several long-standing open problems. Many of these problems are much more general in nature and go far beyond the setting of de Branges spaces. The reason that de Branges spaces serve as a model rests on the fact that this class of spaces already exhibits most of the key difficulties confronting signal processors. Another important goal of this project is to develop a theory that will unify the theory of classical function spaces, and use this unification as a guideline for developing new methods for resolving the remaining open questions about these spaces.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  The following (in no particular order) are the most significant research outcomes of this project.  1. Logvinenko-Sereda theorem for the annulus. The classical version of the Logvinenko-Sereda theorem characterizes the sets that can be used for stable reconstruction of band-limited signals. We show that essentially the same class of sets can be used for the reconstruction of functions with Fourier spectrum contained in an annulus, with the reconstruction constant depending only on the width of the annulus. We used this new form of the uncertainty principle from harmonic analysis to deduce control, observability, and stabilization for the wave equation in unbounded domains.  2. Density results for Riesz sequences (strongly independent) complex exponentials and other related systems. We were able to show that sets that allow interpolation must satisfy an important density upper bound. Our result is very general and is applicable in wide variety of reproducing kernel spaces. In addition, we later improved this result by providing a similar density result valid for approximate interpolation. All these density results can be interpreted as another manifestation of the uncertainty principle.    3. Improved fractal uncertainty principle. This is a relatively new form of the uncertainty principle discovered recently by Bourgain and Dyatlov who originally used it to prove existence of an essential spectral gap for all convex co-compact hyperbolic surfaces. The same result was later used to prove control, observability, and stabilization for the wave equation on hyperbolic surfaces. Using a different approach, based on quasi-analyticity, we were able to obtain a sharper form of their fractal uncertainty principle which is applicable to even denser fractals.   4. General Balian-Low theorem. The classical Balian-Low theorem is another manifestation of the uncertainty principle which prevents us to find a "good/well localized basis" to simultaneously diagonalize the multiplication and the differentiation operator, and consequently prevents us to find a good well localized basis to study partial differential operators. We obtained a quantification of this uncertainty in the general case of non-commuting self-adjoint operators with a positive commutator, that, roughly speaking, shows that even if use approximate common eigenvectors, we cannot achieve nothing even close to diagonalization.
