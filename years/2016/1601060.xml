<AbstractNarration>According to the 2015 (ISC)2 global workforce study, the information security workforce shortfall is widening as the demand for security practitioners is dangerously outpacing the current supply. Of the almost 1,400 survey respondents, 62% stated that their organizations have too few information security professionals, which is a 6% increase from their 2013 survey. This shortfall is serious and estimated to reach 1.5 million security practitioners by 2020. This project entitled Cyber Service at Union County College (UCC) in New Jersey is designed to address this critical cybersecurity workforce shortage of the nation. The innovative curricular design focuses on the education of middle skill cyber forensics technicians. Experiential education and service learning are integrated into the curriculum to keep students engaged, to provide critical workforce readiness skills, and to instill a commitment to community service. By incorporating a community-based, service-learning capstone experience into the associate-degree program. Cyber Service is designed to advance a diverse group of students prepared to enter the well-paying industry of cyber forensics as middle-skilled technicians. The project plans for least 35% of students in the program to be identified as belonging to a population traditionally under-represented in science, technology, engineering, or mathematics (STEM) fields (e.g., female, African American, and Hispanics). Cyber Service has great potential to serve as a national model for other community colleges.  National dissemination of curricular and service-learning materials specifically developed for cyber forensics technicians is planned through the National CyberWatch Center, ATE Central, ATE TV, and the Association for Computing Machinery Committee for Computing Education in Community Colleges (ACM CCECC), as well as national cyber education and experiential education conferences.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Cyber Service will address the urgent need to increase the pool of skilled cyber forensics technicians to fill high-demand jobs by employers in the northern New Jersey and New York City metropolitan region, and to improve student retention and persistence in the attainment of post-secondary credentials while preparing graduates with 21st century career ready skills. The project will adapt four digital forensics courses from the NSF ATE Advanced Cyberforensics Education (ACE) consortium. Cyber Service will then extend the work of ACE by creating three new courses that complement the consortium courses and by integrating innovative experiential education and service-learning throughout the program courses. The three new courses are 1) cloud computing and mobile device forensics, 2) cyber law and ethics, and 3) service-learning cyber capstone. The expert project team will develop a series of embedded, stackable certificates designed to culminate in an associate of applied science degree in cyber forensics investigations that is mapped to federal standards. Upon completion of the associate degree, students will be well prepared to sit for industry certification exams appropriate to cyber forensics, such the AccessData Certified Examiner. The new Cyber Capstone is a culminating course that allows students to demonstrate their interdisciplinary knowledge and technical skills learned in both the adopted and newly developed courses, as well as to build 21st century career-ready abilities and civic responsibilities through service-learning field experiences with community partners.  An extensive evaluation, based on the Program Evaluation Standards of the American Evaluation Association,is planned to ensure that the project documents its achievements and improves it effectiveness relative to student success and employer satisfaction.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The NSF Cyber Service! ATE Project addressed the urgent need to increase the pool of middle-skilled cyberforensics technicians to fill in-demand careers located in the northern New Jersey and New York City megalopolis. After three years, the project produced several outcomes that continue to have a long-lasting impact beyond the life of the grant funding.  Outcome: ATE Impacts Book (see image)  The Cyber Service! project was selected through a competitive process for inclusion in the 2018-2019 ATE Impacts book. The ATE Centers and the best of the best ATE projects were included in this publication,   https://ateimpacts.net/book.  Outcome: New Associate Degree Program  The A.A.S. workforce degree, Cyber Forensics, was designed to improve student retention in the attainment of post-secondary credentials, while preparing graduates with 21st-century career ready skills. Experiential education and service-learning were integrated into this innovative model curriculum to keep students engaged, provide workforce readiness skills, and to instill a commitment to community service. Cyber Forensics was created at Union County College with courses adapted from the ATE Advanced Cyberforensics Consoritum (ACE) alongside new courses developed by the Cyber Service! PIs.

The associate degree with program course syllabi are available for adoption and adaption at https://ate.community/cyberservice. An independent project evaluation is also available at that website.  Outcome: New Courses  The Cyber Law and Ethics course was adopted by the National CyberWatch Center as part of that ATE Center's model digital forensics curriculum, https://www.nationalcyberwatch.org/programs-resources/curriculum/certificate/digital-forensics/. This non-technical program course is unique, blending together sensitive issues of both law and ethics that permeate cyberspace.  The Cloud and Personal Device Forensics technical program course is also unique in that it combines forensic skills for complimentary technologies, Internet and mobile computing, which are used frequently together. This course covers emerging forensic tools and techniques used to recover evidence from cloud storage providers and from mobile devices, such as cell phones, smartwatches, and IoT devices.  The Cyber Forensics Capstone is a culminating program course for students to demonstrate their interdisciplinary cyber knowledge and technical skills acquired in previous coursework, as well as to build civic responsibilities through service-learning field experiences with community partners. Students continue developing the soft skills required to excel in careers and meet social media demands of the 21st century by interacting with professionals in contemporary workplaces. This course combines on-campus meetings, service placement with non-profit partners, and independent projects.
