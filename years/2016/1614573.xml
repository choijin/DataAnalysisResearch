<AbstractNarration>This proposal is to study the evolutionary changes that have been occurring in wild yeasts in the last several decades. Yeast are one of the oldest domesticated organisms, but it was only recently that wild yeasts resistant to herbicide Roundup became known. The highest levels of resistance are observed in the strains collected from agricultural soils that have been treated with Roundup in the last 40 years. In depth genetic analysis of six strains definitively showed that resistance is achieved in a different way from what is observed in Roundup-resistant plants. State-of-the-art genome sequencing technologies will be applied to study the genetic changes that have caused these adaptations to a chemical that is not observed in nature. The project will be done with the help of 6-12th grade students from rural West Virginia schools, science outreach programs at WVU Arboretum and Upward Bound (a TRiO program), in which citizen scientists will find and study yeasts from their own neighborhoods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this project is to identify genes that vary in S. cerevisiae strains with different resistance to herbicides. The working hypothesis is that Roundup resistance is linked to polymorphic regions of the genome that have been selected for by exposure to Roundup. The approach to addressing this question is to map Quantitative Trait Loci (QTL) responsible for herbicide resistance by using recombinant haploid collections between sensitive and resistant strains. With the high-throughput sequencing approaches, responsible gene products will be identified, most likely in chorismate metabolism, small molecule transport and possibly other pathways. The collection of isolates and their preliminary characterization will be done through several outreach and citizen-science initiatives.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Glyphosate-based herbicides are the most widely used herbicide and have far-reaching impacts on the environment and public opinions. We have found that the rise of glyphosate-resistant weeds was not the first environmental impact. From the historical collection, glyphosate-resistant yeast appeared immediately after the commercial release of glyphosate, the active ingredient in RoundUp?. In sequenced yeast, we determined which genes contributed to herbicide resistance. We had anticipated pathways involved in glyphosate transport and amino acid sensing as glyphosate inhibits the synthesis of aromatic amino acids. However, we found that the most resistant yeast had differences in the cell wall and mitochondrial function. Mammals and insects do not have the biochemical target of glyphosate; however, fungi and bacteria do. These changes were not because of glyphosate but because of the ?inert? additives in the commercial formulations in biochemical pathways also present in other organisms. With these results, we should consider herbicides and pesticides as a whole and not just the active ingredient. The results have been submitted for publication in open access journals.</p> <p>As a land grant institution, we are the premier institution in West Virginia for research and training. A graduate student funded by this grant will be defending her Ph.D. shortly and will begin postdoctoral training at the National Institutes of Health. The second grad student defended her thesis last month and is currently a lecturer and freshman advisor in our department. Four undergraduate students were supported during the summer to conduct research. All four presented posters at national meetings. One is now working in a colleague?s research lab at the Pittsburgh University and plans to apply for Ph.D. programs next Fall. Another is participating in a post-baccalaureate program at the National Institutes of Health and is planning to apply to medical school next Fall. The research funded from this project was incorporated into two inquiry-based classes for undergraduates. Graduate students served as teaching assistants, providing a training environment for both graduate and undergraduate students.</p> <p>We introduced yeast to the public through a citizen science program called <em>I ASK WHY (I</em>nformation <em>A</em>cquired by <em>S</em>tudents who <em>K</em>now <em>W</em>est Virginia <em>H</em>as <em>Y</em>east). Yeast from agricultural areas tend to be more glyphosate-resistant but the history of herbicide exposure is not well documented. To aid in strain collection, I began an outreach program that uses citizen science to accomplish our goals. Public events had participants collect environmental samples and extract yeast from areas with known herbicide exposure. I ran this outreach for three years. We expanded the program by teaching the science component during the summer session for Upward Bound. These are first-generation college-bound students from selected from neighboring high schools. They receive college preparation and tutoring during the year and are on campus for six weeks for intensive classes. These students carried out their summer project isolating yeast from the environment and sequencing their DNA. Some students had not yet taken high school biology, so lessons were designed by me and the graduate teaching assistants to span the gaps in their knowledge. They carried out all the steps themselves. We developed the curriculum and the summer culminated with a public presentation of their results. I had two career days with the Upward Bound Students. Eight scientists, including engineers, medical doctor, geologist, master naturalist came from WVU, NASA, Mylan, and WV-GES came to talk about their paths to their current careers.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 09/29/2019<br>      Modified by: Jennifer&nbsp;E&nbsp;Gallagher</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1614573/1614573_10448669_1569809442190_Upward--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1614573/1614573_10448669_1569809442190_Upward--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Upward Bound"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1614573/1614573_10448669_1569809442190_Upward--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Upward Bound"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Students from Upward Bound collecting environmental samples at WVU Organic Farm.
