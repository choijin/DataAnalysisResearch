<AbstractNarration>Climate change projections indicate increasing magnitude and intensity of tropical storms, hurricanes, heat waves, and droughts. The events could have significant consequences for aquatic ecosystems with potential for large changes in ecosystem processes, response and functions. Such changes could also impair the important services that these ecosystems provide and thus affect the well-being of our environment and society. This five day workshop will focus on strategies for monitoring and mitigating the effects of extreme climate events. Scientists from diverse backgrounds (including women and under-represented groups) and at various stages (early career to senior) in their career will participate at the meeting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main workshop topics will be: water-driven exports of Carbon, Nitrogen, and Phosphorus (C, N, P) in particulate, dissolved, and gaseous forms from terrestrial to aquatic ecosystems; changes in biogeochemical cycles of C, N, and P in aquatic ecosystems following extreme climate events; and changes in aquatic ecosystem functions and services as a result of extreme events. The full spectrum of challenges will be covered, from defining extreme climate events and monitoring them, determining the exports of nutrients through the fluvial network, long-term impacts and recovery, changes in structure, functions and services of aquatic ecosystems, differences across land uses, and management practices and restoration strategies to mitigate extreme event impacts.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Chapman conference was successfully held over a 6-day period - January 22-27,2017, in San Juan, PR. A total of 116 registered attendees participated in the meeting with 46 from EPSCoR jurisdictions.  The conference was organized around six themes and questions under each theme were addressed through oral and poster presentations and breakout group discussions.  Details on the conference, including organization, themes, and schedules were posted on a dedicated conference web site - http://chapman.agu.org/extremeclimate/  An additional web site was created to post the invited talks from the conference that could be freely distributed and accessed by a broader audience (beyond those attending) -https://sites.google.com/a/udel.edu/chapmanece/  Midway through the meeting, thanks to the International Institute of Tropical Forestry(IITF) and the Luquillo Critical Zone Observatory (CZO) scientists and personnel, conference attendees visited watershed sites in the Luquillo forest that had been severely impacted by hurricane Hugo in 1989.

Ironically, following our conference, Puerto Rico was substantially impacted by Hurricane Maria in the summer of 2017 and the field sites we visited in Luquillo were completely devastated - all forest canopy cover was completely stripped off. Amazingly though, the forests are already indicating signs of initial recovery - a testament to the resilience of these tropical ecosystems to extreme climate events.  EPSCOR scientists and students played a prominent role in the meeting as a part of the &ndash; conveners, organizing committee, invited speakers, student presenters, field trip organization and presentations, and general conference participation.  The conference provided an excellent opportunity for EPSCoR participants to display their research and network with non-EPSCoR and international participants.

Beyond NSF-EPSCoR, the conference conveners and organizers were also very successful in leveraging funding from sources such as &ndash; USDA-NIFA, CZO, US Geological Survey, and IITF to support the travel and participation of non-EPSCoR scientists to the meeting.  The talks, poster presentations, and discussions at the meeting furthered our understanding of ECEs and the impacts of ECEs on aquatic ecosystems. Important knowledge gaps were identified and addressed at the meeting.  There was a clear recognition that an interdisciplinary approach needs to be adopted to address the broader challenges associated with ECEs.  Current watershed infrastructure, management strategies, and restoration practices are not designed to sustain the ECEs of the future and these practices need to be redesigned or updated.  We expect that synthesis/opinion papers will provide guidance on &ndash; defining ECEs, adopting new tools and techniques and developing common protocols to monitor and assesses ECE impacts on aquatic ecosystems, and development of mitigation and protection strategies for aquatic ecosystems.
