<AbstractNarration>The University of Wisconsin will host a conference for new researchers in statistics and probability from July 28-30, 2016. (See http://www.stat.wisc.edu/imsnrc18/index.html.) The meeting is organized by the IMS Committee on New Researchers and held for junior researchers working in different areas of Statistics and Probability. The primary objective of the conference is to provide a much needed platform for interaction among new researchers, as well as opportunities to seek mentorship from leading researchers in the field. This conference series is explicitly aimed at training the future leaders and researchers in probability and statistics. This award provides partial funding for the 2016 conference, as well as for the 2017 and 2018 conferences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Committee on New Researchers of the Institute of Mathematical Statistics will hold its 2016 conference at the University of Wisconsin, July 28-30, 2016. Each participant will give a brief introduction to his/her research, as well as a poster presentation. Plenary talks will be given by established researchers. There will be panel discussions on teaching and mentoring, publishing, funding, and finding collaborators. NSF is providing funding to partially support this conference for the next three years.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The conferences partially supported by this grant have contributed to the training of future leaders in probability and statistics.   The Institute of Mathematical Statistics New Researchers Conference is an annual conference collocated with the Joint Statistical Meetings that has as its primary objective the professional development of junior researchers in various critical areas of scholarship and pedagogy. A total of 192 new researchers in statistics, probability and data science attended the four meetings that were partially supported by this award. These meetings were held at the University of Wisconsin-Madison (2016), Johns Hopkins University (2017), Simon Fraser University (2018) and Colorado State University (2019). Each of the meetings featured presentations by new researchers, plenary talks by senior researchers in probability and statistics, as well as panels on teaching, mentoring, publishing, funding, leadership and data science. Underrepresented groups were explicitly encouraged to attend and a high proportion of women relative to the number of practicing female statisticians attended the conferences.  In helping to create networks of new researchers, these conferences laid the groundwork for future collaboration and the informal exchange of ideas and knowledge. As such, the conferences played a critical role for professional cohesion within statistics, probability and data science: Meeting people outside of one's research specialty area, and learning about their research, favors a more comprehensive view of research, which is important when taking editor positions or other professional service activities such as being part of professional societies. By inspiring and guiding new researchers in statistics, probability and data science, and also creating a sense of community amongst them, across research specialties, genders, ethnicities and geographical regions, the IMS-NRC conference series impacts these fields in a major way, which are ultimately carried on by the younger generation.
