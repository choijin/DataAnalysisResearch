<AbstractNarration>The Discovery Research K-12 program (DRK-12) seeks to significantly enhance the learning and teaching of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) by preK-12 students and teachers, through research and development of innovative resources, models and tools (RMTs). Projects in the DRK-12 program build on fundamental research in STEM education and prior research and development efforts that provide theoretical and empirical justification for proposed projects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Exploratory project will conduct an in-depth analysis of instructional coaching by analyzing 520 hours of archived video-recorded coaching sessions with 75 middle and high school science teachers in grades 6-12 collected in a U.S. Department of Education IES-funded coaching research study. The goal of the project is to "unpack" the coaching intervention by analyzing the videos and previously collected quantitative outcome data to (a) create descriptive profiles of instructional coaching and (b) identify which key coaching elements ("active ingredients") lead to desired teacher and student outcomes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Following a design-based research approach, relying on iterative feedback and using data saturation process to analyze data, the project will translate theorized, conceptual characteristics of coaching into empirical models to guide future coaching research and practical guidance through identification of critical elements needed for coaching to work.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This exploratory research was an in-depth study of instructional coaching by analyzing archived video-recorded coaching sessions with 51 middle and high school (grades 6-12) science teachers collected in an earlier coaching study.  The primary project goal was to unpack the coaching intervention by analyzing archived coaching videos and previously collected quantitative outcome data to (a) create descriptive profiles of instructional coaching and (b) identify which key coaching elements (active ingredients) lead to desired teacher and student outcomes.  Intellectual Merit  Descriptive analyses showed that the average coaching session was 47 minutes, which aligns well with a 50-minute planning period.  Sessions got shorter as teachers became familiar with the coaching protocols and expectations.  Most time was spent in reflective discussion (36%), followed by feedback (26%), planning (18%) and observation of classroom videos (6%).  In general, a session began with reflective discussion, followed by feedback, and ended in planning.   The coach tended to talk more than the teacher (49%; teacher 44%) but the relatively equal time indicated real dialogue. There were differences in the percent of talking across three coaching stages. Teachers talked a greater percent in reflective discussion; coaches talked more in feedback; and there were relatively equal amounts in planning and observation, suggesting a cooperative effort (dialogue) with a series of short question/answer segments.  Coach-teacher relationship behaviors included rapport, mutual respect, and reciprocal trust.  These behaviors were calculated as rate per minute to provide consistency: rapport (.79 rpm), reciprocal trust (.63 rpm) and mutual respect (.51 rpm). These figures translate to approximately 37 relationship behaviors, 30 reciprocal trust behaviors, and 24 mutual respect behaviors in a 47-minute coaching session.  Rapport was high in the first part of the session to set the tone and lower in the middle part, when the coach was giving feedback.  Mutual respect, along with praise, were significantly higher in the feedback stage than in any of the other stages.  This result suggests that promoting mutual respect is critical in providing effective feedback and that the coach was providing a positive comment along with a way to improve.  Reciprocal trust was highest in the last part of the coaching session, as teacher and coach spent time in planning.  Most of the coaching strategies were directive versus reflective in nature.  This result aligned with the project goal of improving teacher pedagogical skills, which required directive strategies to insure fidelity. As could be expected, reflective strategies were highest in reflective discussion.  Most reflective strategies focused on the coach prompting reflection on student or teacher actions/practices.   In comparing the stages of the coaching process across all sessions, reflective discussion tended to increase, while planning and feedback showed decreases.  Decreasing feedback suggests that over time less direct feedback was needed, and more time could be devoted to reciprocal coach-teacher discussion of student actions, work, and/or thinking, and teacher instructional practices, including areas of improvement and strengths.  The research to identify active ingredients of coaching showed that at both the middle school and high school the quality of the coach/teacher relationship had a significant, direct effect on the level of teacher engagement and teacher reflection/noticing.  At the middle school level, the quality of coaching strategies predicted teacher instructional quality.  Teacher beliefs had a significant effect on student self-efficacy, showing that the more accurate teacher beliefs were about science inquiry, the higher the student science practice knowledge and confidence. Teacher confidence had a significant effect on student science practice.  There was one significant indirect effect:  The quality of coaching strategies impacted teacher practice, which in turn impacted student science practice.  This result showed that teacher science instructional practice was central to the model as a mediator for the quality of coaching strategies on student practice.  This outcome  provides direct support that the quality of coaching strategies is an active ingredient of coaching, a factor that positively impacts student science outcomes.  At the high school level there were no additional positive, significant positive direct effects and there were no significant indirect effects.    Broader Impacts  While the context for this study is science instructional coaching for middle and high school teachers, results can guide future coaching efforts at the K-12 level, not only in science but all STEM subjects.
