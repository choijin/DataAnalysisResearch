<AbstractNarration>The Rocky Mountain-Great Plains Graduate Research Workshop in Combinatorics (GRWC), will be held in Laramie, WY (2016), Denver, CO (2017) and Ames, IA (2018), building upon successful NSF-funded workshops in 2014 and 2015.  Each workshop will involve approximately 39 graduate students and postdoctoral researchers, and 10 or more faculty members in an intense two-week collaborative research experience. Participants will work to solve important, relevant problems from graph theory, enumeration, combinatorial matrix theory, finite geometry, and other modern sub-disciplines of combinatorics. Students will prepare open problems prior to the workshop under the guidance of faculty mentors from the organizing committee, which consists of faculty from Iowa State University, the University of Colorado Denver, the University of Denver, the University of Nebraska Lincoln, and the University of Wyoming. These problems, presented at the workshop by their proposers or hosted on the workshop's secure problem wiki, will be worked on by small groups of participating students, postdocs, and faculty. For more information about the GRWC, including a detailed description of the workshop format, please see the workshop website at http://sites.google.com/site/rmgpgrwc &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the collaborations at the heart of the GRWC is to produce high-quality, publishable research on a variety of topics. Another longer-term goal of the workshop is to help student participants expand their professional research networks. A strong research network is often a crucial part of building a generative and sustainable research program, and establishing these connections at an early career stage can have a long-term positive effect on the quality, impact, and depth of a professional's research portfolio. Participation in the GRWC will allow students to cultivate a large professional network of peers from the combinatorics community with whom they will be able to interact and collaborate throughout their careers. The GRWC will also offer professional development workshops to help students and postdocs prepare for job searches and future careers in academia, industry, or government.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[Major Activities: The 2018 GRWC was held from May 20 ? June 2 at the Iowa State University, in Ames, Iowa.  In total 42 graduate students, 5 postdocs and 14 faculty from 28 institutions participated.  Additional funding for domestic participants was provided by the National Security Agency (NSA; support for 2 visiting faculty and partial support for organizing participants), the Simons Foundation (support for 1 organizing student from Collaboration Grant to Stephen Hartke and partial support for 2 organizing faculty from Collaboration Grant to Michael Ferrara).  Furthermore, generous funding from the Combinatorics Foundation allowed us to include 4 students and 2 postdocs from international institutions in the workshop, including our first participants from South Africa, Mexico and Serbia.  [Goals 1, 2, 3, 4] As part of the workshop, students participated in collaborative research on problems from across combinatorics.  The problem garden for the 2018 GRWC will be posted to the GRWC website (www.combinatoricsworkshop.org) by early summer 2019. Professional development workshops included panel on careers in academia and a discussion session about equity in the mathematical sciences.  This session was followed-up by a private lunch for female participants and faculty, led by GRWC Organizers Leslie Hogben and Margaret Bayer and 2018 visiting faculty member Pamela Harris, which provided an opportunity to discuss specific issues faced by women in the mathematical sciences. Additionally, generous funding from the Institute for Mathematics and its Applications supported a mini-workshop on careers in industry over the weekend prior to GRWC 2018 that was attended by 23 graduate students and postdocs.  [Goals 1, 2, 3, 5]. NSA funding also supported follow-up meetings to continue collaborations from the 2018 workshop.  [Goals 4,5]. Significant Results:  Thus far, 7 papers have been submitted by groups at the 2018 GRWC, and several other papers are in progress.  Project groups from the 2016 and 2017 workshops have generated 17 papers thus far and a total of 40 papers have been submitted across all 5 GRWC workshops, with 23 accepted to or appearing in refereed journals. A list of papers for all five GRWC offerings is attached to this report.  [Goal 5]  Key outcomes or other achievements A total of 15 students and postdocs presented research at a special session on research from the GRWC held at the 50th Southeastern Conference on Combinatorics, Graph Theory and Computing in March 2019 and an additional 4 graduate students .  At least 52 presentations have been given since the last annual report and at least 155 on GRWC research since 2014.  In reality, we anticipate that the total number of presentations is much higher, since the talks are self-reported.   Approximately 40 students and postdocs from the first four offerings of the GRWC participated in the GRWC meet-up at the 2019 JMM.  Much like the meet-ups in 2015 - 2018, this was an energetic and positive event, which provides further evidence of the long-term networking benefits of the GRWC.  [Goal 4] Student feedback on the 2018 workshop was overall extremely positive, and a summary of (anonymous) assessment data for all four workshops held so far is attached to this report.   Highlights of students? quantitative feedback for the 2018 workshop include 95.56% of participants plan to continue GRWC collaborations (3-year average: 87.31%), and a rating of 4.62/5 for the workshop as a research experience.  For the fifth straight year, 100% of participants would recommend the GRWC to a peer.    Additionally, here are some selected comments from 2018 participant surveys. ?I gained a lot more confidence in my ability to do research, in particular research with others.? ?I loved the collaborative environment. I didn?t have any experience doing research outside of my dissertation project before this workshop, and it opened up my eyes to the different ways that research can happen.? ?It was great to be able to sample a wide variety of problems, most of which were interesting and well-presented. I benefited from working with many different people.? ?GRWC (and the pre-workshop at IMA) emphasized to me that there are many different ways to "succeed", with jobs in industry and jobs in academia with varying levels of research/teaching responsibilities. I'm more confident than I was before that I'll be able to find some job which would make me happy.?       Last Modified: 05/31/2019       Submitted by: Tyrrell B Mcallister]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
