<AbstractNarration>ACM MobiSys is part of a series of annual conferences sponsored by ACM SIGMOBILE. It addresses the challenges in the areas of mobile &amp; wearable systems and applications. In addition to the regular conference program, MobiSys 2016 will include a set of technical workshops, research demonstrations, and a poster session, as well as special symposium and workshops focused on Asian graduate students and women researchers. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This proposal requests funds to support US-based graduate students to attend ACM MOBISYS 2016 to be held in Singapore, on June 26-30, 2015. The travel grant will enable meritorious students to take advantage of this gathering and interact with the top researchers in the field of mobile systems. Through conference participation, students will be able to identify and/or sharpen their career goals during discussions with experts in the field and also with their peers. While selecting award recipients, the award selection committee will emphasize on participation of under-represented groups (women and minorities) through targeted advertising to such groups and through special incentives. Women, in particular, will also benefit from attending the N2W (Networking for Women's) event being planned at MobiSys. Additionally, students will also benefit from being exposed to research and technologies specifically tailored for Asian scenarios and problems, with special emphasis on smart cities (as Singapore is the world's first country to lay out a vision of a 'Smart Nation', and has significant initiatives, testbeds and investments in this direction).</AbstractNarration>
