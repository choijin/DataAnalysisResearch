<AbstractNarration>This award supports two workshops that will create a consortium of international repositories (library, archives, museums, etc.) with significant collections on the Arctic.  The workshops will be attended by key stakeholders from across the circumpolar nations who are interested in working together on the creation of an integrated Arctic Library Portal.  This effort aims to build a unified digital access point for some of the world's largest Arctic collections, in conjunction with encouraging the initial digitization of an extensive new base of primary sources and the encouragement of more extensive scanning for efforts that may have begun, on numerous Arctic subjects that include social, economic, geographic, cultural, ethnographic, environmental, and historical topics.   This effort will enable and potentially inspire increased awareness of available tools, networks and best practices that can be replicated across the Arctic and the globe.  In addition, it has the potential to make large library materials available not only to academic scholars but to Arctic community members, and other members of the public many of whom have a great interest but do not possess the resources to gain access to these collections.  This project supports the "democratization" of sources and scholarship, access for all. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first workshop will bring together key archive, library and museum personnel from across the circumpolar north to not only discuss the potential for collaboration on an Arctic Library Portal but to identify the most endangered collections, e.g. deteriorating analog tapes; animal infested paper collections; fading photographs and negatives and brittle film, etc. that could be part of a phase two project for salvaging such collections. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The second workshop is a meeting in Boston to engage the Digital Public Library of America (DPLA) and the broader academic community at Harvard, MIT, and other local universities that have been working on novel ways to categorize and integrate topical materials from widely scattered collections. This second gathering will focus on technical issues surrounding the creation of the Arctic Library Portal as well as ways to integrate this project within the expansion of a larger national digital infrastructure that has been envisioned by DPLA. New content teams in DPLA at the Boston Public Library are also framing an innovative approach to synthesizing digital content in new user-friendly formats for both specialists and the wider public, an effort that has been especially fruitful for integrating related materials by topic across a distributed platform.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The key problem that we gathered to look at was digital discovery and access to the Arctic treasures held in libraries, archives and museums.  Our Libraries event of last year delivered a clear executive level mandate to proceed. That is an encouraging green light giving some hope to the aspiration of taking innovation to scale.    The workshop arrived at two essential macro conclusions: 1) we have to do a better job at delivering solutions for digital discovery and access to the arctic treasures held in libraries, archives and museums; 2) much of the technical, organizational and professional infrastructure necessary to do this is already in place, and yet we are limited by stove-piping.  Our challenge is not one of invention, but of innovation. We must strive to line up existing tools, infrastructure, and resources in new transformative ways to deliver on our collective promise to the arctic and to those who would learn from it.  The next critical test is to identify a focal point for one or several actionable pilot projects. We are far from any final determination, but the target is clear: small but representative proving grounds for quick agile cycles of experimentation, user testing and learning; and where we might quickly apply these incremental lessons to scale across many of the larger portals.
