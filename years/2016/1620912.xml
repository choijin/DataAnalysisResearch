<AbstractNarration>The Security and Human Behavior workshop's goals are to discuss, in an informal and interdisciplinary setting, issues where security, psychology, and behavior interact. The scope is broad: topics that have been covered in the past include the misperception of risk, security usability, deception, security and privacy decision making, and so forth. As the SaTC program has expanded to include social sciences in addition to its core in computer science, gatherings such as SHB provide a key venue for interaction between the different communities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports student attendance and participation in the 2016 SHB workshop.  Participation in the SHB Workshop is by invitation - and the first rule of the SHB Workshop is that everyone who attends actually participates in the discussion. This will ensure that students get more value from attending SHB than many conferences and workshops where they can simply listen.</AbstractNarration>

SHB is a unique venue for interdisciplinary discussions at the intersections of security, psychology, and human behavior. Previous editions of the Workshop have been held at MIT, Cambridge, USC, CMU, and Georgetown University.  The 2016 edition of the workshop consisted in a two-day gathering of distinguished security researchers, psychologists, economists, behavioral economists, sociologists, philosophers, law scholars, and others -- all of whom either directly studying, or indirectly contributing, to the understanding of the human side of security.  The Workshop's goal was to discuss, in an informal and interdisciplinary setting, issues where security, psychology, and behavior interact. The scope was broad: topics we covered included the misperception of risk, security usability, deception, security and privacy decision making, and so forth.  Funding was used to allow graduate students to travel to and participate in the workshop. Students benefitted from participating in the workshop, where they interacted with research leaders from a variety of disciplines and were exposed to the most recent developments in information security and privacy research.  The workshop stimulated the sharing of cutting-edge scientific information pertaining to information security and privacy. A key defining feature and advantage of the workshop consisted in its interdisciplinary approach to privacy and security.
