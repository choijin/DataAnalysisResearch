<AbstractNarration>This project will study the monsoon phenomenon. The broader impacts envisioned are multifaceted, including participation in existing outreach activities for K-12 and undergraduate research mentoring and teaching. The PI also has a strong sense of the need for data and computer code/script dissemination and proposes to develop a tool to facilitate this kind of intellectual product exchange.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Limitations of the existing theoretical treatments of monsoon circulations have been noted in prior literature, and a few examples of those theories failing entirely have been documented, but as of yet there has been no systematic attempt to break the theories. Using idealized general circulation models, effort under this project will identify conditions under which existing monsoon theories break down. New theoretical insights will be applied to climate model simulations of past and future climates in order to improve constraints on monsoon behavior in paleoclimates and in the coming decades.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Monsoon circulations are among the most prominent features of Earth's atmosphere in low latitudes, and they are relied upon agriculturally and economically by billions of people.  A sound theoretical understanding of their emergence, extent, and intensity is therefore a pressing need both scientifically and societally.  In this project, we have advanced the theoretical understanding of monsoon circulations and their longitudinally-averaged counterparts, Hadley cells, through a combination of analytical work and numerical simulations.  We have also advanced the software infrastructure for analyzing climate model simulation output through a new open-source software package and advanced the teaching of the underlying physical concepts through a new project disseminating simple, affordable rotating tank platforms.  The starting place for the theory of monsoons and Hadley cells is the distribution of angular momentum, which depends on how fast the planet is rotating, how close one is to the axis of rotation (which varies with latitude), and how fast the wind is blowing in the east-west direction.  Under certain conditions, if this angular momentum becomes too large, meaning the winds become too strong, the atmosphere will generate a monsoon or Hadley cell to flatten out the angular momentum.  We have advanced the community's understanding of this dynamic by clarifying these arguments and extending them.  In particular, we have introduced a new version of the theory that accounts for variations in the depth of the troposphere --- the atmosphere's lowest layer where these cells emerge --- that previously had been neglected.  We are investigating the role of feedbacks between vegetation cover and monsoon extent in the context of the "Green Sahara" --- a period roughly 8,000 years ago when the Sahara was a vast grassland and the West African Monsoon rains extended all the way to the Mediterranean.  Computer climate models struggle to accurately simulate this syste, so we using simpler models, including some that don't even require a computer, in order to better understand why it remains such a challenge for the more complex models.  Research using climate models requires analyzing a vast amount of data, often in the form of repeating the same calculation or similar ones over different models, simulations, times of the year, and so on.  This can be unwieldy to do in an ad-hoc basis if the number of calculations is large enough.  So we have developed a free, open-source software tool, aospy, that provides a framework for automating these calculations.  The core physical principles underlying monsoon circulations and other atmospheric and oceanic phenomena can be nicely demonstrated using rotating tanks of water.  This beloeved teaching technique has, however, largely been confined to a few universities, because the equipment has costed $1000s and required expert assembly and operation.  So we created the DIYnamics project, which develops do-it-yourself rotating table equipment, accompanying lesson plans, and instructional videos.  We used the tables at a series of outreach events and in classrooms ranging from elementary school to graduate students, and created a website (diynamics.github.io) to disseminate the information freely to any instructors that want it.
