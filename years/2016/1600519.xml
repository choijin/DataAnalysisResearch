<AbstractNarration>The theory of Dynamical systems (with discrete time) studies the long-term behavior of trajectories described by a certain iteration procedure, and the way this phase portrait depends on the parameters of the system. Very interesting fractal objects (like Julia sets and the Mandelbrot set) may appear as phase and parameter diagrams for such systems. In the project, the PI will focus on complex and real low-dimensional dynamical systems described by simple quadratic equations.  Despite simplicity of the description, these systems are known to display complicated chaotic behavior serving as a good model for various phenomena that appear in celestial mechanics, fluid dynamics, biology, and other branches of natural science.  The proposed activity will result in deeper insights into small scale structure of dynamical systems, in training of highly qualified postdocs and graduate students who will apply their skills in academia and industry, in broader interactions between experts in various branches of real and complex dynamics, in publishing a book that would help a broad student and research community to acquire background in the area, in promotion of communication in the field by organizing conferences and scientific programs, giving mini-courses, and maintaining a dynamics web site (http//www.math.stonybrook/dynamics).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI will conduct a broad research program on several intertwined geometric themes of complex and real low-dimensional dynamics, making a gradual transition from the one-dimensional to the two-dimensional world. The PI will work on the Dynamics of dissipative complex Henon maps and attractors for typical dissipative real Henon maps. Specific themes include exploring the problem of existence of wandering domains, building up puzzle techniques, and the study of local dynamics near semi-Cremer fixed points. The PI will keep pursuing several one-dimensional projects unified by the idea of renormalization, a powerful tool of penetrating into small-scale structure of dynamical objects aimed towards completing their classification. They include the Siegel Renormalization Theory, scaling of Mandelbrot limbs, and a priori bounds for primitively infinitely renormalizable quadratic polynomials. The PI will finish the first volume of a book "Conformal Geometry and Dynamics of Quadratic Polynomials".</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Overview:  This research program has been devoted to several intertwined geometric themes of complex low-dimensional dynamics, making a gradual transition from the one-dimensional (D1)  to the two-dimensional (D2)  world.  In 1D,  it led to  developing a new ``Pacman Renormalization Theory'' that gives control of the scaling properties of the celebrated Mandelbrot set M near the main cardioid. It resulted in advances in the problem of local connectivity of M (``MLC'') and in the area problem for the corresponding Julia sets. Another direction that has been explored is the  structure of the group of quasisymmetries of various classes of Julia sets.  We also enhance Sullivan's Dictionary between rational maps and Kleinian groups by providing a class of matings between maps and groups generated by Schwarz reflections.   In  2D, this program led to a classification of periodic Fatou components for dissipative complex Henon map and to a description of the structure of such maps with dominated splitting. It also resulted in a better understanding of the local dynamics near neutral periodic points.  The PI is  finishing  the first two volumes of a book: ``Conformal Geometry and Dynamics of Quadratic  Polynomials'' that would serve as an introduction to some of the above themes.   Intellectual merit of the proposed activity:  Advances in the MLC Conjecture and the area problem for Julia sets always provide holomorphic dynamics with new powerful tools. It is intimately related to the renormalization theory that gives us invaluable insights into universality features of dynamical and parameter regions. The dissipative  Henon family  is a basic model for two-dimensional dynamics, providing us with a natural transit from the  well developed one-dimensional theory to much less understood  dimension two.  Advances in these themes would become illuminating pieces of contemporary Holomorphic  Dynamics.    Broader impacts resulting from the proposed activity:  The proposed activity will result in deeper insights into small scale structure of dynamical systems, in training of highly qualified postdocs and graduate students  who will apply their skills in academia and industry, in broader interactions between experts in various branches of real and complex dynamics, in publishing a book that would help a broad student and research community to acquire background in the area, in promotion of communication in the field by organizing conferences and scientific programs, giving mini-courses, and  maintaining a dynamics web site (http//www.math.stonybrook/dyn        Last Modified: 07/01/2020       Submitted by: Mikhail Lyubich]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
