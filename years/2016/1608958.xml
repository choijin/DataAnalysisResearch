<AbstractNarration>Proposal  Title: An Interferometric CMOS DC-Terahertz Lab on a Chip Biosensor&lt;br/&gt;Brief description of project Goals:&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Building a single-cell sensor platform for labelless identification of cells and their components (protein, DNA, molecules) with extremely rapidly alternating electric fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nontechnical Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Significance and Importance: Identification of cells, and by extension their components, is essential for a wide range of healthcare and scientific applications.  There is key need for real-time measurements, for example during cancer surgery where leaving unidentified cancer cells behind leads to increased cancer recurrence.  Unfortunately, current techniques cannot identify biological molecules without the use of secondary molecules with a signaling tag attached, necessitating multiple steps often in a laboratory setting.  Therefore there is a need for rapid identification of cells and molecules to guide real-time clinical decision making. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The Solution: To enable direct, and near instantaneous, identification of molecules and single cells, this proposal measures their innate response to extremely high frequency electrical fields to identify a unique frequency signature.  In particular, this project aims to extend the ability to measure these characteristic vibrations into the Terahertz range, with electric fields alternating within a picosecond.  At these speeds, the vibrations of molecules are measured, potentially identifying biological molecules without the use of secondary labels.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Advancing the Field: The overarching goal of this research is to establish the frequency characteristics for a wide range of biomolecules and cancer cell lines using a single-cell high frequency measurement platform.  If unique spectral signatures of cancer cells are found, the possibility of rapid labelless identification can be realized.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Benefits to Society:  Of key importance in cancer therapy is the need to identify and treat all disease.  Instantaneous identification of tumor cells, made possible by measuring the innate electrical properties of the molecules themselves, enables instantaneous assessment of tissue to guide resection of all tumor cells.&lt;br/&gt;Furthermore, measurements on single cells at this frequency have never been done before.  Through publications, this information will be disseminated to the community, potentially enabling new biomedical applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Education and Diversity: The educational goals of this research include the training of graduate student researchers in the art and science of terahertz signal generation, detection, and processing, and the development of a new undergraduate curriculum targeting freshman electrical engineering students and outreach to underrepresented groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The focus of this research proposal is to enable labelless investigation of biological systems by obtaining wide frequency spectrum information on the molecular and cellular level through development of a sensor platform operating from DC to the THz regime.  This capability, coupled with microfluidics that enable single cell interrogation, has an immense advantage in the characterization, identification, and, possibly diagnosis of disease, potentially solving a variety of problems faster, less expensively, or perhaps even in a point of care settings.  This research will advance the state-of-the-art by 10X in frequency and allows for inexpensive and rapid Terahertz cell and biomolecule characterization.  Combining Giga and Terahertz sensing allows a broad range of information to be gathered on individual cells and biomolecules. Moving to higher frequencies, from 100 GHz to 1 THz, opens up the possibility to sense molecular rotational resonance signatures, identifying key molecular components of cells.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The work is divided into three interrelated thrusts.  In the first thrust, the focus is on the development of the DC-THz sensor array.  Our group has identified powerful architectures that are amenable to integration in CMOS, built around performing interferometry between on-chip voltage-controlled oscillators (VCOs), which are easily integrated in CMOS technology into a very small area.  The architecture has high sensitivity and immunity from phase noise.  In the second thrust, we will be co-designing the microfluidic package and sensor interface so that we can reliably and repeatedly flow materials such as biomolecules or cells into the sensor to perform measurements (1 THz for biomolecules, 0.5 THz for cells). In the third thrust, we will begin an extensive study of the spectral signature of biomolecules and cells from microwave bands up to the terahertz regime.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Metric:   The goal of this was to enable a new modality for label-less investigation of biological systems by obtaining wide frequency spectrum information on the molecular and cellular level through development of a sensor platform operating from low frequencies (below 1 MHz) to several hundred gigahertz, focusing on the mm-wave spectrum.  Our goal was to build a sensor platform that could be used to probe and manipulate individual cells so that we could test the cell response to mm-wave radiation.  In addition to increasing our knowledge about the impact of mm-wave photons on biological systems, our specific aim was to see if we could use these signals to detect disease by examining changes in cell properties, mainly the cell electrical response (dielectric constant) that is a function of water content, and hence vascularization of cell tissue.  It is known, for example, that cancer cells are more active and have a distinct electrical (dielectric) signature.  Also, cancer cells divide, and we set out to investigate if we could detect cell division.  Furthermore, many complex biological molecules have specific signatures related to conformity (such as protein denaturization) that have distinct mm-wave signatures that we can detect.    We made significant progress in our research by the development of mm-scale sensor platforms using commercial CMOS technology, opening the door for low cost and high-volume manufacturing of sensors that can be used in clinical settings, or in implants.  The first sensor we developed combines mm-wave testing at 40 GHz with optical testing using a single photon avalanche diode (SPAD).  The SPAD device was developed in a technology that is compatible with building mm-wave circuits and enables dual modality sensing, greatly increasing the selectivity of our sensor platform.  Moreover, we demonstrated a new way to build the sensor that obviates the need for complex microfluidic packaging.  The entire sensor surface can be exposed to a sample without requiring a "reference" channel.  Electrical and biological testing confirms the validity of our sensor?s enhanced sensitivity, very low drift, and enhanced selectivity.    The second platform can measure cell properties at even higher frequencies (100GHz) using ring resonator based interferometric sensors.  Two oscillators are locked and forced to oscillate at the same frequency through an entrainment process.  One oscillator is exposed to the medium (the cells or molecules under study), thus lowering its naturally frequency compared to the free-running oscillator, thereby a phase shift develops between the two, a signal that can be accurately measured through interferometry.  Our sensor is used to detect bio-molecules, the presence of cells, and even distinguish between cancer cells and healthy tissue.  We have also detected cells during mitosis (dividing versus not dividing).  These early signals were detected on live tissue samples by using a custom fabricated microfluidic package that allowed cells to flow next to our sensor.  Since the sensor is about the same size as a cell, it?s important to place the cells in close proximity to our sensor.  A low frequency electrical signal is used to "capture" cells, a unique feature of our sensor, using the DEP force (or the tendency of materials to polarize in the presence of an external field).   The DEP capture process is critical because it allows us to place cells in close vicinity of our sensor in a predictable and repeatable fashion.  This issue plagued our previous generation of sensor design that used fluids to flow cells past our sensor.  Due to the unknown height between the cells and the sensor, our signal was more difficult to measure.  In this "lab-on-a-chip" we have eliminated this source of uncertainty.     Broader Impacts:  Our findings have been published in several peer reviewed conference proceedings and journals.  We also engaged with industry often in order to show the community that there are interesting biomedical applications to the "4G" and "5G" radio signals.  Many traditionally computer/communications companies are becoming increasingly interested in biomedical applications, such as smart watches, patches, and other small and portable devices.  Ultimately, we believe these sensors will have applications in many domains, including in new surgical instruments that can be used to detect and eliminate residual cancerous tissue (for example the Dune Medical MarginProbe) and reduce the chances of having to perform second or third surgical procedures to remove tumors.  We also envision a new host of implantable devices that can enable live feedback to doctors and patients by measurement of tumor growth with the application of drugs or radiation/chemotherapy.  One near term goal is to study the benefits of "tumor treating fields", an FDA approved procedure that uses low frequency electrical fields to disrupt the growth of brain cancers.  Our sensor can be used to study the influence of fields on cells in a more direct and observable fashion.       Last Modified: 09/17/2019       Submitted by: Ali Niknejad]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
