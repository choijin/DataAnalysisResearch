<AbstractNarration>The ability to understand and manipulate the behavior of cells is currently limited. In this project, which is a collaboration between researchers at the Carnegie-Mellon University (US) and the University of Bristol (UK), open source computational tools will be developed that will permit microscopic images of live cells (T lymphocytes) that mediate immune responses to be converted into computer models. These models will capture from the microscopic images the behavior of the proteins that constitute the signaling pathways and networks that underlie and control the behavior of the cells, producing a detailed understanding of the mechanisms by which T cell immune reactions are controlled. Interdisciplinary training in cell biology and computer science will be provided to graduate and undergraduate students (including members of groups underrepresented in science), and open access movies designed to promote interest in STEM fields will be produced for K-12 students. These movies will be developed through partnerships with Pittsburgh-area schools serving primarily students from underrepresented minorities.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Movies capturing fluorescence images of proteins (and determination of cell-wide protein phosphorylation) will be used to develop open source software tools that will generate and interpret spatiotemporally aligned maps of 35 key molecules involved in T lymphocyte signaling. The spatiotemporal maps will be used to infer potential signaling complexes, and the apparent affinities and potential causal relationships amongst proteins involved in T lymphocyte signaling.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This collaborative US/UK project is supported by the US National Science Foundation and the UK Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This grant was made through a joint program of the U.S. National Science Foundation and the U.K. Biotechnology and Biological Research Foundation that funds collaborative research between investigators in both countries.  The intellectual merit derived primarily from development of computational methods to provide analysis and modeling of fluorescence microscope movies collected by the U.K. collaborator.  These movies depicted the locations within the cell of many proteins that are involved in immune response signaling.  The project led to five papers published in top biomedical research journals.  The major work consisted of development of open source software implementing three new computational methods and significantly improving in one previous method.  The improved software was used to create models of how proteins involved in immune signaling change their positions within a T cell after it encounters an antigen-presenting cell.  As part of an international collaboration, this led to important new information about the steps required for T cells to secrete cytokines and how tumor cells evade immune surveillance.   One of the new methods was used to learn which protein changes during immune signaling occur before  other changes, suggesting that they might have causal relationships.  A second new method provides better ability to create more accurate models of cell and nuclear shape than previously developed methods.  The third new method introduced a new approach for inferring spatial relationships that cannot be directly measured, and allowed the creation of the first model of how the eight ribonucleoproteins of influenza virus are assembled to create a full virion.  The software and primary data used for all of these studies has been made publicly available as Reproducible Research Archives, allowing the reuse of the data and methods by other investigators.  They have also been incorporated into the open source CellOrganizer system for constructing cell models.  The broader impact of the grant was through providing support for the training and thesis completion of a highly productive Ph.D. student with outstanding potential to become a leader in computational biology and also provided partial support for the training of a computational biology Ph.D. student from a demographic underrepresented in the sciences.
