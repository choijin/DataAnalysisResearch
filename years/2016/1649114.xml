<AbstractNarration>This grant supports the 22nd International Symposium on Transportation and Traffic Theory (ISTTT) to be held July 24-26, 2017, in Evanston, Illinois. The symposium will showcase 35 original papers drawn from a pool of over 300 submissions from around the world. A special workshop session will be held to explore additional ways of placing the symposium findings into professional practice. This award will cover fellowships to foster participation from a selected set of advanced graduate students from underrepresented groups. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since its inception, the ISTTT has been the premier gathering of transport theorists. The coming Evanston Symposium promises to build on that tradition: the papers accepted for the event represent breakthrough research from around the world. These papers have the potential to challenge current thinking about transport science, and perhaps even to transform the field. And the papers address a variety of pressing topics in transportation: they include ideas for promoting greener, more sustainable travel modes, and for transporting people and goods in emergency situations. Given the role that transportation plays in the world and in the lives of her people, the ideas unveiled in the coming symposium are expected to be of significance. An outcome of this workshop includes a report that summarizes the main intellectual achievements of the conference. The report will describe the key challenges raised, new problems identified, and main innovations proposed by the contributors of the conference.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Since its launch in 1959 by the late Robert Herman, the International Symposium on Transportation and Traffic Theory (ISTTT) series has remained the primary venue for discussing advances in the theoretical and methodological aspects of the interdisciplinary field of transportation and traffic systems science.  Many key concepts and methods saw their origins in the Proceedings of these symposia.     The 22nd ISTTT, sponsored by National Science Foundation, was held on the Evanston campus of Northwestern University, in the Greater Chicago region of Illinois, in the USA on July 24 &ndash; 26, 2017.  As the field has continued to grow and evolve, the format of the Symposium has not changed, consisting of thirty six single-track lectern presentations and discussions. Along the way, twenty one poster sessions have been added to give more researchers an opportunity to take part in this event.  The thirty six contributions in the Proceedings of the 22nd ISTTT were selected following a rigorous four-stage refereeing process. In the first stage, nearly 350 extended abstracts were reviewed by up to four members of the scientific and organizing committees, resulting in 117 invitations to submit full papers.  The second stage entailed the review of each of the 102 submitted full papers by two to five internationally recognized scholars.  Based on that process, 60 papers were retained for revision and the second round of refereeing.  A final review by the three co-editors resulted in the selection of 36 for lectern presentation, and another 21 for poster presentation (and inclusion in the digital Procedia volume).       Theoretical developments in an applied domain like transportation are only meaningful when accompanied by observation and measurement. With advances in technologies for sensing, tracking, and otherwise observing the behaviour of people and vehicles, our ability to characterize and model fundamental phenomena and processes in transportation continues to expand.  At the same time, our ability to manage and control transportation systems and services increases, giving rise to further challenges in modelling and optimization of these systems.  The opportunities of connected vehicle systems, and the advent of autonomous vehicles, also challenge our community to model and predict the operational and strategic implications of these technologies, and to imagine and design new mobility services.  Realizing the opportunities, and avoiding potential pitfalls, require development of a solid fundamental base of scientific knowledge and advanced methodologies.  The contributions presented at the 22nd ISTTT reflect some of the most essential work taking place in the world?s leading institutes on the science of traffic and transportation, and presents a view of the rich influences permeating the field.   The papers presented at the symposium are organized in the following ten distinctive subject areas.    SESSION 1: Shared Mobility Operations, three presentations SESSION 2: Connected &amp; Autonomous Vehicles, four presentations. SESSION 3: Vehicular &amp; Pedestrian Traffic Flow, four presentations SESSION 4: Location &amp; Scheduling, three presentations SESSION 5: Dynamic Network Models, four presentations SESSION 6: Transit Planning &amp; Operations, four presentations SESSION 7: Travel Demand &amp; Activity Models, three presentations.  SESSION 8: Macroscopic Flow Models, three presentations.  SESSION 9: Idealized Bottleneck Theories, four presentations.  SESSION 10: Network Management &amp; Traffic Control, four presentations.          Last Modified: 09/21/2017       Submitted by: Yu Nie]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
