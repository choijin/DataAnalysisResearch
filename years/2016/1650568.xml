<AbstractNarration>A goal of the Tribal Colleges and Universities Program (TCUP) is to increase the science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) instructional and research capacities of specific institutions of higher education that serve the Nation's indigenous students. Expanding the research capacity at these institutions expands the opportunities for students to pursue challenging, rewarding careers in STEM fields, provides for research studies in areas that may be locally relevant, and encourages a faculty community to look beyond the traditional classroom for intellectual and professional growth. This project aligns directly with that goal, allowing the institution?s faculty and administrators to design and develop a comprehensive plan for improving and expanding STEM instruction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tohono O'odham Community College will conduct an institutional assessment of its STEM programs and create a strategic plan for increasing its STEM capacity. Workshops that include TOCC faculty and administration, TOCC students, Tohono O'odham Nation departments, stakeholders and external educational institutions will formulate a shared vision of what STEM capacity should be at TOCC and how to achieve it. The results of the assessment will constitute the baseline for the elaboration of a STEM Capacity-building plan and NSF TCUP STEM Instructional Capacity Excellence proposal for 2017. The plan will include a systemic, comprehensive approach to integrating our curriculum into the Tohono O'odham way of life (Himdag) through the application of an indigenous education model. This plan will also include innovative educational strategies such as the creation of learning communities focused on integrative and problem-based learning.</AbstractNarration>

These specific areas of interest are in hands-on, place-based learning which incorporates quantitative and technical skill-building as well as Physics, Astronomy, and Engineering.&nbsp; The visioning sessions laid the groundwork for future opportunities for partnerships with the TON, regional employers and external partners, including 2+2 programs, internships opportunities for students, and career pathways. The results of the visioning sessions suggested that strengthening the physical science offerings and developing a two-year Physics program was a greater priority than the development of four-year programs.&nbsp; The visioning sessions affirmed the need to increase student engagement and success through expansion of integrative, problem-based learning approaches across TOCC's STEM curriculum.</p> <p>This project resulted in an assessment and a design for STEM instructional improvement, which incorporates elements of self-determination and culturally based education in the context of the current generation of Tohono O'odham students.&nbsp; This five-year strategic plan includes a systemic, comprehensive approach to integrating curriculum into the Tohono O'odham way of life (<em>Himdag</em>) through the application of an indigenous education model, the Man in the Maze Educational (<em>MiME</em>) Model.&nbsp;&nbsp; The faculty development workshops supported by the grant affirmed that the faculty are receptive to and can apply this indigenous education model in their courses and programs to integrate traditional knowledge and incorporate culturally-relevant assessment.</p> <p>&nbsp;The final visioning workshop reviewed and prioritized the results of the stakeholder visioning sessions in conjunction with TOCC's strategic plan, institutional data and best practices in indigenous STEM education.&nbsp; Four pillars for the STEM capacity building along with action items were identified and used to create a five-year strategic STEM plan.&nbsp;&nbsp; This
