<AbstractNarration>The team will use the Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope (GBT) to observe the dense gas in nearby galaxies.  The team has added a cutting-edge instrument, Argus, to this NSF facility.  This has paved the way for these important observations at millimeter wavelengths.  The team will study how galaxies form stars in their dense gas.  They will compare their observations to theoretical models.  Senior team members will train junior members recruited from underrepresented groups.  The team will feature the research in materials for the Bay Area Science Festival in California and the Green Bank Visitors Center in West Virginia.  The team will also help others use Argus for their own research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The team will use Argus on the GBT to map the dense molecular gas in nearby galaxies at high spatial resolution.  They will combine these new data with existing data at other wavelengths to study (1) how the amount of star formation per unit of dense gas depends on the local conditions in the galaxies, and (2) how the amount of dense gas depends on the local conditions in the galaxies.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ A multi-institution group of astronomers made images of the nuclei of 36 galaxies with a new radio camera, Argus, on the 100-meter diameter Green Bank Telescope (GBT) showing details in the galaxies at the 100 pc scale of giant molecular clouds.  This level of detail in the spectral lines we observed molecular lines had previously only been possible with interferometers, but the GBT's filled aperture captured flux from extended emission that interferometers alone miss.  In addition, the project mapped the inner arms as well as the nuclear bar of the galaxy IC342.    Members of the group also supported instrumental commissioning and maintenance for this and other projects.  The Argus camera has proved to be very reliable and has been used by a number of researchers to make large images in molecular spectral lines.  The instrument is available for all scientists to propose for its use.   In our specific study, we obtained reasonably complete spectroscopic data cubes (images with velocity information) in the four spectral lines we had proposed for the compact structure in 36 galactic nuclei.  One of the goals was to test the idea that the rarer isotpic variants of the carbon monoxide molecule (CO), 13CO and C18O, would trace densities, as do the HCN and HCO+ species.  C18O was generally undetectable in the same spectra that gave solid 13CO detections (we were able to observe the lines in pairs).  The 13CO spectra and distribution were similar to the fainter HCN and HCO+ lines, showing that that transition traced both dense and more rarified molecular gas.  While not unexpected from molecular properties, we have observationally confirmed it in a sufficient sample to draw general conclusions.  These data are in the final stages of reduction and comparison with other radio, mm-wave, and infrared transitions.  We expanded the study of one galaxy, IC342, with a graduate student's Director's Discretionary Time proposal, to make a deeper and wider study of this one galaxy.  The left-hand side of the figure shows the image of the CO molecule in the galaxy's nucleus, the nuclear bar, and the innermost spiral arms.  Thre right-had side shows the color-coded velocity of the galaxy, with its rotation visible in the shift from red to blue across the galaxy's face.  The paper describing our work there is in final drafts.  One striking result was a nearly constant HCN/HCO+ intensity ratio of 1.2 along the entire nuclear bar, a few kpc in extent.  Since we observe both lines in the same spectrum, the ratio is completely insensitive to pointing errors, changes in atmospheric transmission, or similar observational effects.  Since physical conditions must vary from the starburst core to the bar ends, the constancy indicates that the excitation conditions must be insensitive to temperature and density.  Our result contradicts earlier suggestions that the emission comes from subthermally excited material, which would have a strong density dependence.  Additionally, observations of the ratio over entire nuclei shows a variation in the ratio from about 0.7 to 1.5.  Radiative transfer calculations indicate that the ratio depends most strongly on the species' relative abundance, in material producing somewhat optically thick lines.
