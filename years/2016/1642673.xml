<AbstractNarration>This award will provide partial support for the Educational Partnerships for Innovation in Communities (EPIC) Network to develop international collaborations that will expand the EPIC network. The EPIC-N Model gives communities direct access to institutions of higher education to conduct research and advance knowledge in areas of immediate need. The Model is a year-long, large-scale partnership that matches existing campus faculty and courses with high-priority projects identified by the community partner that address environmental, economic, and social issues. Through their coursework, students conduct research and provide creative, innovative, and multi-disciplinary designs and solutions for each prioritized project.   The results of successful collaboration stands to transform higher education, the way in which institutions of higher education and local governments work together, and the way in which we address sustainability and resiliency and the future challenges that face society. Promotion of the radically simple EPIC-N Model has the potential to impact hundreds of thousands of students, working with thousands of cities, and making a visible difference for millions of residents in communities worldwide. In addition, this is a great opportunity to promote the professional development of US scientists and to help foster future international collaboration in sustainability research.</AbstractNarration>
