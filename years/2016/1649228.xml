<AbstractNarration>The INCLUDES project will build on the Leveraging and Integrating New Knowledge in STEMS (LINKS) framework that was developed at the University of Rochester to target students participating in Upward Bound programs at four institutions that will comprise the Upstate NY Alliance: Cornell University, D'Youville College, Monroe Community College, and the University of Rochester. The project will increase curricular and experiential learning offerings to underserved students by integrating faculty and graduate students into Upward Bound programs.  Applying the LINKS framework, educators will learn and develop new means for managing classroom diversity, including ethnicity, language, age, educational background, and other cultural markers that shape the way students learn. The team will develop and disseminate best practices on creating inclusive teaching and research environments.  The Upstate NY Alliance will produce a proof of concept model for national scale-up with measurable outcomes for varying populations of at-risk high school students. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Alliance will strive to translate and further develop the LINKS framework within the context of each of the varied institutional environments, resulting in a more robust model that draws from the strengths of all of the schools with a core focus and range of applications. The project will create a diverse collegial community dedicated to bridging the gap between P-12 and higher education learning environments.  It also will implement a clearly-articulated and successful collaboration among the four institutions that will provide multiple opportunities to share best practices, engage in cross-institution dialog, and leverage each member's strengths to enhance and further develop the LINKS framework.</AbstractNarration>

Cornell University built upon a strong STEM foundation by creating a summer research day for students from all programs to attend and interact and work with Cornell faculty in courses and labs.   D’Youville college partnered with their School of Education to formalize a STEM structure for their youth, that increased STEM faculty involvement by 200% and created cross campus partnerships.   At the University of Rochester, over 60 faculty over two years participated in the program where, offering over 20 courses across all STEM disciplines from biology, chemistry, data science, electrical and computer engineering, bio-medical engineering, photonics and optics.  The LINKS Model has been shared nationally at conferences to provide additional students access to these experiences at their home institutions.  Five high school students presented their research at the 2019 National Society of Black Engineers (NSBE) Annual Convention. One high school student earned the Best Research Poster award at this convention. One high school student had a paper published in a peer-reviewed chemistry journal.
