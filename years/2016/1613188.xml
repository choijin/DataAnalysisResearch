<AbstractNarration>It is a well-known fact that light, stable nuclei, those with which we are most familiar, are made up of roughly equal numbers of protons and neutrons. This project will explore the structure of neutron-rich nuclei that are far from stability and consequently much less familiar.  This will provide a vital understanding of the subtleties of the nuclear force in nuclei that can be found in explosive astrophysical environments, such as a supernova. These experiments will help us to understand the different abundances of the observed elements in the universe, in addition to engaging students in the study of these fundamental questions.  In addition, the applied nuclear physics efforts at Hope College will use traditional accelerator techniques for the rapid testing of consumer goods and environmental samples containing chemicals of concern. Work on non-destructive characterization of automotive paint samples for forensic applications will continue. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Experiments producing unstable nuclei at the National Superconducting Cyclotron Lab (NSCL) (excited states of helium-9 and oxygen-26) will measure decay neutrons with the Modular Neutron Array, while emitted charged fragments are deflected with a high-field dipole magnet into timing and energy detectors. The properties of the decaying nucleus will be determined with invariant mass spectroscopy. Astrophysics measurements will also be done at the NSCL with the Summing NaI Detector supplemented with an internal beta detector or an internal gas cell constructed at Hope College. The interdisciplinary applied physics portion of the proposed research, done with the Hope accelerator, is principally based on particle induced gamma-ray emission, particle induced x-ray emission, and Rutherford backscattering spectroscopy.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Light, stable nuclei are made up of roughly equal numbers of protons and neutrons. This award enabled Hope College researchers to explore the structure of neutron-rich nuclei that are far from stability.  The findings from this work provide concrete data vital to improve the understanding of the nuclear force and models that apply this understanding to the behavior and structure of all nuclei.  In particular, there was a focus on nuclei found in extreme astrophysical environments, such as a supernova and merging neutron stars and on nuclei near the neutron drip line. This experimental work will aid in modeling and understanding nuclei in order to understand the abundances of the observed elements in the universe and the basic properties of the nuclear force.    Hope College faculty and undergraduate students were part of the Modular Neutron Array collaboration and Summing NaI research group at the Nation Superconducting Cyclotron (NSCL), and as such designed new equipment, participated in data collection and analysis, and obtained new results.  Specifically, experiments were done to measure the neutron radioactivity of 26O, the three-neutron decay channel of 25O, 84Kr(p,gamma) reactions, beta decays from 103,104Nb, structure of 9He, structure of 31Ne, and the structure and beta decay of 93,91Rb, 60Ga, and 71,73Ni.  Most of these studies involved one or more pieces of equipment designed and fabricated by Hope researchers including a cosmic ray veto system, gas target cells, beta detectors for use with a moving tape target system, and LABView-based experimental control systems.    These measurements were conducted at NSCL.  In addition, Hope College researchers coupled their understanding of nuclear physics and developed particle accelerator based techniques for the rapid testing of consumer goods and environmental samples containing chemicals of concern and characterization of metaloproteins.  Using the particle accelerator at Hope, techniques were developed and applied to test for heavy metals in tattoo ink with particle induced x-ray emission (PIXE), to test for PFAS in textiles, food packaging, water and soil with particle induced gamma-ray emission (PIGE), and to determine the stoichiometry of metaloproteins with nuclear reaction analysis (NRA) and PIXE.  These analytical techniques, primarily PIXE and Rutherford backscattering (RBS) were also applied to characterize samples provided by other Hope College research groups and external companies.  Results from this award were disseminated in 19 peer-reviewed publications and 27 conference presentations.  In addition to the new science results, the award supported 12 individual undergraduate researchers.   Participation levels varied from four years of work (summers and terms) on various aspects of the research to in a few instances of just a single 10 week summer experience.   Students were trained in a wide range of research skills including design and construction, experiment execution, data analysis with modern computer tools, and writing.  Participation in research helped students remain enthused about the study of physics and prepared them for direct entry into the STEM workforce or for graduate studies.
