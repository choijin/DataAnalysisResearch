<AbstractNarration>This project involves theoretical and applied investigations of certain ubiquitous nonlinear wave phenomena.  More specifically, the systems that will be studied belong to a class of nonlinear evolution equations referred to as soliton equations or integrable systems, which arise as mathematical models in various areas of applications, ranging from fluid dynamics and nonlinear optics, to low-temperature physics and Bose-Einstein condensates, to name a few.  In particular, one of the model equations that will be studied describes the formation of rogue waves in the open ocean.  These extreme events, which are characterized by wave crests up to four times bigger than the average, have been known to cause significant damages to vessels and other equipment.  Effects similar to rogue waves have also been recently observed in optical fibers.  A precise mathematical description of these model equations is also a key component in the design of optical fiber transmission systems.  The project outcomes will help to better characterize the behavior of these systems and the properties of their solutions, they will elucidate the role that such solutions play in the generation of rogue waves, and they will contribute to paving the way for a deeper understanding of these important nonlinear phenomena. The project will provide a rich educational experience through research for graduate students at the State University of New York at Buffalo and undergraduate students at the University of Colorado at Colorado Springs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mathematically, the overarching goal of the project is a wide-ranging investigation of initial and initial-boundary value problems for integrable nonlinear evolution equations, thereby contributing to closing the gap between our knowledge of linear and nonlinear integrable systems. More precisely, the project comprises problems where the boundary conditions play a key role, as well as various kinds of singular limits. Specific problems that will be studied include: (i) the development of the inverse scattering transform for coupled systems of equations of nonlinear Schrodinger (NLS) type with non-zero boundary conditions at infinity; (ii) the study of initial-boundary value problems for NLS equations on a finite interval with linearizable, periodic or nearly periodic boundary conditions; (iii) the study of the long-time asymptotics of NLS systems affected by modulational instability and of semiclassical and dispersionless limits for NLS equations and the Korteweg-deVries equation with periodic boundary conditions.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project concerned a class of nonlinear evolution equations referred to as soliton equations or integrable systems. These equations model a variety of physically interesting phenomena, and they arise in areas ranging from fluid dynamics and nonlinear optics to Bose-Einstein condensates, among others.  The goal of this project was to undertake a wide-ranging investigation of initial and initial-boundary value problems for integrable nonlinear evolution equations, together with their applications in several concrete scientific and technological settings.   Specifically, the following five main types of objectives were pursued, each resulting in original research outcomes:  1. Study of the behavior of modulationally unstable media modeled by equations of nonlinear Schrodinger (NLS) type, including interactions between solitons, radiation, and dispersive shocks.  In particular:  1a. Interactions between solitons in the focusing NLS equation with non&shy;zero boundary conditions (NZBC) were characterized.   1b. Interactions between solitons and the oscillatory wedge generated by the nonlinear stage of modulational instability were also characterized.  In particular, it was shown that, depending on the location of the discrete eigenvalue associated to the soliton, soliton transmission and trapping are possible, as well as the production of a soliton&shy;-generated wake.  1c. Interactions between solitons and dispersive shocks in the focusing NLS equation were characterized.  It was shown that, generically, the soliton is transmitted through the oscillatory wedge, but its properties (such as amplitude, width, velocity and breather&shy;like vs. traveling wave nature) are changed as a result of the interaction, and depend on whether the soliton is traveling on zero vs. nonzero background.   1d. A class of Riemann problems for the focusing NLS equation were studied.  It was shown that in several cases the genus&shy;1 Whitham equations do a remarkable job of describing the dynamics. However, there are other cases in which more powerful asymptotic techniques will be needed to obtain a complete picture.  2. Study of the semiclassical limit of the focusing and defocusing NLS equation with periodic boundary conditions.  The semiclassical limit of the focusing defocusing NLS equations was studied with periodic solutions was studied.  In both cases, asymptotic formulae for the number, location and relative width of the spectral bands were obtained.  It was also shown that, contrary to the defocusing case and the KdV equation, for the focusing NLS equation the semiclassical limit of periodic solutions is in many cases remarkably similar to that of localized solutions.  3. Development of Whitham modulation theory for (2+1)-dimensional evolution equations.  The Whitham modulation equations for the Kadomtsev-Petviashvili (KP) and two-&shy;dimensional Benjamin&shy;Ono (2DBO) equations were derived.  These equations were also used to study the stability of the periodic solutions of the two variants of the KP and 2DBO equations, showing that the periodic solutions of the 2DBOII equation are stable while those of the 2DBOI equation are unstable.   4. Derivation of novel integrable systems.  The dressing method was used to derive two infinite classes of integrable systems, one continuous and one discrete, describing novel coupled systems of NLS type.  5. Study of soliton solutions and their interactions in other nonlinear systems.  Soliton solutions, their interactions and rogue wave solutions were studied and characterized in various systems, including: in three component coupled NLS systems describing spinor Bose Einstein condensates, integrable and non integrable two&shy;-component coupled systems of Manakov type.  The results of the project were disseminated via the publication of refereed journal articles on each of the above topics.  The results were also presented at many international conferences.  Collaborations with researchers in the USA and abroad were made.  Five graduate students were trained as part of this award.  In addition, the PI co-&shy;organized special sessions at various professional meetings.       Last Modified: 01/10/2020       Submitted by: Gino Biondini]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
