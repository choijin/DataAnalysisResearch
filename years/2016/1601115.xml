<AbstractNarration>This project aims to develop new mathematical and computational tools for understanding the basic information-processing strategies of neurons and neural populations in the brain. Recent technological advances have enabled large-scale recordings of neural activity from intact neural circuits, but there is a severe shortage of theoretical methods for revealing what this activity means--that is, what information it carries, and how it gives rise to behavior. The research described in this proposal will address these questions using novel statistical techniques for studying the neural code in single neurons and neural populations, using both extracellularly and intracellularly recorded neural data. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are at least two important statistical aspects to the proposed research: first, new methods for reliably estimating the neurobiological variables of interest (e.g., spikes, membrane currents, synaptic conductances, etc.) from noisy experimental recordings; and second, powerful, flexible, model-based methods for understanding the complex, high-dimensional, and time-dependent relationship between sensory stimuli, behavioral responses, and neural activity. The three specific aims of the proposal focus on: (1) the encoding and decoding of decisions from multi-neuron spike trains in parietal cortex; (2) intracellular signals in visual cortex, at the level of membrane potential and synaptic currents, and their relationship to the information conveyed in spike trains; and (3) advanced methods for adaptive, "closed loop" neurophysiology experiments, leading to more informative experimental designs and more interpretable neural datasets. All three aims will involve intensive collaborations with experimental groups and will tightly integrate theory and experiment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research will reveal new features of visual and cognitive representations in cortex, and will unlock the neural code at multiple levels of biophysical detail in sensory, motor and cognitive systems. More broadly, the research will shed new light on information flow in groups of neurons, with implications for both the treatment of brain disorders and the design of new technology.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This grant provided vital funding to support the development of novel methods for analyzing neural signals recorded in the brain, and to use these methods to gain new insights into brain function. The grant was divided into three primary aims:   Aim 1: Analysis of multi-neuron coding of decisions in parietal cortex.  This aim focused on encoding and decoding decision-related information in spike trains in parietal cortex (area LIP), with the goal of understanding how spike trains in this brain region carry information about an animal's evolving decision. The grant supported research that led to two high-impact papers (Park et al, 2014, and Latimer et al, 2015), which have shed new light on the role of parietal cortex in decision-making.  The first paper (Park 2014) developed a regression model to study how single neurons in LIP encode sensory, motor, and decision variables (in collaboration with Alex Huk’s group at UT Austin).  The paper showed that LIP neurons encode a heterogeneous mixture of sensory, motor, and decision variables, which converge in an approximately multiplicative fashion. Moreover, it showed that the representation of decisions is captured by two&shy; dimensions of population activity, and that is activity can be read out efficiently using a neurally plausible mechanism. The second paper (Latimer 2015) presented a novel comparison of two competing models for the dynamics underlying LIP responses during decision-making: (1) a "ramping" model (the canonical model commonly known as "diffusion to bound"); and (2) a "stepping" model, in which the latent variable jumps instantaneously from one state to another at some time during the trial. This paper showed that roughly 3/4 of the neurons in LIP were better described by the discrete stepping model. This finding was highly surprising in light of an extensive literature arguing for an interpretation of LIP neurons in terms of ramping dynamics. This paper was the first to directly compare the two models using explicit fits to spike train data. It also led to a peer reviewed book chapter describing the methods in detail, and released a GPU&shy;-based implementation of statistical software implementing these methods, which has now been used in a wide variety of other projects (including a series of follow-up papers extending the debate over stepping and ramping dynamics).   Subsequent work supported by the grant led to the publication of an additional Nature paper (Katz et al, 2016), a Nature Neuroscience paper (Yates et al, 2017), and a Neuron paper (Zoltowski et al, 2019), which delved further into the questions raised in these first two papers.   Aim 2: Deciphering intracellular signals in visual cortex.  This aim of the grrant focused on developing new analysis methods for understanding neural codes at the level of membrane potential and synaptic currents. The primary accomplishment was a new method for inferring synaptic conductances (the excitatory and inhibitory signals that provide direct input to a neuron) from their extracellularly recorded spike trains. This work was published in a peer&shy;-reviewed conference proceedings (Latimer et al 2014), in collaboration with Fred Rieke (U. Washington) and EJ Chichilnisky (Stanford University).  It introduced a novel connection between statistical point process models for spike train data and biophysically plausible models formulated at the level of synaptic currents and conductances, and illustrated the method’s accuracy using data from several classes of neurons recorded in the retina.  A journal length version of this manuscript is now available on the bioRxiv, and is on the verge of publication in a peer-reviewed journal.   Aim 3: Advanced hierarchical models and optimal experimental design. The grant’s third aim focused on developing powerful, flexible models of neural responses and using them to select highly informative stimuli in "closed-loop" experiments. Such methods offer major advances for characterizing complex stimulus-response relationships with a minimum amount of experimental data. This work led to several major publications in collaboration with Greg Horwitz’s group at the University of Washington (Park et al 2011, Park et al 2014, and Charles et al 2018), as well as a tutorial book chapter describing recent advances in the general area of adaptive experimental design (Pillow &amp; Park 2016).  These papers describe novel adaptive stimulus selection methods for closed-&shy;loop physiology experiments, as well as an extension to existing models for spike count variability.  This work also inspired a series of important extensions, including new estimators for neural receptive fields that can extract inferences from billions of datapoints in mere minutes (Aoi and Pillow, 2017; Zoltowski &amp; Pillow, 2018), and to new methods for improving stimulus selection during the training of animals to perform new tasks (Bak et al 2016).
