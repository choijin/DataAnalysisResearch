<AbstractNarration>The NSF INCLUDES program supports models, networks, partnerships and research to ensure the broadening participation in STEM of women, members of racial and ethnic groups that have been historically underrepresented, persons of low socio-economic status, and people with disabilities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The University of California-Irvine (UCI), in partnership with the University of California-San Diego and the University of California-Davis will convene a state-wide conference on inclusion in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) higher education.   The California STEM INCLUDES Conference and Network will share best practices for promoting STEM inclusion and provide an infrastructure to further these practices and track the outcomes.  The purpose of the conference is to form a backbone for a large regional network in support of the National Science Foundation's Inclusion across the Nation of Communities of Learners of Underrepresented Discoverers in Engineering and Science (NSF INCLUDES) initiative.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The five goals of the conference are to:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;--increase California educator awareness of demographic gaps in STEM participation and the research on factors influencing such participation gaps;&lt;br/&gt;--engage participants in discussion of promising practices for increasing STEM inclusion&lt;br/&gt;--broaden the impact of existing successful programs for STEM inclusion, through program modification and replication, scale-up, and increased collaboration;&lt;br/&gt;--create a mechanism for sustained discussion, sharing and collaboration around STEM inclusion across California institutions;&lt;br/&gt;--create central repository and common standards for reporting on STEM inclusion and implementation program impact for the state.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Approximately 340 individuals serving a broad cross-section of California's K-12, higher education, public, private and non-profit constituencies will participate in 2 Â½ days of intense dialogue on topics such as data and research, successful implementations and sustainable networks for collaboration and sharing.  The conference will be held in Spring 2017.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Our project, California STEM INCLUDES, convened three conferences/workshops that focused on convening the three public-sectors of higher education in California to leverage their separate expertise and create networks to support improving equity in STEM education. Two major themes emerged from the work. First, the need for an effective state-wide organization that can help coordinate the different sectors of higher education. Since our first convening, the state has established the California Learning Lab. Though not a direct outcome of the conferences, the foundation establish during the meetings played an important role in jump-starting collaborations that could be supported and coordinated by the California Learning Lab. For example, at UCI, we have been able to organize or participate in at least three California Learning Lab funded collaborations. Second, the need to reform Gateway courses in STEM, and the common themes and differences between the different sectors, emerged as a critical area. Through the conferences, we were able to connect with the Gardner Insitute and leverage their expertise and network in this effort. They provided significant support and partnerships for the final two workshops, and now a number of different California institutions are partnering or pursuing partnerships with the institute. The recent events of the COVID pandemic have highlighted more than ever the need for the connections and coordination in teaching that these conferences were able to support. This funding played a critical role in establishing a number of these partnerships and has allowed for continued improvement during these challenging times.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 01/31/2021<br>      Modified by: Michael&nbsp;B&nbsp;Dennin</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
