<AbstractNarration>Ecosystems carry out a wide range of processes, including services that benefit people such as providing clean air, water, pollination of crops, and productive soils.  These processes depend on diverse communities of plants, animals, and other organisms with a wide variety of traits - characteristics of plants and animals that shape how they interact in ecosystems. Human activities that shift communities, such as ecosystem degradation and restoration, have the potential to alter ecosystem processes.  This project will examine how management actions in a restored grassland shape the species and trait compositions of plant and animal communities and the ecosystem processes that these species drive.  Results will provide guidance on how land managers can maximize the benefits of ecosystems to nature and to society.  Collaborations with the research site managers will allow education and outreach opportunities to members of the public who visit the site, including class field trips, and the project will train both graduate and undergraduate students in the practice and communication of science.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will examine the community and ecosystem function consequences of changes in environmental context resulting from three landscape-scale management actions:  reintroduction of megaherbivore grazers (bison), large predator removal, and application of prescribed fires in restored tallgrass prairies.  It will advance knowledge of community-trait-function relationships by including consumers in interactions spanning entire food webs and expanding to a relevant landscape scale.  Researchers will measure both traits and ecosystem function changes resulting from management actions in two food web modules.  The first module includes plants and herbivores (insect and small mammal) and their impacts on primary productivity and litter decomposition through changes in plant traits and herbivore foraging specialization and the degree to which herbivores use a wide variety of food resources (niche breadth) as measured by stable isotopes.  The second module is dung decomposers and their effects on soil processes (carbon and nitrogen cycling and decomposition rates) through changes in morphology, foraging strategies, and phenology.  Results will reveal how the trait composition of communities mediates the relationship between environmental context and ecosystem function.  Ultimately this research will lay the groundwork for studies manipulating the species- and trait-composition of consumer communities.  Further, by performing this work in a restored system and in concert with managers, it helps close the loop between researchers and natural resource managers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Focusing on two trophic modules (plants/herbivores and dung decomposers) in a restored grassland, we:   Identified the species and functional trait composition effects of management disturbances on herbivores (both vertebrate and invertebrate), plants, and dung-associated arthropods. Measured changes in ecosystem function resulting from species/functional trait variation in the communities for each module.     We used a large-scale prairie restoration project to investigate how plant and consumer communities assemble under habitat management practices and the consequences for ecosystem processes to which these organisms contributed. We performed detailed surveys of communities of plants, small mammals, and ground-dwelling arthropods with a focus on dung beetles and ground beetles for three years and characterized each community with taxon-specific functional traits. We measured ecosystem processes relevant to each group, including aboveground net primary productivity, stable isotope-based trophic niche breadth, dung decomposition, seed predation, and arthropod predation.  Our study is the first to measure how bison are impacting restored prairies and is unique in its approach to quantifying responses of many different food web members (trophic levels).  Our findings bring important understanding into the ways reintroduced bison, prescribed fire, and restoration progress impact plants, invertebrates, and small mammals and how those impacts impact ecosystem functioning.  We find that different methods of measuring functional traits ? traits of plants and/or animals that are associated with a specific ecosystem function ? yield different answers and thus it is important for researchers to choose their methodology carefully.  The intellectual merit outcomes of our project included:  Three published manuscripts, three manuscripts in review, and three manuscripts in preparation. 5 Master?s student theses published, 2 more in preparation. Demonstration of how different methods of measuring functional traits yields different insights. First research on how reintroduced bison impact restored prairie communities and ecosystem function.    The broader impact outcomes of our project included:  11 conference presentations Nearly 100 K-12 students engaged on the research topic, from schools all over the U.S. 23 students trained in science techniques and communication (2 REU students, 10 undergraduates, 9 graduate students, and 2 technicians) Collaboration with managers at the research site, and thus direct delivery of results that are being used to inform future management strategies Outreach to hundreds of members of the public Interviews with members of the media, with resulting publications in CNN and Nature World News Engagement of staff and members of congress through a presentation at the Coalition for National Science Funding conference in Washington D.C. as well as meetings with Senate and House staffers and members of the House Science, Space, and Technology staff.
