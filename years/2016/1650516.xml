<AbstractNarration>The NSF INCLUDES program supports models, networks, partnerships and research to ensure the broadening participation in STEM of women, members of racial and ethnic groups that have been historically underrepresented, persons of low socio-economic&lt;br/&gt;status, and people with disabilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Georgia Department of Education will convene the "CS in the ATL" conference on inclusion in the computer science discipline during the February/March 2017 timeframe in Atlanta, Georgia.  The conference includes several workshops on backbone organization design in support of the National Science Foundation's Inclusion across the Nation of Communities of Learners of Underrepresented Discoverers in Engineering and Science (NSF INCLUDES) initiative.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Approximately 150 individuals serving a broad cross-section of Georgia's K-12, higher education, public, private and non-profit constituencies as well as representatives of the inaugural NSF Design and Development Launch Pilot projects will participate in 2 days of conference workshops - the results of which will be disseminated via a dedicated website and conference report.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  The purpose of NSF INCLUDES supported Atlanta Backbone Organization Design Workshop was to benefit Computer Science (CS) and STEM education initiatives by engaging them in a community of learning and providing concrete backbone design technical assistance. The workshop was organized by members of CS4ATL collective impact initiative. The workshop was a response to the need for access to quality CS education and our local and national governments prioritizing STEM/CS initiatives.   The ?Atlanta Workshop? was actually two trainings.  One was a digital platform that provided the opportunity for dozens of participants from around the country and the world to learn about and begin designing their collective impact/backbone efforts.  The other was an in-person workshop where participants were able to create draft plans for their collective impact efforts with help from a national collective impact planning leader.  The ultimate outcome was to assist participants in both learning spaces to improve the involvement and success of diverse populations in CS education and the workforce.  The other outcome was to build on our knowledge of evidence-based collective impact frameworks.  Objectives for the workshop were  Contract experts to facilitate learning about backbone design learning strategies so that all participants have the opportunity to leave with a backbone organization design for their collective impact effort; Provide participants with concrete examples of successful backbone organizations and how relevant components could be replicated by others; Identify how to use collective impact to guide the development of strategies that address successful implementation of CS education that is more inclusive and accessible to all students; Conduct a ?lessons learned? workshop session to capture the most important backbone design elements/approaches to share with NSF INCLUDES Alliances and Network.   We believe that we achieved and even surpassed our goals by providing pre-workshop online learning and a two-day workshop convening.    In many ways, the Digital Scholar Workshop was a trial to determine if an online learning community could help CS/STEM initiatives to broaden participation by priority groups.  We were able to help many of the participants to advance their organizing efforts.  The CS/STEM collective impact learning community we created in Digital Scholar developed new ways of creating, sharing, and improving their concepts.  With some additional support from the NSF and others, this learning community could continue to advance efforts for improving collective impact-like initiatives.  However, we were not able to keep the INCLUDES Launch Pilots engaged. The vast majority of those who completed the course were from other CS/STEM education initiatives in the US and around the world.   The Atlanta Workshop Convening had a much higher participation rate from Launch Pilots.  We were able to help connect peer CS/STEM broadening participation initiatives and have them learn together from someone with national expertise on collective impact and backbone function design.  They were able to test out their initial broadening participation ideas and therefore speed up their learning curve on collective impact and backbone functions.  We contracted with national and international experts to facilitate both components of our ?conference?.  LSi International led the Digital Scholar online course and Jeff Edmondson of StriveTogether highlighted our in-person Atlanta Convening.  Other local and regional experts were also brought in to help with training needs. Not only were concrete examples shared before and during each training component, we also had experts and participants who had already effectively implemented backbone functions for their collective impact like initiatives. In both the digital and in-person training settings, we always began with the overall purpose of the collective impact model and how to ensure that its priority is to expand benefits to all those students and families with the least resources. We also reminded both training groups that our funding support came from INCLUDES and what the intention of that source of funding was. The INCLUDES purpose was used as a framework to guide our discussions for individual projects as well as for how we are building a national movement to ensure all young people have access to quality CS/STEM education. We not only ended both training components (Digital Scholar and Atlanta Convening) with a ?lessons learned? session, we also did a three month follow up survey with the Atlanta Convening cohort. That group had much better INCLUDES Launch Pilot participation and therefore their feedback was more relevant for NSF feedback.  Overall, both groups see a need for ongoing support for the new CS/STEM education networks that are forming.  They also would like better vetting of trainings to ensure they truly are relevant to their collective impact planning needs.    We followed up the trainings by creating a site with our lessons learned, relevant information about collective impact, and about the CS collective impact effort in Georgia. We also applied the lessons learned in a convening of several states interested in using collective impact to broaden participation in computer science education.
