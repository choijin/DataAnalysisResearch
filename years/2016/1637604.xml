<AbstractNarration>Prior work has demonstrated the potential economic and environmental benefits of ride-sharing; however, ride-sharing has not been adopted by the majority of travelers, since previous efforts aimed to maximize the number of participants but failed to take travelers social attributes into account. One of the major challenges in advocating ride-sharing is how to reduce social barriers. Taking advantage of advances in information technology and social media for building smart communities, and with emerging social attitudes regarding travel behavior, ride-sharing along with its social experience should be considered as a viable and possibly dominant mode of transportation in smart communities. This EArly-concept Grant for Exploratory Research (EAGER) project will address the current social barriers to ride-sharing and will provide more appealing ride matches leading to increased user participation. While a slight compromise in travel time may be tolerated by users in exchange of better social experience, the economy of scale in social ride-sharing would result in better performance of transportation systems in smart cities and communities. The project will support the realization of asocial ride-sharing system that can serve in validating the long-term research goals of deploying Social Transportation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this research is to develop theoretical foundations for supporting social ride-sharing. Users social attributes and preferences will be jointly determined by two innovative patterns: the spatial-activity pattern and the social-activity pattern. A probabilistic location clustering model will be built to identify abnormal non-commuting travels for the spatial-activity pattern. This project leverages a key word-search approach and topic recognition to estimate travelers social activities and travel purposes for the social-activity pattern. Novel optimization models for estimation of travel pattern from social media and ride-sharing data will be developed, to include using state-of-the-art matrix estimation techniques to infer various aspects of travel pattern, such as regular and special-pattern (anomalous) trips by type, time of day, day-of-week, etc. This step is particularly innovative in that these estimation methods are new to the transportation field, and their successful application would be beneficial to the research community. New theory will be developed for social ride-sharing in maximizing both riders satisfaction and trip efficiency. A living lab will be used in collaboration with local entities to demonstrate the pilot implementation of the research product.</AbstractNarration>

This project consists of three components: 1) Travel behavior analysis with multiple datasets; 2) Modeling the public?s social preference in a shared ride; 3) Develop a living lab of the ridesharing platform.</p> <p>In travel behavior analysis, Household Travel Survey data, combined GPS data, was clustered with a novel network-based method for dividing travelers into groups based on their daily travel traces. Each cluster can be clearly labeled with existing known traveler classifications. In sum, individuals can be clustered into 6 groups:</p> <ul> <li>Cluster 1: Non-working individuals with more shopping activities</li> <li>Cluster 2: Non-working individuals with more recreation activities</li> <li>Cluster 3: Individuals with normal working start time and a full-time job</li> <li>Cluster 4: Individuals with a part-time job</li> <li>Cluster 5: Individuals with late start working time</li> <li>Cluster 6: Individuals who need to attend school</li> </ul> <p>Since different travelers have inherently different travel characteristics, such data-driven clustering results could be employed for identifying long-term ride-sharing partners.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Further, this study examines how to leverage social media data (from Twitter.com), together with GPS data and Point of Interests (POI) in Google places to identify and predict traveler?s trip purposes. We develop a novel Dynamic Bayesian Model to model a traveler?s trip chain in one day. As a first attempt, we find out that Google Places and Tweet greatly increase the accuracy compared with the model with only trip information in identifying trip purposes. The results also indicate that activity duration can also greatly increase the accuracy compared with the model without activity duration.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In order to understand the social preference in a shared ride, this study developed a model to calculate the matching index of a shared ride based on the characteristics of two individuals (driver and passenger). After collecting the responses from a survey, this study examines the social preferences of ridesharing passengers for other passengers and drivers. A factor analysis of responses to Likert scale attitudinal statements identified four latent factors. We interpreted these factors as Organizational (Factor 1), Socioeconomic (Factor 2), Smoking/Drinking Habits (Factor 3) and Sociodemographic (Factor 4).</p> <p>First, individuals with anxiety tend to ride with similar type passengers with respect to (i) organizational activities; (ii) socioeconomics and (iii) drinking/smoking habits. Anxious individuals who self-identify as quarrelsome with others intuitively would not prefer to ride with anyone in general, let alone passengers with similar characteristics.&nbsp; Conventional individuals who do not experiment much not surprisingly do prefer passengers with similar preferences. Conversely, individuals who are open to new experiences do not prefer passengers with similar smoking/drinking habits or similar races. With respect to the preference for similar race rideshare passengers, Asians have the highest preference for similar race passengers, followed by Native Hawaiians and those that self-identify as quiet and introspective. The model estimation did not reveal significant gender differences for preferring similar race and drinking/smoking habits. We also developed a matching index to quantify the preference between driver and passenger.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, this project pinpoints the existing barriers that are preventing drivers from wanting to partake in ride-sharing programs. According to the responses, the highest ranked reason why drivers would want to ride-share is to save money. Environmental concerns are also a choice that respondents agreed with. Meeting new people, however, did not seem to be a reason why drivers would ride-share. According to the results, safety concerns is the biggest barrier when it comes to participating in shared ride. Cheap pay and inconvenience to their schedules are also potential barriers. The only barrier that did not seem to matter is confidence in a driver?s driving abilities.&nbsp;</p> <p>Finally, this project developed an Android app to provide real-time ride-hailing service for UB students, faculty and staff to travel among UB three campuses (north, south and medical campus). In 2019, we recruited total 23 drivers and passengers for this study. Total 41 trips were conducted given that each driver and passenger will ride-share max 5 times. Each driver was compensated with $10 and each passenger $5. Each participant will score their ride-sharing partner after each trip. This app provides a ride-sharing platform to test different matching algorithms in the future.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 08/22/2019<br>      Modified by: Qing&nbsp;He</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1637604/1637604_10445331_1566447481788_1-behavior--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1637604/1637604_10445331_1566447481788_1-behavior--rgov-800width.jpg" title="travel behavior clusters"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1637604/1637604_10445331_1566447481788_1-behavior--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="travel behavior clusters"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">This figure presents six clusters of travelers which have different travel characteristics.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Yu Cui</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Qing&nbsp;He</div> <div class="imageTitle">travel behavior clusters</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1637604/1637604_10445331_1566447609007_2-trippurpose--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1637604/1637604_10445331_1566447609007_2-trippurpose--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Trip purpose prediction"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1637604/1637604_10445331_1566447609007_2-trippurpose--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Trip purpose prediction"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">This figure shows the accuracy deduction by removing different sets of features.
