<AbstractNarration>This Smart and Connected Communities research project focuses on developing an innovative solution for enabling emergency communications during disaster recovery.  An aerial base station can substitute for a damaged cell tower and provide cellular connectivity among the first responders and citizens who were impacted by a natural or manmade disaster until the damaged cell tower is restored. The project will lead to fundamental understanding of the science and engineering aspects of the design and deployment of aerial base stations. It will result in a proof-of-concept for a deployable communication system. Aerial base stations have the advantage of higher altitude compared to regular cell towers. They provide better coverage and connectivity to the users. They can be deployed more quickly after a disaster when compared to Cells on Wheels which are traditionally deployed by cellular providers during disaster recovery.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project addresses the capability to quick deploy a communication system, which is a technology gap in today's emergency communication systems. The proposed research investigates efficient strategies for providing cellular coverage in areas where the coverage is not available or lost due to loss of cell towers. It brings the network closer to the disaster victims and relays the voice calls and data between the first responders and victims. The immediate need for quickly deployable communication systems during disaster recovery times makes this project a high-risk and high-reward project. Graduate and undergraduate students, who are participating in this research project will gain hands-on experience in developing innovative solutions for communities effected by disasters.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This smart and connected community project engages local communities including the Fire Department and the Civil Air Patrol in the City of Denton, Texas, as well as private organizations in Telecommunications and Aviation industry. The project will be demonstrated in two phases during the Global City Team Challenge Exhibitions (2016 and 2017) organized jointly by the U.S. Ignite and the National Institute of Standards and Technology.</AbstractNarration>

The PI demonstrated the initial versions of flying cell tower during the Global City team Challenge (GCTC) exhibitions organized by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in 2015, 2016, and 2017. Funding from NSF helped the team to bring the concept to practice.&nbsp;</p> <p>Over the two years of the funding period, the project resulted in the development of a rapidly deployable communication system that can be readily deployed in emergency situations for the purpose of facilitating disaster-relief operations. The first full version of the project with complete functionality was demonstrated in May 2017 at Waxahachie, TX.&nbsp; The demonstration involved integrating a 4G LTE base station with an unmanned aircraft system (UAS) as shown in Figure 1. The LTE base station is portable and in its smallest version weighs about 2 lbs. The base station along with a battery of its own that weighs about 2 lbs., was lifted into the air by a commercial grade UAV as shown in Fig.2. The LTE base station was tuned to Band 14 (700 MHz) that is reserved for public safety communications. Appropriate certifications and approvals were obtained from the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) before deploying the communication system. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) requirements were handled by the Lone Star UAS Center (LSUASC) of Excellence, one of the six UAS test sites established by FAA.&nbsp; The performance of the system was evaluated by flying the aerial base station as shown in Fig. 3 at various altitudes and distances from the Ground Control Station (GCS) as depicted in Fig. 4.</p> <p><strong>Outcome 2 &ndash; An IoT Ecosystem around Deployable Communication System</strong></p> <p>The project also resulted in the design of an ecosystem of Internet of Things (IoT) around the emergency communication system. The ecosystem includes an incident command system (ICS) that displays the time-critical information such as the locations of the disaster victims, services, and resources (personnel and vehicles) to assist officials in decision-making and resource allocation during disaster-relief operations. Sensors such as the vehicle trackers and wearable devices such as the heart-rate monitors constantly transmit data to the ICS such that up-to-fate information is available at the command center as well as on the mobile devices used by the first responders. A prototype for the IoT ecosystem was demonstrated on May 4<sup>th</sup>, 2017 during the annual emergency drill conducted by the City of Denton.</p> <p><strong>Outcome 3 &ndash; Public-private-government Partnership</strong></p> <p>The team established a public-private-government partnership and engaged in a whole-community approach to demonstrate the utility of the Deployable Communication System during emergency scenarios. Two private companies (Virtual network Communications Inc., and Unmanned Experts Inc.) provided the expertise needed to integrate various components of the aerial base station. The City of Denton in partnership with the University of North Texas conducted the full-scale emergency drill. Lone Star UAS Center (LSUASC) of Excellence conducted the flight tests needed for the demonstration and experimental data collection.&nbsp; Subject matter experts assisted the team in data analysis.</p> <p><strong>Outcome 4 &ndash; A Study of&nbsp; Inter-organizational Communications during Disaster-Relief Operations</strong></p> <p>Another key outcome of the project is a study of the inter-organizational communications during emergency situations. &nbsp;The team actively engaged in the two annual emergency drills conducted by the City of Denton and studied the patterns of inter-organizational communications during disaster-relief operations. &nbsp;The motivation for developing, administering, and participating in full-scale disaster drills are multifold. Emergency drills not only test the capacity of the emergency system, but also allow organizations to learn as well as improve processes and communication structures before disasters strike. They have been used as a platform to develop and maintain collaborative networks. &nbsp;The team examined the extent to which organizations collaborate with others during emergency/disaster drills. A social network analysis is employed to determine the patterns of communication and inter-organizational networks during the planning and implementation of a full-scale emergency exercise. The team studied the communication lines that stakeholders use to receive updated information, who they reach when standard communication channels were down, and what backup systems are in place. The research was conducted in the City of Denton, Texas. The study was based on field observations and involved 14 face-to-face interviews with experienced public officials and first responders involved in a municipal government emergency drills/exercises. The interviews were administered after the 2017 full-scale emergency drill.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 02/09/2019<br>      Modified by: Kameswara Rao&nbsp;Namuduri</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1622978/1622978_10438264_1549484815658_20170503_115937.AR-Grncl-crop--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1622978/1622978_10438264_1549484815658_20170503_115937.AR-Grncl-crop--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Fig. 2: Flying Cell Tower - Lifting off the ground"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1622978/1622978_10438264_1549484815658_20170503_115937.AR-Grncl-crop--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Fig. 2: Flying Cell Tower - Lifting off the ground"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Figure 2: The flying cell tower just lifted off the ground.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Kameswara Rao Namuduri</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Royalty-free (restricted use - cannot be shared)</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Kameswara Rao&nbsp;Namuduri</div> <div class="imageTitle">Fig. 2: Flying Cell Tower - Lifting off the ground</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1622978/1622978_10438264_1549484431014_20170503_110816--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1622978/1622978_10438264_1549484431014_20170503_110816--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Fig. 1: Aerial Base Station (aka Flying Cell Tower)"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1622978/1622978_10438264_1549484431014_20170503_110816--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Fig. 1: Aerial Base Station (aka Flying Cell Tower)"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Flying cell Tower before deployment: The blue box contains the smallest version of  4G LTE node that weighs about 2 lbs.
