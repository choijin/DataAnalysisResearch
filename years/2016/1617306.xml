<AbstractNarration>This project studies algorithms for counting and sampling problems.  For an exponentially large set of discrete, combinatorial objects, the goal is to estimate the size of this set or randomly sample from it in polynomial-time. Algorithms for these problems are used in a variety of scientific fields, often with little rigorous guarantees on their performance, and the results of this project will enhance the reliability of such studies.  The results of this project will enhance connections between statistical physics and theoretical computer science by formalizing connections between phase transitions in statistical physics with the efficiency of algorithms for this type of counting/sampling problems. In addition, the PI will organize inter-disciplinary workshops tying together researchers from statistical physics, discrete mathematics, and theoretical computer science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Loopy Belief Propagation (BP) and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms are two popular algorithms for the counting/sampling problems of approximating partition functions and sampling from Gibbs distributions. In this project the PI intends to present new techniques for proving convergence results for loopy BP and MCMC algorithms. This will result in new, efficient counting/sampling algorithms for problems of combinatorial interest including weighted independent sets and colorings of a graph. These results will enhance recent results establishing beautiful connections between the approximability of counting problems for graphs of maximum degree D with statistical physics phase transitions for infinite D-regular trees.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project formalizes connections of statistical physics phase transitions with convergence properties of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms, and more generally, with the computational complexity of approximate counting/sampling problems.  The problems studied in this project arise in a variety of settings, such as Bayesian inference or learning graphical models.  In statistical physics the associated problems correspond to estimating the partition function or sampling from the Gibbs distribution, and are essential for studying phase transitions in idealized models of physical systems in equilibirum.   Two widely-used approaches for counting/sampling problems are MCMC algorithms and message passing algorithms such as belief propagation (BP).  This project yielded new results on the convergence properties of MCMC and BP algorithms, and new connections between these two algorithmic approaches.  These results utilize new connections to statistical physics phase transitions in the associated models.  In addition this project provides many new results on the convergence rates of Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithms in an array of different settings.  The project supported an interdisciplinary workshop bringing together researchers from theoretical computer science, statistical physics, and probability theory.  The project helped support a PhD student and postdoc, and involved undergraduates in a MCMC research project with social science applications.
