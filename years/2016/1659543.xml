<AbstractNarration>Renewed funding for a Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) program at Old Dominion University (ODU) will support research training and professional development for ten undergraduates each summer for three years. ODU is the located in the Hampton Roads region of Virginia, a metropolitan region of 1.6 million inhabitants. The region includes the largest naval complex in the world, and is situated at the conjunction of the Elizabeth and Lafayette Rivers, tidal tributaries flowing into southern Chesapeake Bay. Coastal flooding during spring tides and storms is increasing as a result of the high rates of sea level rise in the Hampton Roads region, currently 4 to 10 cm per decade. Research opportunities at this REU will focus on coastal resilience, sea level rise and the impact of the changing environment on urban communities. Students receive a stipend for the summer research internship, housing and travel expenses. The ten-week program will provide students an opportunity for independent research and will include professional development activities that include field trips to show the students first-hand evidence of sea level rise in Hampton Roads on short and long-term timescales and weekly workshops on topics such as scientific ethics, scientific writing and communication. This REU program will help train thirty undergraduates in research related to coastal resilience and promotes the Division of Ocean Sciences goals related to development a scientific workforce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ODU REU program will focus on sea level rise and extreme events, such as recurrent flooding in the urban coastal environment, and will incorporate these topics into a global perspective. Students will explore a suite of issues related to the relative rate of sea-level rise, addressing topics including true global mean sea level, the effects of high frequency storm events, inundation of coastal lands, antibiotic resistance of human pathogens, geodynamical contributions to regional sea level change, nutrient delivery and cycling in waters affected by changing sea levels, local, regional and global processes contributing to sea level rise, and ocean acidification and temperature effects on Chesapeake Bay sea grasses.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The overall goal of the REU site program based in the department of  Ocean and Earth Sciences at Old Dominion University was to engage students in the research process associated with multiple aspects of the impact of sea level rise and climate in a metropolitan coastal community with an interdisciplinary team of faculty mentors.  The broad focus on sea level rise and climate science allowed undergraduates scholars from multiple backgrounds to research a relevant and related topic across disciplines and provided a broad portfolio of interactions.  The program was led by a tenured faculty member with faculty mentors inclusive of climate scientists, environmental engineers, oceanographers, and social scientists.  The experience was framed to provide students an understanding of research activities across the interdisciplinary arena of rising seas and its impact and to expose students to the associated skills needed to be successful in STEM fields.  This included opportunities to develop the science communications needed for public interaction and the translation of complex issues into a public dialogue.     Over 2017-2019 award period 29 undergraduates participated in the 10 week residential  summer program representing a diverse set of students including first generation college students.   Several participants were from community colleges and many from small colleges with limited accessibility to opportunities to participate in research.  Students were given training in research methods and experimental design by their individual faculty mentors and also participated in weekly workshops specifically designed for professional development in the STEM arena.  These weekly workshops spanned a diverse range of topics, but included science communication to the public, research ethics, graduate school options, and oral presentation design and skills.     Project outcomes associated with intellectual began with interactions of each faculty mentors spanning a related discipline.  The science issues behind these ranged from classic ocean science questions of elemental cycling and pollutants, to the transition across the land sea interface of urban estuaries and nutrients.   This also included regular interaction with experts in the local region and took advantage of several university efforts to address the impact of tidal and episodic flooding on urban resilience such as the Commonwealth Center for Recurrent Flooding Resiliency (CCRFR) which focuses on the challenges to coastal environments that cross disciplinary boundaries.   This holistic approach helped to develop a new generation of scientists in coastal climate change research and public involvement. Through recruitment of students across the diversity spectrum, undergraduates who experienced our program gained skills in actual research questions and were trained in the science communication skills needed to be successful in their future research endeavors.   An explicit part of the broader impacts of this program was to include social science faculty embedded as part of the faculty team to assess the strengths of the program and determine how students gain scientific insight of graduate level research and broader perception of societal issues.  Regular surveys conducted over all three years revealed three important areas of growth for students including: (1) gains in specific knowledge and skills needed for scientific research activities (2) strengthened insight and commitment towards science career-related goals, and (3) increased confidence to participate effectively in scientific communities of discourse and practice.  The program also took an inclusive approach towards both students and early career professional development by integrating a senior doctoral student as a program coordinator.  The REU experience model with a program coordinator and near-peer mentor was strongly favored in post program surveys and interviews.  The results reveal gains in specific knowledge and skills, the manner in which career commitments were being considered by the students, and the ways in which  seminars affected students’ confidence to communicate to a scientific community.  A key metric for the REU program is continued engagements in science whether through graduate programs or science careers.  Nine of the  REU students subsequently participated in regional or national science conferences with presentations of their research results; several  were involved in peer-reviewed publications based on their contributions to ongoing projects.
