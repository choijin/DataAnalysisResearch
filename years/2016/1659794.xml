<AbstractNarration>This new three-year Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site Program, located within the Engineering Research Center (ERC), Power Optimization of Electro-Thermal Systems (POETS), at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign will enhance the knowledge and skill-level of a diverse cohort of undergraduate students with limited access to research opportunities through empowering, hands-on and interdisciplinary research experiences in the area of thermal management of heat in mobile powered devices.  The POETS REU Site located within four institutions-the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Howard University, Stanford University and the University of Arkansas, will train and mentor a diverse set of undergraduate students, including students from underrepresented minority groups with a multidisciplinary, systems approach. The program takes an intergenerational approach where the REU students will be mentored by more experienced researchers and they will serve as leaders and mentors to high school students, gaining experiences so they better see themselves as on a journey toward the expertise they will need as successful researchers. After the completion of the summer experience the REU students will the POETS team will strive to develop a long-term relationship, keeping the students informed about opportunities that arise, thus addressing the goal of solidifying REU student interest in graduate research.        &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each summer, 10 students will be hosted by the four POETS ERC institutions where they will address the timely and critical problem impeding development of many mobile systems - the thermal constraints that arise from increased power densities.  Through their projects the students will be able to readily see the connections and interactions between different disciplines and research teams as they engage in their own research.  Additionally, the REU students will be trained in critical elements of leadership, safety, ethics, teamwork, and outreach.  Their communication abilities, both written and oral will be developed as they prepare and present their research results as well as prepare a draft of an REU graduate fellowship application. The impact of this Site will be to excite, empower, and educate students, and to enable/inspire them to pursue advanced study and STEM careers.</AbstractNarration>
