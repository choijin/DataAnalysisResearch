<AbstractNarration>The long-duration Louisiana rainfall event of August 2016 was not anticipated and the extent of flooding came as an unwelcome surprise. This RAPID project will document how human interventions on the landscape surrounding the Amite River may have influenced the extent and patterns of flooding. Specifically, mining of gravel from the river and floodplains has led to large areas of mobile sand and channel shortening as well as the subsequent remobilization of sediment into cypress swamps and delta regions. Data gathered from this project will map the extent of high water and sediment deposition in order to develop models that will help predict the response to future heavy-rainfall episodes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This RAPID project will support a field effort (1) to document the geomorphic response of the Amite River to the August 2016 rainfall, (2) to analyze channel planform changes and cross-check with remote-sensing images and (3) to develop numerical models for predicting morphological response to future events. In addition, the research will examine flood layer deposition in the lower Amite River basin to quantify and map the sediment distribution from the flood. Choking of the lower basin channel by bed-load material may have exacerbated backwater flooding in some areas. However, the sediment may also nourish the cypress-tupelo swamps in the lower basin that have been sediment-starved due to isolation from the Mississippi River and are drowning under rising sea levels.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Amite River project examined the impact of the 1000-year flood event in 2016 in the river's basin in Louisiana.  This flood destroyed over 100,000 homes and businesses and was made worse by drainage improvements, levees and neighborhood developments done without a master plan for the basin.  These resulted in backwater flooding and redirection of floodwaters into developed areas.  The main effort was an examination of river evolution caused by the flood, using a combination of rapid response field measurements (flood heights, floodplain sediment layer thicknesses and granulometry, etc.), high-resolution satellite imagery of channel morphological evolution pre- and post-flood, and boat-based examination of the morphological response at the river's mouths in Lake Maurepas (a tidal estuary).  These results demonstrated that the river channel's sinuosity was reduced in the reach above the tidal limit.  This straightening was accomplished by abandonment of more sinuous sub-channels in braided reaches, and new channel creation that abandoned sinuous reaches.  These processes of straightening were concentrated in reaches where gravel mining immediately adjacent to the channel in the floodplain had enhanced coarse sediment supply. We hypothesize that the morphological evolution was a response of the channel of the need for greater channel efficiency to advect the enormous coarse sediment load entrained (bedload and suspended) during the 2016 flood.  Flood heights and sediment deposition in the floodplain was also guided, in some reaches, by the presence of bridges, levees and other raised improvements that focused the flooding.  In addition to its intellectual merit, this work is being transmitted to regional and State authorities planning for future basin infrastructural modifications to development in this fast-growing suburb of Baton Rouge, LA.
