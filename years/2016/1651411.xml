<AbstractNarration>The phenomenology of the Earth's equatorial ionosphere with respect to vertical profiles of basic parameters such as the neutral wind and temperature as well as plasma density and ion/electron temperatures is complex.  The root causes of the complexity lie in the mutually coupled dynamics of thermospheric winds, conductivity, electric fields and currents operating under the influence of the geomagnetic field.  This region is also exposed to the continual varying conditions of both terrestrial weather and space weather, which taken together give rise to large day-to-day variability.  The project's objective is to achieve the development of a comprehensive data assimilation approach tailored specifically to the problem of low-latitude electrodynamics that would close the gap in our understanding of the origins of longitudinal dependence and its day-to-day variability.  The project would broaden the education and training experiences of a graduate student at University of Texas Dallas (UTD) and a postdoctoral researcher at University of Colorado Boulder (CU-Boulder) by their participation in this multi-faceted research approach.  The UTD graduate student will spend a summer visiting CU-Boulder and NCAR for training in the use of numerical modeling and data assimilation tools.  The investigation is highly relevant to the need of the modern society for more powerful and reliable communication, navigation and positioning systems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specific science questions to be addressed in this project include 1) the quantitative breakdown of the causes of the observed day-to-day variability of daytime large scale equatorial phenomena along with its longitudinal and seasonal dependency; and 2) to what extent is the longitudinal dependence controlled by the geometry and magnitude of geomagnetic fields, and by the atmospheric tides originating from longitudinal asymmetric sources on the Earth's surface.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual merit  Lead by the University of Colorado, the project revealed the importance of the lower atmosphere forcing in capturing the day-to-day variability of the equatorial electrodynamics on regional levels, while direct solar forcing is associated with global scale day-to-day variability. The uncertainty in the equatorial electrodynamics is also strongly affected by magnetosphere-ionosphere forcing. Constraining the simulated plasma density via assimilating electron density profiles improves the modelled equatorial electrodynamics with observations.  Lead by the University of Colorado, the project started to evaluate simulated daytime, low latitude magnetic perturbations to ground and LEO data, identifying different level of agreement at the ground and LEO between model and observation, indicating a need to better understand the influence of the Earth induced contribution included due to oceans.  Broader impact of HAO funded part  The project involved several students /post-docs who presented results at national and international meetings (e.g. AGU, CEDAR) reported by the PI Tomoko Matsuo.   Graduate student (master) from University of Texas, Dallas, Gayatri Iyer: She visited HAO/NCAR in the summer 2018, and used and updated python code to compare C/NOFS ion drift data with simulated data from the Thermosphere-Ionosphere-Electrodynamics General Circulation Model (TIEGCM). Post-doc, Chih-Ting Hsu, from the University of Colorado, Boulder: She worked with HAO project scientist to set up TIEGCM ensemble simulations and carefully compare characteristics of simulated and observed data. Graduate student (PhD) Chuan-Ping Lien from The University of Colorado, Boulder: He got trained in using a new ionospheric electrodynamo code developed at HAO to determine magnetic perturbation at the ground and at low Earth orbit altitudes.
