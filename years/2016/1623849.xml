<AbstractNarration>A request is made by the University of Washington to fund additional and replacement instrumentation for the R/V Thompson, a 274? general purpose, global class research vessel, and R/V Barnes, a 66-foot coastal research vessel, both operated as part of the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System research fleet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These platforms provide facilities for conducting oceanographic research funded by the National Science Foundation and other federal agencies. The instrumentation they propose to acquire will provide operational flexibility to projects that are embarked upon both vessels and will increase their capacity to do useful science and data collection during transits between funded cruises. Thompson completed 275 days in 2015; 133 of these days (48%) were for NSF. On Barnes, 9 of the 50 days (18%) were for NSF. In 2016, Thompson is scheduled for 130 days and 49 (38%) are for NSF. The schedule is light for Thompson because she goes into the yard for a mid-life refit in June. Barnes is scheduled to sail 86 days in 2016, with 9 days (9%) funded by NSF. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Shipboard Scientific Support Equipment requested in this proposal includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;R/V Atlantic Explorer DESH-5 Winch Refurbishment /Upgrade $582,050 &lt;br/&gt;Gyrocompass System $379,377 &lt;br/&gt;      $961,427 &lt;br/&gt;       &lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;The principal impact of the present proposal is under Merit Review Criterion 2 of the Proposal Guidelines (NSF 13-589). It provides infrastructure support for scientists to use the vessel and its shared-use instrumentation in support of their NSF-funded oceanographic research projects (which individually undergo separate review by the relevant research program of NSF).  The acquisition,  maintenance and operation of shared-use instrumentation allows NSF-funded researchers from any US university or lab access to working, calibrated instruments for their research, reducing the cost of that research, and expanding the base of potential researchers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Originally, subject grant funded the upgrade of one Markey DESH-5 hydrographic winch system for R/V Atlantic Explorer as well as the procurement and installation of a new gyrocompass system for R/V Thomas G. Thompson.  Shortly, after award of this grant the Bermuda Insitute of Ocean Sciences indicated that it was impractical to pursue upgrade of the hydrographic winch for R/V Atlantic Explorer due to the major implications installation of such a winch would have on the ship's electrical systems.  UW then requested authorization from the NSF/OCE/IPS Program Manager for Shipboard Scientific Support Equipment to utilize the remaining funds for upgrades to Thompson's installed scientific systems in conjunction with the planned mid-life refit of R/V Thompson.  That request was approved and UW proceeded to complete a number of major projects to upgrade and/or replace existing scientific systems on the Thompson as follows:  Renewal of the gyrocompass system with a state of the art fully redundant fiberoptic gyro system Additional modifications needed to support installation of refurbished and upgraded Markey DESH-5 hydrographic winches (2 ea) Upgrades and repairs to the hydroboom overboarding system Upgrades and repairs to the stern A-frame overboarding system Installation of a new Electronic Charting and Display System Removal of the obsolete Hydrosweep bottom mapping system   The Mid-life Refit of R/V Thompson was completed in December 2017 and the ship returned to un-restricted science operations in early 2018.  Since then it has supported a number of major science programs while working in the Western and Southern Pacific Ocean as well as throughout the Indian Ocean.
