<AbstractNarration>Understanding the history of galaxy and cluster formation fundamentally affects our knowledge&lt;br/&gt;of the Universe as a whole, and sets the context for our place within the Universe. &lt;br/&gt;This project will use Blue Waters to model the formation and evolution &lt;br/&gt;of a population of galaxies in a Coma-sized galaxy cluster, including their contribution &lt;br/&gt;to and interaction with the Intra-Cluster Medium (ICM).  Modeling galaxies and the ICM in galaxy &lt;br/&gt;clusters is a formidable challenge.  The morphology of the galaxies, and the energy and &lt;br/&gt;metal content of the gas is ultimately controlled by star formation processes that happen &lt;br/&gt;on molecular cloud scales of less than a million solar masses. On the other hand, &lt;br/&gt;total cluster masses exceed 10^15 solar masses; hence a dynamic range in mass of over a billion is &lt;br/&gt;necessary for consistently modeling galaxies within this context.   The investigation of such &lt;br/&gt;issues is appealing to many interested in science and even in society at large. In particular, &lt;br/&gt;the results of the project will be used in a program that will introduce the use of computer &lt;br/&gt;simulations in astrophysics to science pre-majors, in the hope of ultimately attracting &lt;br/&gt;underrepresented students into a STEM major.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Several advancements have now enabled the modeling of these systems. First is the availability&lt;br/&gt;of supercomputers like Blue Waters that can sustained petaflop calculations on real world&lt;br/&gt;problems. Second is the improvement of hydrodynamic modeling in Lagrangian codes. These improvements&lt;br/&gt;include better modeling of multiphase medium and the resulting instabilities, more accurate&lt;br/&gt;handling of high Mach number shocks, and better modeling of the subgrid physics including&lt;br/&gt;growth and feedback from supermassive black holes. Finally these algorithm improvements have&lt;br/&gt;been implemented in codes that can scale to a large fraction of Blue Waters even with very&lt;br/&gt;clustered datasets.  This project will use the highly scalable N-body/hydrodynamics code, ChaNGa, to model the&lt;br/&gt;formation and evolution of a population of galaxies in a Coma-sized galaxy cluster, including&lt;br/&gt;their contribution to and interaction with the ICM. This model will be compared to observations&lt;br/&gt;of cluster galaxies to understand the physical and temporal origin of their morphologies.&lt;br/&gt;The model ICM will be compared to X-ray and microwave (via the Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect) to&lt;br/&gt;understand the relation between these observables and the underlying gas properties. Finally,&lt;br/&gt;the overall mass distribution will be used to better understand how these clusters gravitationally&lt;br/&gt;lens background galaxies.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Clusters of galaxies are one of the most important probes of the global geometry of the Universe, of the evolution of the overall cosmic expansion, and of the nature of ``dark energy''.  This is due to the extreme sensitivity of the cluster population statistics to these parameters and to the fact that as regions of high galaxy concentrations are filled with luminous X-ray emitting plasma, these systems can be identified across a wide range of distances.  Clusters are also ``closed box'' laboratories for the study of galaxy evolution.  That is, gas driven out of galaxies by energetic processes such as supernovae or active galactic nuclei will still remain within the cluster where it can be studied with X-ray and UV telescopes.  This work produced very high resolution simulations of galaxy clusters.  The need for such high resolution was to be able to model the shapes and sizes of individual galaxies as they interacted with the cluster as a whole.  Individual galaxies need mass resolutions below one million solar masses, while the cluster totals 100 trillion solar masses, hence a dynamic range of more than 100 million is needed.  With such a resolution the work was able to follow the star formation and supernovae processes within individual galaxies and track how these processes interact with the hot gas that fills the cluster.  In this way the simulation was used to examine both how the cluster environment shapes galaxy evolution, and how galaxies influence the structure of the cluster gas.  In the former case, the study has shown that the growth of the cluster active galactic nucleus tracks the growth of the star formation in cluster galaxies, somewhat independently of the environment.  This is contrary to previous ideas which invoked galaxy mergers to fuel black hole growth.  In the later case, the study has shown that the intracluster medium becomes increasingly multiphase (i.e. a mixture of gases at various temperatures) as one looks further from the cluster center, with 10,000 to 100,000 Kelvin gas dominating in the cluster outskirts. Therefore the simulation can be used to make predictions of the distribution of cluster gas that can be compared with observations made by the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph aboard the Hubble Space Telescope. Maps of the cluster as seen via various observational diagnostics are shown in theattached image.  The fascination of this subject has attracted many good students both at the Graduate and Undergraduate level to work on the simulation results.  Four undergraduate students participated in the analysis of these simulations, particularly in comparing the simulated galaxies to real galaxies.
