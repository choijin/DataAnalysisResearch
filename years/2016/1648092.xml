<AbstractNarration>This SBIR Phase I project is to develop and demonstrate novel nanotechnology based flow battery that meets demanding 2020 energy density targets for transportation and stationary storage and offers a cheaper, safer and environmentally friendly rechargeable energy-storing fluid, which could ultimately allow using batteries for electric vehicles (EVs) in the same fashion as gasoline-powered engines. The proposed innovative approach uses advancements in nanotechnology to merge solid battery chemistries into a convenient flowable format (nanoelectrofuels or NEF). The low cost and high energy density of the proposed flow batteries (up to 350 Wh/L) makes this technology highly competitive with currently used Li-ion batteries (250 Wh/L), while the flowable format enables charging the liquid in one device and use of energy in a separate device, offering new refueling opportunities for EV operations, specifically addressing range anxiety and long charging time - issues currently preventing widespread adoption of EVs. From the commercial perspective the successful development of the proposed low cost high energy density aqueous flow battery could be transformational for electrification of personal and commercial transportation, grid leveling, and integration of renewable energy sources into our individual energy usage for a climate-friendly, environmentally and economically sustainable future.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this project novel low-cost, high energy density rechargeable liquids that feature active energy storing materials in pumpable low viscosity aqueous nanosuspension (NEF) will be demonstrated in a full flow cell reactor (Phase I). The challenge of achieving electroactive suspensions with high solid loading and low viscosity is addressed by changing the surface chemistry of nanoparticles and based on the patented surface modification approach which enables high dispersibility of nanoparticles in fluids and their ability to more efficiently transport and store electrical energy. Innovation in flow cell designs are also proposed for effective battery operations with this new energy storage format. Demonstration of this technology in a full flow cell will significantly de-risk further commercialization efforts for this transformational technology and will enable highly versatile, interchangeable and rechargeable liquids for electrical energy storage solutions. The main outcome of this project (Phase II) will be the prototype of NEF flow battery with design geared towards the first market - light electric utility vehicles (EUVs, $1.3 B market in US) that currently use Pb-acid batteries. For the same volume and 25% lower price per kWh the NEF battery offers ~3 times the energy storage and the additional ability of rapid charge replenishment through active material (NEF) replacement.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[     Influit Energy is developing an aqueous high energy density nanoelectrofuel flow battery which at the system/pack level is competitive in energy density with Li-ion batteries at half the cost and  improved safety. Nanoelectrofuels (NEF) are composite pumpable liquids comprised of solid electroactive nanoparticles in ionically conductive electrolytes. The  custom surface modification developed at Influit Energy enables high solid particle loading (up to 70%) and low viscosity (&lt;200 cP). Influit?s Phase I SBIR sought to demonstrate the feasibility of combining previously developed cathode and anode composite fluids in a flow cell reactor for electrochemical energy storage. During Phase I of the project we developed and optimized custom flow cells which address the specifics of NEF storage format, improved the performance of anode and cathode nanoparticles and demonstrated &gt;90% Coulombic efficiency of the charge/discharge cycle. We have addressed the challenges of electrodynamic electrolyte drag, side reactions management, and environmental interactions with cell materials and atmosphere.  During this Phase I the unique features of our technology, such as non-flammability, high energy density, pumpability for rapid charge replenishment, and advanced thermal properties enabling multifunctional system designs, garnered interest in both the transportation and aviation industries, and at the end of this project Influit Energy became an incubation company within a NASA and ES Aero project.  Phase II of the project will focus on designing and building a cell stack  for electric utility vehicle demonstration, as well as R&amp;D work on extending the cycle life, optimizing the nanoparticle surface coating and scaling-up the manufacturing of the cells, custom nanoparticles and composite liquids.   Moving forward Influit plans to also develop the second generation of NEF flow battery (Gen 2) to achieve 2-3 times the  energy density of Li-ion batteries at ? of the cost.
