<AbstractNarration>This workshop will bring together researchers to spur future developments of experimental and theoretical investigations of the electronic structure of correlated f-electron systems. In recent years, there has been rapid development of experimental techniques that provide direct measurements of both equilibrium and non-equilibrium electronic structures, as have new calculational methods for the time-independent and time-dependent electronic structures. The workshop will allow researchers at the forefront of their fields to discuss, exchange ideas and explore applications of novel spectroscopies to correlated f-electron systems in a focused forum and also bridge the ever widening gap between time-resolved experiments and non-equilibrium theory. The participants will include graduate students, junior and senior faculty at US universities and national laboratories, as well as international leaders in the field.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ A workshop was held at Temple University for two and a half days, during the period of August 15th -17th 2016. The workshop was motivated by the rapid development of new spectroscopic tools which may prove valuable in the study of strongly correlated electronic materials.  Electronic materials are an indispensable ingredient of many modern electronic technologies. However, the presence of interactions between the electrons makes the properties of devices difficult to predict from first principles. This difficulty in predictive power hampers the development of new electronic technology and devices, crucial to our commercial and economic interests.

The understanding of electronic correlations (non-linear interactions) and non-equilibrium dynamics has been set as a high national priority.  The interdisciplinary nature of the task required assembling a diverse array of researchers with a diverse array of research interests. The workshop brought together 40 scientists, from widely distributed geographical regions, interested in a wide range of novel spectroscopies and the electronic structure of correlated f electron materials.  Twentynine 20-30 minute presentations were made, which were followed by lengthy and lively discussions.
