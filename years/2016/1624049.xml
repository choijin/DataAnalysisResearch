<AbstractNarration>Mobility independence is vital to the quality of life of manual wheelchair users. There are approximately 3.6 million adult and 67,000 pediatric manual wheelchair users in the United States, according to the 2012 U.S. Census. As of 2014, the National Spinal Cord Injury Statistical Center estimated that 85% of these patients experienced some level of upper extremity joint pain or injury, and research has correlated these ailments with the substantial strain of wheelchair use. Injury prevention starts with high quality, effective therapy and training based on current research. Physical therapists provide this care and rely on clinical knowledge and tools to diagnose and treat these patients. There is a need for more objective and reliable methods to evaluate and train manual wheelchair users. Currently available options, such as treadmills and bike trainers, pose safety concerns and lack the capacity to collect quantitative metrics of function, while integrated measurement systems are often cost-prohibitive. Time and financial limitations, as well as the increasing demand for their services, add to the challenges already faced by physical therapists. By investigating the needs, obstacles, and complications in the physical therapy practice, technology can be designed to maximize the impact on clinical and research outcomes in this field. Technological enhancement in this area will not only improve the quality of life of wheelchair users by reducing risk of pain and injury, but will improve daily mobility efficiency, as well as provide increased access to healthcare.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Personal Wheelchair Platform (PWP) is a cost-effective and easy-to-use stationary roller system for use in physical therapy practice. It allows manual wheelchair users to wheel safely in-place, simulating over ground bilateral propulsion based on user anthropometry. Accurate biomechanical metrics, monitored and recorded by integrated hardware and software, can be used by the clinician to develop treatment and training strategies in order to increase propulsion efficiency and reduce risk of injury to the upper extremities. Originally developed as a tool to assist in wheelchair biomechanics research, this product is uniquely positioned to bridge the gap between research and clinical care while improving the quality of life and mobility of these patients. PWP allows wheelchair fitting, propulsion assessment (starting, stopping, turning, and steady-state), and customized training to be completed in the demanding clinical environment, promoting mobility independence, community integration and activity participation of wheelchair users while reducing healthcare costs related to sustained pain and injury. This project proposes to complete a comprehensive assessment of the needs of the physical therapy market, specifically targeting therapists who contribute to the care of manual wheelchair users. This will be accomplished through extensive customer discovery, with interviews systematically conducted to sample a distribution of the physical therapy market across the United States. Customer acquisition and clarification of the key value propositions for a minimum viable business product will assist in furthering business model development and launching PWP to the physical therapy market.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The purpose of this project was to assess the commercialization potential and product-market fit of a stationary roller system to be used by physical therapists in their clinical care of wheelchair users.  It was hypothesized that integration of this technology would satisfy a need for an objective evaluation and training tool that would ultimately lead to superior patient care.   Intellectual Merits  Through the course of this project, this I-Corps team conducted 115 interviews with individuals in clinical markets (physical and occupational therapists, assistive technology professionals, durable medical equipment suppliers), adaptive sports markets (wheelchair athletes, recreation therapists, coaches, and trainers), and research engineers. Key insights from the clinical community helped to illustrate the clinical ecosystem and uncovered a potential pathway of market entry as a solution to alleviate confusion and paperwork in medical equipment justification. Major roadblocks in this market, such as insurance complexities and financial challenges, led the team to pivot toward an athletic focus in order to have a more immediate impact on the wheelchair user community. Through interviews with the adaptive sports community the team identified a variety of archetypes based on sport, competitiveness, and organization, which affect the type and amount of training they do, the type of equipment they use, and access to funding.  Future customer discovery will be directed toward competitive endurance wheelchair athletes and their coaches to assess market size and to validate a minimum viable product.  Broader Impacts  Through this process, this I-Corps team has learned key skills necessary for assessing the broader impacts of research, bridging the gap between academic research and solutions to real-world problems. The activities performed during this program have enhanced each team member?s ability to effectively communicate with technical and non-technical audiences, to successfully work as a team, and to think critically and creatively.  The training provided by the I-Corps program will be disseminated to outreach and community laboratories and clinics affiliated with Marquette University and the Orthopaedic and Rehabilitation Engineering Center (OREC), in order to promote self-sustainability.  This project has resulted in a new market focus for the previously formed startup, EngAbility Inc. Additionally, this team?s experience in this program will be featured in an article entitled, "From the Ground Up", by Erik Gunn, to be featured in the Fall 2016 Marquette Engineer Opus College of Engineering Magazine.
