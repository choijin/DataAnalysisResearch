<AbstractNarration>River deltas sequester large amounts of organic carbon (C) that originates from either upstream, as terrestrial mineral sedimentation, or through local marine vegetation that decays and is buried.  Diminished sediment supply to river deltas can enhance the erosion and release of this sequestered C within deltaic wetlands, thereby potentially releasing CO2 back to the atmosphere through decomposition of organic matter (OM).  The Yellow River (Huanghe) in China is the 2nd largest river in terms of sediment load and 6th in terms of drainage length in the world.  The rate and location of sediment deposition in the Yellow River Delta (YRD) have been greatly altered by human actions in recent decades.  This award supports research that will examine C burial within two different river courses of the YRD, identify the sources of the buried C, and compare these results to other major river deltas, such as the Mississippi River, to understand C storage variations between global rivers with constructed diversions.  Under the supervision of Dr. Xuchen Wang, an expert in C dynamics within coastal wetlands in China and the United States, research will be performed at the Ocean University of China in Qingdao.  The results of this study will contribute to the formulation of global management strategies focused on finding a balance between optimizing ecosystem services, such as wildlife habitat, and economic viability, such as commercial fisheries, within major river deltas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sediment cores will be retrieved from wetlands along current and abandoned river courses within the YRD and analyzed for total organic C, total C, and total nitrogen using a CHN analyzer to quantify buried OM.  Sediment and local YRD above and below-ground biomass, such as from Phragmites australis and Suaeda salsa, will be analyzed for Ã¤13C isotopes, using an Isotope Ratio Mass Spectrometer, and n-alkanes, through Gas Chromatography, to determine the sources of the buried OM.  Changes in odd-over-even predominance of n-alkanes will be utilized as sediment horizons and used to estimate rates of C burial.  This NSF award is funded in collaboration with the Chinese Ministry of Science and Technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award under the East Asia and Pacific Summer Institutes program supports summer research by a U.S. graduate student and is jointly funded by NSF and the Ministry of Science and Technology of China.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Sediments are picked up by rivers and eventually exit via the river mouth into a large water body where it settles out and creates a delta, a formation of land for wetland plants to grow, die, and eventually be buried. These coastal wetlands act as a sink for atmospheric carbon dioxide through the burial of carbon in the form of the decaying organic material in sediments.  The continued accumulation of sediment transported by rivers to deltas ensures long-term storage of this carbon pool.  The Yellow River in China is the second largest river in the world in terms of sediment load with an annual delivery of over one billion tons to the Bohai Sea.  The Yellow River delta encompasses an area of almost 10,000 square kilometers and grows an average of 30 square kilometers every year.  However, the mouth of the modern Yellow River has been redirected by constructed diversions 3 times in just the past 50 years. These human caused alterations redistribute the sediment needed for sustaining the delta platform, thereby impacting the stability and long-term carbon storage potential of the delta.  The purpose of this research project was to examine the amount of carbon buried within different river courses in the delta of the Yellow River, to identify the sources of the buried carbon, and to compare these results to other major global rivers, such as the Mississippi River, to understand the impact of human manipulation on long-term carbon storage in river deltas.  To investigate carbon storage in the Yellow River delta I worked with Dr. Xuchen Wang at Ocean University of China in Qingdao.  Dr. Wang is well-known for work he has done in other global river systems where he identified the age and sources of buried carbon using radioactive and stable isotopes and organic compounds called n-alkanes.  We collected four half meter deep sediment cores, two from the modern river course and two from an abandoned river course, and analyzed the sediment for porosity, percent organic matter, total organic carbon, &delta;13C isotopes, and n-alkanes.  In Dr. Wang?s lab I learned how to prepare sediments for n-alkane analysis and how to run a Gas Chromatograph instrument.  Our preliminary results show there are changes in the sources and quality of the buried carbon due to alterations in sediment delivery caused by human diversions.   Over my 8 week EAPSI fellowship at Ocean University I learned not only valuable lab skills that I can apply back in the U.S., but I gained insight into how I function as a scientist and how to overcome obstacles and frustrations in and out of the lab.  Although I had learned a little Mandarin before I left for China, I had a difficult time understanding procedures in the lab or even buying food.  I was fortunate to have opportunities to meet other professors at Ocean University and at another university nearby.  I was also able to travel to the city of Xi?an to see the terra cotta warriors.  All of these experiences taught me to be more patient, to listen carefully, to appreciate those that took the time to try to communicate and assist me, and to be mindful and courteous to visitors back in the U.S. that may be having similar experiences.
