<AbstractNarration>This project addresses the processes that lead to the formation and growth of secondary organic aerosol (SOA) in the atmosphere.  These very small particles are formed from the oxidation of gaseous biogenic hydrocarbons, emitted by plants.  The results of this research will provide guidance for parameterizing SOA processes in atmospheric models.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The specific objectives of the project are to: (1) quantify incorporation of tracers with different properties such as functional groups and vapor pressures into SOA formed from various gas phase precursors under a range of experimental conditions; (2) measure rates of desorption of various tracers from different SOA for input into a proposed molecular model; (3) elucidate the nature of the surface region of SOA particles using extractive electrospray ionization mass spectrometry; and (4) measure the magnitude, time dependence and mechanism of uptake coefficients for amines of different structures on solid diacids and SOA.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Airborne particles are central component of air pollution, and as such, are important for educing visibility, affecting climate and causing deleterious health effects as a. These particles have complex chemical composition, with organic compounds generally being a significant component, along with sulfates, nitrates, ammonium/aminium compunds, and other species such as trace metals. Under many conditions, the organic compounds are not directly emitted into the air from sources, but rather are formed by chemical reactions of gases in air to form low volatility products. The gas phase reactions first form small clusters of molecules which can act as seeds to take up more products and grow the particles into what is known as secondary organic aerosol (SOA).  Growth to a diameter of ~ 100 nanometers (nm) is key to efficiently penetrating deep into the lung, scattering light and acting as a seed upon which water can condense so it acts as a nucleus for cloud formation.   It is critical to be able to quantitatively predict how such organic particles form and grow if we are to develop the optimal control strategies. Atmospheric models of this process have traditionally assumed that these particles are liquid-like in nature, so that gases diffuse in (and out) on relatively short time scales.  Growth of the particles is then determined by quasi-equilibrium between the gas phase and the particle.  However, about a decade ago it was discovered that under many conditions, SOA particles are actually semi-solids, with slow exchange with the gas phase.  The way the particles grow from seeds is quite different from that for liquids, but is not at all well understood.     This research is directed to understanding the factors that determine how gases are taken up and grow these semi-solid particles. We have shown that:  The interaction of gas phase amines, a class of compounds that are ubiquitous in air, with some solid organic acids form ionic liquids (IL). This was very surprising as the reaction was expected to form a solid salt, rather than a liquid. This formation mechanism for IL, which have found widespread use as solvents for chemical synthesis, had not before been observed;  The uptake of a particular class of organic gases known as organic nitrates into SOA formed from oxidation of a-pinene in air was shown to be much higher than expected based on quasi-equilibrium with liquid particles. This supports a different growth mechanism than that used in atmospheric models, one which depends on both the nature of the organic gas and the nature of the particle surface.  However, the latter is an unknown.  Is the surface chemically the same as the bulk, or does it have a different combination of functional groups? How does this affect the uptake of gases to grow the particle? New approaches to probing the chemical composition of the surface as compared to the bulk of the particle were developed. Both extractive electrospray chemical ionization and sonic spray ionization were applied to model systems for SOA. These consisted of particles that had a core of one organic and a coating of a different compound. These ionization techniques were shown to be capable of probing just the top few nm of the particles, i.e., the coating and not the bulk, and in the case of sonic spray ionization, the method could be tuned to probe the bulk as well. These methods have great promise for "peeling SOA like an onion", defining the chemical composition layer by layer from the surface into the interior, providing insight into the uptake of gases and growth of the particle; In a somewhat accidental discovery, we found halogen bonding in some organic systems in the gas phase.  Halogen bonding has been identified in a number of liquid phase systems, and a few gas phase systems.  What we identified was the importance of this phenomenon in generating adducts that could be seen by mass spectrometry.  It suggested that in the condensed phase in coastal areas where iodine/iodide can be important, the role of halogen bonding should be considered      Overall, this research has established that unlike liquid particles, non-equilibrium, kinetically controlled processes are responsible for the growth of semi-solid particles, and this depends on the nature of the gas and the particle surface. The challenge now is to understand the molecular level forces that control adsorption of the gas to the surface so that quantitative models of particle growth can be developed and applied to develop cost-effective and health protective control strategies.  Finally, a number of students and postdoctoral fellows have received training in the fundamental chemistry of the atmosphere and the implications for air quality and climate change.  Outreach to high schools and the public were also a central part of this research.          Last Modified: 01/03/2021       Submitted by: Barbara J Finlayson-Pitts]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
