<AbstractNarration>This Smart and Connected Communities (S&amp;CC) EArly-concept Grant for Exploratory Research (EAGER) project explores quantitative methods to infer the traits of individual traveler behavior (Origin-Destination trip information and traveler routes/mode choice preferences) from transaction-type transportation data in a multi-modal transit system. The inferential power of this project's approach relies on how the travelers revise their routing choices (recorded by transactions) in response to perturbations in the travel environment and its changing conditions. The inferred knowledge of travelers' origin-destination and preferences can be used to plan, monitor and predict the response of the travelers to operational decisions of public transit system managers and policy-makers, thereby increasing the system flexibility and operational efficiency. Such individual knowledge will be particularly useful for the planning and operations of alternative services in the events of transit system failures/closures, and also, further develop recently emerging customized transportation, including shared mobility systems and ride sharing systems, inform dynamic parking pricing, etc. As a creative educational activity effort, an on-campus test-bed will be created based on student data (student/employee card that is used across campus for various activities including bus, facilities access, dining, shopping, etc.), for various transportation informatics investigations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research reaches into the yet untapped potential of Automatic Fare Collection data, more broadly transaction-type data, to inform Smart City and Transportation Informatics research. The project's methodological advances are general, i.e., not limited to any particular application. This research goes beyond the standard use of Automatic Fare Collection data use for identifying and understanding the statistical properties/trends, to distilling the hidden patterns of traveler agenda and behavior in multi-modal travel environment. Methodologically, the inference framework advances the Expectation Maximization (EM) paradigm that found much success in many inference tasks. The PIs suggest using Iterative EM and Selective Set EM methods, which promise to reliably infer two unknowns for each individual traveler: routing preference and Origin-Destination. If successful, the framework can start a new branch of methodological data-heavy research with repeated data, allowing for the studies of individual travel behavior at a finer granularity and presenting new opportunities to transportation policy makers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project designed an inference framework for distilling comprehensive individual traveler information of multimodal transit system users, namely, their true Origin-Destination (OD) pairs and routing preferences, based on transaction-type transportation data, through probabilistic learning. In particular, the resulting inference method uses Automatic Fare Collection (AFC) data to infer where individual travelers are traveling from and to, and how travelers make multi-modal trip routing decisions. The key to this work is the ability to identify and process the observations of travelers' routing choices between the same locations under different travel environment conditions such as travel times, crowdedness, etc. Methodologically, the project applied and advanced the Expectation Maximization technique under the broad umbrella of "big data and machine learning". The achieved accuracy of true OD inference is at 75-95%. With desirable low computational times, the built algorithms can be used quickly and in real-time if needed. These inferred information can be used better serve travelers especially for emerging transportation systems.  Processing of AFC data for the formulated models also opens doors for addressing other research inquiries. In particular, the research team has investigated travel behavior differences observed in disabled, elderly population, and also investigated how influenza spreads spatially though public transit channels.  This project supported one Ph.D. student who is now working as a data scientist in a leading industry. In addition, this work has inspired two MS students (including one female student) to investigate campus transit data for big data analysis.
