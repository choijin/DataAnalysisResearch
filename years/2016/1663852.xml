<AbstractNarration>The University of Southern California will conduct a workshop to identify and address issues that impact career pathways for African American students in physics and astronomy.  Diverse experts from Pk-12, higher education, industry, and professional societies will convene to (1) identify evidence-based approaches to mitigating barriers to African American students? academic performance and workforce participation, (2) discuss strategies for more rigorous, third-party evaluations of programs or activities designed to increase the representation of African Americans in physics and astronomy, and (3) propose research topics focused specifically on underrepresentation in the physics and astronomy workforce.  The two-day workshop coincide with the annual meeting of the National Society of Black Physicists and will employ a ?strengths-based, pathway model? approach to discuss an action-oriented, systematic, data-driven strategy to broaden the participation of African Americans in physics and astronomy.  The workshop will result in knowledge that can be used by various stakeholder communities, including community colleges, to design effective interventions to reverse the negative trends in physics and astronomy. It also will catalyze collaborations to implement innovations to broaden participation in those disciplines.</AbstractNarration>

The workshop used a 'strengths-based, pathway' approach to devise data-driven, action plans on the systemic, institutional, and individual levels at critical junctures on the physical science career pathway. With the direct support from the National Society of Black Physicists, we invited participants from institutions that have exhibited promising practices resulting in the enhancement of African American participation in physical science education and the workforce.</p> <p>Workshop participants were assembled into sub-teams, which included experts from four areas: Pre-college transition; college; graduate school; and the workforce. Each group was comprised of at least one member from each of the various stakeholder categories to provide a more comprehensive approach to the discussion. Additional goals were to (1) Identify evidence-based approaches, strategies, and practices to enhance the quality of preparation at each stage along the physics and astronomy pathway, and that foster both race and gender equity; (2) Identify&nbsp;gatekeepers and critical leverage points for effective interventions that enhance academic preparation, performance, and workforce participation; (3) Discuss strategies for third-party evaluations of programs or activities designed to increase the representation of Blacks in physics and astronomy; and (4) Develop a research plan to build a body of knowledge on the participation of Black in physics, astronomy, and the workforce.</p> <p>The result of a smaller supplemental meeting was to: a) develop a few of the ideas generated in the pre-conference convening; b) determine the feasibility and viability of implementing one or more of the 'big ideas'; and 3) draft an NSF grant proposal to implement and examine the impact of one of the 'big ideas' generated from the pre-conference (see&nbsp;<a href="https://socialjustice.usc.edu/research-engagement/reports/">https://socialjustice.usc.edu/research-engagement/reports/</a>&nbsp;). These 'big ideas' included mobile physics camps, youth competitions, mentorship experiences, curriculum/ teacher training, theme-weeks at school, and addressing fundamental questions like 'What does it mean to be a Black physicist?' These 'big ideas' are not necessarily transformative ideas, but when the social scientists, physicists, and institutional collaborators agree to participate and assist in implementing these 'big ideas' they become transformational.</p> <p>This pre-conference convening served as a critical lever in developing meaningful and productive interdisciplinary partnerships.
