<AbstractNarration>This project will explore how a specially-shaped intense laser beam can control the movement of electrons in a plasma, a gas of electrons and charged atoms. A beam of light can put pressure on things to force it to move. Normally, this force is too small to see, but if a laser beam is bright enough and the objects have a small weight, it is possible to see these effects. In this project, we will look at how controlling the shape of a pulse of laser light can make it easier for this force to get electrons moving fast. We will also look at how these laser pulses can make strong waves in a plasma, where the electrons and ions become separated by another laser pulse. Our pulses of light are so short (a fraction of a trillionth of a second) that the ions left behind don't have time to move. The electrons accelerate in the laser pulse like a surfer on a big water wave, where she chooses just the right angle to ride the wave. We hope to show that this can lead to a new way to make beams of electrons traveling near the speed of light. The work should also help us understand how we can use these laser pulses for making small channels and for eye surgery. It will also show us how to convert these pulses to other colors of light. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research aims to explore using spatio-temporally structured intense laser pulses to control both ionization and electron dynamics in laser-produced plasmas. By controlling the transverse and angular distribution of the frequency components of the beam, we can control the spatio-temporal structure of a pulse. Important for this project, the angular spatial chirp results in an intensity envelope that is tilted relative to the direction of propagation. This gives us control of the transverse group velocity, which can range from super- to sub-luminal. We will use this control to affect the dynamics of electrons and waves in the plasma. In the free electron regime we will test our calculations that predict that with the proper pulse front tilt angle, electrons can be captured and accelerated to the side by the ponderomotive force of the beam. Such a configuration could ultimately be useful for direct acceleration of electrons to the MeV range, useful on their own or as an optical injector for wakefield accelerators. In the underdense and overdense plasma regime, the tilted pulse fronts can enhance the generation of waves in the plasma. In the latter case, we will perform a series of experiments to explore coupling of ultrafast pulses to surface plasmon waves. Our projects closely couple experiment, theory, and computational modeling. The experiments will be performed at CSM with our kHz repetition rate Ti:sapphire amplifier. Computational modeling will be performed with the open source 3D EM PIC program Epoch and with the finite-element Comsol Multiphysics platform.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>In this project, we worked on using shaped ultrashort laser pulses to study and control the interaction of intense laser beams with free electrons and plasmas. Normally a laser pulse will arrive at the target at the same time across the whole beam. One of the shapes we work with is a pulse that travels through space with a tilt, so that, for example, the left side of the beam will arrive sooner than the right side. Since light can push on objects, and electrons are very light, it is possible to use this force to accelerate the electrons to high speed. By using a tilted pulse, we can make the pulse of light push the electron more to the side than forward, much like a slice drive in golf, or like a tilted snowplow pushes snow to the side of the road.&nbsp;&nbsp;Figure 1 shows several snapshots in time with the tilted laser pulse travelling from left to right (orange arrow). The square in the center represents the bunch of electrons that is accelerated. We can see that the force is in the direction of the blue arrow in the last frame. One of the outcomes of this project was that we developed a theory for how this acceleration process will work, even for electrons that are accelerated to speeds that approach the speed of light. For these relativistic electrons, much of their energy increase goes into an increased mass. Figure 2 shows another view of how the acceleration process works. From the perspective of the laser pulse, the electrons (which are initially at rest in the lab) are approaching the laser pulse and reflect, or bounce off of, the laser pulse. The two figures show how the detailed shape of the pulse will control the range of directions of the accelerated electrons. On the left, a rounded pulse (Gaussian shape) can leave the accelerated electrons with a range of angles and energies because of the curved shape of the pulse front.
