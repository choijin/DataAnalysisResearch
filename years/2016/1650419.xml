<AbstractNarration>Publicly available and searchable genomic data banks could revolutionize clinical and research settings, but privacy concerns about releasing such information are currently preventing its usage. This project aims to address these concerns by providing new mechanisms by which individuals can donate their genomic information to a data bank in such a way that third parties, such as doctors or researchers, querying the data bank are guaranteed to learn only aggregate functions of the population's data that the individuals authorize.Â &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The guarantee comes from the use of cutting-edge cryptographic techniques, specifically functional encryption. The project develops new functional encryption schemes that are highly tailored to genomic applications and support the above-mentioned system model. Additionally, these schemes support a core functionality of query types that the PIs identify for genomic applications. The PIs target reasonably efficient schemes as a proof of concept, and develop a prototype system to evaluate the practicality in real-world settings. This project addresses the immediate need for methods and technologies that provide safe and secure storage and retrieval of genomic information.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Publicly available, searchable genomic data banks hold the key to disease diagnoses, treatment studies, and, hopefully, cures.  Unfortunately, individuals are reluctant to donate their genomic data to create such data banks given the highly personal information that DNA sequences provide and the fear of potential data leaks from these repositories. Note that if the sequences are encrypted using standard methods, there is no way for the host to support critical search functionality without the ability to decrypt the data, opening it up to potential leaks.  Currently, privacy concerns about releasing genomic information are drastically slowing the adoption of genomic information in the clinical and research settings.  Genomic data from clinical trials and personal sequencing is currently difficult to access due to strict security constraints which include data access committees (DACs) which must approve access for individual researchers.   For example http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gap which houses clinical and genomic information from a large number of clinical trials has a lengthy application process for researchers to gain access the genomic data.  Once access is granted, there are numerous technical challenges in decrypting the data for practical use.  Personnel Funded and Expenses: This grant was used to support post-doc Michael Clear for two years, to work on this project.  Other expenses were travel by PI O'Neill to present the result. Co-PI Frieder received no funding.  Resulting Publications: PI O'Neill, co-PI Freider, and post-doc Michael Clear, in collaboration with Shweta Agrawal, Sanjam Garg, and Justin Thaler, have a manuscript in submission to CRYPTO 2019 [ACFGOT19].  The main results are summarized below. Scope: To address the above, the main goals of the proposal were: * Developing basic models of system architecture and information flow in the target applications. * Identifying a ``core functionality'' of the most important queries to support. * Investigating which cutting-edge cryptographic approaches are most suitable for the above. *  Developing ``reasonably efficient''  such cryptographic schemes tailored to the target applications. * Implementing and evaluating a  prototype system. Model and Functionality: Using co-PI Frieder's expertise, we determined the basic model is that senders transmit their inputs to a receiver, without giving knowledge of the inputs to other senders or the receiver.  For each query, the senders can then issue tokens that allow computation a function of their data. In particular,  they may allow the receiver itself to learn the result of the query for simplicity, or they may be more advanced and allow only the querying entity to learn the result. Ad Hoc Multi-Input Functional Encryption: No cryptographic primitive was found that matches the above scenario exactly, but a primitive that comes close is called multi-input functional encryption [GGGJKL14], which allows a receiver to decrypt authorized joint functions of the senders' messages.  But it has the drawback that it relies on a trusted third-party to generate the keys, which we do not want. To rectify this, in a manuscript in submission [ACFGOT19] PI O'Neill, co-PI Freider, and post-doc Michael Clear, in collaboration with Shweta Agrawal, Sanjam Garg, and Justin Thaler introduceda new notion of *ad hoc* multi-input functional encryption (MIFE).  In ad hoc MIFE, each senders will run a \emph{local} setup procedure to generate  some public parameters  as well as a private encryption key.  Using their private keys, senders can issue ``partial decryption keys'' to the receiver.  These partial decryption keys each specify a function of the messages the receiver is permitted to learn.    Ideally, in our construction athese functions would be tailored to what is needed for genomic databases.  However, our most efficient construction, based on lattice cryptography, allows learning *inner-products* of message vectors with vectors associated with the keys.  This has some applications to information retrieval, an area of expertise of co-PI Freider.  In on-going work, we are attempting to apply this to genomic data and allow only an external querier (not the receiver) to learn the result of a query. Implementation Efforts: Post-doc Michael Clear is currently leading implementation efforts of our inner-product ad hoc MIFE scheme. Broader Impact: * Working with Deputy Cybersecurity Director Donna F. Dodson,  PI O'Neill obtained a guest faculty position in NIST's Cryptographic Technology Group.PI O'Neill has disseminated the results of this proposal widely at NIST and given talks on them there. * Working with Subha Madhavan of the Georgetown Innovation Center for Biomedical Informatics (ICBI) and Michael Harris of NIH, PI O'Neill has obtained insight into the practical applications of the work.  Moreover, PI O'Neill gave a talk at the ICBI to disseminate the results.       Last Modified: 04/13/2019       Submitted by: Adam O'neill]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
