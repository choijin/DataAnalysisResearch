<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is two-fold. First, this project may lead to the development of practical security solutions which are needed to fully unleash the benefits of the Internet of Things (IoT). While IoT is projected  to be a 1.7 trillion dollar market by 2020, there is a likelihood that progress may be limited due to security concerns. Curtailing IoT progress may ultimately limit the potential societal and commercial benefits. Second, this project, if successful, will have a positive impact on consumers, businesses, and critical infrastructures by protecting digital assets and private data from large-scale cyber-attacks. This I-Corps project has its origins in NSF-funded research on computer networks and cybersecurity. The I-Corps experience will lead to a deeper understanding of the market requirements and benefits of the technologies that were developed as part of NSF-funded research, especially as applied to emerging IoT deployments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project project address three fundamental issues in realizing a product for securing IoT. First, the project will build a library of models that capture the expected (i.e., secure) behaviors of diverse IoT devices in a unified format. Second, the project will enable a novel policy abstraction where the operator defines the intended policies. This abstraction captures relevant physical environments as well as devices' contexts. Third, the project will build a highly scalable and light-weight policy enforcement layer using flexible software-based security appliances realized by new networking paradigms, namely, software-defined networking (SDN) and network functions virtualization (NFV). Based on these novel technological components, this project has the potential to lead to significant advances in the network security industry.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goal of this iCorps project was to determine the commercialization feasibility of our prior research in the area of network security policy enforcement, with a specific focus on applying the technology to future Internet-of-Things (IoT) deployments. Our method to this end was customer discovery through conducting interviews with several tens of potential customers for our technology.  Through the iCorps program, the Principal Investigator, the Entrepreneurial Lead, and the Industry mentor spent the summer of 2016 conducting more than 160 interviews with customers across the US. As a consequence of these interviews and feedback sessions with the iCorps instructors, a business model canvas was created that reflected our hypothesis on key aspects of the business (e.g., customer, value proposition, income model, resources, etc.)  These interviews validated the team's hypothesis that IoT security is indeed an emerging market and confirmed that customers across various market verticals (e.g., hospitality, manufacturing, and the automotive industry) have already started searching for IoT solutions with little success. That said, the team also discovered a crucial missing piece in the technical solution, namely the actual development of attack detection and prevention algorithms for IoT.  Based on the insights and lessons learned from the experience, the team ultimately decided not to proceed with launcing a commercial endeavor at this time. However, the team gained valuable lessons in how to validate novel ideas with respect to eventual beneficiaries (i.e., customers) as well as more focused exploration in the program domain for future efforts.
