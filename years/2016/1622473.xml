<AbstractNarration>The workshop brings together R&amp;D experts from the German and U.S. academic, government, and&lt;br/&gt;industry sectors to help spur discussion on research gaps, opportunities, and potential international&lt;br/&gt;collaborations and deployments in the areas of IoT (Internet of Things) and CPS. More specifically, the workshop&lt;br/&gt;will explore ongoing research and development activities in IoT/CPS, seek to identify future&lt;br/&gt;joint research opportunities, and establish a foundation for cooperative strategic progress&lt;br/&gt;in this important and rapidly growing area. The magnitude of research challenges and the urgency of addressing them require a strategic&lt;br/&gt;approach. Combining the specific strengths from the United States and from Germany is synergistic&lt;br/&gt;with the goal of accelerating progress in all aspects of research. The program of the meeting includes invited academic research and industry presentations about prospective research synergistic collaborations in the areas of IoT and CPS between the United&lt;br/&gt;States and Germany. Some topics that will be discussed are: 1) Architectures; 2) Development environments; 3) Foundations; 4) Inter-operability and Standardization.  Funds from the workshop will support US researchers participating in the workshop.  Significant efforts will be made to attract women and other under-represented minorities as workshop participants from both US and German sides.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ongoing fusion of information and communication technologies with engineering of physical&lt;br/&gt;systems has triggered tremendous changes in private and public sectors. These changes deeply&lt;br/&gt;influence the nature of systems we build, the technologies we use for development and manufacturing&lt;br/&gt;and the way we teach engineering. The resulting new generations of Cyber-Physical Systems&lt;br/&gt;(CPS) and their emerging platforms such as the Internet of Things (IoT) and Industrial Internet&lt;br/&gt;(II) require bringing together competences both from the information technologies and the&lt;br/&gt;engineering disciplines. As a result, academia, industry, and society will need to expand&lt;br/&gt;capacity in the area of creating CPS in a dependable way.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ 2016 NSF US-Germany Workshop on the Internet of Things/Cyber-Physical Systems (IoT)/CPS   Final project Outcomes Report   NSF Award # 1646142  The 2016 NSF US-Germany Workshop on the Internet of Things/Cyber-Physical Systems (IoT)/CPS grant proposal funded Vanderbilt University to support the organization and logistics required to assemble US and German community stakeholders, including representatives from academia, industry, government, and independent research institutions, for a 1.5-day event that was held on January 19-20, 2016 in the Washington, DC area. This was an invitation-only workshop that was primarily co-sponsored by the U.S. National Science Foundation and the German Embassy in Washington, D.C. on behalf of the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF).  The goal of the Workshop was to devise strategic approaches for accelerating progress for addressing research challenges posed by the technologies we use for development and manufacturing caused by the ongoing fusion of information and communication technologies with engineering of physical systems and the way we teach engineering. Participants discussed ongoing R&amp;D activities in this area and identified future joint research opportunities.  Major activities of the program included a half-day program on January 19 at the German Embassy in Washington, DC and a full-day program on January 20 at the Westin Hotel in Arlington, VA that brought together over 60 leading experts and policy officials from Government, academia, and industry in the areas of IoT and CPS set the stage to clarify the goals of the objectives of the meeting. The workshop was structured around the following four topic areas:  IoT      / CPS development methodology Dependability      of IoT/ CPS The      influence of new technologies on IoT / CPS (e.g., adaptivity, dynamicity,      systems of systems, Big Data, multicore, &hellip;) Standardization,      interoperabilty, and platforom concepts for IoT / CPS   Workshop participants shared the opinion that IoT / CPS will be cutting across almost every societal and industrial domain, be it manufacturing, energy, mobility, the environment, health care or critical infrastructures. Although Germany and the United States are competitors in many domains, the attendees felt that shared goals and interests could create valuable opportunities for collaboration that could greatly benefit both countries, as well as have important impact in this area on a global scale. The magnitude of this challenge is so great that cooperation rather than a competition would prove to be more beneficial for industry, academia and the government. In fact, researchers and industry leaders from both countries agreed that they are facing the same challenges with regard to accelerating the development and deployment of IoT / CPS systems and that both countries stand to reap substantial benefits by sharing solutions to these challenges.   Key research areas where US researchers have achieved significant progress and open for cooperation with the German side include, but are not limited to:  Foundations      for model-based design and manufacturing of CPS including modeling      languages, composition theories, precise timing and model-based      verification methods for heterogeneous systems.  Science      of Integration which includes compositionality and research into      integration of highly innovative control algorithms into complex CPS. Methods      and tools for the design of CPS resilient against cyber attacks and      physical faults.  Foundations      and integration platforms for design automation tool suites for CPS.  Heterogeneous      platforms for CPS applications spanning the full range from edge devices,      to fog and to cloud platforms.  Extension      of the scope of CPS design to include humans and human organizations, and      covering societal-scale systems   Key opportunities where the US and Germany can join forces were identified:  Hybrid      modeling frameworks for IoT / CPS Engineering      processes for IoT / CPS Tool      support concepts for IoT / CPS Dependability      engineering for IoT / CPS Security      for IoT / CPS IoT      and CPS architectures Swarm      system   The workshop appealed for the identification of a novel mechanism to support the set-up of strong cooperation between the US and Germany.  The workshop report can be found on the workshop website at https://cps-vo.org/group/US-German-IoT-CPS-Wkshp16/final-report.
