<AbstractNarration>The "Carolina Dynamics Symposium" is a continued two day weekend conference, which will take place in April 2016 at Furman University Greenville, SC and in April 2017 at Agnes Scott College, Atlanta, GA.  In April 2018 it will be hosted either by the University of North Carolina at Charlotte,  the University of Charleston, or by Wake Forest University.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The Carolina Dynamics Symposium is a two day conference that has been taking place for thirteen years at different colleges and  universities in the Carolinas and Georgia.  In addition to the traditional lively interaction among mathematicians from the Southeast there have been hour talks by invited leaders in the field from outside the region.  The Carolina Dynamics Symposia feature one plenary speaker who will deliver a public lecture on the Friday before the conference begins, as well as about three hour-long plenary speakers during the conference weekend.  All meetings will also have twenty to thirty minute contributed talks and invited talks from Southeastern participants. Typically a significant number of talks are given by (graduate) students and young researchers. The conferences have led to successful research projects and publications in the past.  We are continuing a very successful model with participants of diverse levels and backgrounds, among those a particularly large number of female participants, speakers and organizers.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;For further information on the Symposium, we maintain a webpage: http://www.devio.us/~ppunosevac/cdynsys/pmwiki.php?n=Main.Announcements.</AbstractNarration>

The symposia were hosted by Furman University,  Greenville SC in 2016, UNC Charlotte, Charlotte NC in 2017, Agnes Scott  College, Atlanta, GA in 2018 and again Furman University in 2019. CDS brings together the highly distributed community of dynamical  systems teachers and researches from the Carolinas and Georgia for one  weekend in April. The format of CDS is traditional with presentations Saturday and Sunday and an opening Colloquium on Friday. We host and thanks to the NSF support a wide variety of speakers from various level teaching and research institutions throughout the Carolinas and Georgia.&nbsp; NSF funding allowed us to bring in and support four to  six speakers from "outside" our core location, the Carolinas and  Georgia. It is part of our mission to provide young researchers and  teachers, in particular females, with funding and opportunities to  present their work. Through this round of funding we had at times (Agnes Scott College 2018) nearly 50% of participants and speaker being female. Generally we host about twenty to thirty participants on our symposia and were able to support all who were eligible and requesting it by NSF provided funds. We published a conference proceedings, Contemporary Mathematics 736, for the Agnes Scott 2018 event. Out of eleven published articles in this volume ten were authored by core members of the Carolina Dynamics group and frequent attendees of CDS. We thank the NSF and hence the public for their support to make our Symposia a continued success.
