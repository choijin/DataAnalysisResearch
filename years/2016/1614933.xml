<AbstractNarration>White dwarfs are very dense, planet-sized, stellar remnants produced at the end of a low-mass star's life. About 98% of all stars - including our Sun - will end their lives as white dwarfs. This research team will find and analyze dozens of white dwarfs that are located in very young star clusters in the Milky Way galaxy. Their study will provide critical insights about stellar astrophysics. They will measure and compare the masses of white dwarfs with those of other stars still undergoing fusion, in order to determine how much mass is lost over their lifetimes. This will be used to define the critical mass that separates white dwarf formation from core collapse supernova. They will use data from existing surveys and obtain new data using optical telescopes. A secondary goal is to determine the precise ages of the young star clusters in the study. Broader impacts include further training of a postdoctoral researcher in science and public outreach. The PI will continue his public lecture series on stars and stellar death. He will also collaborate with African American and Indian students at nearby schools and help with the NAACP Scientific Olympics in Maryland.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once white dwarf candidates are identified in a star cluster, the researchers will perform a detailed analysis of each cluster's color-magnitude diagram to derive the properties of the parent system. Next, they will obtain data of the newly discovered white dwarfs with multi-object spectrographs on 4 to 10-m telescopes and determine fundamental stellar properties (such as effective temperature, log g, mass, luminosity and cooling age) by fitting the Balmer line spectra to the team's white dwarf atmosphere and cooling models.  They will measure the critical mass separating white dwarf from supernova formation by establishing a truncation in the white dwarf mass distribution.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[     Our NSF research project resulted in a number of new discoveries of faint white dwarfs, the end products of stellar evolution.  We used powerful telescopes to establish the properties of these stars, and linked their properties to those of their progenitor hydrogen burning stars.   This involved first obtaining photometry of host star clusters and then looking for the stellar remnants using spectroscopy. The results of this research tells us how these stars evolve, how much stellar mass they lose through their evolution, and how they impact their surroundings. We are able to show that the most massive stars that will make white dwarfs will lose about 85% of their  mass through stellar evolution.  We derived a tight relation between stellar initial mass and final mass, now extending all the way from stars less massive than the Sun to those that are 7 times more massive than the Sun.  In addition to this, our project provided a new estimate of the critical mass at which a star either evolves to a white dwarf, or to a supernova explosion.  This critical mass is a major threshold in astrophysics and impacts chemical evolution and energetics in galaxies.  The project resulted in numerous publications and public outreach initiatives that summarize the primary results.
