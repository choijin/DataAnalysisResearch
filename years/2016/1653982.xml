<AbstractNarration>Catalysts are chemical substances that provide an alternative pathway for chemical reactions to occur that is less energy-intensive and  more rapid than the pathway taken without the catalyst present. Some catalysts are difficult to recover when the catalytic process is completed.  Attaching them to a solid surface improves their recoverability and gives an additional route to tailor their catalytic ability. Dr. Gary F. Moore and his team of researchers at Arizona State University are developing innovative ways to create and assemble polymeric surface coatings that attach molecular catalysts to solids that are useful for solar energy capture and storage. The catalyst-polymer construct stabilizes the component materials and enhances their utility for generating fuels and other value-added chemical products with minimal environmental impact, giving broader societal impacts to his research. Dr. Moore is active in outreach programs that engage students in the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) disciplines using topics that draw on advancements made in his research in chemical catalysis and energy science. These activities include research opportunities in Dr. Moore's laboratory to promote the education of under-served students from local high schools and Native American tribes. His integration of research, education, and societal impact broadens student participation in science, and is a major component of this CAREER grant.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With funding from the Chemical Catalysis Program of the Chemistry Division, Dr. Gary F. Moore is pioneering novel synthetic methodologies to immobilize molecular redox catalysts onto semi-conducting and conducting solids while retaining or enhancing their activity using surface-grafted polymers as a soft scaffold.  In these extended polymer matrices, key features of biological enzymes are incorporated into the catalyst design and include extended ligation spheres, channels for substrate delivery and product removal, and regeneration strategies for spent catalysts. The functionality of these materials is under investigation for (photo)electrochemically activation of a range of industrially relevant redox couples, including the H+/H2, CO2/CO and N2/NH3 transformations, and the catalyst activity is examined using (photo)electrochemical characterization techniques. Surface-sensitive characterization methods including grazing angle Fourier transform infrared and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopies. Broader societal impact of the research results from improved catalyst designs for solar generation of fuels and other value-added chemical products.  Dr. Moore is actively engaged in STEM outreach programs that provide mentorship and research opportunities to traditionally under-served students from local high schools and Native American tribes, encouraging promising students early in their academic endeavors and inspiring their pursuit of STEM careers. His integration of research, education, and societal impact broadens student participation in science, and is a major component of this CAREER grant.</AbstractNarration>
