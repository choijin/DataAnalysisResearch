<AbstractNarration>In this era of precision cosmology, measurements suggest that ordinary matter represents only a fraction of the total matter density in the Universe. The rest, whose presence we only infer gravitationally, is unknown in its nature, and is termed Cold Dark Matter, for which a particle called a light axion is a well-motivated candidate. Should axions constitute the dark matter of our Milky Way halo, they may be detected through their conversion into a narrow Radio Frequency (RF) signal in a microwave-cavity resonator permeated by a magnetic field. The experiment being performed at Yale, ADMX-HF (Axion Dark Matter eXperiment - High Frequency), was designed to serve both as an innovation test-bed to develop and transition new cavity designs and quantum-limited photon detection schemes, and as a pathfinder to take first data in the 10-100 micro-electron Volt mass range. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;R&amp;D on superconducting thin-films, and squeezed-state and single-photon detection in quantum electronics will produce unanticipated spin-offs. ADMX-HF has proven to be a great attractor for young talent. This award can be expected to extend this record. In addition, it is planned to establish a permanent exhibit on dark-sector science at the Chabot Space and Science Center, or the Oakland Museum of California, utilizing prototypes and artifacts from many of the historic dark matter, dark energy and cosmic microwave background experiments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;UC Berkeley and U. Colorado/JILA are assisting Yale by taking the lead on cavity and amplifier development, respectively. The three universities have successfully delivered on ADMX-HF, which recently performed its first data run. This represented the inaugural use of Josephson Parametric Amplifiers (JPAs) in the microwave cavity experiment, and operation with a dilution refrigerator. With this award, Berkeley and Colorado plan two lines of R&amp;D: (i) Berkeley will pursue boosting the cavity Q by incorporating multilayer structures of thin-film superconductors into the cavity design, as well as exploring Photonic Band Gap (PBG) structures as practical resonators for higher frequency operation; and (ii) Colorado/JILA will focus on reducing amplifier noise below the Standard Quantum Limit (SQL), initially by incorporating a JPA-based squeezed-vacuum state receiver. This would be only the second application of a squeezed-state receiver, beside the GEO/LIGO gravity wave interferometers. Later, photon detector systems based on superconducting qubits inside of a cavity will be developed and deployed. Technical deliverables anticipated are to (a) extend the mass range of the search to 12 GHz (~50 micro-eV), and (b) deliver an improvement in power sensitivity by an order of magnitude, and thus approach sensitivity to Dine-Fischler-Srednicki-Zhitnitsky (DFSZ) axions. This will dramatically improve the discovery potential of the axion search in the most promising mass region.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ ADMX-HF, subsequently renamed HAYSTAC is an experiment searching for the dark matter of the universe in the form of a hypothetical ultralight elementary particle, called the axion.  The principle of the experiment is that axions can convert to a weak microwave signal in a magnetic field, and the conversion probability is resonantly enhanced in a microwave cavity.  The microwave cavity is tuned slowly, and the signal would appear when the frequency of the cavity corresponds to the mass of the axion.  The signal is indeed very weak, being optimistically a trillionth of a trillionth of a watt.  The experiment is carried out by a collaboration of Yale (where it is sited), the University of Colorado who make the very sensitive amplifiers, and the University of California Berkeley where we design and fabricate the specialized microwave cavities for the experiment.  The collaboration has recently submitted a paper which will be published by Nature, one of the most prestigious journals in the world, for designing and operating this experiment in a mode which even evades the usual limits on sensitivity established by quantum mechanics, the first dark matter experiment to have ever done so.  Along with LIGO, which discovered gravitational radiation, HAYSTAC is one of only two fundamental science experiments to utilize this technique, called "squeezed vacuum states".  During the performance period of this grant, the Berkeley group had developed techniques which enabled the microwave cavity to achieve a high quality factor (think of a very pure tone, like a tuning fork), and achieve very low physical temperatures such that the thermal noise was subdominant to the receiver noise, thus allowing us to probe very weakly coupled axions.    This NSF grant allowed us to provide support for a postdoctoral researcher, four graduate student researchers, and several undergraduate researchers.  Two of the graduate students have been awarded a Ph.D. and another will receive his in May 2021.  Most of the group members are women, and the postdoctoral researcher is an underrepresented minority.  Technology from Berkeley's work in microwave technology feeds directly into accelerator science, a critical national need.  Several high-visibility papers have been written on the basis of this work.  But the primary purpose of this experiment is to discover the dark matter, and then further explore its properties, which would be a major scientific achievement.  As a consequence of this grant, we have built up an experiment which has the greatest sensitivity in the world by more than an order of magnitude in terms of reducing intrinsic noise to the quantum limit and below, making discovery a real possibility in our upcoming runs.
