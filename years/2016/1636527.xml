<AbstractNarration>The ocean's midwater realm is the next frontier for underwater robots.  The mesopelagic or "twilight" zone encompasses depths from 200 to 1000 meters where sunlight is dim. This vast region plays a key role in regulating ocean chemistry and biology, which in turn strongly effects global climate. The mesopelagic zone holds much of our planet's fish populations as well as poorly understood processes that couple the ocean surface to the seafloor including vertical fluxes of plankton, organic and inorganic particles, bubbles, and droplets. Mesopelagic features are often mobile, patchy, and ephemeral, so surveys and sampling can be very difficult.  Recent studies have found that mesopelagic biomass including fish are dramatically underestimated, yet investigations of patterns and processes in this region are strongly constrained by available technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This program will produce a unique new robot that will enable unprecedented scientific access to midwater environments, complementing existing survey and sampling tools. The robot will use cameras, lights, and oceanographic sensors to autonomously track slow-moving individual targets such as migrating mid-water animals, descending particles, and rising bubbles and droplets without disturbing those targets. It will also have the ability to detect and follow fine-scale oceanographic features such as thin layers that hold critical nutrients. Finally, the robot will take samples utilizing on-board intelligence to determine precisely when and where to sample. Under this program, the robot will be built and tested under a collaboration between the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute, Stanford University, and the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley.</AbstractNarration>

Along with housing the mesopelagic fishery, which serves as the base of food webs that feed billions of people globally, the ocean?s midwaters connect the sea surface to the depths of the ocean, playing a pivotal role in regulating Earth?s climate. While the ocean?s midwaters are strongly connected to us and our continued survival, little is known about this frontier for science exploration and discovery due to the challenges of accessing this region. To address this need, a number of researchers and engineers from Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute, Stanford University, University of Texas Rio Grande Valley, and the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute worked together to develop a new robotic platform optimized for midwater exploration called the Mesobot (Figure 1). By leveraging a number of existing underwater technologies (e.g., DSL?s Jason, MBARI?s ROV MiniROV and LRAUV) and integrating stereo tracking with vehicle control algorithms, the Mesobot provides a novel platform from which continuous observations of individual biotic/abiotic targets for long durations could be made (Figure 2). This ability will enable numerous investigations in the ocean?s midwaters, related to carbon cycling, organismal ecology, and biomechanics for the first time. Developments like the Mesobot will ultimately contribute to our understanding of the midwater ecosystem, bringing to light the importance of this region to the rest of the planet.</span></p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 05/28/2020<br>      Modified by: Kakani&nbsp;K&nbsp;Young</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1636527/1636527_10461308_1590710648803_CI7A9259--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1636527/1636527_10461308_1590710648803_CI7A9259--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 1."><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1636527/1636527_10461308_1590710648803_CI7A9259--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 1."></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">The Mesobot is a new class of underwater vehicles purpose-built for studying processes in the ocean�s midwaters.
