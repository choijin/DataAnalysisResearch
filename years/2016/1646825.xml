<AbstractNarration>The 2017 Chloroplast Biotechnology Gordon Research Conference and Seminar meeting will bring together a growing community of scientists combining fundamental studies on chloroplast molecular biology with applications in agriculture, industrial biotechnology and healthcare. The topics discussed are comprehensive and address the major needs and questions necessary to realize the envisioned benefits of plastid biotechnology. The meeting will host graduate students, postdoctoral scientists and junior academics together with an international cadre of leading experts in the field. The emphasis on sharing previously unpublished information enables the cultivation of innovative approaches to address the most important challenges facing the field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Plastid engineering is driven by the expectation that plastid transgene expression precludes transgene flow vial pollen, because the inheritance of the transgene is limited to maternal parent.  The conference will be focused on topics such as: (1) expression of recombinant proteins for industrial and pharmaceutical applications; (2) engineering the plastid genome to improve photosynthetic efficiency and plant productivity; (3) engineering novel metabolic pathways and structures into chloroplasts; (4) engineering novel agronomic traits into chloroplasts for gene stacking and transgene containment.</AbstractNarration>

Leading experts introduced novel approaches to chloroplast genome engineering and new tools for plastid gene manipulation and transgene expression.

Target products covered included biopharmaceuticals (vaccines and therapeutic proteins), industrial enzymes, green chemicals and next-generation biofuels. The impact of organelle turnover, genome stability and plastid-nuclear interactions on chloroplast gene and transgene expression was also discussed. Sessions on plastid gene expression addressed transcriptional and post-transcriptional control mechanisms of gene expression at all levels (transcription, RNA metabolism, translation, protein folding, protein turnover), highlighting bottlenecks and engineering options for optimized transgene expression. Moreover, possibilities to exploit nucleus-encoded, chloroplast-targeted regulator proteins for the precise control of plastid (trans)gene expression and chloroplast metabolism was presented. The conference also covered new synthetic biology approaches in cyanobacteria that are likely to stimulate future engineering efforts in chloroplasts of seed plants and eukaryotic algae.
