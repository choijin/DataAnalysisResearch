<AbstractNarration>With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) and Chemistry Research Infrastructure and Facilities programs, Professor YuHuang Wang from the University of Maryland College Park and colleagues Janice Reutt-Robey, Lawrence Sita, Chunsheng Wang and Liangbing Hu have acquired an atomic force microscope system. In an AFM a laser beam is directed to a surface by means of a cantilever and tip. As the cantilever is displaced by interacting with the surface, a reflection of the laser beam is displayed on a detector (photodiode). In this way an image of the surface can be created with the aid of an electronic system. In general, an AFM has three major abilities: force measurement, imaging, and manipulation. The microscope is an important tool in the investigation of the surfaces of materials. It is used in fundamental and applied research to study morphology of surfaces, surface imaging and functionalization, electrical, magnetic, chemical and mechanical properties of surfaces. This knowledge enables advances in developing better materials in fields such as nanoscience and energy science. The instrument is used in the research and training of undergraduate and graduate students preparing them for technical careers and opportunities for advanced education.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposal is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels, especially in: (a) studying nanoparticle transport and internalization at model interfaces, (b) probing quantum defects in low-dimensional carbon materials, (c) mapping peak current and peak force of carbon nanoparticles in covetics, (d) imaging small circuits on glass, (e) studying living polymerization and direct assembly of precision polyolefins, (f) assessing the integrity and stability of xeolite membranes, (g) understanding and tailoring designing of solid state interphases for nanostructured silicon electrodes and (h) studying solid electrode interface formation, structure and evolution of molybdenum disulfide.</AbstractNarration>

Successful Transition to a Self-Sustained User Facility. After an initial period of the first year for free use, we have been operating the facility as a part of shared user facility since January 2018 based on the following fee structure:      Type of user    Rates $/hr      University of Maryland    30      External academic / non-profit    46      Small commercial    85      Large Commercial    96         This fee structure is aimed at supporting the maintenance of the facility to ensure long term viability of the facility.  Once internal users are trained on the system they are given keycard access to the room and can sign up for time on a first come first serve basis through an online scheduler hosted by the Maryland NanoCenter. Trained external users can also sign up for time on the online but check in with us before arriving to make sure someone will be there to let them in.  Significant results:  We have identified a state-of-the-art AFM system (Asylum Cypher) that uniquely satisfies the needs of proposed user projects. The instrument has been ordered, delivered, and installed. The Cypher was installed in June 2017 and made available to an increasing number of users, which count 55 at the time of reporting.  This state-of-the-art research tool provides opportunity for training of graduate students, postdocs, faculty and undergrads in several areas of research including chemistry, chemical and biomolecular engineering, materials science, physics, electrical engineering and computer engineering and nutrition and food Science. The AFM was incorporated into an undergraduate level course in Materials Science and Engineering (ENMA441 ? Characterization of Materials).  Students were given demos of the AFM in small groups during which time data was collected and students analyzed the data as part of their coursework. Since its installation, we have trained 53 of the 55 users on the instrument from a range of departments including five external users.  So far research carried out by the AFM has resulted in 8 refereed journal publications, 2 theses, 11 oral presentations at symposiums, three of which were invited, 5 symposium poster presentations and one non refereed conference proceeding.
