<AbstractNarration>Mass-casualty events such as terrorist attacks and natural disasters can affect hundreds to thousands of people and place significant burdens on emergency response systems for unpredicted periods of time. During these events, the emergency response management faces several complex operational decisions under time pressure and sometimes security and safety concerns. One fundamental decision is how to distribute casualties from the affected areas to multiple medical facilities that differ in capacity, specialty, and distance. Currently, this decision is left to the emergency transport officer in civilian settings and to battlefield commanders during military operations. Using mathematical modeling and analysis in conjunction with medical expertise, this project will build knowledge and decision tools to make casualty distribution more efficiently and objective. This multi-disciplinary project bringing together operations researchers and emergency physicians, will benefit society directly by facilitating effective casualty distribution during disasters. It will also significantly contribute to the education of a diverse group of students from the operations research, public health, and medical fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In its most general form, casualty-distribution problem is a stochastic sequential decision making problem that includes various parameters and variables such as the number of casualties at each location; the number of emergency vehicles; the capacity, capability, and congestion levels of each hospital; the travel time between locations and hospitals; and the condition of travel routes. The first phase of the project involves identifying the most fundamental tradeoffs underlying this complex decision-making problem and formulating separate models for each. These models will then be analyzed by means of exact methods such as sample-path analysis and Markov decision processes to obtain insights about the characteristics of optimal decision rules. In the second phase of the project, approximate approaches such as fluid models and Lagrangian relaxations will be used to develop heuristic policies. In the final phase, an extensive simulation study will be conducted to test the principles and decision rules in more realistic settings using data from literature and the 2010 National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey.  The mathematical models developed for this project can equivalently be seen as queueing models with dynamic routing. Hence, this project also contributes to the operations research literature by introducing and studying a new class of queue-routing problems, where the travel to queues takes time and possibly requires a scarce resource.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ One of the most important decisions for the success of the overall response effort in the aftermath of a mass-casualty event is how to distribute casualties from affected areas to medical facilities, which differ in their capacity, specialty, and distance. This applies to both natural and manmade disasters.  In disaster medicine the process of sorting patients and prioritizing the treatment of patients is known as triage.  In the past, all triage systems have divided patients into one of four groups: Black, Red, Yellow, and Green.  Patients triaged into the Black category have been the sickest group and are either dead or so severely injured/ill that they are felt to be unsalvageable.  The next category are the patients placed into the Red category.  These patients are felt to be critically injured/ill but salvageable.  A less injured/ill group would be the Yellow group.  These patients, while needing urgent medical, help can wait for care until the Red patients are treated.  The least injured/ill group are the Green patients.  These patients have the ability to walk and can wait for medical care until the more critical patients have been treated.   This method of caring for patients has been the norm in disaster situations, but it does have limitations. For example, it does not allow flexibility for varying levels of resources.  The system is also rigid in that Black patients are never transported and Red patients are always cared for prior to Yellow patients.   Unfortunately, there is a paucity of very high-quality evidence to support the current method of triage described above. Given that in the real world it is extremely difficult to prospectively study triage methods, our research aimed to use computer simulations to study the best triage method.  In this project, we assisted researchers at UNC&ndash;Chapel Hill is constructing realistic mathematical models to help develop our understanding of this sequential decision problem. Specifically these models were used to build a mathematical framework that can be used to develop dynamic decision rules that prescribe which non-ambulatory patients should be transported to which treatment facilities and in what order.
