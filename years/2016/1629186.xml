<AbstractNarration>Software continues to evolve long after the first version is released. Changes made to source code in the course of evolution might not have the intended semantics (fix bugs, add features), which negatively impacts both software producers and software consumers, and has high economic costs. More generally, the software evolution process is not very well understood.  To remedy this situation, this work will use information derived from analyzing software history in two ways. First, to develop a type systems-based approach named differential typing, that enables reasoning about the properties of source code before and after a change has been made, and reveals the semantics of source code changes at development time.  Second, to construct a framework for declarative hypothesis testing that automates and simplifies the process of conducting empirical studies in software evolution, and software engineering in general.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The interdisciplinary foundation of this work will catalyze interaction between two primary communities, programming languages and software engineering.  The results of this research will lead to a better understanding of how software evolves, and to improvements in the software evolution process. By making the semantics of software changes explicit and revealing certain kinds of errors before software is deployed, the incidence of, and costs associated with, software bugs and incorrect software updates are reduced. The project will transform the way researchers conduct empirical software evolution studies by shifting the focus from how hypotheses are tested to what the right hypotheses are.  The contributions will be made publicly available, which will benefit not only the research community, but also the software development community. Ideas from this work will be incorporated into education, so that tomorrow's graduates are better prepared to tackle software evolution challenges.</AbstractNarration>

It was just the perfect event. I love the fact that everybody was military, and with military experience - this helps a lot, be- cause you don?t have to explain your situation first.

Research Achievements        This  project's research goal was to use rigorous mathematical models (theory  of programming languages, statistics) to understand how software  changes over time and to make software easier to maintain.    The project has made fundamental contributions to the research and practice of software evolution and program verification; and more broadly, to the areas of programming languages and software engineering, and interaction between them. The project has led to 17 publications including topmost conferences such as International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE) and ACM International Conference on Architectural Support for Programming Languages and Operating Systems (ASPLOS).   The project's research contributions, grouped by areas, were:  - Empirical software engineering (ICSE12, ICSME14, CMSR13,  ISSRE15, EASE15, JSS12).  - Leveraging software evolution for adaptive computing (ADAPT15, CC16).  - Concurrency (EASE15,ISSRE16, ASPLOS18).  - Automatic debugger generation and fault location (ISMM13,SANER15,CC16).   - On-the-fly program evolution (COMAD13) .  - Low-overhead tracing and dynamic monitoring/verification approaches (SANER15, ISSRE13, ISMM13, SCAM13).   - Paving the way for Dependable AI (ICST19,AITEST19).          2. Broader Impacts         Improving the state-of-the art in software evolution. The research approaches and tools described in Section 1 facilitate understanding software evolution, designing easier-to-evolve systems, detecting bugs early, etc.         Education. With support from this grant the PI has completely redesigned several Software Engineering and Programming Languages courses: ?CS 673:Software Design and Production Methodology? and ?CS 635:Computer Programming Languages? at NJIT; ?CS 179K:Project in Computer Science (Software Engineering)? ?CS 179K:Project in Computer Science (Compilers)? at the University of California, Riverside. In addition, the PI has made substantial improvements to ?CS 180:Introduction to Software Engineering? ?CS 100:Software Construction? at the University of California, Riverside.   Specifically, the changes involve a tighter interaction between the Programming Languages and Software Engineering topics; of- fering optional research projects into course materials; increased emphasis for formal, rigorous methods of software construction; and rapid dissemination of recent research results, as published by the PI and others, into course materials.            Support for military veterans students. The PI was College of Engineering? representative for the military veteran students at the University of California, Riverside. In this capacity he has worked with the veteran counselors and support staff on issues such as attracting veterans to UCR and counseling engineering veteran students (graduate and undergraduate).      Veteran outreach funds from this grant have been the primary means of funding for the April 2013 Inland Empire College Boot Camp (https://www.eventbrite.com/e/inland-empire-college-boot-camp-registration-5941726865) , which brought together colleges from the Inland Empire to provide resources and information to make prospective military veteran students? college journey successful. The event was a big success, with about 100 attendees: 40 veterans attended, along with representatives from 16 academic institutions, 9 veteran service organizations, and 2 community businesses. In May 2013 the PI received the UCR Bravo Zulu award for outstanding service to student veterans/military members.   The event?s main organizer has characterized the event thusly:   ?Responses were very positive. From among the attendees, 95% of respondents rated the event ?excellent? or ?very good;? 90% stated that the event provided ?a lot of value? for the time spent; 90% rated the presentations as ?excellent? or ?very good;? and 90% rated the venue as ?excellent? or ?very good.?   Here?s a comment from a participant: ?Thank you for this amazing event. I have been to a lot of school events, always trying to get some information. But the Boot Camp in Riverside was so far the best event I have been to. Everybody was so amazing, ready to help, and everybody had great information to share. I loved everything about this event - the speakers, the vendors, and the different schools. It was just the perfect event. I love the fact that everybody was military, and with military experience - this helps a lot, be- cause you don?t have to explain your situation first. I will be back again. Thank you again for this AMAZING event.?   The participating organizations also enjoyed the event. 69% of the exhibitors responded that event participants were extremely or very engaged with their table or presentation, 81% stated that it provided a lot or a great deal of value for the time spent, and 94% said they are very or extremely likely to participate if the event were offered again. One exhibitor said, ?It was a great opportu- nity to meet students that would not have previously heard about [our] University. Networking with other colleges/universities and VA representatives was an added plus!?               Outreach and support for minorities and underrepresented groups. The project has provided funds for training 9 PhD students, including 4 female PhD students, and several Master?s, as well as undergraduate students.
