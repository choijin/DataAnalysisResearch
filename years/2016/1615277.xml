<AbstractNarration>The team will use the Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope (GBT) to observe the dense gas in nearby galaxies.  The team has added a cutting-edge instrument, Argus, to this NSF facility.  This has paved the way for these important observations at millimeter wavelengths.  The team will study how galaxies form stars in their dense gas.  They will compare their observations to theoretical models.  Senior team members will train junior members recruited from underrepresented groups.  The team will feature the research in materials for the Bay Area Science Festival in California and the Green Bank Visitors Center in West Virginia.  The team will also help others use Argus for their own research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The team will use Argus on the GBT to map the dense molecular gas in nearby galaxies at high spatial resolution.  They will combine these new data with existing data at other wavelengths to study (1) how the amount of star formation per unit of dense gas depends on the local conditions in the galaxies, and (2) how the amount of dense gas depends on the local conditions in the galaxies.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  This award supported the commissioning of the Argus instrument -- a 90 pixel camera for the Green Bank Telescope operating between 80 and 115 GHz -- and its subsequent use to conduct a survey of 40 nearby galaxies. As part of the DEGAS survey (Dense Extragalactic GBT+Argus Survey), molecular gas in each galaxy is mapped using its spectral line emission. Four different molecules were probed using this technique -- HCN, HCO+, 13CO and C18O.  Each of these molecules emits a spectral line at a specific frequency, and the brightness of each line depends on the density of the gas in a different way.  Therefore, by mapping each galaxy in each of these four lines, the physical conditions of the gas can be inferred.  The DEGAS team has completed 500 hours of measurements of these galaxies, and publications are in preparation.   In addition to the DEGAS survey, the Argus team made the instrument available to other members of the astronomical community for a variety of astronomical measurements including mapping nearby gas clouds both in our own galaxy and in M31 (the Andromeda galaxy).  Argus is now available to any user of the Green Bank Telescope and represents a significant addition to the instrumentation of this telescope.   Two graduate students worked on Argus and on the DEGAS survey.  One completed a PhD thesis on the building of Argus and then a postdoctoral position during the commissioning phase. Each student received training in state-of-the art millimeter wave receiver design, and in data analysis and interpretation.
