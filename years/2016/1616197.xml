<AbstractNarration>This research project concerns fundamental mathematical questions in fracture mechanics, an area of importance in materials and structural engineering. Despite substantial recent progress in mathematical analysis of models for fracture and crack propagation, nucleation and propagation of material defects in general, and fracture in particular, remain poorly understood, yet their accurate prediction is of great importance in many materials science applications. This project aims to develop new mathematical methods for addressing some of the major challenges in this area. These include showing existence of solutions to classes of mathematical models for fracture evolution, improving dynamic fracture models, and analyzing properties of dynamic fracture solutions, with a particular emphasis on exploring crack branching and its consequences. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Showing existence of quasi-static cohesive fracture evolutions, showing existence for mathematical models of dynamic fracture, and establishing qualitative properties of dynamic fracture solutions are major challenges in the mathematical analysis of fracture mechanics. The methods that have been used to show existence for quasi-static Griffith evolutions are now known to fail for cohesive fracture. The main difficulty arises from the delicate role that history plays in the definition of these solutions. This project will continue the development of new methods for analyzing this and other quasi-static problems, based on higher order energy approximations using history at only a finite number of prior times. Dynamic Griffith fracture is also very delicate, due to complex interactions between elastic singularities and the (a priori unknown) evolving crack set. New methods based on blow-up techniques will be developed for analyzing these evolutions.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[This project concerned fundamental mathematical questions in fracture mechanics.  Despite recent progress, the propagation of material defects in general, and fracture in particular, remain poorly understood, yet their accurate prediction is very important in many materials science applications.  This project was devoted to extending mathematical methods and developing new ones for addressing some of the major challenges in this area.     Predicting material failure in practice involves computer simulations based on approximate mathematical models.  The accuracy of these simulations depends on both the accuracy of the numerical method, and the accuracy of the approximate model.  Both of these are at least partly mathematical questions, and this project focuses on the latter.  In particular, when we propose an underlying mathematical model to be approximated, it should be well-posed -- at least, there should exist a solution to the problem.  This basic question can be very difficult, and this is the case for models of dynamic fracture.   In prior results, existence for dynamic fracture had been limited to models predicting only regular crack paths under certain assumptions on the motion of the material undergoing fracture.  Here, in a series of papers with collaborators, we extended prior results and methods to models without the motion assumption and to some irregular crack paths.  In a related area, and with different collaborators, we also showed existence for models of dynamic damage, which appears to be the first result of its kind.   This project also involved the training of a Ph.D. student and undergraduate students.  The supported Ph.D. student has been working on problems in quasi-static fracture (i.e., slowly growing cracks, rather than the potentially quickly advancing failure in dynamic fracture).  So far, mathematical existence results are limited to prescribed boundary displacements rather than applied forces.  The student and I have been working on results for applied forces, which are more important in applications, and raise many interesting questions.   Finally,  this project involved international collaboration, and results were presented at international conferences, including in Germany, Italy, Mexico, and Canada.
