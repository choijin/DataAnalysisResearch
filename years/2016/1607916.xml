<AbstractNarration>The Development of a New Instructional Approach to Teach Engineering in Middle School Science Classrooms&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project has two overall goals. The first goal is to create a new instructional approach that middle school science teachers can use to teach the engineering design process. The second goal is to learn more about how middle school students propose, support, critique and revise design solutions. This project will result in new findings about how middle school students learn about the engineering design process, how they propose, support, critique and revise engineering designs; and how different aspects of instruction support or constrain middle school student use of disciplinary core ideas and cross-cutting concepts while engaging in the engineering design process. This project will directly impact four teachers and a diverse group of approximately 1000 students. Once the instructional model is developed, it has the potential to be adopted by teachers throughout the United States. This new approach to instruction will enable science teachers to integrate engineering concepts and practices into any middle school science course as prescribed by the Next Generation Science Standards - without needing to adopt or purchase an entirely new curriculum. In addition, the project has the potential to enhance interest in the field of engineering and to broaden the participation of women and minorities in engineering.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) call for middle school science teachers to add engineering design into their curriculum so all students can learn to use core ideas, crosscutting concepts, and engineering practices to solve problems. This project uses a design-research mixed-methods approach. The project team will develop, implement and revise 4 prototype engineering design tasks (EDTs) based on a new instructional model called Argument-Driven Engineering (ADE). Iterative improvements of the instructional model and the EDTs will be made from analysis of both quantitative and qualitative data. This project will result in the generation and validation of a new assessment of practices related to engineering design, referred to as the Scenario-based Assessment of Design (SAD). The SAD will be administered three times (pre-, mid- and post-) to track changes in students' knowledge and skills over time. Qualitative data, including the collection of video data of EDTs and student artifacts, will be analyzed using iterative content analysis.  This research project will also result in new findings about: a) how middle school students propose, support, critique and revise engineering design; b) how patterns of the these skills change over time; and c) what features of instruction support or constrain learning of the engineering design process. The results will be used to refine the ADE model so that it can be used effectively by teachers who incorporate engineering design in their classes.</AbstractNarration>

This instructional model is designed to help students learn to use core ideas and practices of science, engineering, and mathematics to develop solutions to problems. To increase access to engineering learning experiences for all students, ADE is intended for use in science classrooms instead of a stand-alone engineering course. The instructional model is an eight-stage sequence of activities where students learn about a problem; identify the parameters (i.e., criteria and constraints) of acceptable design solutions; propose and argue about possible solutions; build, test, and refine solutions; present final solutions and argue for their quality; and write reports detailing their solution and how they know it meets the design parameters.

This instructional model is designed to help students learn to use core ideas and practices of science, engineering, and mathematics to develop solutions to problems. To increase access to engineering learning experiences for all students, ADE is intended for use in science classrooms instead of a stand-alone engineering course.

These four design challenges are available for any teacher to use. Teachers can also adapt the ADE instructional model to create their own design challenges.   Intellectual Merit: The research associated with this project resulted in the following findings:  Students are more motivated to learn during a design challenge when it is interesting, relevant, and emphasizes the importance of making the world better. The ways students propose, support, critique and revise design solutions improves over time when students have repeated opportunities to argue from evidence and discuss ?what counts? as high-quality evidence in engineering. Instructional materials designed to give students opportunities to engage in engineering design as part of a science curriculum should (a) provide challenges that are authentic, relevant and interesting to students, (b) frame design as a way to make the world better, (c) require the use of core ideas and practices from multiple disciplines, (d) provide opportunities for students to propose, support, critique, and revise ideas, (e) include opportunities for talking and writing, and (f) provide opportunities for goal setting, feedback, and reflection. Teachers often view the integration of engineering design into science curriculum as a way to help students develop critical thinking and problem-solving skills rather than a way to make engineering more accessible and inclusive.  Science teachers must learn how to frame, guide, and facilitate student engagement and learning during an engineering design challenge, particularly regarding instances when designs do not work as intended.  Providing opportunities for teachers to observe student thinking during an engineering design challenge helps them see students as capable sense-makers. The use of an instructional model is key to facilitating changes in teachers? instruction and ensures coherence across a science curriculum and common experiences for students throughout a school.  Engaging students in engineering design requires specialized facilities, equipment, and supplies. This is a potential source of inequity if funds are limited or unavailable for purchasing these resources.  The adoption of a new instructional model will be hindered if the model is not well aligned with school priorities, state standards, and local or state assessments. This includes teachers? perceptions of the misalignment between these goals.     Broader Impact: This project had a direct impact on the participating teachers who used the ADE instructional model in their classrooms. Furthermore, approximately 800 students completed the four engineering design challenges during each year of the project. At the end of the project, the partner school district decided to integrate at least four ADE engineering design challenges into the formal curriculum of six different science courses.

Workshops at science teacher conferences, including the annual meetings of the National Science Teaching Association, the National Science Education Leadership Association, and the Science Teachers Association of Texas. Published manuscripts in researcher and practitioner journals, including Science Scope, Journal of Pre-College Engineer Education Research, Science Education, and the Journal of Research in Science Teaching.
