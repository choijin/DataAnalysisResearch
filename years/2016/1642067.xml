<AbstractNarration>Heegaard Floer homology is family of invariants of objects studied in low-dimensional topology, including closed 3-manifolds,  4-dimensional cobordisms, knots and links in 3-manifolds, and contact structures on 3-manifolds.  Bordered Heegaard Floer homology is an extension of Heegaard Floer homology to 3-manifolds with boundary, with good gluing properties.  (Roughly, Heegaard Floer homology forms a (3+1)-dimensional topological field theory, and bordered Heegaard Floer homology is a (2+1+1)-dimensional extension of this field theory.)  This project seeks to further develop bordered Heegaard Floer homology. The ultimate goals are to find practical ways of computing Heegaard Floer homology (and the Seiberg-Witten invariant); an axiomatic characterization of Heegaard Floer theory; and variants on Heegaard Floer theory capable of answering other topological questions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As is taught in high-school geometry (and was known to the ancient Greeks), three-dimensional space -- the space we live in -- can be sliced into a family of non-intersecting (parallel) planes. It can also be sliced into a family of disks with boundary on the standard, unkotted circle (except that one disk will have a point missing): think of the disks as soap bubbles on a bubble-wand, and the family as coming from blowing on the soap harder or less hard.  If you start with a knotted circle K, it may or may not be possible to slice space into a family of surfaces with boundary on K.  So, it is natural to ask:  for which knots K is there such a family of surfaces?  Knots for which there is such a family are called "fibered knots", and finding ways to tell if a knot is fibered turns out to be both interesting and hard.  Surprisingly, some of the most effective tools for answering this kind of question are closely related to ideas from modern mathematical physics, quantum field theory, and string theory, and have applications not just to 3-dimensional questions but also to 4-dimensional ones.  A family of invariants called Heegaard Floer homology is one such tool.  This project seeks to further understand the structure of Heegaard Floer homology, with the goals of developing ways to compute it more efficiently and finding other related tools adapted to different problems.</AbstractNarration>

The research conducted was documented in 6 peer-reviewed articles which have been published, 2 peer-reviewed articles and 1 peer-reviewed book which have been accepted for publication but not yet published, and 3 articles which are still undergoing peer review.</p> <p>In mathematics, "expository" is used to mean that a paper focuses on explaining and contextualizing existing results, rather than discovering and proving new ones. These papers help consolidate the field's knowledge and make it more easily accessible to other researchers in the field, rather than breaking new ground. Two of the articles above are expository. The PI and a coauthor also wrote 1 expository article which will be published in a non-peer reviewed volume (Proceedings of the 2018 International Congress of Mathematicians). The PI's graduate students advised during this period wrote 7 papers which have been published or submitted for peer review.</p> <p>Peer review in mathematics takes often takes several years, and many mathematics journals have a publication backlog of several more years. For the field to continue developing rapidly, it is important for rough versions of papers to be made available without these delays. This is now accomplished via the arXiv, the main preprint server used by mathematicians. All of the papers above are available on the arXiv. Papers on the arXiv are available free of charge to anyone in the world with Internet access. The versions available on the arXiv differ cosmetically from published versions, but the mathematical content is identical.</p> <p>Turning to the educational activities, the grant partly supported:</p> <ul> <li>Columbia's summer undergraduate research program in mathematics in 2012-2014, which reached 16-20 undergraduate students each year.</li> <li>Sonya Kovalevsky Day events at Barnard College in 2013, 2014, and 2015, reaching 80-100 high school girls each year, from a math-focused high school in an under-resourced community in New York.</li> <li>Two undergraduate students to contribute to SnapPy, a software package for computations in knot theory and low-dimensional topology.</li> <li>The Elementary School Math Circles at the University of Oregon, supporting 2 graduate students and 8 undergraduates to work with roughly 40 elementary school students in 2016-2017 and 2017-2018.</li> <li>A day-long Math Festival in Spring 2017 at the University of Oregon, reaching more than 200 elementary school students</li> <li>Several outreach events by graduate students at the University of Oregon to local K-6 students, including two "Girl's Math Days".</li> <li>Mentoring 3 postdoctoral researchers and 7 Ph.D. students.</li> </ul> <p>(The PI moved from Columbia University to the University of Oregon during the grant period, and the grant was transferred.)</p> <p>The grant focused on relationships between 1-, 2-, 3-, and 4-dimensional objects, using techniques from calculus (partial differential equations), modern algebraic structures (e.g., A-infinity modules), and high-dimensional topology (stable homotopy theory). The main goal is to develop techniques to answer topological questions about spaces that are, currently, hard to answer.</p> <p>For example, just like a plane cuts 3-space in half, 3-space itself cuts 4-space in half. A circle in a plane is the boundary of a disk in 3-space (Figure 2, left). By contrast, a knot in 3-space might or might not be the boundary of a disk in 4-space. An example is shown in Figure 2 (center, right). In 3-space, the disk shown intersects itself, but in 4-space one can push the disk a little ways in the 4th dimension to remove the intersections.</p> <p>More generally, one can ask how complicated a surface in 4-space must be to have boundary a given knot; this complexity is called the "4-ball genus". The PI and coauthors answered this question, for example, for the class of knots shown in Figure 3. (The answer for the knot shown is 5=(5-1)(3-1)/2+1.) The paper uses ideas from Morse theory and symplectic geometry to turn the question into a problem about high-dimensional spaces and then use techniques from algebraic topology to answer that question.</p> <p>Another question is when a piece of a tangle is parallel to the boundary. For example, one of the two strands in Figure 4 (left) is parallel to the boundary, but the other two are not. The PI and coauthor gave an algorithm, using a tool called bordered-sutured Floer homology, for answering this question. Bordered-sutured Floer homology involves considering surfaces with certain kinds of decorations, as shown on the right of Figure 4, and then using tools from differential equations and abstract algebra.</p> <p>A last topic considered by the grant is knots and spaces with symmetries, as shown in Figure 1, which is drawn from another paper of the PI and collaborators.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 07/31/2018<br>      Modified by: Robert&nbsp;Lipshitz</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1642067/1642067_10152587_1532141509666_Figure4--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1642067/1642067_10152587_1532141509666_Figure4--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Symmetric grid diagram for a link, and its quotient"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1642067/1642067_10152587_1532141509666_Figure4--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Symmetric grid diagram for a link, and its quotient"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">A symmetric grid diagram for a link, and its quotient.
