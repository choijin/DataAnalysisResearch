<AbstractNarration>PI:  Wrenn, Steven / Sarkar, Kausik&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: 1603007 / 1602884&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research is focused on the study of the behavior of microbubbles inside a liquid drop. The microbubbles become stable when coated with lipids and then nested in a cell that is filled with water. This arrangement can have applications with biological interest, such as drug delivery techniques and diagnostics through imaging of the acoustic response of the bubbles. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Coated microbubbles are already useful for contrast enhanced ultrasound imaging. Nesting them inside a drug bearing vesicle confers great potential as "theranostic" vehicles, meaning they can be used for both therapeutic and diagnostic applications. At the same time, nesting can protect microbubbles against gas diffusion, enhancing their life time from minutes to hours. However, nesting a microbubble leads to dramatic changes in microbubble acoustical activity and the resulting fluid dynamics, including acoustic microstreaming. The nesting concept was demonstrated experimentally for the first time just a few years ago, and the mechanism by which nesting impacts acoustic microstreaming is not yet known in detail; both experimental and theoretical studies involving nested microbubbles are scant. This is the objective of this collaborative proposal. The research team will perform a systematic and exhaustive series of acoustic and physicochemical tests of various nested formulations, while simultaneously deriving mathematical and computational fluid dynamics models that account for the nesting shell and agree with the experimental results. There are three specific aims: 1) compute the streamlines in a nested configuration and calculate the resulting shear stress profile along the inner leaflet of the nesting phospholipid bilayer; 2) identify the mechanism(s) by which the bilayer restructures itself in response to the stresses produced by microstreaming; and 3) quantify the sensitivity of microstreaming and the bilayer response to ultrasonic input parameters and chemically derived nesting membrane properties. The broader impact of the proposed work is to develop a theranostic vehicle that can be used for ultrasound imaging and/or drug delivery. The end application could be the use of nested micro-bubbles in actual clinical environments. The proposal also includes a plan to actively recruit underrepresented minority students from Morgan State, as well as educational activities for high school, undergraduate and graduate students.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This work scientifically interesting because of the complex physics that arise when interactions between ultrasound and microbubbles, which are dispersed in water, subsequently give rise to new interactions between those microbubbles and nearby cells. Ultrasound is a pressure wave, and the interactions that arise depend on the pressure applied. Low pressures cause microbubbles to expand and contract repeatedly. The repeated expansions and contractions essentially stir the water in which the microbubbles are dispersed.  If the stirring is strong enough, then &ndash; if the microbubbles are sufficiently close to a cell &ndash; a cell membrane will become porous.  At high ultrasound pressure, a microbubble can expand so much that the next contraction will cause the microbubble to implode. This generates a shock wave, which &ndash; like the stirring caused at low pressure, though acting over much larger distances -  can cause a cell membrane to become more porous.  If the microbubble that generates a shock wave happens to be close to the cell, then the cell membrane can rupture.  As a result of cell membrane rupture, the cells die.  Thus, in addition to being scientifically interesting, this project potentially has significant practical utility.  Specifically, the knowledge gained from this work could lead to new technologies that employ ultrasound and microbubbles to decontaminate food products, thereby eliminating unnecessary food waste.
