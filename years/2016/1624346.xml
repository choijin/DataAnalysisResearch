<AbstractNarration>Political instability and violence create the environment for language loss and resulting social instability.  Establishing the intersecting causes and consequences of political and social instability as tied to language is of interest to national security.  The purpose of the Political Instability and Language Endangerment Conference is to develop a thorough understanding of how political instability and violence break apart communities and erode their ability to pass down their written and spoken word.  This interdisciplinary conference will bring together experts from political science, linguistics and other fields to develop a global and comprehensive account of the intersection of politics and language endangerment. Broader impacts include the engagement of undergraduate and graduate students, many of whom are first generation and themselves from underrepresented groups, by providing networking and co-authoring opportunities to mentor students and to provide  training that will be invaluable in both private and public sector work.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Led by an interdisciplinary team of linguists and political scientists from the University of North Texas, the Political Instability and Language Endangerment Conference will integrate knowledge from both disciplines and will produce new strategies for interdisciplinary research. The dominant paradigm for understanding the causes of language endangerment takes into consideration local social and economic factors. The potential for a more comprehensive understanding is possible through the perspective of political science which takes into account the role of violence, power and resources in societies and across institutions of governance.  In order to stimulate research utilizing this novel interdisciplinary perspective, conference participants will explore (1) how government policy, instability due to war and other forms of conflict lead to language endangerment; (2) how instability due to economically forced immigration contributes to language endangerment; and (3) how political conflict due to language endangerment and national language policies can lead to political protest, unrest and violence.  The resulting white paper and edited volume will be invaluable resources for practitioners, academics, and most importantly, the affected communities to develop strategies for language preservation. A follow-up conference envisioned for the Smithsonian Institution will help raise greater public awareness of this phenomenon.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ It is clear that in marginal communities, the loss of language and other cultural artefacts is exacerbated by political violence among armed actors, economic violence perpetrated by individuals and businesses intent on acquiring new land from indigenous communities, and so forth.  Led by an interdisciplinary team of linguists and political scientists from the University of North Texas, the Political Instability and Language Endangerment Conference integrated knowledge from both disciplines to produce new strategies for interdisciplinary research. Conference participants explored methods of studying the causes of language endangerment including government policy, instability due to war and other forms of conflict, and economically forced migration.  Broader impacts of the project included training and professional development for University of North Texas undergraduate and graduate students, many of whom are first generation and themselves from underrepresented groups.  Working with the project provided networking and co-authoring opportunities and training that will be invaluable in both private and public sector work.  The findings of the conference were disseminated widely through follow-up symposia at the  Smithsonian Institution and at UNESCO India in partnership with the Indira Gandhi Centre for the Arts in New Delhi.  These sessions were used to raise greater public awareness of language endangerment and political instability.   The UNT, Smithsonian and UNESCO/IGNCA meetings each focused on a slightly different aspect of the question:  how can political scientists and linguists work together to improve data sets and thereby understanding of marginalized communities. The presentations and discussions that took place at these three venues along with the white paper are freely available for viewing through the University of North Texas Digital Library.  A publication summarizing findings will be available in the journal Language Documentation and Conservation.
