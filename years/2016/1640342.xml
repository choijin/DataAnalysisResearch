<AbstractNarration>The period from 4.5 to 3.5 million years ago is an important part of our evolutionary history, during which a number of hominin species appeared and diversified. In this project, the investigators will collect paleontological, archeological, and geological data from the Galili Formation in the Afar region of Ethiopia, which is known from initial surveys to include fossils for a range of species, including some hominin specimens. Additional findings at this location will contribute to the study of important issues in hominin evolution and adaptation, such as behavioral changes, expanded habitats, stone tool use, and regular meat eating. This project will provide training opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students and field personnel, and build paleontological and archeological research collections from a scientifically interesting period and region. Fossils and archeological materials, with information on their context, will be permanently curated at the Ethiopian National Museum, and data from geochronological and isotopic analyses will be added to relevant publicly-accessible databases.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this two-year field investigation of the Early Pliocene-Early Pleistocene Galili Formation, the investigators will expand on a previously NSF-funded survey of the project area; collect, prepare, and curate taxonomically, biochronologically, biogeographically, and paleoenvironmentally sensitive fossils; identify, sample, and process geological samples for dating; and develop a high-resolution geologic map and stratigraphy of the area. These project activities will improve the chronological control of the deposits, better document the time-successive diversity in fauna and environments, reconstruct basin geometry and evolution, and allow biological and geological comparisons with other Awash basin areas. Findings from this project will contribute to topics such as the transition to bipedality, the origins of stone tool manufacture and meat-eating, and the origins of the genus Homo. The Galili deposits are sampling a unique part of the ancient landscape, and comparisons with other similarly aged fossils from the Afar region, such as those from Woranso-Mille, Dikika, Hadar, and Middle Awash, will provide a more comprehensive understanding of the entire ancient Awash Basin to better understand that circumstances of early hominin evolution.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Our team has conducted three seasons (two funded by this grant and one from remaining funds from a previous NSF grant) of field research in the Galili area of the Afar State of Ethiopia.  This research included intensive paleontological, geological, and archeological survey of the 100 km2 study area.  During that time, we have collected over 1400 paleontological specimens, including 21 hominins, conducted significant geological sampling and mapping, and collected numerous archeological remains.  The grant was originally scheduled to end in December 2018.  We requested and received a one-year extension.   A revised chronology (including 9 newly dated levels) of the study area shows that the deposits span the period between 5.31 Ma to 2.335 Ma with the majority of fossiliferous sediments located in the 4.43-3.80 Ma span within the Shabeley Laag and Dhidinley Members of the Galili Formation.  Additional samples are currently being analyzed with results expected shortly.  Project geologist Dr. Jay Quade (University of Arizona) has developed a novel approach to zircon dating of the numerous volcanic rich sandstones.  This approach can be used both to date new stratigraphic levels and refine the existing columns but also be used to explore drainage patterns in the basin based on the age composition spectra of the zircon populations.  In addition, &gt;20 geological sections were measured and dozens of soil samples were collected for pedogenic carbonate analysis.  Further geological study reinforces the unique position of the Galili study area as both the southernmost of the Mio-Pliocene sediments in the Awash basin but importantly that these deposits are at the easternmost edge of the basin.  The ancient landscape was dotted with volcanic features that acted to both direct the paleo-Awash river as well as impound the flow forming a lake.  With the rise of the 3.6 Ma volcanic event forming the Ayelu and surrounding volcanoes, this redirected the river westward and closer to its modern position.    There are significant lacustrine and peri-lacustrine deposits at Galili, as evidence by the numerous fish, freshwater turtles, crocodylians, and hippopotamids. The terrestrial fossils are rich in monkeys, bovids, suids, and proboscideans.  Preliminary analyses show a marked diversity of taxa in the Dhidinley Mbr. with up to five species including an early Theropithecus.  This diversity is interesting in light of the presence of only two species in the slightly older (4.5-4.3 Ma) deposits at Gona and the Middle Awash.  The suids are numerous and well preserved including a significantly complete cranium of Notochoerus jaegeri.  Our preliminary results from the analyses of the suids provide greater insight into the evolution of the Tetraconodont suids and will allow us to further refine the phylogentic relationships of the genera Nyanzachoerus and Notochoerus.  The analyses of the non-hominin taxonomic groups as well as the paleoecology and taphonomy will be conducted by researchers and their students from a number of US and international institutions.   We are continuing laboratory research at the Ethiopian National Museum in the summer of 2019. Simpson will be accompanied by a two PhD candidates (Amanda Slotter, Arizona State University; Hailay Reda University of Oregon) and a paleoecological specialist (Sabrina Curran, Ohio University).  The period between 4.4 Ma and 3.8 Ma was previously considered to document the transition between Ardipithecus ramidus and Australopithecus anamensis.  Recent research has revealed a greater diversity of hominins in this period, especially from the Woranso-Mille study area.  In the three field seasons, we have recovered 21 hominins ranging from isolated tooth fragments and postcrania to a complete mandibular dentition.  Preliminary assessments indicate that multiple taxa are present.  While some of these fossils can be assigned to known taxa, the allocation of some others is elusive.   The archeology component of the project is led by team senior scientist Dr. Hasan Said (Addis Ababa University).  The archeological remains are primarily Middle Stone age or more recent surface finds although some refined but highly weathered Mode 2 tools are occasionally encountered.  Curiously, some of the MSA tools are made from fossilized palm trees that are present in the study area.  An interesting area of future research is the presence of large stone works on the top of Mt. Galili. These appear to be indigenous and a radiocarbon date from the site yielded an age of ca. 800 BP.  The fossils and artifacts are housed in the National Museum of Ethiopia.  A full catalog of these fossils has been created and the non-hominin fossils are stored in newly purchased shelving.  The fossils collected previously from the Galili area have been recurated and their collection locations have been registered with the current project allowing a coherent analysis of the entire Galili paleontological sample that in total numbers over 3000 specimens including 31 hominins.  The Galili fossils provide the best sampling of the critical 4.4-3.8 Ma period of hominin evolution in the Afar region. We have received a 1-year no-cost extension.
