<AbstractNarration>The Macromolecular, Supramolecular, and Nanochemistry Program of the Chemistry Division supports the work of Prof. C. Scott Hartley in the Department of Chemistry &amp; Biochemistry at Miami University. In nature, the structural complexity of large molecules (e.g., proteins), and ultimately their function, is generated by the folding of smaller molecular pieces (oligomers and polymers). This fact has inspired many efforts to study non-biological "foldamers" smaller molecular pieces that fold in well-defined ways. Research in the Hartley group focuses on the ortho-phenylenes, a simple class of foldamers formed from directly connected aromatic rings. In this project, the Harley group develops methods to control the folding of o-phenylenes and incorporates the rings into more complex structures. The project involves graduate students, undergraduates, and high-school teachers working to understand fundamental concepts of molecular folding, self-assembly, and molecular recognition, using the techniques of organic synthesis, computational chemistry, and various characterization methods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ortho-phenylenes combine several features that make them attractive as "next-generation" foldamers.  They are straightforward to synthesize.  Their folding behavior is easily modeled using simple, inexpensive methods.  Their exact, solution-phase folding state can be characterized by NMR spectroscopy. This project has three specific aims that take advantage of these features. First, the twist-sense of o-phenylene folding is controlled using chiral end groups. While this sort of control over oligomer folding has been demonstrated in other systems, it is critical for more advanced uses of o-phenylenes.  If successful, may be used to test o-phenylenes for spin-selective electron transport. Second, o-phenylene subunits are linked together into macrocycles. This simple system represents a first step toward incorporating o-phenylene secondary structures (i.e., helices) into higher-order structures, and provides a framework to test the conformational interaction between bridged foldamer subunits. Finally, o-phenylenes are functionalized with macrocycles to create binding sites along their sides. The architectures represents a first step toward o-phenylene-based molecular recognition.</AbstractNarration>

Nature's example shows that the most promising strategy to generate large-scale, complex molecular geometries is through folding, via polymers (chain-like molecules) that are programmed through their structures to adopt specific shapes. If we can learn to use these same principles, we will be able to create new chemical technologies that operate under non-biological conditions or that are tailored to specific applications. Understanding how to fold non-biological molecules, so-called "foldamers", is accordingly a current area of interest.</p> <p>This project focuses on a specific class of foldamers, the <em>ortho</em>-phenylenes. They are structurally very simple, just chains of benzene rings, but this simplicity belies very rich structural behavior. <em>o</em>-Phenylenes spontaneously fold into helices driven by attraction between every third benzene ring. Importantly, they offer some very useful features if one is interested in studying folding: their behavior is straightforward to model computationally, and their structures in solution can be determined using Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. This combination of properties makes them especially well-suited to addressing two key problems for molecular folding. First, while there are many examples of foldamers that exhibit short-range folding into well-defined structures ("secondary structure"), there are far fewer examples of systems that take the next, necessary step and further organize those folded segments in space ("tertiary structure"). Second, the dynamics of folded systems (i.e., how they change over time) are important to their function, but difficult to control.</p> <p>In this project we have achieved two key results. First, we have shown that we can control the direction of <em>o</em>-phenylene folding by attaching appropriate groups to their end. That is, we design them such that they favor one twist sense (left- or right-handed) over the other. This is the first step toward actively controlling their folding. By looking at how many different attached groups affect the folding, we have built up a model to explain how interactions with the <em>o</em>-phenylene can alter its behavior. This model makes some important predictions for the project going forward, and in particular should allow us to design switchable systems where we can actively control the handedness.</p> <p>Second, we have studied how multiple <em>o</em>-phenylenes can be incorporated into large rings, called "macrocycles". This has the effect of orienting them in space, but more importantly it creates molecules with a defined interior that can be used to interact with other species, important for future applications in catalysis and sensing. When suitable <em>o</em>-phenylenes are combined with other compounds that can act as linkers, the macrocycles assemble spontaneously. We have focused on understanding the relationship between folding and this self-assembly. That is, how does the folded structure of an <em>o</em>-phenylene (or other foldamer) dictate what shape of macrocycle that will be formed, and what happens to the structure of the foldamer once it is confined within a larger structure? We have found that the combination of folding and assembly leads to new emergent behavior, with the <em>o</em>-phenylenes distorted, predictably, into otherwise inaccessible folding states.</p> <p>We have also developed a teaching lab activity for college students that teaches concepts of molecular assembly. In our lab, the students study the self-assembly of macrocycles from simple molecular building blocks, learning about both the synthesis and the characterization (structure elucidation) of these compounds. They explore structures using computational methods to determine how thermodynamics can be used to predict the outcome of many self-assembling systems.</p> <p>Over this funding period, the project trained research group members in many areas related to organic materials chemistry (e.g., synthesis, characterization methods).
