<AbstractNarration>This award provides funding  to help defray the expenses of participants in the "Summer School on Fractal Geometry and Complex Dimensions" that will be held June 14-22, 2016, on the campus of the California Polytechnic State University-San Luis Obispo.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The summer school will offer  three mini-courses aimed at introducing nonexperts to the frontiers of a range of topics, including the following: fractal geometry, dimension theory, complex dimensions, distance and tube zeta functions, and analysis on fractals topics. The organizers will lead a day of primer lectures and workshops (at an undergraduate level) preparing nonspecialist participants for the plenary lectures and aforementioned mini-courses. The selected topics include geometry of fractal subsets of the real line and of higher dimensional Euclidean spaces, complex dimensions and zeta functions, analytic number theory, and analysis on fractals with connections to geometric measure theory, quasicrystals and noncommutative geometry, stochastic processes, and thermodynamic formalism. The event allows for plenary lectures (90 minutes) from well-known experts, short research communications, poster sessions, and discussion sessions. The summer school will place special emphasis on preparing undergraduate students for further research in mathematics (independently or at later activities, like REUs).</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The 2016 Summer School on Fractal Geometry and Complex Dimensions convened in San Luis Obispo from June 21 to June 29 and drew 103 participants. Among them were researchers from 12 foreign countries, many under-represented minorities, postdoctoral researchers, graduate students, and undergraduates students.  The first day of the conference featured activities designed to teach basic concepts in fractal geometry to students and newcomers to the area. The remaining days included three minicourses on core topics in active research areas (fractal geometry and complex dimensions, quasicrystals, and analysis on fractals). There were also a large number of research communications and special sessions, as well as a poster session. Materials from the minicourses and most presentations can be freely accessed at http://www.calpoly.edu/~epearse/Fractals2016/presentations.html.  In addition, there were two public lectures by internally renowned academics:   Fractal Transformations by Michael Barnsley (Australian National University, Australia);  Why should one define a Laplacian by Uta Freiberg (Universit&auml;t Stuttgart, Germany).  Both talks were attended by over 100 members of the general public.  A proceedings volume to complement the event is in preparation; it has been approved by the American Mathematical Society and is due to appear in their "Contemporary Mathematics" series, with a target completion date of Summer 2017.
