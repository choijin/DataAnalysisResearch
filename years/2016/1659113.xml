<AbstractNarration>This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) program at Grand Valley State University will provide talented undergraduate students from across the nation with first-hand, experiential knowledge of the process of conducting mathematical research. Over the course of eight weeks each summer, eight undergraduate students will engage in mathematical research on an interesting, original, and mathematically significant topic selected by a faculty mentor. Topics will be chosen from geometry, combinatorics, graph theory, dynamical systems, voting theory, and algebra. Research results may have applications in national security, political science, and industry. These experiences will enable participants to make an informed decision about pursuing a career as a mathematician.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the program, faculty mentors will also work to enhance students' written and verbal communication skills and build a community of scholars. Students are expected to present their findings several times over the summer. Projects funded by prior REUs at Grand Valley State University have resulted in prize-winning posters and numerous award-winning student talks at national meetings of mathematicians, and at least 26 published or accepted papers in peer-reviewed journals. Most of the alumni of the previous REUs choose to attend (or have attended) graduate school in mathematics or a closely related field. These students report that the REU had an impact on their choice to pursue a career in mathematics or a related field. The nonacademic career choices of program alumni include software engineering, working for the National Security Administration, and financial engineering.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This grant funded a Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) program at Grand Valley State University in Allendale, MI during the summers of 2017, 2018, and 2019.  For eight weeks each summer, eight students from institutions across the United States worked in pairs with four faculty mentors, conducting original research.  Of the 24 total participants, half (12) identify as male, and half (12) as female.   The team investigated a variety of topics in pure and applied mathematics.  For example, a 2019 team of researchers proved that picture accompanying this article is an optimally dense packing of 3 circles (two small ? one green and one blue -- and one large ? red --with radius ratio of Sqrt(2)-1) on a surface called a flat torus. We can also prove that it is the densest way to pack those circles with that radius ratio on any flat torus.  In addition to conducting research, participants also received training and mentoring to improve their oral and written communication skills.  All participants presented their work locally, at a statewide conference, and at MathFest, the national summer meetings of the Mathematical Association of America (MAA). (MathFest was held in Chicago, IL in 2017, Denver, CO in 2018, and Cincinnati, OH in 2019.)  In addition, one student presented his work at the 2019 Joint Mathematics Meetings in Baltimore, MD and won an award for his outstanding poster.    Participants have also won numerous awards for their presentations at MathFest. At MathFest in 2017, three groups of student researchers won awards for their presentations. The titles of their talks were ?Equal Circle Packing on Flat Klein Bottles?,? Anti-Games on Steiner Triple Systems?, and ?Generalized Catalan Numbers?.  At MathFest in 2018, again three research groups won outstanding presentation awards.

Finally, at MathFest 2019, two groups won outstanding presentation awards from the MAA. The titles of their talks were ?Bipartite Graphs, Edge Coverings, and Line Segments Defined by Sets? and ?Mathematical Analysis of Random Sample Voting?.    After the summer of research, many program participants have continued to work with their mentors to prepare manuscripts for publication in peer-reviewed journals.  Several papers about the research have either been submitted or are in preparation.  While many of the 2017-2019 REU participants are still completing their undergraduate studies, others have gone on to enroll in graduate programs in mathematics (or related fields) or take mathematical jobs in industry.  Currently, the 2017 and 2018 alumni of the program are enrolled in mathematics graduate school at Cornell University, University of Oregon, Michigan State University (two students), University of Pennsylvania, and Boston University.  A 2018 alumna is pursuing a master?s degree in Data Science at University of Alabama-Birmingham and two other alumnae are working in industry (at Cisco Systems and Northrop Grumman).  In summary, the Summer Mathematics REU at Grand Valley State University provided 24 undergraduate students an opportunity to conduct original research in mathematics and to present their work in various local, state, and national venues.  These students won numerous awards for their research, and many have gone on to graduate school in mathematics (or related fields) and industry.  The research from this REU has practical applications to problems such as designing voting systems.           Last Modified: 10/15/2019       Submitted by: William C Dickinson]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
