<AbstractNarration>Nearly a century of fire prevention and suppression in the United States has resulted, counterintuitively, in larger, more frequent wildfires with negative impacts on natural, cultural, and recreational resources. In response, new research focuses on alternative ways to manage the lasting effects of fire, rather than prevent it. To understand the role of fire in modern ecosystems, the long-term history of human influence on fire regimes and biome productivity must be considered. Archaeological and paleoecological research demonstrates that humans have intentionally set fires for millennia to transform the arrangement and diversity of resources within their landscape, with global consequences for terrestrial and atmospheric systems. Anthropogenic fire, meaning fire intentionally set and controlled by humans, has played a vital role in transforming and maintaining agricultural landscapes. Consequently, the beginning of agriculture often coincides with changes in fire frequency and vegetation communities. This project combines multi-dimensional research on anthropogenic burning with archaeological measures of prehistoric agricultural land-use to investigate the origins and evolution of Neolithic (7,700-4,500 cal. BP) agricultural landscapes in three case study areas in eastern Spain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work integrates new field and laboratory methods, quantitative models of wildfire and its ecological effects, and an "off-site" archaeological perspective to study the impacts of anthropogenic fire on the human and environmental aspects of ancient agricultural landscapes. The Mediterranean landscape is uniquely suited to investigate prehistoric anthropogenic fire due to its long-term history of agricultural land-use, infrequent naturally caused fires, and fire-sensitive ecosystems. This research encourages international collaboration between archaeologists and fire scientists with implications for long-term management of similar fire-prone ecosystems around the world, including southern California, coastal South Africa, southern Australia, and the entirety of the Mediterranean Basin. Fieldwork for this project is conducted in collaboration with American and Spanish archaeologists, paleoecologists, and fire scientists. This diverse, international team combines multiple perspectives on the role of anthropogenic fire in forest ecosystem function, maintenance, and sustainability. Laboratory work conducted at Arizona State University also provides scientific training and mentorship to undergraduate students studying archaeology, paleoecology, and fire science.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The recent emergence of global megafires has made it imperative to better understand the role of humans in altering the size, distribution, and seasonality of fires. The dynamic relationship between humans and fire is not a recent phenomenon; rather, fire has deep roots in our biological and cultural evolution. Because of its long-term perspective, archaeology is uniquely positioned to investigate the social and ecological drivers behind anthropogenic fire. However, the field faces challenges in creating solution-oriented research for managing fire in the future. This dissertation project facilitated new methods and approaches to archaeological data that enable us to interpret humans' long-term influences on fire regimes. By weaving together human niche construction theory and ecological resilience, new connections between archaeology, paleoecology, and fire ecology emerge.  The principal research goals of this project were addressed through three, stand-alone studies, which illustrate the usefulness of new methods and theoretical perspectives for charting changes in land-use, fire-regimes, and vegetation communities during the Neolithic Transition (7600 - 3800 cal. BP) in eastern Spain. In the first study, archaeological survey data is analyzed using Bayesian methods to extract land-use intensities from mixed surface assemblages from a case study in the Canal de Navarres region. This work points to changing patterns of land-use throughout study area, with an intensification and concentration of occupation during the Late Neolithic period (4500-3800 cal. BP). The second study builds on the archaeological data collected to create a computational model of landscape fire, charcoal dispersion, and deposition to test how multiple models of natural and anthropogenic fire activity contributed to the formation a single sedimentary charcoal dataset from the Canal de Navarres.

With global fire activity on the rise, it is vital to incorporate perspectives on the origins, development, and maintenance of human-fire relationships to effectively manage fire in today's coupled social- ecological landscapes.
