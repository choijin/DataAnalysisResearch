<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ From 2016-2019, the PI was funded by an NSF Mathematical Sciences Postdoctoral Research Fellowship (MSPRF). The research focused on Bridgeland stability, derived categories, and their application to the study of algebraic varieties, geometric spaces that are the solution sets to systems of polynomial equations.  Algebraic varieties play a prominent role throughout mathematics, and can be studied using different tools.  The PI used techniques from commutative algebra and homological algebra to study algebraic varieties, resulting in three journal articles, and one preprint.  In addition, two manuscripts containing work from the funded period are in preparation.       The first main contribution of the PI's supported research was to the foundations of the theory of Bridgeland stability conditions, a tool for studying algebraic varieties.  Bridgeland's original motivation was to mathematically formulate Douglas's Pi-stability in string theory.  The set of Bridgeland stability conditions on (the derived category of coherent sheaves of) an algebraic variety forms a finite dimensional complex manifold that is believed to provide the right tool for relating Kontsevich's homological mirror symmetry to classical mirror symmetry in string theory.   Bridgeland stability has revolutionized our understanding of both derived categories in general and coherent sheaves and their moduli spaces in particular.     Nevertheless, because of the subtle, categorical nature of Bridgeland's definition it was a mystery how to apply Bridgeland stability to the study of families of algebraic varieties.  One of algebraic geometry’s greatest strengths is its ability to study objects of interest in families, but for some time it was unclear how to formulate Bridgeland stability to work in this relative setting.  Along with collaborators, the PI succeeded in developing such a relative version of Bridgeland stability that is robust enough to ensure proper relative moduli stacks (with proper good moduli spaces in characteristic 0) in a wide range of situations.  For example, they applied their theory to solve some unresolved problems about cubic fourfolds, as well as to prove the deformation invariance of some important numerical invariants related to string theory.  Since then, a number of other authors have applied their work in a variety of different directions, from studying hyperK&auml;hler manifolds to using the spreading out technique to apply characteristic p methods.     A second main direction of the supported research was the application of Bridgeland stability to study algebraic varieties via their moduli spaces of stable sheaves, which are new algebraic varieties that shed light on the original one.       In one application, Yoshioka and the PI developed a general tool to use wall-crossing in the manifold of Bridgeland stability conditions to study the (birational) geometry of these moduli spaces.  They applied this tool to study the Enriques surface case.  This was inaccessible by previous techniques which depended heavily on the very specific geometry of those cases.  The PI’s forthcoming preprint contains similar results obtained using this tool in the case of bielliptic surfaces.  These were the final family of Kodaira dimension zero surfaces to be unexplored.     In a second application, appearing in a forthcoming preprint with Coskun and Yoshioka, the PI applied wall-crossing in the Bridgeland stability manifold to determine the cohomology of any stable sheaf on a K3 surface, where both are generic in their respective moduli spaces.  This is part of a higher rank, higher dimensional generalization of the classical Brill-Noether theorem for curves, which was of monumental importance.  A corollary of their  result was a classification of Ulrich bundles on generic K3 surfaces, an important question in Boij-S&ouml;derberg theory.  Using far more classical techniques, Borisov and the PI studied Ulrich bundles on generic Enriques surfaces early during the supported research.  Their work inspired a number of articles by others studying a conjecture they formulated.     Finally, in a different direction, the PI and collaborators developed a new technique for extending equivalences along semiorthogonal decompositions of a derived category.  They then applied it to prove a Derived Torelli Theorem for Enriques surfaces, which shows that an Enriques surface is uniquely determined by a certain smaller component of its derived category.  In addition, they applied this technique to prove a conjecture of Ingalls and Kuznetsov about Artin-Mumford double solids.       During the duration of NSF funding, the PI co-organized two conferences on Bridgeland stability, moduli spaces, and applications.  The PI also mentored two graduate students in their research, one of whom was from an outside institution.  The PI gave lectures at conferences and seminars both in the US and abroad.
