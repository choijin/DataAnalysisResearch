<AbstractNarration>In this project funded by the Chemical Synthesis Program, Professor Andrei Kutateladze of the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at University of Denver develops new methods for the synthesis of complex organic heterocycles.  These are substances which contain nitrogen in a ring, a common feature of natural products and pharmaceuticals. New synthetic routes are primarily based on novel cycloaddition reactions initiated by ultraviolet light. Complex multi-ring heterocyclic molecular architectures are accessed and alkaloid mimics are synthesized.  Fundamental new science includes the development of cascade photoreactions to form multiple chemical bonds in one experimentally simple step.  In addition, this award supports research experiences for undergraduate and graduate students, especially those from historically underrepresented groups in science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research expands the excited state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) based synthetic photochemistry tool box with new photoassisted cascade methodology.  New reactions provide access to complex polyheterocyclic compounds in a controlled atom- and step-economical fashion.  The mechanism of these cascade processes, including quantum mechanical tunneling at the hydrogen transfer step, is elucidated to better modulate stereochemical and regiochemical outcomes. Such control is needed to develop the capability of systematically screening the chemical space in search of novel polyheterocyclic molecular architectures with the requisite scaffold diversity. To further grow scaffold complexity and diversity and to decorate the core scaffolds with additional functional groups and heterocyclic pendants, experimentally simple postphotochemical steps are deployed after the light-induced transformation. This experimental work is accompanied by the development of computational methods for fast and accurate predictions of NMR spectra, which is critical for success of this project, but also has broader implications for structure elucidation of complex synthetic and natural organic molecules.  Additionally, this research provides hands-on laboratory training for graduate and undergraduate students, especially those from historically underrepresented groups in science.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In this project Professor Andrei Kutateladze of the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at University of Denver develops new methods for the synthesis of complex organic heterocycles.  These are substances which contain nitrogen in a ring.  They are important and ubiquitous in many areas of chemical sciences, from materials science to medicinal chemistry. In our work, new synthetic routes to these complex molecules are developed, which are primarily based on novel elaborate cycloaddition reactions initiated by ultraviolet light. Complex polyheterocyclic molecular architectures are accessed and alkaloid mimics are synthesized, which possess potential therapeutic properties. The crowning achievement of this work is the development of several cascade photoreactions to form multiple chemical bonds in one experimentally simple step.  This allows for the use of simple renewable chemical feedstock as starting point for synthesis of very complex molecules possessing useful properties.  As complexity of these synthesized molecules increases, it becomes increasingly more challenging to determine their structure. To that end, fundamentally important efforts were directed at facilitating solution structure elucidation of these polyheterocycles and other complex organic molecules, including important classes of natural products found in nature.  This is achieved by development of a theoretical/computational method, DU8+, to predict nuclear magnetic resonance properties of complex molecules in order to accurately identify their molecular structure.  This is a very challenging task for large organic molecules, but it is critically important to accurately determine molecular structures because useful properties of such molecules, especially potential therapeutics or modern materials, depend on molecular structure.  Our newly developed method, DU8+, allows for accurate calculations of nuclear magnetic resonance spectra obtained in deuterated chloroform, facilitating molecular structure elucidation.  One of the most important broader impacts of this grant is the training of the next generation of practitioners in the field of organic chemistry. This NSF support allowed for the training of three graduate students, three research associates (partially supported on this grant) and a number of undergraduate students, especially those from historically underrepresented groups in science.  The multifaceted nature of this project allowed for training opportunities on a broad range of research skills.   All participants were exposed to a classical synthetic chemistry research.  In addition, all of them received training in photochemical and photophysical techniques: running photochemical reactions in batch and flow modes; determining relative quantum yields by irradiating samples in carousel photoreactors, determining isotope effects on photochemical quantum yields, elucidating complex molecular structures with sophisticated NMR experiments and theoretical/computational analysis.  Another important area of broader impacts emerging from this grant is in the increased availability of complex polyheterocyclic molecular architectures for other disciplines and scientific fields, from materials science to drug design and discovery.   The search for novel complexity-building reactions assisted by light continues.  This is an ongoing program.
