<AbstractNarration>This research project will explore how and why the small self-view window (a window with a live video feed of oneself in the corner of the screen) in video-mediated communication (such as Skype) can affect people's disclosure of sensitive information during survey interviews.  In an earlier study, respondents in the self-view condition disclosed more socially undesirable (that is, more embarrassing) behaviors and perceived the interview to be less sensitive.  This project will expand on earlier research by tracking where survey respondents look on the screen while answering sensitive questions via video. Examining gaze patterns and how they might differ for different respondents or questions will provide a basis for understanding why people disclose more and find the interview less sensitive with a self-view window.  The findings will increase understanding about how nonverbal behaviors correlate with disclosure.  Video-mediated interviewing is a potentially cost-effective mode of data collection that could facilitate the collection of policy-relevant data on some hard-to-reach populations.  The data collected may be useful for informing the design of new video-based data-collection interfaces.  Project results will be presented at conferences and publication venues that maximize impact across several disciplines. As a Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement award, support is provided to enable a promising student to establish a strong, independent research career.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Video-mediated interviewing offers a unique combination of features that differ from those in other face-to-face or audio interactions, including the ability to see oneself in a self-view window. This research project will compare the responses and gaze patterns of adult participants interviewed in a controlled laboratory setting over Skype.  The experiment will use a set of sensitive and non-sensitive questions from U.S. government and social scientific surveys.  Respondents will be randomly assigned either to a self-view (respondents can see themselves and the interviewer) or no self-view (respondents can see only the interviewer) condition.  Measures of gaze will be recorded using an unobtrusive eye-tracking system.  The data will be analyzed to determine when and how often self-view respondents look at the images of themselves, whether respondents who disclose more look at the self-view more, and how gaze location, duration, and frequency of glances differ for sensitive vs. neutral questions and for less socially desirable answers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In videomediated survey interviews, how does the small self-view window alter what respondents disclose and where they look?  In this laboratory study, 133 adult participants were randomly assigned to answer questions from US government and social scientific surveys over Skype, either with a self-view window (respondents could see themselves and the interviewer) or without a self-view window (respondents could only see the interviewer).  The survey questions included both nonsensitive topics (e.g., reading novels, watching television news) and sensitive topics (e.g., sexual behaviors, alcohol use).  During the interviews, an unintrusive eye-tracking device tracked where respondents looked&mdash;at the interviewer, at the self-view window, or away from the screen&mdash;allowing analyses of how gaze location and duration differed for sensitive vs. nonsensitive questions and for more and less socially desirable answers.   Respondents with a self-view window reported more socially undesirable behaviors (more sexual partners and more alcohol use), and they reported finding the interview less sensitive. They also reported having thought more about what they said (arguably reflecting increased self-awareness). This pattern replicates prior lab findings that the self-view window can promote greater disclosure of sensitive information.  As for gaze patterns, self-view respondents&mdash;unlike the non-self-view respondents&mdash;looked more at the interviewer during questions about sensitive than nonsensitive topics, and they averted their gaze more (looking away from the screen entirely) when giving socially undesirable answers. Contrary to the possibility that the self-view window might increase self-consciousness, respondents who looked more at the self-view window reported greater comfort and less self-consciousness.  Respondents (with and without a self-view window) were more likely to look away from the screen when giving socially undesirable responses, as were respondents who reported greater concerns about self-presentation (how they looked or that they were being watched).  These findings demonstrate that gaze patterns can be informative about respondents? experience and response processes, and that the self-view window creates a distinct interactional dynamic, increasing respondents? engagement with the interviewer and reducing self-presentation concerns. The findings thus increase understanding of the extent to which new communication technologies like Skype, each of which has particular affordances and constraints, constitute manipulations that have significant and not-yet-fully-understood psychological effects.  In a practical sense, the findings may inform computer and information scientists as they design interviewing systems of the future, and as researchers&mdash;for example, those who collect influential policy-relevant data about society (e.g., health, employment, crime) and those who collect clinical data&mdash;work to reach people who are currently hard to reach: people with limited mobility, people who are geographically distant, people who might find an in-person interview too intrusive, and people who are unwilling to engage in interviews via traditional modes.
