<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award: DMS 1611786, Principal Investigator: Mark J. Behrens&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project aims to address major problems in the field of algebraic topology.  Topology is the study of geometry (in any number of dimensions) where you identify one geometric object with another if one can be deformed into the other.  The goal of algebraic topology is to ascribe discrete algebraic invariants to these geometric objects to distinguish their topological types.  In this way, distinguishing geometric objects is reduced to algebraic computations.  Such algebraic computations are desirable, because they can be handled by a computer, for example.  An early success of algebraic topology was the classification of all possible surfaces (2-dimensional objects) by means of Euler characteristic (a number, defined by Euler in the 18th century) and orientability (e.g., a Mobius strip is nonorientable). By contrast, the situation in higher dimensions is much more intractable, and is the subject of active research.  Understanding the topological type of geometric objects is a fundamental act of scientific/mathematical inquiry, comparable to the study of prime numbers, or the classification of the fundamental particles that constitute matter and carry forces.  However, there are also important applications of algebraic topology. We live in a 3-dimensional universe (4-dimensions if you include time).  What is the shape of this universe?  Addressing this question requires a working knowledge of the possible shapes in 3 or 4 dimensions. The fundamental interactions of matter and forces in particle physics is governed by quantum field theory.  The global behavior of the partition functions of such theories involves topological considerations.  Such considerations are impossible to avoid in the context of string theory, as a moving string traces out a surface.  Topological computations have recently been applied to solve problems in solid state physics.  Also, data involving the interrelation of a large number of variables naturally traces out a high dimensional geometric object in a higher dimensional space.  The study of such data-sets using algebraic topology is the subject of the new and active field of topological data analysis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The specific projects proposed are aimed at shedding light on many problems in algebraic topology surrounding the homotopy groups of spheres, chromatic homotopy theory, and topological modular forms (tmf).  The principal investigator (PI) and his collaborators will engage in a project to develop the tmf-based Adams Spectral Sequence to the point where it can be actually used for calculations.  The classical Adams spectral sequence has succeeded in computing the first 60 stable stems.  We expect that since tmf is a much more sensitive cohomology theory, when properly developed, its associated Adams spectral sequence could push these computations into the 90s, which would shed light on the only remaining case of the Kervaire Invariant Problem, in dimension 126. The PI also plans on using the tmf-based Adams spectral sequence to investigate the Telescope Conjecture at chromatic level 2.  Unstable homotopy will also be studied through the chromatic lens, using a generalization of Quillen-Sullivan rational homotopy theory based on topological Andre-Quillen cohomology.  Computations in stable homotopy theory at generic primes using ultra-filters will be investigated using Drinfeld Modules. The Chromatic Splitting Conjecture will be investigated using Goodwillie calculus.  The PI will also study the conjectural relationship between the Ochanine genus, topological modular forms, and smooth structures on loop spaces of spheres.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The PI completed a variety of research projects related to chromatic stable and unstable homotopy theory, as well as in the areas of equivariant and motivic homotopy theory.  Chromatic homotopy theory computes homotopy groups by assembling periodic data.  Equivariant homotopy theory studies the homotopy theory of spaces with symmatry, and motivic homotopy theory studies the homotopy theory of spaces which are the solutions of polynomial equations.  The PI's work with his collaborators on chromatic homotopy theory was focused largely on understanding computational techniques where cohomology theories, which are straightforward to compute, were used to access stable homotopy groups, which are computationally harder to access, but which contain deeper information. Stable homotopy groups themselves are a more computable variant of unstable homotopy groups, and the PI also developed, with Charles Rezk, a method of extending stable chromatic computations to the unstable setting.  The stable computations were used by the PI and his collaborators to show that in dimensions less than 140, in all but a few dimensions the sphere admits exotic smooth structures.  With Dylan Wilson, the PI showed that equivariant cohomology for spaces with an involution can be constructed from an equivariant double loop space, and with Jay Shah, the PI showed that the stable homotopy groups of a space with involution can be accessed directly from homotopy groups in the case where the space is given by the complex solutions of systems of polynomials with real coefficients, and the involution is given by complex conjugation.  During the period of this grant the PI published 6 reseach articles on the reseach described above, and has submitted one article which is still being refereed.  The PI also wrote two survey articles - one on unstable chromatic homotopy theory, and one on topological automorphic forms, to make these areas more accessable.  The PI has advised 10 grad students during the period of this grant, many of which benefitted from support from this grant.  Four of these students earned Ph.D's, and the rest are still progressing toward their dissertation.  The PI coorganized an undergraduate summer workshop in geometry and topology in each summer 2017-2019, and an annual bridge program for incoming graduate students.  During the periodic of this grant the PI coorganized 7 conferences and workshops.             Last Modified: 01/13/2021       Submitted by: Mark J Behrens]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
