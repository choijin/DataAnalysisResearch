<AbstractNarration>This project will enable Kent State University to acquire a benchtop X-Ray Diffractometer (XRD) that will allow geoscientists to integrate environmental research and undergraduate teaching. XRD is a mission critical technique for multiple disciplines within geology. In one project the XRD will be used to study acid mine drainage at the Huff Run Watershed, which is located less than one hour from the Kent State campus and readily accessible for field trips and research. Students will collect their own samples and then use the XRD to identify soil mineralogy as a function of depth across the weathering front. In a study of the geochemistry of tundra and boreal ecosystems, the XRD will be used to quantify the abundance of crystalline iron phases in the bulk soils. The research conducted using the instrument will be of direct benefit to society through insights into mineralogical and geochemical processes that affect remediation of contaminated land and water. The skills learned by undergraduates operating this instrument will be valuable training for entering a wide range of jobs after graduating.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The acquisition of a benchtop X-ray Diffractometer (XRD) by Kent State University will further research in the interactions between minerals, water, and biota within the "Critical Zone" that supports life. The XRD will support research and education in Environmental Mineralogy and Geochemistry in order to better evaluate human impacts on Critical Zone processes. The XRD is an efficient and effective method for identifying soil mineralogy as a function of depth across the weathering front and metal release into soil water. The XRD will support ongoing research projects that include: (1) mineral weathering and metal cycling in ecosystems developed on coal mine waste; (2) coupled manganese-carbon interactions in soil environments; and (3) metal and nutrient cycling in climate-sensitive tundra and boreal ecosystems; and (4) the formation of unconventional hydrocarbon deposits in shale.  Measurements made with the XRD will be incorporated into class laboratory projects for a range of undergraduate classes. Its portability allows it to be moved to different laboratories and classrooms and undergraduates can be trained to use the instrument to collect and analyze data within an hour. Most geology, materials science, and engineering industry jobs require the ability to characterize solid phases by XRD.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The primary goal of this project was to purchase a new X-ray diffractometer in order to facilitate multiple research projects currently led by the PIs. The improved capabilities have generated new understanding of the geochemical and physical properties of earth materials in human-perturbed landscapes. X-ray diffraction (XRD) is a mission critical technique for multiple disciplines within Geology. We have replaced our aging X-ray diffractometer with a Rigaku MiniFlex 600 Benchtop X-ray Diffraction System, representing a very significant upgrade in data collection and processing capabilities. XRD is an efficient and effective method for determining the mineral composition of geologic samples. Analyses are performed by comparing diffraction peak positions and intensity values of unknown samples with the reference patterns of known compounds. Subsequent analyses, including quantitative analysis of identified phases, are easily accomplished. There were three major goals during the grant period: (1) install and setup the XRD; (2) determine changes in the mineral composition of soils in anthropogenically impacted environments; and (3) train students in classroom settings and through independent investigations. Research topics included soils impacted by acid mine drainage from historic coal mine waste, and urban soils contaminated with lead (Pb) and other toxic elements.</p> <p>Major research findings based on data collected on the new XRD include the following: (1) the source of lead (Pb) contamination in an urban soil in Cleveland, Ohio was determined to be from historic industrial waste, due to the presence of discreet particles of Pb-bearing Fe(III)-(oxy)hydroxides; (2) the composition of a coal shale, which is the source of acid mine drainage (AMD) due to the presence of historic and abandoned mine waste was dominated by quartz, kaolinite, muscovite, and pyrite; and (3) Pyrite, the source of AMD, is mobilized from soils as colloids and the presence of these particles may explain why there is a &lsquo;slow bleed&rsquo; of AMD discharge into the watershed despite cessation of mining activities decades ago.</p> <p>The Rigaku Miniflex has become integral to our research and teaching program.
