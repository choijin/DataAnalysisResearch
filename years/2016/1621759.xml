<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project seeks to refine, broaden and characterize a new family of optical chemosensor dyes designed for real-time monitoring and control of heavy-metal concentrations in industrial wastewater discharge. This will allow metal platers, metal finishers, circuit board manufacturers, ink manufacturers, and a multitude of other businesses that discharge heavy metal waste, the capability to reduce treatment costs by an average of 25% to 40%.  At the same time, this technology will assist in improving compliance with discharge limits defined by the Environmental Protection Agency's Clean Water Act and by local regulatory agencies. This would in turn reduce toxic metal treatment costs at downstream municipal wastewater treatment plants. It is estimated from market surveys that at least 15,000 businesses in the United States are potential customers for such a system.  The global market in this vertical is estimated to be at least $2 billion.  In addition, many other market segments, such as defense and homeland security, could potentially use these chemosensor arrays to permit accurate detection of heavy metals in real-world conditions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this project is that it further develops and evaluates a family of chemosensor dyes that are inherently stable over time and can be used for continuous, real-time, heavy-metal monitoring in wastewater treatment processes with detection limits relevant to environmental regulations. Earlier work demonstrated that sets of several of these dyes have significant promise to accurately and continuously measure the concentration of specific metals in wastewater effluent. To quantify each metal ion of interest, the output of multiple dyes is analyzed to provide accurate identification of specific metals.  Rigid attachment to the sensing platform allows for longer-term deployment.  Specifically, this project intends to demonstrate and evaluate the response of a sensor array to several heavy metals identified, based on customer surveys, as the primary analytical needs of the wastewater industry. This effort will include the quantification of relevant metal ions and an evaluation of the stability of those measurements over time in several flow systems which will be assembled.  A viable sensing platform prototype is envisioned at the end of a successful project.  Moving forward, further dyes can be added to allow quantification of other metals over the concentration ranges of interest, with minimal interference.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Bruce Bathurst (PI) resolved to find a way to continuously measure the concentration of dissolved heavy metals in real time.  Businesses are required by environmental regulations to remove heavy metals from wastewater, and the commercial driver for this new technological advance was to enable businesses to automate removal of toxins, reduce operational costs, and lower the risk of inadvertent pollution events and regulatory notices of violation.  Mr. Bathurst collaborated with Dr. Alan Schwabacher and Dr. Peter Geissinger, both with the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, with five specific goals in mind:  1. Create a broad family of long lasting chemosensors with specific sensitivities to metals, 2. Permanently bond those sensors to a substrate in a way such that metal sensitivity remained, 3. Build a predictive model that could be used to convert raw data from multiple sensors into specific concentrations of multiple metals, 4. Test sensor performance in real-world conditions where wastewater is continuously flowing, and 5. Transfer the sensor technology from the research lab to a manufacturing business.   All five of these goals were successfully accomplished.  Preliminary data indicates that this new chemosensor technology has the potential to provide measurement accuracy comparable to that provided by the lab standard, atomic absorption spectroscopy. Although accurate measurement is of key importance, the true value of the technology is that it can be used for continuous measurement, making it the only technology in today?s marketplace that can be employed for automatic and precise process treatment control.  A broad array of metals was evaluated including zinc, cadmium, cobalt, chromium, lead, copper, iron, magnesium, manganese, mercury, nickel, tin, calcium, potassium, and aluminum.  All of them were successfully measured by the new chemosensors, which can continually detect specific metals in concentrations from approximately 5 to 200,000 parts per billion. Initial tests indicate that the sensors will last for six months to one year in flowing wastewater in real-world conditions.  It has also been demonstrated that this new family of chemosensor films can be expanded to continuously measure additional metals and other analytes that today can only be measured in the lab with sampling techniques.  Continuous measurement and real-time control of toxins are expected to significantly reduce waste treatment costs and the risk of regulatory violations.  Effectively controlling toxic discharge 24 hours per day, as opposed to the current methods of infrequent sampling and adjustment, will, over time, improve real-world environmental conditions.  Based on the positive results of the project, investors have formed AquaMetals, LLC to develop a commercially available product line of water quality analyzers from prototypes built during Phase I research.
