<AbstractNarration>One defining characteristic of humans is their unusually cooperative nature, which is unparalleled among animals. An important goal for anthropology is to understand the nature and evolution of this "altruistic" behavior. This doctoral dissertation project will investigate cooperative exchanges among free-ranging rhesus macaques in order to test predictions from several competing evolutionary hypotheses about altruism. Studying cooperative exchanges among rhesus macaques will provide a comparative model for understanding the behavioral evolution of humans and our ancestors. The broader impacts of this project include the support of science education and outreach, through valuable field experience for research assistants, data analysis experience for undergraduates, and presentation of research results in various public formats, including local zoos and conferences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study will observe grooming interactions among 50 adult female rhesus macaques from three social groups at Cayo Santiago, Puerto Rico, using focal animal sampling methodology, for eleven months (spanning both mating and birth seasons). Specifically, the project will examine how well reciprocal grooming exchanges resemble those predicted by several competing theoretical hypotheses (kin selection, reciprocal altruism, biological markets theory, and social bond investment), in one comprehensive and integrated analysis, via AIC model ranking. These exchanges will be examined across multiple time scales and across groups of variable sizes. Additionally, there will be a more detailed investigation of biological markets theory. By focusing on exchanges of grooming for mates or infant handling, this study will test a key prediction that such exchanges conform to supply and demand relationships. The extent to which apparent supply and demand relationships may be artifacts of, or mediated by, stress responses will be examined, with stress measured both behaviorally and via fecal glucocorticoid metabolite assays.</AbstractNarration>

Therefore, one important goal for anthropology is understanding the nature and evolution of altruism. Like humans, rhesus macaques (<em>Macaca mulatta</em>) rely on cooperation to navigate their social world. This project investigated cooperative exchanges among free-ranging Cayo Santiago rhesus macaques, specifically by examining grooming for infant handling exchanges and time matching behavior when grooming was reciprocally exchanged for itself.

Supply and demand relationships have inconsistently been found to operate in grooming for infant handling exchanges in other primate species, such that grooming durations provided by handlers to mothers decrease as the availability of infants in the group increases. It is unclear whether market conditions are solely responsible for this relationship, or whether maternal stress levels are also involved.&nbsp; While increases in grooming when commodities become scarce may indicate market effects, they may also be byproducts of increased attention and/or harassment towards mothers of scarce infants. Grooming could serve as a benign signal of intent or even function to de-stress commodity holders. We hypothesized that stress may serve as a mechanism mediating the appearance of supply and demand. While we did find evidence for supply and demand operating in the grooming for infant handling exchanges among rhesus macaques, we found no evidence that stress impacts this relationship. We measured stress both behaviorally and physiologically, and found no relationship between maternal stress levels and infant availability. Finding evidence for supply and demand in the absence of stress effects is an important finding, as it highlights a major similarity between primate and human market exchanges, which do not characteristically involve mediation by stress.</p> <p>Our investigations of reciprocal grooming exchanges provide the first evidence for short-term time matching in rhesus macaques. As with the appearance of supply and demand, conclusions about time matching also vary across species. Generally, researchers focus on the duration of pauses between grooming episodes that involve a switch in partner roles and choose a cut-off point to distinguish short from longer term reciprocation. Problematically, researchers have made inconsistent choices about these cut-offs. Such inconsistencies are potentially concerning, as it is unclear whether resulting inconsistent conclusions about short-term time matching are attributable to species and/or ecological differences, or are due partly to methodological inconsistency. We investigated whether various criteria for distinguishing short from long-term reciprocation influence conclusions about short-term time matching, by comparing several commonly used cut-offs to ones generated by the currently preferred approach of survival analysis. While most cut-offs yielded similar degrees of time matching as the one derived from survival analysis, very short ones significantly underestimated both the degree of time matching and the influence of rank distance on time matching.
