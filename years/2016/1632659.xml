<AbstractNarration>The proposed four-day interdisciplinary workshop on "The Great Plains: An Environmental History" will be hosted by the University of Oklahoma in May 2017. This interdisciplinary workshop will explore the environmental history of the North American Great Plains from western Texas to southern Canada. This workshop will enhance interdisciplinary dialogue in environmental studies. It will expand academic knowledge of the Great Plains. The workshop will be free and open to the public.  It will be podcast and tweeted live. The published book will inform contemporary policy debates on the environment. It will explain why certain technologies succeed and others fail in regards to human habitation and resource management. It will provide an opportunity to members of the public to consider the Great Plains as a complex ecosystem that includes human interactions from a historical perspective.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposed interdisciplinary workshop will offer a scholars the opportunity to re-conceptualize the Great Plains from the perspective of technological adaptations rather than only ecological disasters. By exploring the elemental and persistent themes of water, grasses, animals, and energy, the workshop will discuss the complex ways in which shifting technologies sustained human life, advanced diverse societies, and altered human relations with the region's myriad ecologies. The workshop will integrate the perspectives and research methodologies of different fields to forge an analysis of the Great Plains at the intersection of environment, culture, and technology.  The workshop will involve scholars from environmental history, energy history, anthropology, geography, sociology, Native American studies, and environmental science, policy and management.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ With a generous Collaborative Research Workshop Grant from the NSF Science, Technology, and Society program, Kathleen Brosnan of the University of Oklahoma and Brian Frehner of the University of Missouri, Kansas City, convened a workshop on "The Great Plains: An Environmental History," from May 22-24, 2017 at the University of Oklahoma in Norman and at the Tallgrass Prairie Preserve in Pawhuska, Oklahoma.  The workshop also included guided tours of the Sam Noble Museum of Natural History and the Fred Jones, Jr. Museum of Art at the University and the Osage Nation Museum in Pawhuska.     The project focuses on the North American Great Plains from western Texas to southern Canada over the long dur&eacute;e of history, from pre-contact to twenty-first century commemoration. The project seeks a redefinition of region framed by technological adaptations rather than ecological disasters (i.e., the Dust Bowl) and built around the elemental and persistent themes of water, grasses, animals, and energy, illustrating how shifting technologies sustained human life, advanced diverse societies, and altered human relations with the region?s myriad ecologies.      Participants for the workshop were chosen in a two-step process. First, Brosnan and Frehner invited seven scholars to be included in the grant application. After the grant was awarded, Brosnan and Frehner posted a call for proposals in various locations. They selected ten more workshop participants from 29 applications.     The sixteen workshop participants represented the disciplines of anthropology, American studies, archaeology, ethnic and Native American studies, geography, and history, and included three graduate students in addition to more seasoned scholars. Participants came from the United States, Canada, and Germany.  University of Oklahoma faculty members in anthropology, geography, and history, as well as Brosnan and Frehner, offered comments on the papers presented at the workshop. Full drafts of participants? essays were pre-circulated while participants made briefer, 20-minute presentations at the workshop.     In advance of the workshop, the co-PIs, working with Brosnan?s research assistant, maintained a website where we posted various primary source materials used by the participants in their workshop papers as well as paper abstracts and biographical sketches.  We contacted high schools across Oklahoma, and worked with contacts at the Chickasaw Cultural Center, to insure we reached schools with significant Native American populations. We invited the schools to review primary source materials in advance of the workshop and then participate in a live stream of the workshop.

During our live stream, we had some 27 followers, although none chose to submit questions. Thus, it is not known how many students watched.  Unfortunately, the timing of the workshop, determined in part by the schedule of the participants, did not coincide well with the schedule for high schools nearing the end of their academic year.     Brosnan and Frehner divided the workshop into 8 panels:     Indigeneity and Mobility on the Plains  Perceptions of the Plains: Wind, Grass, and Animals  Indigenous Adaptations: The Long Dur&eacute;e  Understanding Indigenous People and Bison: Archaeology and Commemoration  Energy Resources and Infrastructure  Accounting for Animals in Borderlands Environments  Agriculture: Technology and Conservation  Twentieth-Century Food Production     Comments, discussions and debates at the workshop, as well as a wrap-up meeting with the co-PIs and participants, helped to give the larger project greater structure and cohesion with the identification of other themes that emerged during the workshop.  The participants used this feedback to revise their essays which are to be returned to Brosnan and Frehner by December 31, 2017, for editing. Brosnan and Frehner will co-edit the collection of essays to be published by the University of Oklahoma Press.
