<AbstractNarration>With the capacity ultra-broadband residential networks provide we have the opportunity to re-center our digital lives around our residence. This project develops the technology to fruitfully leverage the raw capacity of ultra-broadband residential networks to shift a residential user's digital hub to his or her residence. The project focuses on two themes. The first theme is centered around an appliance in homes -- a home point of presence -- that provides a variety of services to the users in the house regardless of where they are physically located and hence connected to the network. A base-level service is a 'data attic', or a single place for users to store all their information that leaves them in direct control over the use of their data. We introduce infrastructureless CDNs that aim to leverage homes with ultra-broadband connectivity to move us away from delivering content from large service providers and towards massively distributed delivery that is ultimately cheaper and faster. Our second theme involves monitoring the operational Case Connection Zone ultra-broadband fiber-to-the-home network to better understand how protocols and applications can be extended to work better in such high-speed residential settings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This re-structuring offers societal-scale benefits. Rather than spreading our digital lives across myriad services and providers across the Internet, we will enable individuals to retain control of their resources while at the same time sharing them with friends and trusted services, as needed and on demand. The advent of ultrabroadband residential networks facilitates this change, as individuals will now have the resources to serve their own data in a way they see fit, rather than being beholden to large service providers for the required resources.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project aimed to broadly investigate ultra-broadbandresidential networks.  Our inspiration and testbed for this projectwas the "Case Connection Zone" (CCZ)---which is an experimentalnetwork adjacent to Case Western Reserve University that provided aneighborhood of roughly 100 homes with bidirectional 1 Gbps networkconnectivity.  Our project progressed along two synergistic areas.First, we sought to empirically understand how users would leveragethe capacity provided in the CCZ, as well as how our protocols andsystems worked in such environments.  Our second thrust was todesign ways to use the bandwidth of ultra-broadband networks toimprove users' experiences in a number of ways (e.g., performance,security, robustness).  The first thrust of our project involved developing new networkmeasurement techniques, as well as monitoring an in-situultra-broadband network.  We developed techniques to determine"congestion signatures" or ways to understand where and howcontention for network capacity were presenting themselves in atvarious points in the network.  Additionally, we were able toquantify the performance, security and robustness of the Domain NameSystem's (DNS) operation.  The DNS turns human-readable names intolow-level "addresses" that are used to move traffic around thenetwork and as such the DNS has a significant role in nearly alltraffic traversing our networks.  We showed how concentrated---andtherefore fragile---the DNS system has become over time.Additionally, we were able to show that the performance of DNS doesnot have the dramatic impact previous lab-based work suggested.  Ourlargest contribution in this part of the project was a new way tothink about measurement: as part of protocols and not as an adjunctactivity.  Adjunct measurement has shown much benefit in theoperation of networks by showing large issues that can be fixed ortuned to improve future transactions.  However, by includingmeasurements directly in-band with real transactions we can assessthe network just as users experience it and, therefore, we can tuneprotocol and system operations in real-time to improve performancefor users.  The second component of this project involved re-thinking theoverall network organization to take advantage of a significantamount of capacity to peoples' homes.  Our contributions here werelargely focused on an appliance that users could install that wecalled a Home Point-of-Presence (HPoP).  The HPoP is effectively anagent that undertakes a wealth of tasks on the users' behalf.  As anexample, we investigated allowing the HPoP to not only cache, butrefresh DNS lookups.  For instance, once a user has interacted withsome web site like "www.nsf.gov"---using DNS to turn this name intoan address---the HPoP would continue to keep the address valid bylooking it up periodically without any effort on the part of theuser.  Then, the next time the user wishes to visit this site theHPoP can immediately provide the address without a (sometimescostly) lookup.  This allows us to use the network's capacity tomake users' experiences faster.  We have also used the HPoPframework to develop additional architectural foundations, such as(a) a system for increasing the trustworthiness of DNSlookups, (b) a data attic for providing personal file storage thatdoes not depend on traditional cloud providers and (c) a form acontent-distribution network among houses with ultra-broadbandconnectivity that does not depend on cloud-based infrastructure.  In addition to developing technology and writing papers as part ofthis project, we were able to help mentor a number of graduate andundergraduate students.  Further, we also released a dataset withroughly 604M DNS transactions over the course of nine years.  Thishas and will continue to enable the research community to study DNSin the context of ultra-broadband networks.       Last Modified: 04/30/2021       Submitted by: Mark Allman]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
