<AbstractNarration>A major goal in engineering of biological systems is to predictably reprogram the genetics of cells to control a cellular function, such as to produce readily detectable indicators of metabolic states or environmental conditions. Although recent years have seen numerous advances towards this goal, the sophistication, performance and scale of mammalian genetic circuits trail their microbial counterparts. In this collaborative project, investigators from the US (Boston University) and the UK (University of Warwick) combine experimentation and computational modeling to develop a new genetic technology tool that will enable mammalian cells to respond to a signal to reprogram genetic circuits with memory capabilities.  The memory feature is crucial to enable recordings of past events in complex environments where continuous monitoring is not feasible, which will be potentially useful for biopharmaceutical production. This project provides interdisciplinary training opportunities for high school, undergraduate, and graduate students in quantitative experimental methods and cell biology. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will develop new tools for controlling mammalian cell gene expression using a class of DNA modifying enzymes called serine integrases. Serine integrases have advantages over the better characterized tyrosine recombinases due to the presence of recombinase directionality factors that bind to serine integrases to modify its conformation, permitting the reverse reaction to occur. To achieve this goal the PIs will: 1) perform detailed analyses of serine integrase (Bxb1, PhiC31, TP901-1 and TG1) activity and specificity in mammalian cells; 2) design, build and test inducible, rewritable memory switches for biopharmaceutical production; and 3) design, construct, and test a serine recombinase-based genetic circuit with reversible memory capabilities.  This work will provide in-depth characterization of the specificity and toxicity of serine integrases and develop a novel decoder system for the reversible genetic circuit through integrated experimentation and computational modeling.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This collaborative US/UK project is supported by the US National Science Foundation and the UK Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Rewritable biocomputers in mammalian cells     A major goal in genetic engineering is to be able to reprogram and control cell function.  Although recent years have seen numerous advances towards this goal, the sophistication, performance, and scale of mammalian genetic circuits trail their microbial counterparts.  The overarching goal of this proposal is to develop a suite of versatile gene expression tools in mammalian cells.  One of the most important tools in mammalian genetic engineering is a class of DNA modifying enzyme call site-specific recombinase.  We and others have shown previously that highly complex cell functions can be created using recombinase-based genetic circuits.  To control recombinase activity for more precise modulation of cell function, we have developed a large library small molecule and light controllable recombinases.  To evaluate the performance of our inducible recombinases, we determined their signal-to-noise ratio.  We also have demonstrated their ability to control therapeutically important protein production in mice.      In addition to recombinase tools development, we have also developed a detailed mechanistic mathematical model for recombinase-based genetic circuits.  We have shown that this model can be used to predict some of the behavior we have shown in our earlier work.  This model will help us design more complex genetic circuits in the future.     Broader impact  We anticipate that our library of inducible recombinase will be useful to the broader research community for engineering mammalian cells.  As such, we have deposited all of our inducible recombinases in the non-profit repository, Addgene, to facilitate resource sharing with other researchers around the world.  Furthermore, because we extensively characterized our library with the quantitative SNR metric, it will further enable the adoption of our resources.
