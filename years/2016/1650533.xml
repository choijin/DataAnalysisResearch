<AbstractNarration>The NSF INCLUDES program supports models, networks, partnerships and research to ensure the broadening participation in STEM of women, members of racial and ethnic groups that have been historically underrepresented, persons of low socio-economic&lt;br/&gt;status, and people with disabilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Algebra Project, in partnership with the Young People's Project, will convene a conference on inclusion in science, technology, engineering and mathematics(STEM) higher education in support of the National Science Foundation's Inclusion across the Nation of Communities of Learners of Underrepresented Discoverers in Engineering and Science (NSF INCLUDES) initiative.  The conference will examine a critical question: What roles and structures are needed for a mini-backbone organization in order to scale a "bottom up" model of social change into an organized, full scale collective impact model?  Additionally, the conference will develop participants' capacity to link action on the various design challenges, and backbone structures, to future actions that meet the needs of a potential&lt;br/&gt;Alliance on this Broadening Participation Challenge and others facing similar challenges.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Five pre-conference design teams will focus on key components to improve education of students from underrepresented and disadvantaged populations over a four-month period prior to the convening of the stakeholders in St. Louis, Missouri in 2017.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ A national conference entitled:Working Math Literacy from the Bottom Up on Behalf of the Bottom Quartile was convened by the Algebra Project, Young People?s Project and Southern Initiative Algebra Project May 19-21, 2017, in St. Louis, MS. Diverse stakeholders addressed the goal that students who now perform in the bottom quartile in mathematics (as measured by state tests) have the opportunity to graduate high school able to take college or career mathematics courses without remediation. Partipating organizations and individuals aim to develop an alliance bringing together students, teachers, school and district leaders, parents and community leaders/organizers in learning sites with local and national university discipline specialists and policymakers.  The Conference Organizing Committee represented expertise in the design and delivery of effective strategies to build knowledge, influence policy, and execute on social change efforts across education, health and human services, civil and human rights, and public policy.   James A. Burruss, Senior Vice President, McClelland Center for Research and Innovation, Hay Group. Courtland Cox, Chairperson, Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) Legacy Project.  Frank E. Davis, consultant on STEM education, former President of TERC, Cambridge, MA.   Michael Nettles, Senior Vice President and Edmund W. Gordon Chair, Policy Evaluation &amp; Research Center, Educational Testing Service.  Maisha V. Moses, Executive Director, The Young People?s Project, Inc. (YPP). Robert Parris (Bob) Moses, Founder &amp; President, The Algebra Project, Inc.   Beverly Jo Walker, Algebra Project Board member, consultant to states on health, human services and education.  Discussion built on the consensus stated in 30 letters of commitment, a National Design Meeting in February, 2017, and pre-work by Voice Groups (Students, Teachers, School Leaders, Parents &amp; Community Members, University/Policymakers) to examine stakeholders? needs and develop plans to advance the goal. The 151 participants from across the country included: 23 students age 14-22; 13 other young people age 23-40; 26 teachers (elementary, middle and high school); 17 school and school district administrators; 27 university members; 45 national/regional organization representatives (including community organizers).  The Conference produced a draft Theory of Change for the work of an alliance; updates on activities in sites and programs; identification of functions and structures; plans for next steps.  Recommendations included: dissemination of stories and data; development of a sense of agency among students, caregivers and teachers; enabling students to demonstrate what they know; resources to address social justice including facilitation and organizing; structures for collaboration and communication, fundraising, expansion and sustainability.    Continuing work produced a contact list of &gt;300 individuals from 30 school systems across the country, faculty from 38 universities including 8 HBCUs, 1 Latinx serving institution and 1 Indigenous Peoples serving institution, and representatives of 25 national and 17 local/regional organizations.   Intellectual Merit: The Conference contributed a "bottom up" approach to knowledge of broadening participation, as learned by founders of the Algebra Project and Southern Initiative Algebra Project during the 1960s Civil Rights Movement, and as implemented for three decades in the service of mathematics education. It engaged key stakeholders in learning sites together with discipline specialists and policymakers in discussion of causes, actions and outcomes needed. It produced recommendations for functions and structures of an alliance, and continuing discussion on how these structures serve the five key elements of the NSF INCLUDES initiative:  Vision, Partnerships, Goals and Metrics, Leadership &amp; Communication; Potential for Expansion, Impact &amp; Scale.    Broader Impact:  To foster social change at times when there may be distrust, experience of racism or biases based on class, gender and disability, and differences in views between those at the center of the problem and those in positions of influence, a better understanding is needed of how to facilitate discussion and collaboration. The Conference exemplified methods to engage diverse stakeholders around a critical problem in education.    The conveners believe that the holding together of our society depends on the belief of citizens that they can achieve a measure of economic security and safety that will sustain family life. Such security in turn depends on the existence of real educational opportunity &ndash;- opportunity to learn the reasoning skills and technical skills demanded in well-paying jobs. Even nonprofessional work nowadays requires literacy, technical skills, reasoning skills, and collaboration. When youth begin to sense that their schools and communities are in fact not preparing them for those opportunities, they seek alternative tracks. This is where the "school to prison pipeline" begins.    The Conference participants aim to reach those youth who have not yet given up but who are vulnerable &ndash; those who have been performing in the bottom quartile on measures of educational achievement. By targeting those students in particular, participants are seeking not just to "close an achievement gap" but to establish national standards and practices for their education in a society where all citizens can believe in a just society, can have a dream, and can know that their contributions are worthy.
