<AbstractNarration>This three year renewal Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site program, Fluid Mechanics with Analysis using Computations and Experiments (FM-ACE), at the University of Alabama Tuscaloosa, will engage and mentor a diverse cohort of undergraduate students from underrepresented groups with limited access to research facilities in exciting and emerging areas related to fluid mechanics. The field of fluid mechanics is unique in its ability to be visually captivating, making it an excellent area of research for motivating students to pursue graduate study. It is also multidisciplinary in nature as a wide range of engineering disciplines require varying depths of knowledge in fluid mechanics. While many basic aspects of fluid mechanics are well understood, it is still an engaging field of study where innovation and exciting discoveries are actively taking place; this is greatly in part due to the technological advances in experimental and computational capabilities over the last 20 years such as high speed imaging, advanced laser diagnostics and powerful computing. A major aim of this site is to diversify and increase the number of American engineers who pursue a graduate education and enter the engineering work force to perform cutting edge research leading to technological innovation in areas of public and national defense interest, thereby furthering our country's prosperity. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The University of Alabama Tuscaloosa will host 10 undergraduate students over 10 summer weeks in exciting and emerging areas related to fluid mechanics with an end goal of presenting their research the following November at the American Physical Society Division of Fluid Dynamics (APS DFD) conference. This component of the program acts as an important follow-through mechanism to further encourage REU participants to pursue graduate studies and contributes to the success of the site by motivating both the student and mentors to obtain quality research results. Other important objectives include providing a structure wherein research and technical communication skills are cultivated. This site involves basic and applied research in fluid mechanics across a range of engineering disciplines as well as the training of undergraduate students in state-of-the-art laboratory environments. Students will contribute to projects that include, as a sampling, Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) investigations of bio-inspired boundary layer control mechanisms, combustion studies using a color schlieren system, and computational aeroacoustics.</AbstractNarration>
