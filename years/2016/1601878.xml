<AbstractNarration>Between 65 and 100 million years ago, during the time that dinosaurs walked the earth, a large, tropical seaway covered the central part of what is now North America. This seaway teemed with marine life. Snails and clams lived on the seafloor; ammonites, along with giant mosasaurs, plesiosaurs, sharks, and fish, swam about; at the same time early birds and pterosaurs floated on or flew above the seaway. What remains today is a prolific fossil record that has been collected by paleontologists for over 100 years. Notable fossils from this time period and region are on display at museums around the world. However, the vast bulk of fossils collected from this region are locked away in museum drawers. To provide scientists and the general public access to these fossils and their associated data, this project proposes to digitize invertebrate and vertebrate fossils from this time period and region, making information accessible through searchable electronic databases. Additionally, a variety of online resources illustrating and describing these fossils and mapping their distributions will be developed. A freely accessible online textbook of paleontology will be generated and a website and App will be developed to highlight the appearances, occurrences, and ages of constituent species, to help students and aspiring paleontologists identify and learn about these fossils. The project plans to generate a variety of curricular materials for K-12 education, including 3-D scans of fossils for free download and printed 3-D models for classroom use. Products of this project will also include workshops to engage science teachers and items to augment public programs and exhibits at participating institutions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work will greatly increase the scientific value of eight major U.S. museum collections of fossils. The museum collections contain large amounts of data useful for studying what causes marine species to migrate, go extinct, and evolve during a long period of greenhouse climate conditions similar to those our planet may soon experience. These data have relevance for evaluating how global change has and will continue to affect life on earth. An estimated 164,000 specimens collected from thousands of locations, in the region once occupied by the Western Interior Seaway, will be databased and georeferenced. Representatives from each of roughly 1,500 microfossil, invertebrate, and vertebrate species will be imaged. The digitized records will be made available online via individual museum databases, iDigBio, and iDigPaleo. The resultant data will enable scientists to answer questions about how different species interact and ecosystems change in the face of environmental shifts during a key time in the history of life. Moreover, the data will be ideal for use with an assortment of modern quantitative tools -including paleoecological niche modeling (PaleoENM) - and will help improve paleoclimate and paleoceanographic models. Finally, several undergraduate and graduate students will be trained. Results of the project will be published at the following url: www.digitalatlasofancientlife.org.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The overarching goal of the Cretaceous World TCN was to digitize records, localities, and photographs of fossil specimens from the Western Interior Seaway of North America that are housed in the nation?s leading museum collections, and more specifically those housed at the University of New Mexico?s Paleobiology Collections (UNMP). This project made available unique and important information for research (for example, studies linking environmental change to evolution or species data for testing hypotheses of evolutionary relatedness), education (at the K-12, undergraduate, and graduate levels), and public outreach activities at the local, regional, and national levels.</p> <p>Our specific goals at UNMP were to: (1) digitize UNMP fossil specimens from the Late Cretaceous Western Interior Seaway of North America (WIS); (2) assign latitude and longitude information to all specimens; (3) photograph unique and/or diagnostic species for science and public use; (4) share digitized records, localities, and images through local institutional websites as well as international specimen repositories (e.g., iDigBio, iDigPaleo, GBIF); (5) utilize Late Cretaceous WIS data to further the goals and impact of iDigBio and associated repositories.</p> <p>&nbsp;Our goals to ensure that this project had broader impact on educational and public communities included: (1) contributing specimen images and data to an online, open access textbook, <em>Digital Encyclopedia of Ancient Life</em> (<a href="https://www.digitalatlasofancientlife.org/learn/">https://www.digitalatlasofancientlife.org/learn/</a>); (2) contributing specimen images to the <em>Digital Atlas of Ancient Life</em> (<a href="https://www.digitalatlasofancientlife.org/">https://www.digitalatlasofancientlife.org/</a>; an online field guide to WIS fossils linked to the Digital encyclopedia); and (3) associated smart phone app Digital Atlas; and (4) train undergraduate and graduate students in specimen curation and museum collection maintenance.</p> <p>We achieved all of our project goals in both the intellectual merit and broader impacts categories. Using the Arctos Database (<a href="https://arctos.database.museum/">https://arctos.database.museum/</a>) we have digitized the species location information of a total of 1560 trays of catalogued specimens, which represents over 10,000 actual museum specimens (where we had proposed to digitize ~ 2000 specimens). We succeeded beyond our stated goals by also updating the species identifications on over 700 specimens. We added ~ 250 high resolution photographs to our online specimen records, representing 143 key specimens. All images were provided to Co-PI Hendricks for integration into the <em>Digital Encyclopedia of Ancient Life</em> and <em>Digital Atlas of Ancient Life</em> (both desktop and phone app versions). Finally, at UNMP, we trained a total of eight students in collections curation, management, specimen digitization, georeferencing, specimen identification, and specimen imaging over the course of this grant (three graduate students, three undergraduate students, two high school interns). The three graduate students were financially supported for one or more semesters as Research Assistants; two undergraduates were supported as part-time student researchers; the remaining undergraduate student was a volunteer participating in research credit. Two high school students also completed internships in the collections. Paid graduate and undergraduate students were developed digitization and photography workflows, uploading digital data to Arctos, and sending data to iDigBio and Co-PIs for broader impacts. Volunteers primarily worked on specimen digitization and georeferencing (assigning latitude and longitude coordinates to fossil localities); all students worked to update specimen names when needed. The data made available through this project also supported paleobiological science at UNM. This is exemplified by 14 talks given at national and international science conferences, three published papers in peer-reviewed science journals, and four masters and one PhD dissertation. Museum and paleo science was also shared publicly through local outreach to K12 schools, UNM-wide field trips (2) to local Cretaceous outcrops, participation in the UNM Shared Knowledge Conference (four posters), participation in several Skype-a-Scientist virtual classrooms, and mentorship of the UNM Advancing Women in Science student group and broader UNM Paleobiology group.</p> <p>Finally, in addition to making UNM paleobiology collections data visible to the public and other researchers, this project had an important impact on UNM institutional and Arctos database technological infrastructure. Leveraging our work in this project, we were able to successfully acquire UNM funding to renovate the existing Biology Annex Building and repurpose it as a <em>Natural History Sciences Center</em> to support and promote UNM Paleobiology and collections-based teaching and research. It has also supported a National Research Training grant proposal to promote specimen-based research training to graduate students (recently awarded) and a Sustained Availability of Biological Infrastructure Collaborative Proposal to continue funding work on the Arctos database infrastructure and community development (proposal pending). Regarding technological infrastructure, the integration of paleontological specimens into the Arctos database is a new endeavor. PI Myers and graduate Research Assistant Perriguey worked with the Arctos development team to incorporate the unique types of geological data needed for fossil specimen research. These include fields for geologic units (e.g., formations, members), geologic time (e.g., geologic eras, periods, stages), unique specimen naming, and type of preserved organism (e.g., body fossil, trace fossil, etc.). With these changes, the Arctos database has become much more accessible for paleobiological collections needs.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 07/17/2020<br>      Modified by:
