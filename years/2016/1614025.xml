<AbstractNarration>Invasive species are a global concern, causing substantial environmental and economic losses worldwide, and international partnerships are critical for the research and effective management of invaders. Mycorrhizae are a ubiquitous symbiotic relationship between plant roots and fungus that is mutually beneficial to both organisms. Mycorrhizal fungi are likely critical in determining the potential range of an invasive species. The geographic distribution patterns of mycorrhizae, while poorly understood, could be important in determining the mechanisms of invasive success. Lodgepole pine, an obligately mycorrhizal and economically important timber crop, is native to western North America and a significant invasive species in much of the southern hemisphere. This project will implement parallel analyses between the western North America native and New Zealand invaded ranges to provide insight into the origin, dispersal, and distribution patterns of invasive lodgepole pines and their fungal mutualists. This research will be conducted in collaboration with Dr. Ian Dickie, a noted expert in invasion ecology, at Lincoln University and its partner the Bio-Protection Research Center, which have been influential in the research and implementation of New Zealand?s invasion management programs. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The absence of compatible mycorrhizae is thought to be a substantial barrier to invasion for lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta), an obligately ectomycorrhizal (ECM) invasive in much of the southern hemisphere. The dispersal and distribution patterns of lodgepole pine-associated ECM communities are likely important in determining the potential range of this invader, and may be predicted by Island Biogeography Theory. The research objectives are to (1) compare ECM communities associated with lodgepole pine in the western North America native and New Zealand invaded ranges; (2) determine whether Island Biogeography Theory can describe ECM dispersal and distribution patterns; (3) determine the spatiotemporal and environmental gradients structuring these ECM communities; and (4) predict the consequences for future plant invasions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award under the East Asia and Pacific Summer Institutes program supports summer research by a U.S. graduate student and is jointly funded by NSF and the Royal Society of New Zealand.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>New Zealand has been geographically isolated for over 80 millions years, and many unqiue native flora and fauna have evolved there that are not found anywhere else in the world. European colonization began in the 1640s, and extensive land use change for agriculture and the introduction of many invasive species ensued. An invasive species can be defined by a species that is not native to a given area, and is likely to spread and cause harm to the environment, economy, and/or human health. Characteristics of an invasive species include rapid growth and reproduction, aggressive spread, and a negative impact on local communities. We are particualrly concerned about invasive species on islands such as New Zealand because isalnds are in general more vulnerable due to the lack of predators and other competitors, and this can significantly decrease biodiversity and disrupt important ecosystem servies. There are currently more non-native plant and animal species in New Zealand than native species, and significant environmental and economic harm has been caused.</p> <p>Lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) is a tree with a native distribution in western North America, but it was widely planted in the souther hemipshere as a timber crop. It has subsequently escaped from plantations and invaded into the adjacent communities and displaced many native species. Invasive lodgepole pines now account for about 15% of total vegetation cover on the south island of New Zealand alone due to its rapid and prolific seed production. Lodgepole pines require mycorrhizal fungi in order to grow and spread. Mycorrhizal fungi are ubiquitous symbiotic fungi that associate with plant roots to exchange nitrogen and phosphorous for photosynthetically-derived carbohydrates. The absence of compatible mycorrhizae is thought to be a substantial barrier to invasion for lodgepole pine, and thus can significantly determine the potential range of this invader.</p> <p>Current management efforts in New Zealand are costly and largely ineffective. I characterized the mycorrhizal species associating with lodgepole pines along the invasion fronts to better enable predictions of the potential range of this invader and to assist in concentrating management efforts on high risk communities. My preliminary results indicate that the mycorrhizal communities have relatively few species, as was similarly found in other invaded regions of the souther hemisphere where lodgepole pine was introduced.&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 06/30/2017<br>      Modified by: Briana&nbsp;Boaz</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1614025/1614025_10432190_1498841425397_IMG_3343--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1614025/1614025_10432190_1498841425397_IMG_3343--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Field site"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1614025/1614025_10432190_1498841425397_IMG_3343--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Field site"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Invasive lodgepole pines in south island of New Zealand</div> <div class="imageCredit">B.Boaz</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Royalty-free (restricted use - cannot be shared)</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Briana&nbsp;Boaz</div> <div class="imageTitle">Field site</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1614025/1614025_10432190_1498841547056_IMG_3243--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1614025/1614025_10432190_1498841547056_IMG_3243--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Non-native mushroom"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1614025/1614025_10432190_1498841547056_IMG_3243--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Non-native mushroom"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Fruiting body of the non-native fly agaric mushroom (Amanita muscaria)</div> <div class="imageCredit">B.
