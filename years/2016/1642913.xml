<AbstractNarration>This award will support participation in a series of four weekend Algebraic Geometry Conferences that will be held in the fall of the years 2016-2019 at the University of Missouri, University of Kansas, University of Missouri-St Louis, and Washington University, respectively. These schools, located along a 300-mile stretch of I-70 in Missouri and Kansas, have strong groups of researchers in the field. The conferences will provide a forum for algebraic geometers in this region to meet with colleagues and learn of recent research developments in the focused areas. Another important purpose is to give graduate students and recent PhD recipients an opportunity to broaden their mathematical horizons. Attending these meetings allows them to meet fellow young algebraic geometers as well as distinguished faculty from both inside and outside the region.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each of the annual conferences will have a similar format but with a different focus area. Specifically, there will be five or six one-hour talks, two or three of which will be given by leading researchers in algebraic geometry, who will give colloquium-style lectures aimed at introducing the audience to the latest developments in the focused area. The other talks will be given by local algebraic geometers from the I-70 schools as well as from other nearby universities in the broader region. Priority for these three or four talks will be given to recent PhD recipients and members of groups underrepresented in mathematics. The focus areas of the conferences are as follows. Fall 2016 (Missouri): Derived Algebraic Geometry. Fall 2017 (Kansas): Higher-Dimensional Varieties of General Type and Related Counting Problems. Fall 2018 (University of Missouri-St Louis): Cycles and Vector Bundles on Algebraic Varieties. Fall 2019 (Washington University): Algebraic Cycles and Moduli Problems.
