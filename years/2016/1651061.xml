<AbstractNarration>Language users readily adapt to linguistic variation, both in the short term -- after exposure to another's speech -- and in the long term as linguistic structures change in the surrounding community. How is an individual's interaction with linguistic variation influenced by the general cognitive strategies used to resolve competition in the environment? In a dual mechanisms framework, cognitive control -- the mechanisms engaged to resolve conflict and regulate expectations -- is divided into two interrelated strategies: proactive and reactive control. Study 1 examines how those control strategies influence individual adaptation to distributional changes in speech input, using an experiment simulating sound change in the laboratory. Less habitual engagement of proactive and reactive control strategies is hypothesized to facilitate the integration of phonological variation. Study 2 then translates the same behavioral tasks to the field in a community-based study examining language variation on a larger scale: sound changes-in-progress (as when 'wait' sounds more like 'wheat'). This dissertation complements existing knowledge regarding sound change in Philadelphia by collecting sociolinguistic interviews of Puerto Rican Philadelphians, one of the largest communities outside of Puerto Rico. Interviews are collected from two age groups and two neighborhood groups based on demographic makeup (proportion of Black and White Philadelphians) to document how one?s immediate community influences participation in three socially-stratified sound changes-in-progress. The same participants then complete the three behavioral tasks from Study 1 (AX-CPT, a modified Stroop paradigm, and an n-back task with lures), permitting a regression analysis of how control strategies modulate their adoption of changes-in-progress.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is one of the first studies to explicitly link dual mechanisms of cognitive control to language processing. It is unique in applying these strategies both to simulated sound change in the laboratory and real-world sound change in the community, documenting the speech of an understudied population and providing a unified account of how social and cognitive factors interact in language use.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    A common presumption in linguistic research&mdash;based chiefly on studies of African Americans in major urban centers in the US&mdash;is that minorities fall behind when language is undergoing change in the community at large. This research provides support to a growing body of evidence to the contrary, suggesting that minority populations do participate in changes underway in the greater community, and they may in fact be critical to understanding how language change spreads from one community to another.     The Community  Philadelphia  has  one  of  the  largest  Puerto  Rican populations in the world aside from New York City, and Puerto Ricans have been an integral subpopulation there since the 1940?s. Despite decades of research on speech in Philadelphia and the ways that language is undergoing change there, next to nothing is known regarding their speech&mdash;in relation to the majority population or otherwise.  Participants in the project were minimally second-generation Puerto Ricans who had lived nearly all of their lives in Philadelphia. 26 women and 11 men, ranging in age from 19 to 63, were selected from a variety of occupation groups to approximate a range of socioecnomic statuses.     The Corpus  The participants in this project were recorded during hour-long conversations designed to elicit personal narratives. They also completed a sociodemographic survey and read words corresponding to sound changes that are underway in Philadelphia more generally.   Conversational data were transcribed and time-aligned, and these transcriptions were then force aligned using software that employs machine learning (FAVE) in order to extract key vowels related to sound changes in-progress in Philadelphia.      Target sound changes underway in Philadelphia  This study focused on three sound changes in-progress that have been documented in greater Philadelphia, each of which has a distinct level of social awareness and is on a distinct point in the typical trajectory of sound change:  EY Raising, where the vowels in bay and bait begin to sound differently, is a new sound change in-progress under the level of social awareness, and it is geographically tied to Philadelphia. Canadian Raising, where the vowels in price and prize start to sound different, is a change that has spread to all social classes in Philadelphia but is not overtly commented on. It is also found in many other large cities in the Northern US. OH-Lowering, where the raised vowel in bought and water (which in Philadelphia sounds more like wooder) has begun lowering again in more educated and younger speakers as a reaction to stigmatization.      Minority participation in majority sound change  The results demonstrate that Puerto Ricans have indeed adopted Philadelphia sound changes&mdash;not only in rates but in the contexts where those sound changes typically occur. What is more, while speakers? vowels are acoustically in line with those described in white Philadelphians, their speech evidences sensitivity to supralocal patterns of language use (beyond Philadelphia).  Puerto Ricans exhibit EY-Raising (a change geographically isolated to Philadelphia), showing effects of socioeconomic status, sex, and age that mirror those found in the white population. Similarly, Canadian raising is widespread in the Puerto Rican data: Puerto Ricans show similar trends to white Philadelpheans by age and speech style. Importantly, Puerto Rican women lead the change, which deviates from reported trends in greater Philadelphia but aligns with general principles of language change and reports of the change in progress elsewhere in North America. The vowel in water is lowering in younger Puerto Ricans as it is in white Philadelphians, but the way the vowel is lowered differs according to speaker sex: while women produce the vowel in a lower position like white speakers do, younger men employ the geographically ubiquitous cot-caught merger, where the vowels in cot and caught become equivalent, to avoid the stigmatized vowel altogether.  In addition to filling a curious lacuna in research on Philadelphia sound change, the findings of this project highlight the importance of minority communities in advancing language change. More specifically, this research suggests not only that minority communities do participate in changes underway in the majority community, but they in fact may facilitate change through sensitivity to patterns of language use that extend beyond the geographic confines of their communities.
