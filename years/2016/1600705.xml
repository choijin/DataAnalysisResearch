<AbstractNarration>The conference "Harmonic Analysis, Complex Analysis, Spectral Theory and All That" will be held at The Mathematical Research and Conference Center (MRCC) in Bedlewo, Poland, July 31-August 6, 2016. The conference enter belongs to the Institute of Mathematics of Polish Academy of Sciences - International Banach Center.  It is expected that about 100 participants will come from Canada, Finland, France, Germany, Israel, Norway, Poland, Spain, Russia, Sweden, USA and other countries. A significant number, about 30, of the participants will be PhD  students and postdoctoral fellows.  One of the aims of the conference is to bring graduate students to geometric harmonic analysis where there are a wide range of applications. The conference organizers aim to reach the critical mass of young scholars, women and men, that will intensify interdisciplinary interaction already in their post-doc phase with senior researchers.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This conference, in major part, focusses on recent advances in harmonic and complex analysis with numerous connections and important applications in mind. The aim is to strongly promote linkages between the modern theory of 2D-geometric analysis (in its various manifestations, including holomorphic dynamics, inverse conductivity problems, partial differential equations, geometric measure theory calculus of variations, fractal geometry) with other possible developments, thereby bringing new ideas and results to each field. The organizing committee's background and experience affirm those goals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More information can be found on the conference website: http://bcc.impan.pl/16Harmonic/</AbstractNarration>
