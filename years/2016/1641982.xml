<AbstractNarration>This I-Corps team is developing a standardized software platform to allow humans to interact with and use robots through natural communication, such as speech and body language. The proposed "Semio" software platform allows robot developers to create (through developer tools) and deploy (to an app store) speech/gesture-based applications to be executed by robots, and allows non-expert robot users to access (from the app store) and use (through natural communication and smart devices) those robot applications. The proposed  software enables a robot to automatically recognize human speech and body language, make decisions about how to respond (specified by the developer for the application), and act based on those decisions while also providing its own speech and body language. This natural communication interface increases the usability of robots by novice users. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Semio software platform involves novel algorithms and robust code bases that enable a robotic hardware platform to operate "out of the box" based on a set of core social behaviors that serve as building blocks of face-to-face conversational interaction; these behaviors include speech (what is said), eye gaze (where attention is focused), gestures (face, head, body, arm, and hand movements), turn-taking (when to talk and when to listen), and interpersonal spacing (where to stand for to have a conversation). The target market for the proposed speech/gesture-based software is personal robotics, though the team is also exploring other markets, such as smart devices (smart phones, GPS, and the Internet of Things), gaming, transportation (cars and self-driving cars), sensors (Microsoft Kinect and Intel RealSense), and general robotics (industrial, military, and commercial robotics). The team is currently targeting customers who are hardware and software developers of these interactive technologies. Developers may be both expert and non-expert, and may be members of industry, the Maker community, hobbyists, or academia. Through repeated customer interviews, this team will continue to integrate customer feedback into the demo app to better improve the product content and performance to meet the identified needs of customers. The software platform will also be connected to a hardware robot platform to begin proof-of-concept demonstrations to and connection-building with prospective customers in the robotics market.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[Semio Project Outcomes Report   The major goal of this project was to perform customer discovery to determine the commercialization potential of a standardized operating system, application ecosystem, and developer tools in the domestic and global consumer, commercial, and collaborative robotics markets. The specific objectives were to investigate customer segments/archetypes and associated value propositions for those customer segments to be delivered by the software solutions in development. The Semio team tested hypotheses regarding distribution channels for the software, as well as evaluate relationships to get, keep, and grow customers in the robotics market. A set of revenue streams were also explored to bring capital into the company. Other objectives included validating key activities and resources necessary to execute proposed software solutions, as well as identifying key partners to aid in the pursuit of the venture. Finally, an operational cost structure was formalized to determine if the commercialization approach was viable. Answers to these questions provided evidence to suggest that Semio had (1) problem-solution fit, (2) product-market fit, and (3) a sustainable business model.   As part of the customer discovery process, the Semio team conducted more than 1,000 one-on-one face-to-face interviews with prospective customers to investigate the commercialization potential of its robot software technologies. These interviews focused on the business side of the consumer (personal), commercial (enterprise), and collaborative (industrial) global robotics market segments. Three core customer archetypes were identified within these markets: software developers, content developers, and product developers; these customer archetypes are characterized by challenges in system integration, content creation, and application deployment, respectively. Specifically: (1) Software developers spend 75% of their time simply combining existing software components. (2) Content developers (typically, writers and animators &ndash; i.e., not programmers) spend 60% of their time translating content between a creative team and an engineering team. (3) Product developers (typically, programmers who implement the content created by content developers) spend 90% of their time packaging applications for one-time deployments to robot hardware.   By addressing the above challenges, Semio software will transform the way in which robot applications are developed (through design tools) and deployed (to the cloud), and subsequently the way in which end-users access (from the cloud) and use (through natural language) those robot skills, thus, unlocking the potential of the consumer, commercial, and collaborative robotics markets.   Intellectual Merit.  The Semio software platform involves novel algorithms and robust code bases that enable a robotic hardware platform to operate "out of the box" based on a set of core social behaviors that serve as building blocks of face-to-face conversational interaction; these behaviors include speech (what is said), eye gaze (where attention is focused), gestures (face, head, body, arm, and hand movements), turn-taking (when to talk and when to listen), and interpersonal spacing (where to stand for to have a conversation). These core behaviors allow developers to focus on creating and deploying end-user applications without having to develop low-level robot control algorithms and code, and also makes personal robotic technology more accessible to non-expert users by allowing them to access and use developed applications through natural communication mechanisms (speech and body language).   Broader Impact.  The Semio software platform also enables and expands access to general consumer robots for industry, hobbyists, the Maker community, and academic researchers, as well as for K-12 students across the U.S. to stimulate interest in STEM topics and careers through exposure and training in human-robot interaction, typically an engaging topic.
