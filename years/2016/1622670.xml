<AbstractNarration>Professor Malcolm D. E. Forbes of Bowling Green State University is supported by the Chemical Catalysis program, Division of Chemistry, the Americas program, Office of International Science and Engineering, and the Chemical, Bioengineering, Environmental, and Transport Systems Division to organize an international workshop entitled "Workshop: Photocatalysis, Photoconversion, and Photoelectrochemistry: Fundamentals, Techniques, and Applications for the 21st Century."  The workshop will be held on May 22-23, 2016 on the campus of the Universidad Andre√¨s Bello in Santiago, Chile, immediately preceding the 25th Meeting of the Inter-American Photochemical Society in Santiago, Chile.  Fifteen early-career U.S. student and post-doctoral researchers of diverse background meet with 10 students from different South and Central American countries and jointly interact with senior US and South American faculty in a constructive environment.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The aim of this workshop award is to encourage international collaboration and to provide the US students and postdoctoral researchers with an international experience.  The workshop exposes them to the current frontiers and future directions in fundamental and applied research in photocatalysis.  The workshop serves to provide much needed cross-fertilization, and bonds are formed between US and South American participants that could potentially last a scientific lifetime. Furthermore, the US participants develop a broader perspective on international science at an early stage in their careers.</AbstractNarration>
