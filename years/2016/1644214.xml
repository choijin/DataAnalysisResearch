<AbstractNarration>This award will provide funding for the Integers Conference 2016: Spanning the Generations, which will be held October 6-9, 2016 at the University of West Georgia, in Carrollton, Georgia; the conference website is  www.westga.edu/~math/IntegersConference2016. The Integers conferences serve to bring together mathematicians and students interested in combinatorics and number theory; this will be the seventh such conference. The 2016 Integers conference will place a particular emphasis on the recruitment of undergraduate students, graduate students,  and early-career mathematicians.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference will include talks on such topics as additive number theory, multiplicative number theory, combinatorial games, Ramsey theory, elementary number theory, and sequences. It will feature three plenary speakers and about sixty additional speakers. In addition to the plenary speakers, a major portion of the funding will support a number of recent REU students, graduate students, and younger faculty. The conference plans to include at least twelve student research talks. It will promote interaction among research mathematicians at all career stages from the talented undergraduate to the internationally distinguished researcher. The proceedings of the conference will be published as a special volume of the journal Integers.</AbstractNarration>

Nineteen of the speakers were students, including eleven undergraduate students. All of the stidemt talks were very well-received.  There were also several talks by early-career mathematicians.  To help disseminate the research advances resulting from this meeting, all speakers were invited to submit expanded versions of their talks to the journal Integers, which plans to publish a special volume devoted to the Proceedings of this conference.  Twelve articles were submitted for consideration for this volume; it is anticipated that it will be published in early 2018.
