<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project focuses on allowing a greater number of people with varying abilities to independently operate a power wheelchair. The kit developed with this project can also provide more independence by freeing up the hands from operating the wheelchair and allowing for the wheelchair to be operated within a specified range - even if the user is not seated in it.  This wireless control technology can be used to control other devices such as robots, travel scooters and adaptive sport devices. Using sensors that are already part of smart phones, and the software application including in the kit, a control device that is user friendly and cost effective is created. Expanding the concept of how humans control machines beyond a typical joystick can change the way society views wheelchairs and other mobile devices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project will explore the commercialization of a hands free wheelchair control kit that can be used by power wheelchair users, including those with a spinal cord injury, multiple sclerosis, muscular dystrophy or poly trauma injuries.  The device is designed to allow power wheelchair users the ability to operate their wheelchair without the need to manipulate a joystick with their hands. A smartphone and its accelerometer sensors becomes the joystick by sending the control signals via Bluetooth to the controller of the wheelchair or any mobile device. The smartphone can be attached to the user's arm, head, chest, or remotely, to control the wheelchair. The kit is also designed to toggle between the wheelchair's original joystick controller and the customized smartphone controller using a switch. A wiring harness is used to connect the custom controller to the original controller of most wheelchair manufacturers for easy installation and operation. Preliminary work by the team has shown its capabilities as a successful control alternative to a joystick opening up wheelchair manipulation to a wider group of users.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Our team developed a mobile wheelchair control kit designed to allow power wheelchair users the ability to maneuver their wheelchair without the need to manipulate a joystick with their hands. We used a smartphone and its internal accelerometer sensor to detect the vector of gravity, and thus detecting the pitch and roll. These values were converted into motor commands and sent via Bluetooth to the custom wheelchair controller. The wheelchair controller is designed to accept the Bluetooth motor commands from a smart phone and move the wheelchair accordingly. To determine the viability of the commercialization of this kit as well as which features to further develop, a customer discovery was completed.&nbsp; Over a hundred interviews of power wheelchairs users, therapists, care takers, manufacturers, dealers, and assistive technology professionals were conducted at clinics, tradeshows, disabilities support groups, and rehabilitation organizations. The goal of these interviews was to meet power wheelchair users, ask about their lives in a power wheelchair and identify pain points of wheelchair use. It was determined that most power wheelchair users were content with the joystick control methods.&nbsp; The sub-features of the wheelchair control kit, such as remote operation and collision avoidance, had more value than the control method itself. Some power wheelchair users were aware of back up cameras to help with wheelchair navigation, but did not want the extra bulk of the addition of a screen added to the wheelchair. After the customer discovery, the collision avoidance was implemented into the control kit.
