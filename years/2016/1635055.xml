<AbstractNarration>Effective properties and structural performance of cementitious mixtures are substantially governed by the quality of the interphase region, because it acts as a bridge transferring forces between aggregates and a binding matrix, and is generally susceptible to damage. In spite of advancements made over the last several decades, understanding and modeling the interfacial region of cementitious mixtures still presents important challenges. As non-traditional additives such as recycled aggregates and alternative binding agents are more often used today, there is a growing need of fundamental knowledge to uncover interphase formation mechanisms and a resulting model to predict interphase properties. The goal of this research is to develop an experimental-computational method to identify and model the interphase region of cementitious materials. The successful application and dissemination of research findings is expected to significantly reduce costs, natural resources, and carbon dioxide emissions through the promotion of non-cement binding agents and secondary aggregates without compromising mechanical properties and structural performance. This project will improve education and training opportunities of underrepresented students and also impact current civil engineering practices, allowing for the development of more cost-effective mixture products that significantly increase the performance and sustainability of a wide range of structural materials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To meet the goal, this research systematically integrates multiscale tests and the two-way coupled multiscale computational modeling with the following four specific objectives: 1) develop a multiscale experimental method to identify microstructure details and properties of the interphase zone in cementitious mixtures; 2) develop a two-way coupled computational multiscale model that involves nonlinear-inelastic material behavior; 3) integrate the experimental efforts with computational modeling to determine effective material properties of interphase region; and 4) validate-calibrate the modeling approach and extend it to other cases where mixture design variables are varied. This research will advance the fundamental understanding of cementitious mixtures, specifically the mechanical effects of interphase on entire mixture properties and performance. This research incorporates several intellectual significances including micromechanical-nanomechanical material characterization in multiple length-time scales and the two-way linked multiscale computation with nonlinear-inelastic material behavior. Successful completion of the project will provide significant key information that will advance current technology and knowledge on a broad range of multiphase particulate solids in which inelastic-nonlinear deformation, interface, and multiphysical loads are involved as primary energy dissipation and performance-controlling phenomena.</AbstractNarration>

Experimental efforts demonstrate that the integrated nanomechanical-chemical-microstructure characterization aided to better understand the time-dependent kinetics of cementitious binding materials and material specific interphase between cementitious materials and particles. By incorporating the multiscale experiments with the two-way linked multiscale computational modeling, it is also expected to unveil the unknown linkages between component properties and macroscale behavior of mixtures. Furthermore, our integrated experimental-computational multiscale approach can help identify challenging material properties, such as nanometer-scale viscoelasticity and micrometer-scale fracture properties, which are considered critical but not usually feasible to identify using conventional test methods. Research outcomes can vastly contribute to a more resilient engineering of construction/building materials based on the advanced understanding and better predicting power.</p> <p><strong>Broader Impacts:</strong></p> <p>During the project years (August 2016 to December 2018), we have disseminated our research outcomes via publications and presentations. Five journal papers were published and five more papers are currently under review. We also published nine conference articles, and one of them was selected as the Best Paper. We made ten technical presentations, and three of them were recognized as two Best Poster Awards and the Dwight Eisenhower Transportation Fellowship Award. The PI also made three invited seminars at significant venues.</p> <p>A total of five Ph.D. students and six REU (undergraduate) students have been involved in this project for the entire project years in various research-outreach activities. All doctoral students have their own specific foci but work closely together for the maximal collaboration. Dissertations of all five doctoral students have been benefitted by this project, and all dissertations are expected to be completed by this year (2019). The REU students have been trained by graduate students and closely work with graduate students. Graduate students served mentors for REU students. All students participated in regular group meetings to share/discuss ideas and make practice presentations to develop oral communication skills. They also worked together to develop technical manuscripts on a regular basis which could improve writing skills. Both graduate students and REU students co-authored publications and made presentations at several technical venues. Successful accomplishments of the students involved in various activities were also recognized by many awards, honors, and scholarships/fellowships.</p> <p>In addition to the research training of graduate-undergraduate students, we accomplished several outreach activities during the project years to target various groups of audience: K-12 students, undergraduate engineering students, and general public. Our team participated in the&nbsp;<em>Nebraska Science Festival</em>&nbsp;at the University of Nebraska State Museum and&nbsp;<em>STEAM Sunday</em>&nbsp;at Lincoln Children Museum which catered toward young future scientists and engineers ranging from pre-kindergarten to eighth grade. Our goal was to introduce these young people to the STEM field, especially focused on the engineering aspect. Our team also organized an event in a Discover Engineering session at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln&nbsp;<em>Big Red Summer Camp</em>. For two days, high school students learn how the power of science and engineering can be used to solve world problems in energy, water, healthcare, or infrastructure. We conducted a bridge materials design activity allowing high school students to design and test the strength of bridges using conventional and alternative cementitious binding materials. This hands-on activity demonstrated how alternative construction materials may replace conventional materials and bring greener and more sustainable infrastructure for the future, and fundamental research in construction materials can improve all fields of civil engineering. All three activities were extremely successful, which was demonstrated by summative and formative survey results and their feedbacks during and after the events. Also, the PI reached junior/senior civil engineering students in his Civil Engineering Materials course to introduce green construction-building materials engineering. The activity was planned as a brief workshop within their lab session. The session included a presentation on geopolymer concrete and hands-on experiments in geopolymer mixture design, sample preparation, and nanoscale experiments. A hands-on software,&nbsp;<em>MIDAS</em>&nbsp;(multiscale inelastic damage analysis software) that can conduct microstructural model simulations was also developed and presented in several places (conferences, classes, and invited lectures) as a tool to advance design of materials and mixtures.&nbsp;</p> <p>The resulting outcomes of this project are expected to impact current civil/architectural engineering practices, allowing for the development of more cost-effective mixture products that significantly increase the performance and sustainability of a wide range of structural/building materials. Current practices and decision-making practices in choosing materials and their blending can be improved based on new findings from this project: direct linkage between fundamental materials engineering and sustainable infrastructure engineering. In addition, the technical merits of this project potentially applicable to a broad range of fields wherein the quality of the interphase region is significant as a bridge transferring forces between multiple distinct phases that are generally susceptible to deformation and damage.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 04/29/2019<br>      Modified by: Yong-Rak&nbsp;Kim</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1635055/1635055_10444934_1556494170637_Image1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1635055/1635055_10444934_1556494170637_Image1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Project Outcome_Intellectual Merit 1"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1635055/1635055_10444934_1556494170637_Image1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Project Outcome_Intellectual Merit 1"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Integrated Multiscale Characterization of Interphase in Cementitious Materials-Mixtures.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Yong-Rak Kim</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Yong-Rak&nbsp;Kim</div> <div class="imageTitle">Project Outcome_Intellectual Merit 1</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1635055/1635055_10444934_1556494388922_Image2--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1635055/1635055_10444934_1556494388922_Image2--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Project Outcome_Intellectual Merit 2"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1635055/1635055_10444934_1556494388922_Image2--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Project Outcome_Intellectual Merit 2"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Figure 2.
