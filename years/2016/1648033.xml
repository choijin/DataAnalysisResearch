<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will be to create a user-friendly, universal control&lt;br/&gt;system for robots and sensors that for the first time would make it possible for nontechnical service&lt;br/&gt;industry professionals to task and control co-robots deployed in their facility. This simplification of&lt;br/&gt;software for an end-user will make systems of robots as easy to control as a single robot. Data collected&lt;br/&gt;over the lifecycle of the robots and sensors (which is currently not done) may aid in identification of new&lt;br/&gt;technologies to revolutionize system capabilities in the field of robotics. Although this concept could be&lt;br/&gt;applied to a wide array of service sector industries, SRT proposes to efficiently integrate and&lt;br/&gt;cooperatively control a fleet of robots and sensors to support custodial service industry tasks, because?&lt;br/&gt;though essential?custodial services add no commercial value to an organization. Thus the sector is&lt;br/&gt;clamoring for ways to reduce personnel turnover and other costs. In the U.S., custodial services are a $40&lt;br/&gt;billion industry; a mere 5% increase in efficiency would result in $2 billion in savings annually. This&lt;br/&gt;sector is rife with robots from disparate manufacturers, yet facility managers need an easy-to-use method&lt;br/&gt;to ?employ? multiple, specialized robots.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a common software&lt;br/&gt;architecture that will serve as a universal receptor for service robotics systems. The predominant technical&lt;br/&gt;hurdle is effectively combining the software protocols and coordinating control of the robots. There&lt;br/&gt;currently is no common standard for robotics software systems. The actual robot (the hardware) is&lt;br/&gt;typically the primary focus for product developers, while the software is built from a variety of&lt;br/&gt;proprietary, heritage and open sources, and is as unique as the company developing it. Little or no&lt;br/&gt;consideration is given to how robots from different manufacturers could interact in the real world. By&lt;br/&gt;standardizing the data protocols for robots and smart devices, and making that openly available, SRT&lt;br/&gt;intends to drive future open API development for hardware. Standardized APIs will still protect the&lt;br/&gt;proprietary components, but will quickly allow for data sharing across multiple devices?facilitating&lt;br/&gt;research in robotics, machine learning, and big data?by allowing end-users to quickly integrate multiple&lt;br/&gt;components into the same system, and develop their own algorithms to utilize the shared data streams.</AbstractNarration>
