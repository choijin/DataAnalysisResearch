<AbstractNarration>The investigator seeks to understand our Milky Way galaxy.  The Milky Way has dozens of smaller dwarf galaxies in orbit around it.  These dwarf galaxies are being ripped apart by our galaxy's gravity into long streams of stars. Some of these streams encircle the entire galaxy.  The investigator recently discovered that the disk of the Milky Way, which includes the spiral structure, has previously unknown 'ripples'.  These ripples are believed to form when smaller dwarf galaxies fall into the Milky Way, just as a pebble dropped into a pond produces ripples on the surface of the water.  By mapping the density of stars throughout the Milky Way, this project model of the interaction between the Milky Way galaxy and the dwarf galaxies orbiting it.  These models will help us understand where dark matter is located.  The models also teach us how the spiral arms of galaxies are made and sustained.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will train undergraduate students in science and computing.  The investigator will engage the public in the scientific process through sustained public outreach initiatives.  Public outreach will include science web pages, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, YouTube videos, Reddit Ask Me Anything (AMA) sessions, opportunities to observe the sky through small telescopes, and hands-on outreach activities that will reach thousands of children, teens, adults, and seniors.  A relationship will be maintained between the investigators and the ~20,000 people, at any given time, who volunteer their personal computers to create the MilkyWay@home supercomputer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigator will map the three dimensional stellar density in the disk and halo of our galaxy, using Sloan Digital Sky Survey main sequence and turnoff stars in the galaxy's halo.  The investigator will use the technique of statistical photometric parallax to make the density maps. This technique recovers the underlying density distribution without measuring the distance to each individual star, because only the intrinsic brightness distribution is required.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The outer disk and the stellar halo will be mapped with turnoff stars. Main sequence stars, which are intrinsically dimmer, will be used to trace the density of closer stars in the Milky Way disk.  The investigator will map the dominant substructures, including the vertical oscillations of the stellar mid-plane.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This grant supported a project to understand why galaxies like ours look   the way they do. We did this by mapping the density of stars in the   Milky Way galaxy. There are two major parts to the distribution of stars   in our galaxy: the disk stars and the halo stars. Disk stars like the   Sun are mostly on circular orbits around the Galactic center. They are   located close to a flat plane called the Galactic plane. The halo stars   are a mostly spherical distribution of stars that surround the disk.  The  halo contains "tidal streams" of stars that are formed when small  galaxies  fall into our galaxy and are ripped apart by the gravitational  force of  the Milky Way. A dwarf galaxy that fell into the Milky Way a  billion  years ago could become a tidal stream that we see today. The  purpose of  mapping the stellar density is to understand how the  features we see in  the halo and disk form and evolve.<br /><br />We used  stars from the Sloan  Digital Sky Survey that were on the northern side  of the Galactic plane.  We mapped the spatial density of the stars in  three large tidal streams in  the halo. One of them, the Perpendicular  Stream, was a new discovery. We  also mapped the spatial density of a  background of stars that were not  in these streams. We counted how many  stars are in each of these  components of the stellar halo, and found  the shape of each component.  The density functions were fit using  MilkyWay@home. MilkyWay@home uses  contributed computer processors from  tens of thousands of volunteers at  any given time. We need a large  number of processors because we fit  complicated functions with twenty  or more parameters to the data.<br /><br />We  showed that we could use  information about the positions of stars in  tidal streams to determine  how much dark matter was in the original  dwarf galaxy that fell into  the Milky Way. Although no one has been  successful in detecting dark  matter directly, we think it exists because  stars move as if pulled by  the gravitational force of some unseen  matter. By studying tidal  streams of stars, we hope to better understand  the dark matter in dwarf  galaxies that fall into the Milky Way. We can  also study the dark  matter in our own galaxy. This work also used  MilkyWay@home to run  simulations of dwarf galaxies falling into our  galaxy. Using these  simulations, we could find the dwarf galaxy shape  that makes a tidal  stream that looks like the actual stream.<br /><br />We  looked at the  velocities of disk stars that are close to the Sun.  Although these  stars are on mostly circular orbits around the Milky Way,  there are  small differences from the circular orbit. These differences  vary from  place to place in the disk. The velocity and density  differences move  like waves through the disk. It is believed that these  waves are caused  by dwarf galaxies falling into our galaxy. As a dwarf  galaxy falls in,  it makes waves in the disk star component and then it  gets pulled  apart by the Milky Way's gravity into tidal streams.<br /><br />We  also  studied the Virgo Overdensity, which is a very large concentration  of  stars in the Milky Way halo. Previous authors have found many groups  of  stars in the Virgo Overdensity that are moving in the same  direction.  Many tidal streams have also been found in the Virgo  Overdensity. We  matched velocity data from the Gaia satellite with  information from  previous surveys to find the three-dimensional  positions and velocities  of stars. We then showed that all of the  previously discovered moving  groups and streams were actually stars from  a single dwarf galaxy. This  dwarf galaxy was pulled apart when it fell  through the center of our  galaxy. We called this event the Virgo Radial  Merger (VRM). We believe  that this merger event is the same one that  made the Gaia sausage,  which is a similar merger event that was found by  other astronomers  using stars near the Sun.
