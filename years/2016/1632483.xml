<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project allows for the realization of a commercial millimeter-scale intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring product that can help neurosurgeons in treating patients with hydrocephalus. While the goal of this SBIR Phase II project is the development of said ICP monitor, the technology can also be translated to the development of 'smart dust', opening up the next generation of computing paradigm. This will mark a significant milestone towards massive-scale realization of internet of things, dramatically accelerating the technology adoption and research impact of millimeter-scale wireless sensor nodes. The technology adoption can be introduced to multiple markets including, but not limited to, medical, industrial, and consumer spaces. This would open up many new commercial opportunities that were previously limited by energy consumption and size, heralding a new era of computing in an unprecedented form factor and lifetime.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project focuses on the development of a millimeter-scale intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring for improved treatment of hydrocephalus. Hydrocephalus is a condition in which cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) builds up in the brain's ventricle area, causing head enlargement, epilepsy, and death. The only practical treatment for hydrocephalus is surgical implant of medical shunts, which relieves excess CSF to other parts of the body. The biggest problem with existing shunts is that they lack any embedded monitoring feature. Once the shunt is installed, there is no way to measure the internal pressure outside of hospital settings. The proposed monitor enables a 'smart shunt' solution, which continuously records ICP information inside the shunt for many years. This data is read out wirelessly and can be used to prevent shunt failures and improve the treatment of this lifelong disease.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>CubeWorks, Inc. has successfully researched and developed the CubiSens? TS100 an Ultra-Small Implantable Wireless Temperature Sensor. The CubiSens? TS100 brings a whole new dimension of size and functionality to temperature monitoring for environmental, biological, and research applications. What makes the TS100 so amazing is not just its size (7.5 x 7.5 x 4.2 mm), but its ability to in real time monitor, log and transmit temperature data to our gateway up to 100 meters away. The TS100 is encapsulated in bio-compatible epoxy and fully programmable to accurately measure temperature within 0.1?C as often as once a second. What?s more, this tiny smart sensor can run for up to two years depending on how it is programmed. The TS100 is ideal for animal model in vivo studies and, due to its size and construction, requires minimal incision for implantation, enabling breakthroughs in biomedical science in spaces such as alcohol and drug abuse, fertility cycles, behavioral activities, metabolism, and genetic diseases. We achieved this by leveraging our ultra-low power circuit designs, allowing us to miniaturize the TS100?s energy source. By combining our CubiSens platform with the energy source and assembling the TS100 with miniaturization in mind has allowed us to produce the world?s smallest and longest lasting independently monitoring implantable wireless temperature sensor.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 03/19/2021<br>      Modified by: Zhiyoong&nbsp;Foo</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Image         </div> <div class="galControls onePhoto" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation onePhoto" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1632483/1632483_10460682_1616162688369_CubeWorks-TS100-202--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1632483/1632483_10460682_1616162688369_CubeWorks-TS100-202--rgov-800width.jpg" title="CubiSens TS100"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1632483/1632483_10460682_1616162688369_CubeWorks-TS100-202--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="CubiSens TS100"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">CubiSens TS100</div> <div class="imageCredit">CubeWorks, Inc.</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Zhiyoong&nbsp;Foo</div> <div class="imageTitle">CubiSens TS100</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
