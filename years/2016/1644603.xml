<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project derives from the ability to enhance the status of cells and tissues for more effective therapies in regenerative medicine to treat a variety of diseases.  Moreover, emerging drug treatments in areas such as cardiovascular disease and cancer can be optimized. This approach will be more efficient than direct and difficult-to-control animal studies.  Thus at a societal level, the proposed technology has the potential to rapidly bring robust treatments to millions of patients with critical health problems.  The commercial impact of this project is expected to be most substantial in the pharmaceutical and regenerative medicine industry wherein during the product development phase conventional animal studies which are very expensive and time-consuming can be significantly reduced.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project focuses on a device that can grow cells and tissues under any combination of flow, stretch and flexure (FSF) mechanical loads.  The device, the FSF bioreactor system provides a platform for advanced cell biomanufacturing in regenerative medicine by regulating the fate of stem cells.  It can also be used as a cardiovascular model system to objectively evaluate the efficacy of pharmaceutical agents while being subjected to the mechanical conditions of the human circulation.  Under a combination of flow and cyclic flexure states as well as under pulsatile flow settings, the system has already demonstrated that stem cells convert to cells exhibiting cardiovascular characteristics.  Moreover, it has also been shown that the underlying driver of this conversion is oscillations in the fluid flow, which the FSF bioreactor is able to facilitate and regulate.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The intellectual merits of this work are to utilize our technology (a mechanical conditioning device known as a Flow-Stretch-Flex bioreactor) to identify mechanical conditioning protocols that lead to optimal in vitro growth of cells and tissues for cardiovascular applications. The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project derives from the ability to enhance the status of cells and tissues for more effective therapies in regenerative medicine, to treat a variety of diseases.  This will reduce the time and expense in bringing effective therapies to treat cardiovascular diseases to the clinic, thereby saving lives.  This project outcomes were three-fold.  First, from over 130 interviews including various individuals working in regenerative medicine in industry and in hospitals as well as with key opinion leaders, we recognized that the true potential of the device in the context of commercialization was in generating cell and tissue based products for cardiovascular medicine that could be optimized using our bioreactor.  Moreover, a service-type model appeared to be an initial route to commercialize the work.  Additional value to this technology would be gained by collaborating with top researchers in the field to develop breakthrough therapies that could be publicized in prominent journals.  Therefore, joint therapeutic scientific discovery could be a second strategy for revenue-generation. A key enabling next step is to secure additional Federal funding to either (i) develop a practical and viable cell/tissue based product using our bioreactor or (ii) collaborate with top scientists to use our bioreactor to optimize their therapy for a specific cardiovascular disease.   The second key outcome of the current work was to revise our FSF bioreactor to a "Version 2" which incorporated a number of revisions that made it much simpler to use, so it could be employed routinely with minimal training, and without the risk of contamination.  These new features will enable us to proceed to (i) and/or (ii) stated above.  Finally, this project experience led the team to recognize that their University (Florida International University - FIU) and its surrounding community with a majority-minority population in Miami-Dade County were under-exposed to the I-Corps process.  As a result, the third outcome of this work is a 2-course sequence (over 2 semesters) adopting I-Corps methodology on Experiential Innovation.  The courses are currently under development by the PI and the Industry Mentor of the team and will be co-taught by the same two individuals starting Fall (August) 2018. The course targets undergraduate students with an intention to expose the I-Corps culture to individuals beginning their University journey.  This will ensure that the know-how to test the commercial potential of an idea/technology and if applicable, the procedures to bring it to the market can be instilled early.
