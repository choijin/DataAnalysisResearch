<AbstractNarration>1619915&lt;br/&gt;Liu&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The metal chromium has many applications in society. However, when disposed of improperly, it can also find its way into ground and surface waters. While this usually happens in trace quantities, at higher concentrations it may cause adverse health effects.  It cycles between two oxidation states and is toxic in the hexavalent form. This project involves a theoretically sound, but high-risk, untested approach with significant potential impact, to develop a new method of detection of chromium in water. This project will create a new rotating ring-disk electrodes-based tool with the potential to transform the environmental engineering community's understanding of chemical processes that relate to water quality, public health, and regulatory processes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This EAGER project will develop a novel in situ electrochemical tool for the detection of chromium intermediate species during the oxidation of trivalent chromium Cr(III) species in drinking water. Formation of highly toxic hexavalent chromium Cr(VI, typically in the form of oxyanion CrO4 2-,  can inadvertently take place in drinking water due to the oxidation of residual Cr(III) by disinfectants. However, the mechanisms of Cr(III) oxidation remain largely unexplored. Preliminary investigations in the principal investigator's (PI's) laboratory indicates that the yield of Cr(VI) is controlled by elemental reactions involving the formation of Cr intermediate species, followed by the associated decomposition of these intermediate species. This project aims to develop a novel electrochemical system with multi-stage rotating ring-disk electrodes to quantitatively investigate the formation of short-lived tetravalent and pentavalent chromium species, i.e., Cr(IV) and Cr(V). Currently, the detailed mechanisms of Cr(VI) formation via Cr(III) oxidation are poorly understood. Although it is widely presumed that the low solubility of Cr(III) prevents its release in drinking water and that Cr(III) is chemically inert downstream of water treatment processes, these presumptions are inadequate. Since Cr(VI) is under consideration by regulatory agencies for more stringent drinking water standards, it is urgent to understand the fundamental mechanisms of Cr(VI) formation to develop better control strategies. This research will assess the role of these intermediate species relevant to Cr(VI) occurrence in drinking water. Specifically, in this project, two novel and advanced electrode systems will be developed to examine the nature of Cr intermediate species: (1) state-of-the-art noble metal electrodes (i.e., gold and platinum) for homogeneous Cr(III) oxidation investigation; and, (2) in-house built electrode with deposited Cr(III) minerals for heterogeneous Cr(III) oxidation investigation. Outcomes of this research will establish a protocol for rotating ring-disk electrodes-based electrochemical analysis of chromium intermediates and exploration of fundamental mechanisms associated with Cr(VI) formation.  Outcomes of this research will establish a protocol for rotating ring-disk electrodes-based electrochemical analysis of chromium intermediates and exploration of fundamental mechanisms associated with Cr(VI) formation in aquatic systems. The project involves a radically different electrochemical approach in contrast to a traditional batch reactor system to study metal redox chemistry, and applies new expertise of surface electrochemistry and analytical chemistry to engage novel discoveries in a new area of research.</AbstractNarration>
