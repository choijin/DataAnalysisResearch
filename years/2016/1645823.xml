<AbstractNarration>The International Conference on Intelligent Biology and Medicine (ICIBM) aims to create opportunities for advancing information science, technology, and education to a varied and diverse audience, including trainees, faculty, teachers, scientists, and engineers, and to provide a forum for the cross-fertilization of ideas. ICIBM 2016 promotes the education of next generation of bioinformatics, systems biology, and intelligent computing scientists with frontier technologies and knowledge, as well as advances informatics research in complex biological systems and translational, agricultural, environmental, pharmaceutical, zoological, and data sciences. In the era of big data, it is the time to promote the fundamental concepts of data science, molecular biotechnology, genomics, and systems biology for researchers seeking to understand living organisms at multiple levels, to explore complex and dynamic functions and regulation in cellular systems, and to improve algorithms, computational tools, knowledgebase, and biotechniques for better diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of diseases. Support of ICIBM will fund opportunities that include the promotion of interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary education and research, especially for underrepresented groups, such as women, minorities, and students with disabilities, and the introduction of new initiatives and cutting-edge collaboration.  The commitment to education and diversity through the inclusion of underrepresented students and other trainees, as well as the conference?s unique training opportunities, drives the establishment of a culturally and professionally diverse Trainee Committee comprised of minority students. This dedication, in combination with the conference?s unique training opportunities, makes ICIBM 2016 an unprecedented platform for higher education of diverse students in interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary scientific fields.</AbstractNarration>

ICIBM 2016 included four workshops or tutorials, four keynote lectures, four conference invited talks, eight concurrent scientific sessions (total of 55 presentations) and a poster session for fifty-three accepted abstracts, covering current topics in bioinformatics, systems biology, intelligent computing, and biomedical informatics. The eight presentation sessions were structured for researchers to showcase their recent innovative work in the areas of bioinformatics, systems biology, medical informatics, and intelligent computing. These eight regular sessions were: Genome Structure Analysis and Visualization, NGS Analysis and Tools I, Computational Drug Discovery, Medical Informatics and Big Data, NGS Analysis and Tools II, Cancer Genomics, Systems Biology, and Big Data and Machine Learning.
