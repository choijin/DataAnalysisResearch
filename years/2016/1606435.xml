The title of the project for this fellowship to Nathaniel Bottman is Functoriality for Fukaya Categories of Symplectic Manifolds. The host institution for the fellowship is Princeton University, and the sponsoring scientist is Helmut Hofer.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The PI works in the field of symplectic geometry. His project concerns the Fukaya category, an invariant of a symplectic manifold which encodes an intersection theory of the Lagrangian submanifolds. In a series of papers mostly completed during the award period, the PI proposed a specific method to implement a complete version of functoriality for the Fukaya category, and made significant progress toward this goal. He laid the groundwork for a new plan to construct a hierarchy of composition operations amongst Fukaya categories of different symplectic manifolds. This will enable the construction of a single algebraic object, the "symplectic (A-infinity,2)-category Symp", which binds together the Fukaya categories of symplectic manifolds into a single structure.  Besides this central component, the PI's project involved three other strands:  (1) Compute portions of Symp in some concrete situations.  (2) Explore the connections to (a) algebraic geometry and (b) algebraic topology and higher category theory.  (3) Understand the ramifications of Symp for symplectic cohomology, an important invariant of a noncompact symplectic manifold.  The PI made significant progress toward these goals during the award period. Briefly, using the numbering from the list of papers below:  * In 1 and 2, the PI demonstrated that pseudoholomorphic quilts satisfy some of the basic analytic properties that are necessary for the construction of Symp to be a possibility.  * In 3, 4, and 8, the PI built and explored a collection of abstract polytopes, called 2-associahedra, which form the combinatorial core of Symp. In 6, he used the 2-associahedra to define the notion of an (A-infinity,2)-category, of which Symp is an example.  * In 5, the PI developed a computational technique for computing certain structure maps in Symp, and made two calculations as proofs of concept.  * In 7, the PI demonstrated a connection with algebraic geometry, which he intends to continue studying in future work with A. Oblomkov.  Papers produced during the award period:  8. "The 2-associahedra are Eulerian." N. Bottman, D. Mavrides. Submitted. Preprint posted in 2019. 10 pp.  7.
