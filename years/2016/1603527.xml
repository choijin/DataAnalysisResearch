<AbstractNarration>This award provides funding for the Canada-US summer  (Centre de Recherches Mathématique) school on "Spectral theory and applications," to be held at Université Laval, in Québec City, CA  from July 4 to July 14, 2016.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference focuses on recent developments in Analysis, especially in the fields of elliptic differential equations, quantum mechanics, and computational spectral theory.  A number of distinguished mathematicians have agreed to attend and speak at this conference. The award gives early career researchers, researchers who are members of underrepresented groups, researchers not funded by NSF a chance to attend and participate in this conference.  The organizing committee will strive to make this funding opportunity known to target groups through a number of different activities.

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The major goal of the project was to run a summer school on spectral theory, from July 4th to July 14th 2016. The school was aimed at senior undergraduate and beginning graduate students and was organized by the mathematics faculty at Universite Laval and the University of South Florida in Tampa. The goal of the school was to give an overview of a selection of topics from Spectral Theory, interpreted in a broad sense. It covered topics from pure and applied mathematics.  At the summer school, there were six mini-courses, complemented by supervised  computer  labs  and exercise sessions. In addition, five invited speakers gave hour-long specialized talks. The school brought together over fifty undergraduates, graduates and postdocs, hailing from Canada, France, Israel, Italy, Mexico, Russia, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, United Kingdom and the USA. Supporting the travel of promising undergraduate and graduate students to such an event where scientists from North America, Europe and Asia, old and young, prominent and just beginning, were essentially spending 24 hours together in an inspiring and congenial environment, discussing appealing and important problems in mathematics and physics, certainly encouraged many younger students to pursue some of these topics in their future research.  The subject matter covered by the topics of the school incorporated a broad territory between analysis, numerical and applied mathematics, and physics, as is evidenced by the work of all the teachers of the mini-courses. The attractiveness of the topics chosen for the school and the minimality of background needed to participate enabled the summer school to serve as a significant outreach vehicle to attract and retain STEM students into modern mathematics and applications. Because the summer school was 11 days long and thanks to the afternoon problem and computer sessions, there was a significant opportunity for students to develop lasting working relationships with each other and with the mini-course leaders.
