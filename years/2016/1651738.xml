<AbstractNarration>Quantitative literacy is becoming increasingly important not only to STEM-related careers but in the everyday lives of Americans. Educators, policy makers, and others are calling into question the United States' ability to compete globally if the next generations of citizens are not better prepared for a world that relies more on big data, analytics, computation, and problem-solving skills. This project, with the leadership team from the Transforming Post-Secondary Education in Mathematics (TPSE Math) group, will convene a conference of mathematics department chairs and academic leaders from a diverse pool of postsecondary institutions throughout the country. The conference will catalyze reforms both (1) within mathematics, lowering barriers, raising completion rates, and realigning lower division pathways, and (2) between mathematics and other fields, creating upper division pathways that better meet the career demands of students and employers and reshapes the role of mathematics in society and the workplace. A central premise of TPSE Math is that underrepresented segments of society, as marked by gender, ethnicity, and socio-economic status, must become full partners in this effort in order to strengthen the nation's intellectual capacity and economic leadership.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The project known as Transforming Post-Secondary Education in Mathematics, or TPSE Math, was initiated in 2013 to help coordinate and share leadership in efforts to improve post-secondary mathematics education in the United States.  The formation of TPSE Math was prompted by challenging issues of long standing, including inequities of opportunity for students from disadvantaged backgrounds; low student retention and completion rates; rapid growth in numbers of students without increases in staff; demand by students for curriculum pathways more relevant to careers; and a desire for broader preparation of graduate students who enter non-academic careers.   With the help of a consultant and many members of the math community, including professional math organizations, TPSE Math has sought to respond to these opportunities through four strategic priorities:     In lower division curricula, create multiple pathways that offer choices that better fit students? interests, improve completion rates, and raise academic success; In upper division curricula, offer more diverse and flexible pathways with greater relevance to modern careers; For all undergraduates, evaluate and promote new teaching and learning technologies and methods; For graduate students, broaden training so as to equip them for more diverse careers in teaching, industry, business, and government.      Projects under the first priority are underway in partnership with APLU, AASCU, NASH, and the Dana Center of the University of Texas at Austin. The other priorities are being pursued in partnership with members of the math community and outside stakeholders.  This grant supported the first of two "Chairs Plus One" conferences. The day-and-a-half convening, held at the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) headquarters in Washington in October 2016, featured a series of panels focused on lower- and upper-division pathways and on change management, alternating with breakout sessions in which all participants contributed to TPSE Math?s evolving strategies for project development and implementation.  Members of TPSE?s Mathematics Advisory Group (MAG), consisting of 35 math department chairs and professors, served as panelists, discussion leaders and moderators. Each MAG member who participated was accompanied by a "plus one": a dean, provost, other administrator, or faculty member from his or her institution.  Some conference participants had already launched local experiments to implement reforms, and shared their experiences. One TPSE Math objective is to support the expansion of such experiments to a reasonable level of scale, evaluate their outcomes, and provide leadership in recruiting additional partners.             The Chairs Plus One conference demonstrated the leadership abilities of chairs and their eagerness to collaborate with TPSE Math in designing and implementing change; and it confirmed the value of periodic regional meetings as a tool in advancing and evaluating reform strategies.  The meetings also validated another core part of TPSE?s strategy: to work in partnership with all the mathematics societies and associations (i.e., the AMS, MAA, ASA, SIAM, and others, coordinated by the CBMS, the umbrella group for 17 such groups). These organizations have played an increasingly important role in TPSE Math's strategic planning and outreach.       Last Modified: 10/26/2017       Submitted by: Phillip Griffiths]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
