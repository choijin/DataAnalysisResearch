<AbstractNarration>This REU Site award to the University of Massachusetts Boston, located in Boston, MA, will support the training of 10 students for 10 weeks during the summers of 2017-2019. Students are paired with Biology Department faculty members based on mutual scientific interests and conduct intensive research while participating in a research community.  The theme of integrative and evolutionary biology encourages cross-disciplinary research approaches -- including molecular, genetic, population-level, and informatics -- to solving problems in genetics, cell biology, evolution, ecology, and other areas. Specific topics include cell signaling, developmental genetics, control of cellular organization, molecular evolution, marine ecology, and microbial ecology. Direct research experiences are complemented by enrichment activities that bring students together to address broader issues concerning the practice of science.  These include weekly workshops on preparing for graduate school, scientific communication, the ethical conduct of research, and other topics.  Community-building activities include a three-day retreat to the Nantucket Island Field Station and other field trips.  Students apply to the program using an online application system and are selected based on motivation, research potential, and maturity.  Students from underrepresented groups and students from primarily undergraduate institutions are especially encouraged to apply. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is anticipated that a total of 30 students, primarily from schools with limited research opportunities, will be trained in the program. By providing a full-immersion research experience, close mentoring, and a supportive scientific community, the program helps prepare students for advanced study in biology and increases the diversity of the research workforce.  Students will learn how research is conducted, and many will present the results of their work at scientific conferences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A common web-based assessment tool used by all REU Site programs funded by the Division of Biological Infrastructure will be used to determine the effectiveness of the training program. Students will be tracked after the program in order to determine their career paths. Students will be asked to respond to an automatic email sent via the NSF reporting system.

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The REU Site: Research Experiences in Integrative and Evolutionary Biology, was hosted by the Biology Department at the University of Massachusetts Boston during the summers of 2017 to 2019.  The program provided intensive, ten-week research and enrichment experiences to ten undergraduate students each summer, recruited from schools nationwide.  The program aimed to stimulate students’ interest and confidence in research in the biological sciences, enrich their understanding of the research enterprise, and provide them with some of the scientific skills needed to pursue research careers.  The ultimate goal was to help prepare and diversity the science workforce.  The program especially targeted students from underrepresented minority groups, from schools with limited research opportunities, and/or from disadvantaged backgrounds.  Each student participant was assigned a faculty mentor who closely supervised the student’s research and, along with the director, monitored her/his progress.  Through intensive engagement in individual research projects, students received focused research training, including training in scientific problem solving and experimental design.  Research experiences were complemented by a comprehensive program of career-development and community-building activities, which taught professional skills and fostered a collegial research community.  Highlights were a foundational ethics component, a retreat at a biological field station on Nantucket Island, discussion of how prepare for graduate school, and a final Research Symposium at which students presented the results of their work to the larger university community.  Intellectual Merit:   The theme of integrative and evolutionary biology inspired students to consider biological problems at various scales and to use cross-disciplinary approaches in research.  The individual research projects emphasized the application of molecular, genomic, and evolutionary approaches to a variety of critical, contemporary problems in biology.  The diverse research problems explored included genome organization and molecular evolution, control of cellular organization, cell signaling, developmental genetics, neurobiology, molecular microbial ecology, ecosystem ecology, urban ecology, biodiversity and ecoinformatics, microbiomes and disease ecology, and evolution in the deep sea.  The ethics component, which focused on the responsible conduct of research, provided another key intellectual focus&mdash;by analyzing ethical dilemmas in research, students developed critical-thinking skills as applied to the conduct of research.  Students gained additional training through a research skills mini-course as well as workshops on topics such as science communication, bioinformatics, experimental design, internet resources in biology, applying to graduate school, and careers in science.  Broader Impacts:  This project contributed to the development of a diverse and well-trained science workforce.  It helped to broaden the participation in science of underrepresented groups, especially minorities underrepresented in science, students from disadvantaged backgrounds, and students with limited access to research opportunities.  The program impacted not only the cohort of REU participants but also the underserved urban student population of UMass Boston.  The majority of UMass Boston undergraduates are low-income, first generation college students, and the school has the highest percentage of minority students of all four-year, degree-granting institutions in New England.  By providing mentor training and by contributing to the overall undergraduate research enterprise, the REU program benefited many science students, faculty mentors, and graduate students in the participating labs at the University.  The program was also able to positively impact REU students’ home institutions, especially those with limited research activities.
