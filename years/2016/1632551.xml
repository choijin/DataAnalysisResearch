<AbstractNarration>This NSF award provides partial support for U.S. participation in the international conference on knots, low-dimensional topology and applications, titled "Knots in Hellas 2016," to be held at the International Olympic Academy, Ancient Olympia, Greece, from July 17 through July 23, 2016.  This cross-disciplinary conference will enable the exchange of methods and ideas as well as the exploration of fundamental research problems in the wide fields of knot theory and low-dimensional topology, from theory to applications to the life and physical sciences such as biology, chemistry and physics, as well as to engineering.  It will provide opportunity for high quality interactions across fields and for generations of researchers, from graduate students to senior scientists. Graduate students and new PhD's working in these fields are especially encouraged to participate.  This project will enable the participation of roughly twenty outstanding US based young researchers in the conference fields that might not otherwise be able to benefit from this exposure to cutting edge research relevant to their interests or be able to present the results of their own efforts on an international stage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Knot theory is a core area of topology that interacts significantly with many fields across theoretical and applied mathematics.  Knots in Hellas 2016 brings together researchers from the whole spectrum of such research.  This project will expose at least twenty excellent US based graduate students to cutting edge research relevant to their interests. The conference will feature plenary lectures, research sessions, and tutorial workshops providing focused research introduction for graduate students and young participants. The focal topics include the wide range of historical and contemporary invariants of knots and links and related topics such as virtual knots, topological quantum field theory, skein modules and algebras, quandles and their homology, knot algebras; braids and orderability of groups; hyperbolic knots and geometric structures of three dimensional manifolds; physical knots with applications to fluid flows, polymer and biophysics, DNA enzyme mechanisms, protein structure and function, and biochemistry. The program will be organized so as to facilitate inter-disciplinary discussions and research interactions. The program, size, and location of this international cross-disciplinary conference is ideal to enable exploration of fundamental problems, exchange of ideas, methods and contemporary and developing research problems, and to provide high quality interactions across fields and generations of researchers, from graduate students to the most senior researchers.

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  Knots in Hellas 2016: Knots, Low-Dimensional Topology and Applications was an international research congress held at The International Olympic Academy, Olympia, Greece from July 17 through 23, 2016.  There were 143 international participants from 23 countries, including 104 speakers and about 20 poster presenters.  The objective of this project was to insure the participation of 20 excellent USA-based graduate students and recent PhDs doing research in relevant fields who might otherwise be unable to benefit from this international research event in which to showcase their research and have the opportunity to engage with leading researchers from across the globe.   Sixteen outstanding USA-based graduate students and four recent (within 5 years) PhDs were selected. Nineteen participated, with 26% female representation.  Fourteen of the supported participants presented their research, with several also presenting posters, thereby providing them with international exposure that might not have otherwise been possible.  In addition, these participants were actively engaged in research interactions with interested participants from the 23 countries represented.  Their lectures were recorded and are now available on the congress webpage as are a number of the posters that were presented during the meeting.    In addition to presenting their own work, the participants took part in organized networking events with internationally renowned researchers whose work they were studying as students and novice researchers.  The high quality of these interactions proved to be a powerful catalyst re-energizing their efforts and leading, at least anecdotally, to accelerated progress toward their professional goals.  They returned to their home institutions with new ideas and a powerful appreciation for the level of interest in their individual research objectives.
