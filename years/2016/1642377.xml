<AbstractNarration>The Annual ACM International Conference on Bioinformatics and Computational Biology (ACM BCB) is the premier conference in the areas of bioinformatics, computational biology, and biomedical informatics. The 7th ACM BCB 2016 will be held in Seattle WA, Oct.2-5, 2016, (http://acm-bcb.org/). The award will provide support for female keynote speaker and 25 selected students with high priority given to female and minority students and young professionals to participate in the conference. ACM-BCB conference provides a common platform to bridge important interdisciplinary research areas in computer science, mathematics, statistics, biology, bioinformatics, and biomedicine and an interactive forum which brings together experienced researchers, practitioners, and students from around the world to promote scientific understanding and findings in bioscience. Students will learn about advanced knowledge in bioinformatics and computational biology, enhance their knowledge in the cutting edge inter/multidisciplinary fields, and participate in special student activities aimed. To promote broad participation in this event, ACM BCB includes the "women in bioinformatics" initiative that aims to recruit and engage young female students and researchers in this interdisciplinary area. ACM BCB 2016 is inviting a distinguished female keynote speaker whose experience and success may inspire many students, especially underrepresented minorities and women, to enter this exciting field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ACM-BCB conference is a leading venue for presenting results and building a bioinformatics and computational biology community. The presented papers will appear will be included in the ACM BCB 2016 proceedings published by ACM Digital Library. To enhance the results dissemination, the authors of selected papers will be invited to adapt their papers for publication in a special issue of IEEE/ACM Transactions on Computational Biology and Bioinformatics (TCBB), or a special issue of IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics (J-BHI).</AbstractNarration>
