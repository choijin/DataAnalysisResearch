<AbstractNarration>The lack of appropriate instructional materials at the undergraduate level for laboratory techniques presents a significant barrier to increasing student access to and knowledge of analytical skills necessary to succeed in the geosciences and other STEM fields.  This project will create and evaluate five open access online learning modules for laboratory methods and scientific inquiry skills.  These materials will initially be evaluated in courses at a four-year university (JMU) and a minority-serving two-year college (NOVA).  The community-based review, evaluation, contribution, and further testing of these modules in various types of classrooms will create a forum for sharing ideas among geoscience and STEM faculty who wish to incorporate analytical methods into courses using robust peer-reviewed online teaching resources.  The modular format will provide flexibility for instructors to use as few or as many units as needed for a specific course or student research experience.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Five learning modules will be created that represent commonly available analytical methods as well as techniques available at both JMU and NOVA.  These units will include gas and water plumbing, petrographic microscopes, thin sectioning equipment, energy-dispersive spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and Raman and infrared spectroscopies.  Scientific inquiry skills will be embedded into the content modules, and will include creating and testing protocols, evaluating data quality and error, and synthesizing data.  To benefit the larger geosciences and STEM community, the modules will be published on an open educational resource (OER) courseware site.  Module structure and content will align with active, inquiry-based learning theories, and will include video mini-lectures, individual and group quizzes and assignments, expository materials in video or animation formats, video tours of equipment and laboratories, and instructor resources.  This project will improve geosciences and STEM learning by establishing effective practices for integrating open educational resources into research-based instructional units in geoscience and STEM courses involving the use of analytical equipment.  The assessment plan will include formative and summative evaluations of student learning and attitudes within required and elective courses in geosciences and STEM at JMU and NOVA, as well as module reviews by geoscience community members outside of these institutions.  Evaluation will focus on the effects of open educational resources and a blended learning course format upon student retention of analytical methods and instrumentation skills, student mastery of scientific inquiry skills, and student attitude and competencies towards conducting research with analytical equipment.  The protocol established by this study will be used to create additional modules on other analytical techniques in the future, and will be a template the STEM community may use to develop other online learning resources.</AbstractNarration>

To ensure the fulfillment of the goals for this IUSE project, the principal investigators conducted formative evaluation on a regular basis and incorporated interdisciplinary peer review and novel formats for feedback in an open-access platform such as Google Analytics and Pressbooks comments sections. These design research results contribute to the broad impacts of OER creation for IUSE.     Student learning outcomes included increased confidence in using equipment, student perceived gains regarding reflection, increased discussion, and confidence in laboratory-based learning as intellectual merits of this project. A scientific analytic writing rubric was developed as a result of this project for learning assessment.     Little research has previously been done for OER use in lab-based STEM courses, so the project had many instructional design and project management outcomes, as results from interdisciplinary collaboration.  We developed a formative evaluation process during development, modified inquiry-based learning techniques to apply to online resources accessed by individuals, documented protocols for development of accessible videos, and described the structure and challenges of project management and updates for OER.  We discovered that traditional data collection such as surveys and lab observations would need more mixed methods of data collection, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, and that using metadata enhances searchability of OER.    The dissemination of OER was the key to their sustainable adaptation in blended learning. We organized and ran two workshops (at American Geophysical Union and Earth Educators’ Rendezvous meetings) and presented twice at American Educational Research Associations (AERA) to introduce OER concepts, inquiry-based approaches to OER, and interactive technologies to more than 40 geoscience instructors and nearly 50 educational researchers. As part of the workshops, we invited participants to peer-review our OER materials.     The materials were viewed by tens of thousands of unique users, and during the COVID-19 pandemic usage totalled thousands of users per month.  The OER format increased accessibility to content and inquiry-based thinking during a time of predominantly online courses.     The interactive OER format allows removal of significant barriers to accessing costly learning materials and limited and expensive lab equipment. The adapted inquiry-based learning model provides a flexible approach for blended learning adaptation of these OER in undergraduate learning and research. With the knowledge gained from this study on readily-made and reusable OER, instructors will be able to create active learning and research experiences for students to access skills and knowledge necessary to succeed in the geosciences and other STEM fields.
