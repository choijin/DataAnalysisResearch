<AbstractNarration>PART 1: NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The properties of various polymeric materials depend on the structure at the nanoscale.  As a consequence, characterizing the arrangement and order of polymers at nanometer length scales is crucial for the continued development of new materials.  Much progress in this area is due to the application of advanced microscopy techniques (transmission electron microscopy) to complex polymeric systems in order to resolve the structure at  very high resolutions.  New developments in electron microscopy instrumentation are pushing the limits of what is possible, but these advances have not been tailored for the microscopy of polymers, which are very sensitive to electron beams and undergo rapid damage.  This project will develop electron microscopy tools to image the structure of electrically conducting polymers used in a variety of emerging electronic applications, such as transistors and solar cell devices.  By demonstrating new approaches for resolving the morphology with sub-nanometer resolution, this research will advance the fundamental science of how the chemical composition of polymers leads to the microstructure and aid in the development of polymers for flexible electronics applications.  Furthermore, integrated educational and research activities will also include recruitment and retention of students from underrepresented groups.  The investigators involved in this project will further support diversity in engineering education by offering mentorship and research experiences to undergraduate students.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PART 2: TECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will develop advanced electron microscopy tools for the study of polymeric materials.  New methods to generate contrast in the electron microscope are warranted because of the complexity of the microstructure of conjugated polymer systems.  The proposed work begins by examining radiation damage in the transmission electron microscope using two observables: diffraction intensities and low-loss electron energy-loss spectroscopy.  These measurements will guide further experiments and establish limits of imaging modalities.  Low-loss energy-filtered transmission electron microscopy will generate high-resolution images of long-range order in conjugated polymers.  Phase plates will enhance contrast in both bright-field and focused-probe modes to enable imaging of polymer/fullerene mixtures, polymer blends, and block copolymers used in photovoltaics.  Furthermore, charge transport heterogeneity will be examined using low-loss spectrum imaging to see deviations in density of states under bias, and by imaging local variations in electric fields that result from charge heterogeneity using a phase plate.  Overall, this proposal will demonstrate the utility of monochromated electron sources and phase plates for imaging of conjugated polymers.  Educational objectives are motivated by the need to enhance diversity in engineering.  A number of specific programs will be implemented encompassing recruitment, retention, and mentoring of underrepresented groups.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Recent instrumentation advances in transmission electron microscopes (TEM) have opened the door for new types of experiments to image the microstructure of organic materials.  As such, these advances have the potential to revolutionize our understanding of how controlling the chemical structure of polymers can lead to new applications in electronics, health, and energy.  Overall, this award has led to nine publications, one PhD, and about eight research experiences for undergraduates.    A main accomplishment of the work is centered on elucidating the role of the three-dimensional microstructure on the transport properties of water filtration membranes.  The approach developed for quantitatively extracting image intensities can reveal heterogeneity in polymer density within filtration membranes.  Further work is needed to connect these 3D intensity variations to differences in local polymer density.  This project has also outlined the key steps for successful elemental mapping of polymers in the TEM, which is the imaging of elemental composition with nanometer resolution.  Clearly pointing out the challenges and opportunities of advanced instrumentation will likely lead to new accomplishments in the microscopy of materials that are sensitive to radiation damage.    Mapping the sulfur concentration of the active layer in polymer solar cells has revealed a universal motif for the nanoscale morphology.  The donor polymer phase separates through crystallization, leading to fibril-like microstructures (where fibril are about 10 to 20 nm in diameter), which are surrounded by an acceptor.  This has been demonstrated to be true even with both fullerene and non-fullerene acceptors.    This project has also made significant accomplishments in the mechanism of radiation damage in the TEM for conjugated polymers.  A slow secondary processes was revealed to be significant, where reacting species are generated through interactions with the electron beam that then go on to damage a wide region of samples.  The use of antioxidants and cryogenic conditions was also demonstrated to suppress this mechanism, and thereby enable high-resolution image of polymer microstructure.  With this approach, the pi-stacking of solution-processable conjugated polymers can be directly imaged.    Educational efforts have focused on providing opportunities for undergraduate students, mentoring of students from underrepresented groups, and promoting recruitment and retainment of students in engineering.  High school students were exposed to research activities for the first time through a collaboration with the Spend A Summer Day program at Penn State.  We enhanced First Year Seminar engineering courses to deliver messages from Changing the Conversation, a publication by the National Academy of Engineering.  The hypothesis is that altruist messages are more appealing to students, and therefore can enhance both recruitment and retention.  Furthermore, research results from this project provided examples of how molecular structure of polymers affects macroscopic properties that were shared through a junior/senior Chemical Engineering course, Introduction to Polymer Science.
