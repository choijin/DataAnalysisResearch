<AbstractNarration>TECHNICAL AND NONTECHNICAL ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;Funds in the amount of $2,540 are requested to support the registration fee and travel expenses of attendees at the Symposium on "New Chemistries towards Functional Polymeric Materials" to be held at the 2016 Southern Regional meeting of the ACS (SERMACS) in South Carolina October 23-26, 2016. The symposium will cover the latest progress in using chemistry strategies for developing functional polymeric materials, including monomer design, synthesis, polymerization methodologies for architecture and composition control, and the chemical modification of polymers. The symposium provides a platform for the exchange of expertise and ideas by academic and industrial organic chemistry and polymer scientists from the southeastern region, and having an educational impact on attending graduate students as well as postdocs.</AbstractNarration>
