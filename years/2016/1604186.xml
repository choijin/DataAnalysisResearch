<AbstractNarration>Non-Technical Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project addresses the arrangement and properties of arrays of nanoscale magnets fabricated&lt;br/&gt;by lithography methods. The fundamental physics component will investigate, both by&lt;br/&gt;experiment and modeling, the stable magnetic configuration of such arrays subject to different&lt;br/&gt;perturbations introduced by different magnetic underlayers. It will also investigate the possibility&lt;br/&gt;of (a) using such arrays for next generation magnetic recording media for information storage, and&lt;br/&gt;(b) developing a magnetic approach for logic function in information processing. &lt;br/&gt;We will study interactions that can provide much needed additional freedom to&lt;br/&gt;engineer new properties, functionalities and applications. This proposal will also enable the PI to &lt;br/&gt;combine the simultaneous advancement of discovery with teaching, training, learning, and if appropriate, commercialization.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Technical Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Single domain, nanoscale magnetic elements, fabricated by lithography, and patterned into&lt;br/&gt;ordered arrays, form excellent magnetic metamaterials with unusual properties. Typically, their&lt;br/&gt;behavior is dominated by macroscopic inter-element dipolar interactions, but here in addition, we&lt;br/&gt;propose microscopic exchange interactions to provide much needed additional freedom to&lt;br/&gt;engineer new properties, functionalities and applications in three distinct areas:&lt;br/&gt;(1) Geometrical frustration in a lattice of nanoscale ferromagnetic islands with dipolar interactions,&lt;br/&gt;leads to the formation of a spin-ice configuration; here we propose to investigate the materials&lt;br/&gt;physics and magnetic configuration of a spin-ice metamaterial, including its thermodynamic phase&lt;br/&gt;transitions, coupled through underlayers where the interactions between the nanoelements of the&lt;br/&gt;spin lattice are dominated by lateral exchange bias (EB). The EB, along different well-defined&lt;br/&gt;crystallographic directions, can also be added to the system at different stages of the spin-ice&lt;br/&gt;configurational evolution.&lt;br/&gt;(2) Alternatively, each element in the metamaterial can be a multilayer, with intra-element&lt;br/&gt;exchange interactions; the magnetic performance of such exchange exchange-coupled composite&lt;br/&gt;metamaterial, fabricated in large-area arrays by nanoimprint lithography, will be optimized for bitpatterned&lt;br/&gt;media.&lt;br/&gt;(3) Magnetic quantum cellular automata (MQCA) in specific nanomagnetic arrays to process&lt;br/&gt;information and perform Boolean logic operations is a promising alternative to CMOS technology.&lt;br/&gt;We will design and construct, for the first time, exchange-coupled logic gates that perform&lt;br/&gt;elementary Boolean logic operations, based on a novel design of sub-50nm nanomagnet elements;&lt;br/&gt;two representive gates (AND and OR), will be demonstrated.&lt;br/&gt;Micromagnetic modeling and materials characterization, both routine and advanced, using&lt;br/&gt;electrons, photons and scanning probes, will provide fundamental insight into the structure- property &lt;br/&gt;performance correlation, at appropriate length scales, of all these unique and tailored&lt;br/&gt;metamaterials. This proposal will also enable the PI to combine the simultaneous&lt;br/&gt;advancement of discovery with teaching, training, learning, and if appropriate, commercialization.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Building on our expertise in magnetism, thin film engineering and lithography, we have studied various phenomena involving exchange bias in nanoscale magnetic systems.  Exchange bias (EB) is an effect observed when an antiferromagnetic layer is grown, under well-defined temperature and field conditions, on top of a ferromagnetic layer that causes its hysteresis loop to shift in one direction with respect to the applied field. We extended this unidirectional shift or anistropy caused by EB to the nanoscale and investigated its role in three principal classes of devices -- magnetic logic gates, spin wave propagation and artificial spin ice (ASI).  In magnetic logic, based on micromagnetic simulations we designed the smallest logic gates based on exchange interactions; however, the fabrication of these devices was a challenge to realize given our lithographic capabilities.  Artificial spin ices are arrays of nanomagnets arranged as periodic lattices. Our investigation focused on the use of EB to tune the most stable magnetic configuration (ground state) of a square ASI array.  When exchange-bias is applied over the entire array it acts as a global field, while exchange-bias applied at specific lattice sites provide the local field effects. This applied field breaks the spin reversal symmetry of Fe nanomagnets, alter their energy states and their relaxation dynamics. The local fields applied with different spatial periods is shown to exhibit different magnetic textures which were previously unattainable. Our experimenta findings and interpretations were supported by numerical Monte Carlo and micromagnetic simulations.  The results of ourwork is broadly relevant to the study of frustrated systems such as liquid crystals, low power information and sensing systems, and could form the basis of artificially tunable magnetic devices, potentially leading  to the development of intelligent nanomagnetic logic devices and non-Boolean neuromorphic computation.   We disseminated our results in prestigious academic journals and lectures in various forums. We trained a number of students, including two women, in  STEM disciplines with multidisciplinary expertise in cutting-edge fields of thin film engineering, nanotechnology and magnetism.  Additionally, we developed second-level lithography capabilities at the Washington Nanofabrication Facility - the premier nanofabrication facility in the PNW  -- and shared these protocols with potential benefit for future users of WNF from academia nad industry.
