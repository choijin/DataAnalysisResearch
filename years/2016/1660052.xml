<AbstractNarration>Virtual reality has been around for more than 20 years, but only recently have companies begun to market consumer virtual reality headsets thereby bringing virtual environments to more people than ever before.  The widespread use of this technology has rekindled interest in cybersickness, a problem that has been known and studied since the early days of computer simulation.  The term refers to a cluster of symptoms associated with spending time in a computer generated environment.  Most people are susceptible if immersed for enough time in a virtual environment; symptoms range from a brief bout of nausea to several hours or even days of feeling dizzy and disoriented.  This is funding to support a workshop of 25-30 experts from academia and industry, who will meet for 1.5 days in Spring 2017, on the campus of Design Interactive, Inc. in Orlando, Florida, to tackle the problem of cybersickness from all angles with the goal of successfully bringing virtual reality to the wider audience.  Broader impacts are expected to ultimately include significant advances in medical training, therapy for PTSD, driver safety, and education.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By bringing together leaders in medical research, technology R&amp;D, and industry, the workshop will lay out a roadmap to determine the cause(s) of cybersickness and how it can be prevented.  The discussions will both guide future research and build new partnerships between academia and industry.  Four topics will be addressed: the causes of cybersickness, how to best measure the symptoms, how the symptoms might be mitigated, and what factors determine an individual's susceptibility.  Breakout groups will propose a project for each of these areas that will be developed into a cohesive interdisciplinary proposal that will bridge the gap between research and development.  Workshop outcomes will include a final report summarizing the discussions, a website synthesizing relevant research, and outlines of publications to be included in a special issue of the journal PRESENCE.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This award supported a workshop on adaptive and personalized virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) that was held July 17-18, 2017, at NSF in Washington, D.C., with 38 participants from both academia and industry. The goal was layout the key research challenges that need further investment to make adaptive and personalized VR &amp; AR a reality. "Adaptive and personalized" means that the technology would adapt to each person, so that everyone from children to older adults could use it, with out concern about their ability to balance (important when wearing a VR headset) or their height or the distance between their eyes. Also, VR/AR systems need to adapt to people's ability to use game controllers and manipulators; some people have more gaming experience than others, and people with disabilities need to be able to use VR/AR as well. <br /><br />The workshop members decided 8 themes of research that need further exploration and investment to bring VR/AR to its full potential. Note that since the workshop, many experts in the field have started to use the term "XR" for Extended Reality to encompass VR, AR, and any other realities involving technology. The eight themes are:<br />&nbsp;<br />=== 1. User-centric hierarchical benchmarks -- Establishing standards for XR products will ease comparison and shape new goals.<br /><br />=== 2. Optimizing the human-machine interface -- XR should deliver a personalized, natural experience to every user regardless of shape or size.<br /><br />=== 3. Identifying Internal States &amp; Traits -- If the system knows how you feel, it can adapt accordingly.<br /><br />=== 4. Detecting Physical States -- Are you pointing at a particular product? Greeting a colleague? The system should know.<br /><br />=== 5. Dynamic Content Generation -- The digital environment adapts to your choices in real time.<br /><br />=== 6. Cybersickness -- XR should automatically acclimate if you start to feel sick.<br /><br />=== 7. Spatial Cognition -- It?s even tougher to ask for directions in XR.<br /><br />=== 8. Social and Behavioral Factors -- XR developers should accommodate social norms and understand the psychological impact of their designs.<br /><br />After these themes were established, the project supported a webinar series called XRAdvance that created 10 YouTube videos of talks by members of the workshop, complete with Episode Guides which contain the descriptions of the video contents and discussion questions so that future researchers might use these videos for class or lab discussion. <br /><br />The website <a title="XRAdvance Video Series" href="http://www.xradvance.io" target="_blank">http://www.xradvance.io</a> describes the 8 research themes and presents the 10 videos and their Episode Guides. During the time of the NSF project, the XRadvance.io website had 496 unique users, with the majority of them in the Fall of 2019 during active promotion. Its YouTube videos have received 1,180 views with over 167 hours watched and a minimum of 42 views for each video. The top-viewed videos were Doug Bowman's (227 views) and the overview of the 8 research areas (208 views). A spike of 20-30 views in September and October, 2019 and again on June 15, 2020 suggest that, as intended, faculty or students were watching videos together. <br /><br />The workshop website, which contains the original agenda and 3 favorite publications from each participant is available at <a title="NSF VR/AR Workshop" href="http://projects.vrac.iastate.edu/vrworkshop/" target="_blank">http://projects.vrac.iastate.edu/vrworkshop/ </a>.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 07/03/2020<br>      Modified by: Stephen&nbsp;Gilbert</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1660052/1660052_10465855_1593814501262_VR-themes_1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1660052/1660052_10465855_1593814501262_VR-themes_1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Theme 1 User-centric hierarchical benchmarks; Theme 2: Optimizing the human-machine interface"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1660052/1660052_10465855_1593814501262_VR-themes_1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Theme 1 User-centric hierarchical benchmarks; Theme 2: Optimizing the human-machine interface"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Themes 1 and 2 that need further investment.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Emily Oldham & Landon Getting</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Public Domain</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Stephen&nbsp;Gilbert</div> <div class="imageTitle">Theme 1 User-centric hierarchical benchmarks; Theme 2: Optimizing the human-machine interface</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1660052/1660052_10465855_1593814586715_VR-themes_2--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1660052/1660052_10465855_1593814586715_VR-themes_2--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Theme 3: Identifying Internal States &amp; Traits; Theme 4: Detecting Physical States"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1660052/1660052_10465855_1593814586715_VR-themes_2--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Theme 3: Identifying Internal States &amp; Traits; Theme 4: Detecting Physical States"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Themes 3 and 4 that need further investment</div> <div class="imageCredit">Emily Oldham & Landon Getting</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Public Domain</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Stephen&nbsp;Gilbert</div> <div class="imageTitle">Theme 3: Identifying Internal States & Traits; Theme 4: Detecting Physical States</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1660052/1660052_10465855_1593814910896_VR-themes_3--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1660052/1660052_10465855_1593814910896_VR-themes_3--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Theme 5: Dynamic Content Generation; Theme 6: Cybersickness"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1660052/1660052_10465855_1593814910896_VR-themes_3--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Theme 5: Dynamic Content Generation; Theme 6: Cybersickness"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Themes 5 and 6 that need further investment</div> <div class="imageCredit">Emily Oldham & Landon Getting</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Public Domain</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Stephen&nbsp;Gilbert</div> <div class="imageTitle">Theme 5: Dynamic Content Generation; Theme 6: Cybersickness</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1660052/1660052_10465855_1593815088991_VR-themes_4--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1660052/1660052_10465855_1593815088991_VR-themes_4--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Theme 7: Spatial Cognition; Theme 8: Social and Behavioral Factors"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1660052/1660052_10465855_1593815088991_VR-themes_4--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Theme 7: Spatial Cognition; Theme 8: Social and Behavioral Factors"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Themes 7 and 8 that need further investment</div> <div class="imageCredit">Emily Oldham & Landon Getting</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Stephen&nbsp;Gilbert</div> <div class="imageTitle">Theme 7: Spatial Cognition; Theme 8: Social and Behavioral Factors</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
