<AbstractNarration>This project involves a cross-calibration of speleothems and tree rings at two locations in northern and southern Lao PDR at locations uniquely situated to address fundamental questions in tropical paleoclimatology.  Such fundamental questions include: What are the relative roles of, and inter-relationships between, the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) in influencing Southeast Asian climate variability? Currently, there is no coherent understanding of how the archives from these phenomena reflect climate, specifically how the physical or eco-physiological controls of each influence the stable isotope records extracted from them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research team aims to better understand the processes that control the transfer of atmospheric and land surface climate signals to climate proxies by addressing the following questions: 1) How are temperature, precipitation, and stable isotopic variations recorded in the physical, chemical, and biologic signatures of each archive? 2) Are local and regional climate signals synchronous between speleothems and tree rings? and 3) Do the inherent climate signals exhibit inter-proxy variability with seasonal bias or low vs. high frequency variability, and if so, why? &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The specific objectives of the research include: i) exploring the dominant controls on and interrelationships between tropical speleothems and tree-rings through a paired cave and tree modern calibration study at two sites in Laos; ii) examining the dominant controls on speleothem and tree-ring stable isotope records for the instrumental period through proxy system modeling and comparison of new and existing records with instrumental climate data and modeled precipitation delta 18 Oxygen; and iii) extending the paleoclimate record back through the last millennium utilizing new and previously collected speleothems and tree cores from North and South Laos.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The potential broader impacts cover three specific areas: research, mentorship, outreach. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On the research side, the project aims to tackle aspects of evolving areas of controversy integrating climate proxies across climate archives and climatic events.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In terms of mentoring, the project supports graduate students during the academic year and undergraduate students in summer research in the Manhattan Center for Science and Mathematics.  Students will assist with fieldwork, data processing and analysis, co-authorship of papers, and presentations of results. One of the collaborative institutions, William Patterson University, a Hispanic Serving Institution, is largely a teaching university with a diverse student body that includes many underrepresented minorities that are first generation to college.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Outreach is conducted by all the Collaborators. One of the Principal Investigators is a female Native American scientist and organizes the American Indian Summer Institute in Earth System Science, a two-week residential program for high school students.  Another Principal Investigator organizes an annual international Ecological Field School in Vietnam.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The overarching goal of this project was to reconstruct past hydroclimatic variability in Mainland Southeast Asia (MSEA) using precisely-dated and high-resolution speleothem and tree-ring records from Laos and Vietnam.  We aimed to investigate the dynamics of Asian monsoon and MSEA precipitation variability in response to external forcing (e.g. solar) and to natural internal variability governed by coupled ocean-atmosphere processes, such as ENSO.  Another major objective of this project was to conduct a detailed cross-calibration study of speleothem and tree ring records to assess the uncertainties and biases inherent in each proxy.  Towards this end, we aimed to investigate: 1) How temperature, precipitation, and precipitation isotopic signals are incorporated in each archive, and 2) Whether the local and regional climate signals are synchronous across both speleothems and tree rings, or exhibit differences that can be linked to the unique systematics of each proxy.  The UCI component of the project focused on: (1) conducting precipitation isotope, climatology, and cave monitoring studies in Laos and Vietnam, (2) development of high-resolution paleoclimate records from MSEA speleothems, (3) conducting proxy system modeling of speleothem oxygen isotopes, and (4) comparison of our records with climate model and other paleoclimate records, including available tree ring data.  We investigated interannual precipitation variability across East China and MSEA, with a focus on identifying the dynamical links between MSEA precipitation variations and the observed East China precipitation patterns (Wang et al., 2020). The key finding from this study is that the meridional tripole and dipole precipitation structures, that have been widely studied in China, also extend in to MSEA and are linked to ENSO and the North Atlantic. We investigated processes controlling stable isotopes in precipitation in Vietnam and across MSEA by analyzing monthly precipitation data in combination with analysis of moisture trajectories and other meteorological data (Wolf et al., 2020). Our key finding is that the seasonal cycle of precipitation &delta;18O across MSEA is dominated by ITCZ migration related shift in moisture source from the Indian Ocean to the South China Sea that occurs during summer-winter monsoon transition periods each year.   Through the course of this project, we developed multiple speleothem stable isotope and trace element records from MSEA.  Records published thus far include a ~1900 year long, 2-year resolution stable isotope record that records substantial decadal to centennial scale variability in large-scale monsoon intensity and local water balance, as inferred from &delta;18O and &delta;13C, respectively (Wang et al., 2019).  Detailed comparison of the &delta;13C record with tree ring records from Laos and Vietnam, revealed large centennial-length megadroughts that were previously identified in the tree ring record.  We utilized simulations from the Community Earth System Model Last Millennium Ensemble (CESM-LME) to investigate the dynamics underlying the multidecadal &delta;18O variability, and link these changes to solar-forced variations in upstream rainout over the tropical Indian Ocean moisture source region.  We also published a replicated, multi-proxy speleothem record from Tham Doun Mai cave in Northern Laos that spanned the period from ~9 - 1 kyr BP (Griffiths et al., 2020).  Our stable isotope, trace element, and 14C results show evidence for a substantial ?megadrought? period from 5-4 kyr BP, during the mid- to late Holocene, coincident with the termination of the Green Sahara (African Humid Period) and also a period during which substantial shifts in human settlement patterns occurred in MSEA.  Through comparison with other records and analysis of a set of climate model experiments, we show that reduced vegetation and increased dust loads during the Green Sahara termination shifted Walker circulation eastward, cooled the Indian Ocean, and may have caused the reduction in monsoon rainfall in MSEA.  Finally, we utilized a proxy system model, Karstolution, to assess how karst hydrology and in-cave fractionation processes impact speleothem &delta;18O.  Results indicate that high-frequency climate signals are likely smoothed through these processes at Tham Doun Mai cave, presenting a challenge for direct comparison with tree-ring records.  This project supported a Native American PI and contributed to the training and professional development of four UCI PhD students (2 female, 2 male) and four undergraduate students (3 female, 1 male; 2 URM).  This project was highlighted during outreach to increase recruitment and retention of women and underrepresented minorities by the PI and PhD students through various programs, including Skype a Scientist, the UCI-Led CLEAN program, during campus visits by Native American high school students, and the CSU-NASA DIRECT STEM program.  Results were communicated to the scientific community through publications, invited lectures, and conference presentations, and to the general public through social media and mainstream media.
