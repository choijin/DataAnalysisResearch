<AbstractNarration>This Smart and Connected Communities (S&amp;CC) EArly-concept Grant for Exploratory Research (EAGER) project will investigate the feasibility, challenges, and opportunities of deploying shared connected vehicles with new information and communication technologies, to deliver goods and services in future smart and connected communities. The project outcomes will lead to easier and more transparent access to transportation and delivery services, and will create new job opportunities to the public. Transportation is needed to access jobs, medical facilities, grocery stores that offer competitively-priced healthy food options, and childcare. Delivery services could provide healthcare services, medicine and food to those who are immobile or geographically isolated. However, reliable access to transportation and to these types of delivery services are often unavailable to underserved populations such as the elderly, disabled, and the poor, and understanding how to best design these transportation systems and operations for these populations is not well understood. This award supports fundamental research to understand the requirements for such services to exist. The results will lead to positive societal and economic benefits in the U.S. and these outcomes will help to expand transportation options to the underserved. The execution of this research alone could lead to increased technological literacy, increased networking opportunities and enhanced access to medical care, healthy food, and employment among underserved and often geographically isolated communities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project aims to identify barriers and opportunities for engaging the underserved in smart and connected communities through vehicle-and-service-sharing schemes. This research team will develop and explore two types of vehicle-and-service-sharing schemes: centralized and decentralized systems. These schemes will have a corresponding interface design for user interaction for analysis. The research team will use rigorous mathematical modeling and algorithm design, with statistical analysis of data acquired through living lab and behavioral studies. The living lab studies involve the co-creation of products, services, businesses and technologies in real-life environments with multiple stakeholders (e.g., community members, local businesses and organizations), to understand how to deploy shared vehicles to facilitate delivery services and shared rides to jobs and job interviews. These studies will enable researchers to: understand stakeholders' levels of trust in the system and understand the types of services, deployments, and underserved populations to prioritize deployment to in the future. The results of this research will broadly contribute to the fields of Behavioral Economics, Human-Computer Interaction and Ubiquitous Computing.</AbstractNarration>
