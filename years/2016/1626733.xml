<AbstractNarration>Despite the best of their intentions, people often fail to act in a manner that is consistent with their important goals and values. These discrepancies between people's intentions and behavior have been implicated in some of society's most pressing problems, including obesity, substance abuse, discrimination, aggression, and poor financial decision-making. Self-regulation research attempts to understand who, when, and why some succeed--and others fail--in realizing their goals and values in their every day behavior. One important insight from this research is that self-regulation involves a number of distinct challenges that must each be addressed in unique ways. At times, self-regulation requires thinking about circumstances that extend beyond the immediate here-and-now. To illustrate, although students might be tempted to attend a week-night social gathering, it is their ability to think about the distant future rewards of studying that advances their academic goals. At other times, self-regulation requires attention to the details of the present context. Proof-reading for typographical errors, for example, requires students to narrowly focus their attention on the specifics of the task at-hand. The present work aims to test if people have developed unique thinking styles or mindsets that are tuned to help them address each of these two types of challenges--namely, high-level and low-level construal. Critically, the investigator tests the novel prediction that successful regulation requires flexibly matching the right mindset to the right challenge. That is, knowing when to engage in which psychological mindset may be the key reason why some people are able to attain their goals, and others are not.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These questions are explored in six studies. The studies examine people's beliefs about what kinds of thinking will promote their goals under different circumstances. Those beliefs are compared to what research indicates will improve versus undermine self-regulation in those situations. In particular, the investigator tests the prediction that those who intuitively know what research reveals to be good versus bad for self-regulation will be better at attaining goals. Experiments also examine the factors that might explain why some are able, and others not, to engage in the right kinds of thinking styles at the right time. For example, some people may be more cognitively flexible--able to think about the same event from multiple perspectives--whereas others may not be so flexible. Studies examine to what extent cognitively flexible individuals may be better at self-regulation because of their ability to adopt the most advantageous thinking style at any given moment. To examine the practical implications of this work, a field study tests to what extent these hypotheses explain students' performance in a classroom context. Such a context is ideal in that it is a real-world situation known to present numerous self-regulation challenges. Understanding the factors that promote self-regulation may spur the development of new interventions and policies that enhance people's ability to behave in line with and eventually attain their valued goals.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Why are some successful &ndash; and others not &ndash; at achieving their goals?  Research on self-regulation historically has attempted to answer this question by investigating how people monitor and modulate their thoughts, feelings, and behavior to achieve desired ends.  For example, dieters trying to restrain from eating fattening foods might attempt to avoid thinking about how tasty those foods are.  Relatively less attention has been placed on how people regulate their underlying motivational states.  This is somewhat surprising, given that motivations often guide how people think, feel, and act.  The aim of this project was to address this question.  The basic premise of this work is that those who understand how to regulate their motivation effectively should be more likely to achieve their goals.  To explore this question, we examined people’s ability to expand vs. contract their mental horizons in response to various goal-relevant tasks.  Sometimes, goal pursuit requires people to broaden their perspectives &ndash; being responsive to concerns that extend beyond the here-and-now.  For example, planning for retirement entails thinking about the distant future &ndash; an expansion of one’s perspective.  Other times, goal pursuit requires people to be responsive to the specific considerations of the here-and-now.  Successfully sinking a putt in golf, for example, requires being attuned to the idiosyncratic local conditions of the present moment &ndash; a contraction of one’s perspective.  Research suggests that people perform better on tasks demanding expansion when they adopt a more abstract mindset (termed "high-level construal").  By contrast, people perform better on tasks demanding contraction when they adopt a more concrete mindset (termed "low-level construal").  Those who are able to fit the right mindset to the task at-hand should be more successful in their goals.  To create this "fit," however, one needs to know 1) when tasks demand expansion vs. contraction, 2) whether abstract vs. concrete mindsets would promote performance on those task, respectively, and 3) how to get one’s self into an abstract vs. concrete mindset.  The present project was designed to test whether people had these three types of knowledge. Experiments showed that indeed on average, people do appear to have the requisite knowledge to expand vs. contract their mental horizons strategically.  We showed this to be the case not only among participants in the U.S., but also in Japan &ndash; demonstrating cross-cultural similarity.  Critically, there were significant individual differences in this knowledge: those with greater knowledge were more likely to get themselves into the right mindsets and were more likely to experience positive outcomes. In short, differences in people’s knowledge of how to regulate their motivation may play a key role in determining who is &ndash; and how is not &ndash; successful in attaining their goals.  This work has furthered understanding who, when, and why some succeed while others do not in goal pursuit.
