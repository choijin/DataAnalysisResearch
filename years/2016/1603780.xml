<AbstractNarration>PI:  Kondic, Lou / Rack, Phillip D.&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: 1604351 / 1603780&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the proposed research is to investigate the behavior of nanoscale liquid metal drops on surfaces with a comprehensive approach of simulations, modeling and experiments. Placing such  nanodrops on different surfaces in a controlled way is important for manufacturing surfaces with unique material properties that can be used in microelectronic devices, in solar panels, in spectroscopy and even in radiation treatment for cancer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed work explores competing capillary, viscous and inertial forces in the collapse versus breakup of nanoscale liquid metal filaments, liquid metal-substrate interactions, and thermal effects where nanoscale thermal gradients will be imposed via templating and temperature dependent material properties. The transformative aspect of this proposal resides in providing new insights into the emerging field of complex and multi-component nanoparticle synthesis with enhanced functionality. Research efforts put forward in this proposed work focus on developing direct numerical methods for solving fully 3D Navier-Stokes equations in combination with targeted experiments. Specifically, accurate numerical methods will be developed based on the multi-material Volume of Fluid approach, also incorporating triple junctions and moving contact lines, as well as the potentials describing liquid-solid interactions. To challenge the computations, the physical experiments are designed to interrogate various metal/alloy-substrate combinations which will probe the relevant hydrodynamic and chemical instabilities. A distinguishing feature of the proposed project is the immediate and direct comparison of numerical results with the experimental ones. The theoretical, computational, and experimental work will drive each other, with theoretical predictions directly checked by experiments, and subsequently these experiments will be used to develop more accurate theoretical description of the instabilities and transport of nanoscale liquid metals. The results of this research will be of interest to a wide community exploring experimental and computational fluid dynamics and more generally to the researchers considering various aspects of nanoscience. The broader impact of the proposed work resides in providing new insights into the emerging field of complex and multi-component nanoparticle synthesis with enhanced functionality. The proposed work is expected to have an impact on a number of applications. Examples include metal-particle based plasmonic structures for enhanced solar cells and waveguides, where it is of interest to have a substrate covered by ordered arrays of metallic nanoparticles. The proposal also includes the development of software that will be available to researchers in the community, and educational activities for graduate and undergraduate students.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The intellectual merit of this program was the investigation of a simple method to synthesize metallic nanoparticles by laser heating a thin metal film or patterned nanostructure sufficient to rapidly melt the films.  When in the liquid state, the film/nanostructures destabilize into nanoparticles into nanoparticles with deterministic composition, size and spacing.  Our approach combined theoretical modeling and detailed experiments to investigate the relevant liquid phase forces that are operative, which dictate the nanoparticle assembly process.  Additionally, we correlated the resultant nanoparticle structure and composition and correlated this to their magnetic and optical properties.  One application that the team focused on was biomedical nanoparticles designed to kill cancer cells.  One recent approach to target cancer cells is use nanoparticles with special magnetic and optical nanoparticles; the magnetic properties are used to steer the nanoparticles to the cancer infected regions and the optical properties are used to convert light into heat sufficient to locally kill the cancer with minimal damage to the surrounding region.  We studied the detailed dynamics of an Ag-Ni thin film system and developed models to explain the energetic pathways that occur when laser treated.  Ultimately the film phase separates into nanoparticles with controllable size that had the requisite magnetic and optical properties to be applied for this type of therapeutic treatment.   Beyond the intellectual merit of the program, there were several broader impacts that emerged.  First of all, several students were trained for the workforce; one masters student graduated and is working for a small technology startup company, one student is close to finishing their Ph.D. degree and will enter the workforce soon, and one undergraduate student was supported and currently enrolled in an engineering graduate program after being inspired by the research performed in this program.  A second broader impact was the mentoring of several senior design teams that incorporated thin film processing and characterization into the design project.  Finally, the third broader impact resulted from our deeper understanding of laser-solid interactions, partially learned during this program, is a partnership (PDR, UTK) with a small startup company (Waviks Inc.).  A small business innovative research proposal was funded by the National Science Foundation to develop a new laser delivery system to study laser-solid interaction in a microscope capable of imaging materials at the nano- and atomic-scale.   This one-of-a-kind instrument has been installed at the Joint Institute of Advanced Materials at the University of Tennessee, which has bolstered the University?s research infrastructure.
