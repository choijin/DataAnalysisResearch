<AbstractNarration>PI:   Prabhu Arumugam&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A practical understanding of the human brain is one of the the greatest scientific challenges of the 21st century. Current neural probes to elucidate the chemical mechanisms underlying brain function lack the multiplexing and multimodal capabilities necessary for detecting multiple classes of brain analytes that have been implicated in various brain disorders. This project will advance basic neuroscience research by the development of highly sensitive, and highly reliable diamond-platinum nanoelectrodes capable of sensing local concentration changes of brain chemicals. The nanoelectrodes will also facilitate fundamental advances in emerging analytical measurements within cellular and sub-cellular domains.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An understanding of the human brain is one of the greatest scientific challenge of the 21st century. Previous research in this highly topical field has demonstrated the importance of neurochemicals, toxins and field potentials for neuronal communication in healthy and diseased states. The dynamics of interaction between these key functions, in all areas of the brain, is clearly of critical clinical importance to the development of a useful brain chemical model. The proposed research will result in the development of a novel multi-purpose biosensing nanoprobe capable of near simultaneous in vivo sensing of multiple brain analytes in body fluids. The proposed probe will utilize new carbon nanostructures, advanced nanoelectrode geometries and fabrication processes and redox cycling methods to demonstrate at least a 10-fold increase in the key sensor metrics, i.e. the sensitivity, selectivity and limits of detection as compared to current neural sensing electrodes. Specifically, and for the first time, a concentric three-dimensional nanoprobe for brain analyte testing will be microfabricated with several individually addressable BDUNCD (Boron-Doped Ultrananocrystalline Diamond) and Pt nanoring nanoelectrodes ?nanodes?. One of the potential applications of the nanodes is the localized sensing of changes in the levels of different brain analytes, e.g. dopamine, lead and electrical field potentials as affected by external stimuli such as neuromodulation. This will fundamentally improve understanding of neurostimulation mechanisms, which is a promising technique now being employed for patients with brain disorders. The creation of new nanodes, the central goal of this project, would also allow progress in emerging analytical measurements within cellular and sub-cellular domains. This project will deliver innovative nanoprobes to advance basic science that is expected to be transformative in terms of its unique multifunctional, multimodal and multiplexing capability. The proposed research will contribute new advanced materials and fabrication science to the general nanobiosensing field including nanodes for high sensitivity and high selectivity chemical sensing.</AbstractNarration>
