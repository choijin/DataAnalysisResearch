<AbstractNarration>Cloud computing is growing rapidly, with businesses, institutions and individuals moving their workloads to clouds. Cloud users benefit from low cost ownership, a pay-as-you-go pricing model where they only pay for the procured resource usage, and the ability to dynamically scale the resource usage up and down. However, the applications running in clouds usually experience unpredictable performance, which makes it extremely challenging for the users to choose resource configurations that meet their cost and performance requirements. This problem is further complicated as users do not have physical control over cloud computers and are forced to make their decisions based on convoluted cloud performance reports.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research addresses the need to support users in achieving their cost-performance requirements as they port their applications to various cloud services. In particular, the research is embodied in an envisioned testing and recommendation system that determines proper resource management policies that meet performance and cost requirements. By taking a software-testing-based approach, the research provides solutions using only user-accessible information to satisfy user requirements, addresses the limits of static analysis techniques that rely on performance predictability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Such a testing and recommendation system enables non-experts to port their applications to various clouds in a cost effective way. The novel framework, testing and recommendation approaches, data sets, and experimental infrastructure developed within the project will be released open source to advance knowledge and understanding within software engineering and cloud computing. The PIs will continue to involve students of underrepresented groups and continue their involvement in mentoring workshops for students.</AbstractNarration>

Experimental results indicate that this testing strategy is a cost-effective approach to test for performance effects of cloud uncertainty when porting an application to the cloud.     In another project, we developed a novel cloud performance testing methodology called "PT4Cloud," which employs non-parametric statistical approaches to provide reliable stopping conditions to obtain highly accurate performance distributions. PT4Cloud also allows the users to specify intuitive accuracy objectives and trade accuracy for testing cost. To reduce the cost of testing, we developed two test reduction techniques that can significantly reduce the number of test runs while retaining a high level of accuracy.  We experimentally evaluated PT4Cloud and found that it provides testing results with 95.4% accuracy on average while reducing the number of test runs by 62%. Our two test execution reduction techniques for PT4Cloud can reduce the number of test runs by 90.1% while retaining an average accuracy of 91%.      In the third project, we improved the PT4Cloud to test for performance in terms of point estimates, such as the mean performance or performance percentiles.

While the previous projects involved static workloads, we introduced a project that works on dynamic workloads and elasticity; that is, we investigated how to adapt the PT4Cloud cloud performance testing methodology to work in the presence of dynamic workloads and elasticity.  Dynamic workloads such as web traffic are volatile and workload fluctuations occur for various factors which would require an IaaS elastic service. Elasticity is the ability of a system to adapt to workload changes by provisioning and  de-provisioning  cloud  resources to match changing demands and is challenging for performance testing. Users can utilize auto-scaling policies to achieve elasticity and  enhance  performance  and  cost  satisfaction. A major challenge when creating effective scaling policies to utilize elasticity  is that users are expected to have precise knowledge of the performance of their application.

Our results show testing results with similar accuracy on average to results achieved for applications with static workloads also with significant reduction in test runs in dynamic workloads.   Besides performance testing, this NSF award also supported the PIs’ other research projects on cloud computing, including the development of several cloud job scheduling algorithms for time-sensitive cloud jobs, the development of a generic cloud workload predictor with automated machine-learning optimizations, and the first benchmarking framework for interactive cloud 3D applications.
