<AbstractNarration>Extant research pinpoints gaps between school and work in respect to engineering practice. For example, a recent American Society of Mechanical Engineering (ASME) study identified a number of student weaknesses, such as: practical experience, project management, problem solving, and design. Equally important, industry supervisors have also identified these gaps. The misalignment between the engineering classroom and workplace poses serious challenges with the professional formation of engineers. Generally speaking, capstone courses are key academic experiences that can bridge these gaps. Few studies, if any, have examined the effectiveness of capstone courses in helping students make the transition from engineering classrooms to the workplace. Instead, most research focuses on course structure, pedagogy, assessment, and end-of-course outcomes. To address the knowledge gaps, the investigators draw on Wenger's concept of communities of practice to study students' experiences as they move from capstone courses to the workplace. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using a multi-case study design, the project is focusing on four primary research questions: &lt;br/&gt;(a) What skills, practices, and attitudes fostered through the capstone experience do individuals draw on or apply in their early work experiences? &lt;br/&gt;(b) What differences do individuals identify between their capstone design and early work experiences, and how do those differences help or hinder their school-to-work transition?&lt;br/&gt;(c) What specific pedagogical practices or aspects of the capstone course do students identify as helping or hindering their transition?&lt;br/&gt;(d) In what ways do individuals perceive themselves to be underprepared in their early work experiences? &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Further, with a particular focus on women and Hispanics, the investigators proposed to study the extent that capstone design courses prepared these students to enter communities of practice in engineering workplaces. This project is closely aligned with the National Science Foundation's strategic priorities to build the STEM workforce with capable individuals, as well as broadening participation in engineering among underrepresented groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the scientific literature, there are numerous studies that highlight the gaps between theory and practice in relation to engineering education and the workplace, yet capstone courses are common practices that engineering instructors use to help students gain more in-depth engineering knowledge. There is a dearth of studies that have examined the effectiveness of capstone courses and how these courses may help students to translate and apply prior engineering coursework to the engineering workplace. With this in mind, this project has immense potential to positively impact engineering instruction across the nation. It also possesses great potential in helping engineering faculty to develop more effective capstone courses, while maximizing their instructional resources to create such courses. Ultimately, this project will benefit U.S. engineering industries seeking to hire adaptable engineering graduates who are technically and professionally prepared to enter the engineering workforce.</AbstractNarration>
