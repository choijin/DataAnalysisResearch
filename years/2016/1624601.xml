<AbstractNarration>For nearly 90 years the Highlands Biological Station (HBS; highlandsbiological.org) has been a center for scientific research, teaching, training as well as public education and enrichment focused on the biological richness of the southern Blue Ridge Escarpment region. The study of Blue Ridge escarpment watersheds and aquatic ecology and biota has long been an important research activity at HBS because of the Station's proximity to the headwaters of several major river systems of upland North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia. These river systems have both Atlantic and Gulf drainage and support some of the richest aquatic diversity in North America. The HBS Aquatics Laboratory was built in the late 1950s and has served the scientific community well for over 5 decades, supporting numerous scientific studies and specialized aquatics courses for teaching and training undergraduates, graduate students, and Federal and State agency biologists nationwide. This project aims to modernize and expand this now-dated laboratory at a time when Blue Ridge Escarpment watersheds are experiencing accelerated changes, from development to precipitation patterns to dam removal, activities that affect or are projected to alter forest hydrology and stream and river health in complex ways. The wettest region in the eastern continental US, the southern mountain region and its aquatic resources are a natural laboratory and classroom, and an ideal setting for learning about how watersheds and river systems function ecologically and respond to environmental changes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project aims to reconfigure, update, and expand the HBS Aquatics Laboratory by (1) modernizing the lab infrastructure by upgrading outdated electrical, lighting, HVAC, insulation, and plumbing; (2) rearranging and replumbing existing research tanks and artificial streams; (3) expanding the research lab to provide bench space, restroom, and accommodate upgraded research equipment; and (4) reorganizing and upgrading the adjacent exterior space by replumbing outdoor artificial streams and creating storage for field equipment. The upgraded HBS Aquatics Laboratory will support a greater breadth of controlled laboratory and field studies of regional riverine and stream system ecology, improving the scientific understanding of these systems and thus providing the information needed to inform planning, management, and mitigation. Expansion of the facility is also designed to dovetail with the growing public education and enrichment activities at HBS, introducing K-12 students and life-long learners to the equipment and methodologies of aquatic sciences.</AbstractNarration>

A 23-acre facility of Western Carolina University, HBS was established in 1927 as a center for field biology research and education in the richly biodiverse southern Blue Ridge.&nbsp; Aquatics research, teaching, and training have long been an important part of the HBS program, thanks to its ideal location astride the eastern continental divide near the North Carolina-Georgia-South Carolina border, a region with the second-highest average annual rainfall in North America.&nbsp; The headwaters of several major river systems meet in the vicinity of HBS, including two Federally designated Wild &amp; Scenic Rivers, and the area's topography and myriad rivers, streams, seeps, and waterfalls contribute greatly to the status of the southern Blue Ridge as a world temperate-zone biodiversity hotspot.&nbsp; Though this NSF-supported project, the HBS Aquatics Laboratory, originally built in 1958, is a now a fully modernized facility with upgraded HVAC, plumbing, lighting, bench space, and water purification system.&nbsp; The lab's interior research and teaching space was doubled to approximately 1000 square feet, including a dedicated lab of 6 interconnected Living Stream tanks, ample bench space, storage, and restroom facility.&nbsp; The exterior lab area now has conditioned storage, sheltered prep space for nets and other aquatics equipment, and exterior tanks and fully plumbed artificial stream flumes with removable/retractable shade cloth barriers.&nbsp; The Aquatics Laboratory will support research by scientists from across the country, and create new opportunities for cooperative research and conservation projects with State and Federal agencies (e.g., the NC Wildlife Resources Commission and US Forest Service) as well as local conservation nonprofits that steward watersheds of the area (i.e., Mainspring Conservation Trust, Highlands-Cashiers Land Trust).&nbsp; It will also serve undergraduate and graduate training through the HBS summer field course and workshop program (e.g., courses in fish biology, aquatic ecology, limnology, aquatic insect identification, and more on a rotating schedule), as well as provide new opportunities for public engagement and outreach from local schools to life-long learners.&nbsp; The newly modernized and expanded HBS Aquatics Laboratory will be a tremendous asset for aquatic system research, education and outreach, and conservation in the southern Appalachians.&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 06/01/2020<br>      Modified by: James&nbsp;T&nbsp;Costa</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1624601/1624601_10473050_1591027389281_1.HBSAquaticsLab.LivingStreamlaboratory--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1624601/1624601_10473050_1591027389281_1.HBSAquaticsLab.LivingStreamlaboratory--rgov-800width.jpg" title="HBS Aquatics Lab Living Stream tanks"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1624601/1624601_10473050_1591027389281_1.HBSAquaticsLab.LivingStreamlaboratory--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="HBS Aquatics Lab Living Stream tanks"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Living Stream lab of the HBS Aquatics Laboratory, featuring six interconnected units.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Michael McMahan</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Royalty-free (unrestricted use)</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">James&nbsp;T&nbsp;Costa</div> <div class="imageTitle">HBS Aquatics Lab Living Stream tanks</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1624601/1624601_10473050_1591025575850_2.HBSAquaticsLab.MainLab1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1624601/1624601_10473050_1591025575850_2.HBSAquaticsLab.MainLab1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="HBS Aquatics Laboratory main lab space"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1624601/1624601_10473050_1591025575850_2.HBSAquaticsLab.MainLab1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="HBS Aquatics Laboratory main lab space"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Another view of the main work area of the HBS Aquatics Laboratory.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Michael McMahan</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Royalty-free (unrestricted use)</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">James&nbsp;T&nbsp;Costa</div> <div class="imageTitle">HBS Aquatics Laboratory main lab space</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1624601/1624601_10473050_1591026958008_4.HBSAquaticsLab.Artificialstreamflumes--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1624601/1624601_10473050_1591026958008_4.HBSAquaticsLab.Artificialstreamflumes--rgov-800width.jpg" title="HBS Aquatics Lab artificial stream flumes"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1624601/1624601_10473050_1591026958008_4.HBSAquaticsLab.Artificialstreamflumes--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="HBS Aquatics Lab artificial stream flumes"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Plumbed artificial stream flumes with retractable shade cloth posts at HBS Aquatics Laboratory</div> <div class="imageCredit">James T.
