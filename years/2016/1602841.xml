<AbstractNarration>This award is made as part of the FY 2016 Mathematical Sciences Postdoctoral Research Fellowships Program. Each of the fellowships supports a research and training project at a host institution in the mathematical sciences, including applications to other disciplines, under the mentorship of a sponsoring scientist. The title of the project for this fellowship to Dan D. Wilson is "Bounding the Critical Coupling Strength and Controlling Synchronization in Networks of Heterogeneous Oscillators." The host institution for the fellowship is the University of Pittsburgh, and the sponsoring scientist is Bard Ermentrout.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This research grant supported research that focused on developing and investigating model reduction techniques for nonlinear, high-dimensional dynamical systems.  These reduction algorithms allowed for the analytical and computational study of biological systems including those that govern circadian and cardiac physiology.  This work resulted in 11 published journal articles.  All journal articles are freely available on the PI's academic website http://volweb.utk.edu/~dwilso81/.  The majority of the research was performed between July 2016 and July 2018 and was completed at the University of Pittsburgh.  Remaining journal articles worked their way through the peer review process in the ensuing two years.  This grant also supported travel for 3 conferences at which the PI presented results from the research.  Intellectual Merit:  Research supported by this grant focused on developing model reduction strategies for limit cycle oscillators and excitable systems to better understand their emergent properties. This research resulted in the theoretical development of high accuracy phase-amplitude reduction strategies based on the isostable coordinate framework, which represents level sets of the slowest decaying modes of the Koopman operator. These reduction frameworks were applied to investigate the mechanisms of cardiac arrhythmia and led to the development of a feedback control strategy to suppress cardiac alternans (a precursor to cardiac fibrillation) in tissue. Additionally this grant supported work that used these reduction strategies to shed new light on the possible mechanisms responsible for the reported differences in jet-lag severity between eastward and westward travel, and allowed for a better understanding of the transient dynamics of periodically firing neurons. Other works supported by this grant include an experimental collaboration predicting synchronization bounds in coupled oscillators and two tutorial articles on model reduction using phase and isostable coordinates.  Broader Impacts:   The PI co-organized an international conference on complex systems in neuroscience. This three-day conference was open to researchers with backgrounds in both experimental and theoretical neuroscience and drew over 80 attendees, a significant portion of which were graduate and undergraduate students. Additionally, this funding allowed the PI to participate in the mathematical biology group at the University of Pittsburgh, a collection of approximately 30 students, postdoctoral fellows, and faculty with an interest in biological applications of mathematics.
