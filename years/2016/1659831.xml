<AbstractNarration>This REU Site award to the University of Missouri (MU), located in Columbia, MO, will support the training of 10 students for 10 weeks during the summers of 2017- 2019. MU is the largest institution of higher learning in Missouri and the flagship campus of the University of Missouri System. The program offers a wide range of very exciting interdisciplinary projects in neuroscience, with both wet-lab and computational components. The projects are drawn from all levels in neuroscience (i.e., intracellular/cellular, systems and behavioral levels), with participating faculty coming from the colleges of arts &amp; science, engineering, and veterinary medicine. Starting with a 1-week boot camp, students attend a weekly class on computational neuroscience, conduct lab research as well as participate in various seminars and workshops on topics such as the responsible conduct of research, professional skills, career opportunities, and the graduate school application process. Each student will have the opportunity to write reports, and design and present a scientific poster. They will form part of a group of 100+ undergraduate researchers from all over U.S. who participate each summer in a vibrant summer research program (http://undergradresearch.missouri.edu/). All participants will be recruited from outside MU, and selected based on academic record, research performance, and potential for research in neuroscience. Participant support during the REU experience will include a stipend, lodging and food, travel to and from the university, and funding for the research project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is anticipated that a total of 30 students, primarily from schools with limited research opportunities, will be trained in the program. Applications from underrepresented groups and minority institutions are encouraged.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A common web-based assessment tool used by all REU Site programs funded by the Division of Biological Infrastructure will be used to determine the effectiveness of the training program. Students will be tracked after the program in order to determine their career paths. Students will be asked to respond to an automatic email sent via the NSF reporting system. More information about the program is available by visiting&lt;br/&gt;http://engineering.missouri.edu/neuroreu/, or by contacting the PI (Dr. Satish S. Nair at nairs@missouri.edu) or co-PI (Dr. David J. Schulz at schulzd@missouri.edu).</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Our REU program included a strong interdisciplinary team of faculty mentors with expertise at all levels in the growing field of neuroscience (intracellular/ cellular, systems and behavioral levels).  The specific objectives of our NSF REU Site on Neuroscience were to:  Introduce undergraduate students to the basics of the research process; Demonstrate the importance of interaction (teamwork) and the value of different disciplines in collaborative research in neurosciences; Introduce students to the intensity of specialized independent research without losing sight of how their work fits into the larger goals that brought such a diverse group of faculty together; Foster students’ creativity and provide satisfaction from seeing successful results; Develop outstanding candidates with research experience for graduate programs; and Provide valuable experience in technical writing and oral presentations.   The key outcomes were as follows:  (i)      All 30 students enrolled over the three years were from outside MU, based on an average of 140 applicants each year to an area that perceived as being difficult due to the need for a background of math and biology;  (ii)    The 30 REU Fellows were from 20 different states in US, and from diverse departments: Biology (11), Neuroscience (3), Biochemistry (3), Chemistry (1), Psychology (2), Bioengineering (2), Computer Science (5), Electrical Engineering (1), and Mathematics (2). Average GPA for the 30 Fellows was a high 3.64/4.    (iii)   One of our alumni (few were rising seniors) has started a PhD program in interdisciplinary neuroscience, and several are applying for graduate schools presently; 1 is on a journal paper being finalized, and 3 on planned national/international conference publications. We note that a third of the REU students finished their internship only a few weeks back, and manuscripts including them as well as past REU students are still in process.  (iv)   The representation from 20 different states and 10 different majors over the three years was as follows: Women = 80% (24 total; 6 African American; 8 Hispanic; 8 White Caucasian; 2 Asian-Pacific Islander);  Men = 20% (6 total; 1 African American, 3 Hispanic, 2 White Caucasian); So, under-represented minorities were 18/30 or 60% of the total. Not counting URMs, 90% of the recruited students were from non-PhD granting institutions, exceeding our target of 75%.   (v)     To date, the 2017-19 site program attendees have been co-authors on 1 chapter and 9 national/ international conference papers/posters.  (vi)   Of the 30 REU participants over 3 years, based on information available, a total of 8 have entered graduate program so far (6 MS, 2 PhD) and 8 are yet to complete their BS program. Those who went on to graduate program included 2African American and 3 Hispanic students.
