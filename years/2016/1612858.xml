<AbstractNarration>This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology for FY 2016, Research Using Biological Collections. The fellowship supports a research and training plan for the Fellow to take transformative approaches to grand challenges in biology that employ biological collections in highly innovative ways. The title of the research plan for this fellowship to April Wright is "Building a time-calibrated tree of ants using the fossilized birth-death process." The host institutions for this fellowship is Iowa State University and the Field Museum of Natural History, and the sponsoring scientists are Drs. Tracy Heath (Iowa State) and Carrie Moreau (Field Museum).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project uses the Field Museum's extensive collection of ant fossils to estimate both the phylogeny (evolutionary tree) of ants and the timescale of their evolution. Ants are an important presence in the most terrestrial ecosystems, providing vital ecosystem services of ecological and agricultural relevance. An estimate of the phylogeny of ants forms the basis for comparative studies of every aspect of their biology. The newest methods for inferring the timescale for evolution use the fossil record much more efficiently than previous approaches, making them more powerful and precise than older methods. However, these new techniques have not been thoroughly tested. In this project, the Fellow is evaluating the state-of-the-art methods for estimating the timing of evolutionary events, in order to generate recommendations on how to best perform these analyses. This project will involve building software to analyze the phylogenetic data, which will be made freely available.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Fellow is receiving advanced training in computational biology, including experience with C/C++ programming and software development. Furthermore, the Fellow is using the knowledge gained through these training activities to engage in outreach activities to women and underrepresented minorities. Thus, the Fellow is teaching workshops on computational biology at both host institutions, through the networks afforded by her supervising scientists, including the Field Museum Women in Science group and the Iowa State Women in Science and Engineering group.</AbstractNarration>

Phylogenetic trees are hypotheses about the relationship between the taxa on them (the tips, see Figure 1). Tips may be species, they may be higher taxonomic units, or they may be populations or even individuals of interest. From the beginnings of phylogenetic inference, phylogenetic trees have provided an organizational framework for thinking about biological diversity. Phylogenetic trees are used in population-level analyses of evolution and ecology, studies of agriculture, and the study of medicine. Time-scaling a phylogeny allows researchers to put absolute ages on the nodes in a phylogeny. In time-scaling a phylogeny, researchers disentangle the relationship between evolutionary rate and the time since lineages diverged (i.e., an ancestral population became two independent daughter lineages, see Fig. 1). This allows researchers to test hypotheses about the rate at which evolutionary change accumulates, how lineages diversify, and how phenotypic and genomic features evolve. <br /><br />These analyses, while powerful, are also parameter-rich and complex. Fossils form our only direct observations of the past. Without fossils, establishing a time scale upon which to place evolutionary events is impossible. Historically, fossils have been integrated with phylogenetic trees via simplistic analytical methods. In this project, I used a combined molecular and a new, recoded morphological dataset to explore the models of evolution that enable more biologically-realistic modeling of morphological data for joint inference of phylogenetic trees and divergence times.<br /><br />In this study, I recoded characters in two morphological matrices to expand the taxon and character sampling available to researchers working in the Formicidae. This dataset has interesting properties. Because there are stem ant lineages (lineages that are outside the clade of ants, but more closely related to ants than to their outgroup) represented, there are taxa that have characteristics that are lost after the divergence of the stem lineages. This extremely one-sided loss structure violates the assumptions of some of the common phylogenetic models used to add fossils to trees. To combat this model misspecification, I implemented a model of evolution that can accommodate asymmetrical transition rates. This model allows for a certain number of categories of transition rate asymmetry, as opposed to the blanket assumption that all characters are equally likely to be gained and lost. Some characteristics of the ant group are also gained after the divergence of the stem lineages, which also violates the assumption of equal change probabilities. Because of these model violations, this dataset is an excellent test case for models that relax key assumptions of our existing phylogenetic toolkit. <br /><br />Using Bayes factor model selection, I demonstrated that models capable of relaxing these assumptions significantly improves the fit of the model to the data. Prior morphological phylogenies of ants made extensive use of clade constraints, an analytical construct by which some nodes in the phylogeny are fixed are not estimated. Without these constraints, ant specimens have previously not been supported as monophyletic from the data.&nbsp; Instead, they have been jumbled into a larger clade with wasps, a result that is strongly countered by the molecular data. However, with our new model, ants are always monophyletic (Fig. 2). This&nbsp; lowers conflict between the molecular data and the morphological data. <br /><br />With respect to the dated tree, I demonstrate that allowing different amounts of transition rate asymmetry affects the estimated age of ants (Fig. 3). Prior molecular studies of divergence time estimation have found conflicting ages for the ant group. My work demonstrates that using inappropriate models of evolution may lead to incorrect age estimates. I also included a comparison to a molecular-only dataset. The tree for this dataset was estimated under the best fit model of evolution, in which every gene and codon position has its own parameters. Excluding morphological data leads to strongly older ages than including it (Fig. 3).</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 10/28/2018<br>      Modified by: April&nbsp;M&nbsp;Wright</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1612858/1612858_10423647_1540761058231_Fig1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1612858/1612858_10423647_1540761058231_Fig1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 1"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1612858/1612858_10423647_1540761058231_Fig1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 1"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">A graphic displaying a phylogeny.

Outcome: I recoded characters in two existing morphological matrices such that the matrices can be combined into one matrix.
