<AbstractNarration>Language is used to communicate ideas and transfer information because it can reflect what our individual beliefs are and what our shared beliefs are. As one example, the way that words like "know" and "think" are used within a conversation reflects how sure the conversational participants are about what they believe, whether they agree about what they are discussing, and what they take to be facts or opinions. This project examines how children come to understand how belief words like "know" and "think" contribute to the exchange of information within a conversation. Do children from different backgrounds have similar experiences with these words? And to the degree that there are differences, how does that variation contribute to differences in acquiring an adult-like understanding of these words? To answer these questions, this project first conducts corpus analyses to investigate how parents use belief words in talking to their preschool-aged children. Then, these corpus results are combined with behavioral methods to reveal how linguistic experience relates to children's mastery of these words.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Finding out how children come to learn words like "know" and "think" is important in understanding contributing factors to later academic and professional success. Specifically, these words require an understanding of the ways that information is exchanged and communicated through conversations. As a result, understanding these words leads to mastery in interpreting what their conversational partners believe and why they believe it. This, in turn, allows children to better understand academic and professional communication and may lead to greater achievement in school, and ultimately, in their careers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ We know that children must learn the meanings of new words they encounter through the early language experiences that they have. But we still understand relatively little about how this process works. This project took a step towards greater understanding of this process by asking what early experiences children use to figure out a very subtle meaning difference, such as the one between the belief verbs "know" and "think". While the two verbs both express beliefs, there are subtle differences between them. "Know" can only be used to describe true beliefs, which we take for granted. On the other hand, "think" can be used to describe beliefs that we do not take for granted, and that may in fact be false.     In this project, we measured aspects of conversations that preschool-aged children have over dinner and while playing games with their parents, to see which aspects of the conversations might contribute to children?s ultimate understanding of what it means to "know" or "think". We contrasted experiences that teach children about the difference between "know" and "think" directly (discussion of true beliefs with when "know" is used, and discussion of false beliefs when "think" is used) with more indirect sources of information ("know" is used to ask questions and request information, such as "Do you know where the bathrooms are?" while "think" is used to offer information, such as "I think the bathrooms are down the hall."). We found that children who understand the difference between "know" and "think" very well have more indirect evidence than their peers, suggesting that this indirect evidence plays a role in how they learn the meanings of words. But this does not suggest that direct evidence is never informative. We found evidence that direct evidence may play a role in learning other words which have similar properties to "know".
