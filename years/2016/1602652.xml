<AbstractNarration>This award provides funding to help defray the expenses of participants in two meetings of the "Northeast Analysis Network," the first of which will be held September 23-24, 2016, on the campus of the University of Rochester and the second of which will be held September 22-23, 2017, on the campus of Syracuse University. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Northeast Analysis Network (NAN) will bring together once a year, for the coming two years, the analysis communities in the state of New York and neighboring states. The University of Rochester and Syracuse University will each host one conference (Rochester: NAN 2016; Syracuse: NAN 2017). Each conference will primarily feature talks by senior post-docs and finishing graduate students who are about to enter the job market. A magnet lectures by a leading researcher, the "Excelsior Lecture" (named after the motto of the state of New York) will serve as a catalyst for each conference. The Excelsior Lecturers are Jill Pipher (NAN 2017) and Svitlana Mayboroda (NAN 2017).</AbstractNarration>
