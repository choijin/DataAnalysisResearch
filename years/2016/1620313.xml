<AbstractNarration>The research objective of this award is to study the structure property relationships of functional&lt;br/&gt;gradients created through the use of nanowires. The use of nanowires to create a functional&lt;br/&gt;gradient is a novel approach that has not been explored, yet could provide significantly improved&lt;br/&gt;performance while maintaining the composition of each phase. A functional gradient is often&lt;br/&gt;created through the blending of ceramic or precursor materials at the interface which is difficult&lt;br/&gt;to control and can lead to inferior properties due to compositional changes resulting from&lt;br/&gt;diffusion of the two phases. This issue is of principle concern in electroceramics where the&lt;br/&gt;properties are strongly related to the purity of the ceramic. While the research will seek to&lt;br/&gt;identify the fundamental properties of strain transfer across a nanowire interface, our efforts will&lt;br/&gt;be focused by the application of the graded interface to multiferroic materials. The goal will be to&lt;br/&gt;produce the highest degree of multiferroic coupling while developing a new methodology for&lt;br/&gt;creating functional gradients that maintain the material's phase and connectivity across the&lt;br/&gt;interface as well as producing direct measurement of the strain gradient created such that&lt;br/&gt;modeling tools can be developed for the nanoscale interface.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this this award will provide a new methodology to create a nanoscale&lt;br/&gt;functional gradient across an interface. The efforts will be directly applied to the growing field of&lt;br/&gt;multiferroic materials and will focus on both basic and applied challenges to the application of&lt;br/&gt;multiferroic materials and thus offers potential for a wide range of future research efforts&lt;br/&gt;approaching more efficient design of ME devices. The proposed techniques could be applied to a&lt;br/&gt;wide range of application that involve an interface between dissimilar materials including thermal&lt;br/&gt;interfaces, semiconductors and composites as well as many emerging technologies that provide&lt;br/&gt;positive societal impact. Beyond providing an increased understanding of the mechanics across a&lt;br/&gt;functional gradient, the resear</AbstractNarration>
