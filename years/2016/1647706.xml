<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to eliminate the need for costly trial and error in the fabrication of specialty optical fibers. Specialty fibers are rapidly finding applications in a diverse array of fields, resulting in a rapidly growing market for this technology. However, a major bottleneck in their development is the difficulty of fabricating them, since the configuration of the fiber may differ from the preform from which it is drawn. The new technology will provide value in significantly reducing costs in materials and labor associated with existing trial and error procedures by providing a tool capable of predicting in advance the preform configuration and parameters necessary to draw a desired fiber. Besides enhancing scientific understanding of the physics of fiber drawing, the development of this tool would allow more rapid exploration of the possibilities offered by specialty optical fibers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project would lay the mathematical groundwork necessary to develop prediction software for specialty optical fibers. By developing a mathematical model of the fluid dynamics of fiber drawing that incorporates both air channels and inclusions of viscous fluid, it would be applicable to a wide range of specialty optical fibers being developed today, including multicore fibers. The proposed project would additionally attempt to overcome previous efforts' restrictions on the slenderness of the draw-down region. Because the model will be specialized to the geometry of fiber drawing, an implementation will run fast enough for fabricators to explore a large space of possible parameters, allowing them to realize their fiber designs precisely. The model will be tested against numerical simulations of viscous threads and against experimental data. A successful outcome of the proposed project will be the development of methods that are accurate, fast enough for optimization work, and require only parameters that can be easily measured in draw towers. Implementing these methods in software will provide a crucial tool for fabricators in this rapidly expanding market.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ There is growing interest in optical fiber technology that goes beyond the standard fibers that are currently in widespread use.  New "specialty" optical fibers are being developed for applications in communications, medicine, manufacturing, and many other industries.  Many of these specialty fibers have complex structures that incorporate multiple cores, air channels, and unusual core and cladding shapes, among other innovations.  Unfortunately, they can be difficult to make.  When a preform is heated and drawn down to produce a fiber, surface tension can cause any structures in the preform to deform, so that these structures end up different in the fiber.  This deformation depends on the parameters used to draw the fiber, such as the draw speed, the temperature of the furnace used to heat the preform, and any pressurization.  Because of this, repeated trials are often required to find the preform design and the draw parameters that will produce the desired structure in the fiber.  This results in wasted resources and increases the cost of development for new fibers.  Previously, a mathematical method was introduced to calculate in advance the fiber that would be produced by drawing a given preform.  Whereas general purpose computational fluid dynamics software is too slow to be practical for all but the simplest designs, this method is easy to implement, fast, and only requires a handful of inputs.  This makes it suitable for exploring a range of preform designs, which would allow a fabricator to determine how to produce a desired fiber without having to rely solely on trial and error.  However, the method does not always accurately predict how the draw parameters influence the fiber structure.  In addition, it only works for fibers made from a single material.  Since choosing the correct parameters is of prime importance to fabricators, and since many new fiber designs require combinations of materials that may have different temperature-viscosity relations, it is desirable to remedy these deficiencies.  In Phase I, we have traced the inaccuracy in the method to a simplifying assumption, that the diameter of the preform is small compared to the length over which it is drawn down.  Using a new method that does not make this assumption, we have shown that the structure of a fiber can be accurately predicted from the structure of the preform and the draw parameters.  This new method can easily be generalized to fibers made from multiple materials.  Although more difficult to implement than the old method, the new method is still much faster than general purpose software, which makes it suitable for finding the preform design and draw parameters that will produce a desired fiber.  Once it is implemented in software, the need for trial and error will be greatly reduced.  This will allow fabricators to more rapidly develop new specialty optical fibers to exploit the possibilities offered by this technology.
