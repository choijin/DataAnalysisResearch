<AbstractNarration>The Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP) through Targeted Infusion Projects supports the development, implementation, and study of evidence-based innovative models and approaches for improving the preparation and success of HBCU undergraduate students so that they may pursue STEM graduate programs and/or careers. The project at Lane College seeks to improve the first-year experience for Biology and Chemistry majors. The project aims to improve student retention, engagement, and academic progress in STEM by infusing research and peer-led team learning in General Biology and General Chemistry foundational courses. Lane College freshmen are mainly from underserved minority populations, and many are first generation college students who would not otherwise receive the benefit of higher education. In addition, very few students engage in undergraduate research opportunities and most are underprepared for a career in STEM. This project will engage a large number of underserved minority students in scientific research, improve student foundational laboratory skills, and provide students with qualifications for graduate and professional school. It will significantly increase the number of Lane College students completing the Biology and Chemistry programs. These benefits will result in an increase in the number of minority students entering STEM fields, thereby leading to a more diverse workforce. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The overall goal of the project is to improve STEM retention through student-focused approaches that enhance student learning and core competencies within foundational courses: General Biology and General Chemistry. This goal will be accomplished through the following specific objectives: 1) Adopt and implement an evidence-based Peer Tutoring approach in foundational courses for Biology and Chemistry to increase student retention and academic performance; and 2) Develop core competencies necessary for success in a career in science early through inquiry-based experiences in General Biology and General Chemistry Laboratory courses. The benefits of achieving the objectives of this project include: 1) increased student learning of fundamental concepts in Biology and Chemistry; and 2) improved STEM education and research at Lane College while honing students' interest in STEM fields as a major and as a career. This project is a collaborative effort between the Biology and Chemistry departments within the Division of Natural and Physical Sciences and Mathematics.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Lane College is a Historically Black College located in Jackson, TN.  Founded in 1882 by former slave Bishop Isaac Lane, the college is committed to educating underserved students through student-centered approaches.  This project focused on improving academic performance in General Biology and Chemistry through the implementation of active-learning pedagogies, peer-mentoring and undergraduate research.  We partnered with the Office of First Year Experience to create peer mentoring program for our first and second-year biology and chemistry students.  Peer mentors were high achieving juniors and seniors and completed training focused on undergraduate research, leadership, and responsible conduct of research.  Our faculty received training in active-learning strategies at conferences and workshops.  They then re-designed the syllabi for the foundational biology and chemistry courses to focus on key concepts and integrate active-learning pedagogies within the courses.  These methods included flipped-classroom, instant feedback assessments, process oriented guided inquiry learning, and case-based teaching to engage students with course material.  Furthermore, we also revamped our foundational laboratory courses to include inquiry-based activities or course-based undergraduate research experiences.  Our peer mentors served as supplemental instructors for the foundational courses and assisted with course-based undergraduate research projects.  Intellectual Merit:  This project explored the impact of active-learning strategies, including flipped-classrooms, peer mentoring, and course-based undergraduate research experiences on student performance and persistence in STEM within the context of an HBCU.  Students who were taught using active-learning pedagogies showed increased scores on validated assessments of key foundational concepts in molecular cell biology and natural selection compared to their peers taught with traditional lecture.  The bioinformatics research projects in General Biology I contributed to comparative genomics research as part of the Genomics Education Partnership.  Additionally, projects in General Biology II provided new insights in local plant and microbial diversity.  Twenty-five students are authors on nine student abstracts presented at national meetings, including American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology (ASBMB), American Society for Cell Biology (ASCB), and The National Organization for the Professional Advancement of Black Chemists and Chemical Engineers (NOBCChE).  Our study on the impact of active-learning and course-based undergraduate research experiences was recently published in the American Chemical Society symposium book Growing Diverse STEM Communities: Methodology, Impact, and Evidence.  Broader Impacts:  This project considerably impacted STEM education and research at Lane College through the implementation of high-impact practices such as peer mentoring and undergraduate research. Through project activities, we engaged twenty-five to seventy-five students in course-based undergraduate research each semester.  During the project, nine peer-mentor students participated in the traditional apprenticeship research experiences in Chemistry and Biology and two recent graduates served as project coordinators.  One student was awarded 3rd place in student oral presentation competition at the National Role Models Conference, Minority Access, Inc., four students received travel awards to present at ASBMB ASCB, and NOBCChE annual meetings, and one student was inducted into the ASBMB National Honor Society Chi Omega Lambda.  Eight of these alumni are now enrolled in graduate school, including two students in Ph.D. programs.  This project also contributed to the career advancement of women and minority faculty, two of whom were promoted to Associate Professor.
