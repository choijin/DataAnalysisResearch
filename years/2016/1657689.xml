<AbstractNarration>The doctoral dissertation research project will develop a new general method to measure the impact individual districts have on estimates of advantage associated with different configurations of legislative units.  The doctoral student will empirically examine the relationship between existing indicators of district boundary configuration and new measures that he will develop and test.  He will evaluate the fundamental assumptions common in the analysis of electoral advantage, and he will assess the validity of different measures as well as fundamental statistical assumptions in electoral modeling techniques in order to determine the robustness of estimates to spatial dependence.  This project will expand basic understanding of electoral dynamics.  It will improve the accuracy, fidelity, and usefulness of electoral models, and it will provide new tools for analyzing legislative district plans, thereby contributing to societal debates about the configuration of electoral unit boundaries.  The simulation techniques developed in this project also will be applicable for sensitivity analysis of other kinds of spatial models.  As a Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement award, this award also will provide support to enable a promising student to establish a strong independent research career.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The doctoral student undertaking this project will extend existing symmetry measures to examine individual district contributions to the estimated asymmetry of a redistricting plan.  These new local measures of district influence will be used to analyze the impact strangely shaped districts have on a plan's overall estimated advantage for one group over others.  Two fundamental components of electoral models will be assessed.  The student will interview redistricting officials and stakeholders to guide and inform the development of new measures of electoral advantage in order to ensure they are meaningful and useful in practice.  He also will evaluate the impact of geospatial dependence in estimating the relationship between the share of seats a group wins in a legislature and the share of votes the group receives across all districts.  He will assess legislative election models for potential spatial misspecification, and he will assess the degree to which an increase in aggregate support for a political group is modeled by a set of independent, randomly distributed district changes.  The student also will examine the spatial structure of electoral swings to improve the models on which the new local influence measures depend&lt;br/&gt;.</AbstractNarration>

The dissertation, defended in December of 2017 (due for publican in winter of 2019) involved four distinct projects:  Data: Development of an open replicable geographical dataset about elections in US Congressional Constituencies Post-Hoc Analysis: Analysis of models used to assess partisan bias in electoral districting plans.  Shape &amp; Local Bias: Analysis of the correspondence between measures of geographical "regularity" for congressional districts &amp; the individual district contribution to electoral bias Validity Study: Interviews to assess the construct validity &amp; practical applicability of measures of partisan bias.    Below, the project results will be discussed in turn.  Data  Using two existing datasets and a significant amount of cleaning, linking, and processing, a new data product, outlined in Wolf (2017) was developed. Further, Wolf (2017) examines basic validation and comparison of the new dataset to an existing &amp; longstanding dataset, ICPSR 6311. Finally, Wolf (2017) makes public the entire chain of processing required to obtain the final data product; the entire process is repeatable when the input data changes or is updated.

Post-Hoc Analysis  In this phase of the project, basic assumptions in models of partisan bias were analyzed. The study found that many assumptions about how vote shares tend to change and vary over space and time were found to be unrealistic.

This is important: while the typical model of the electorate may appear to be overly simplistic from a geographical perspective, the introduction of spatial or geographic information did not significantly change results.  Shape &amp; Local Bias  One way individuals feel they can identify gerrymandering is to look at the shape of a district itself. If the district looks odd, then it is likely gerrymandered. However, this misses the mark. Oddly shaped districts can  act either in favor of and against the party that wins the district.
