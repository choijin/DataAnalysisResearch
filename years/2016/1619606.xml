<AbstractNarration>Non-technical Description&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Earthquakes pose a significant hazard in many areas of the United States and the world, and understanding the processes that generate earthquakes is a key problem in Earth science today.  A leading idea is that fault rocks have to weaken during the earliest stages of the earthquake; otherwise, fault slip stops and large earthquakes would not occur.  If such "dynamic weakening" occurs, we should see evidence for it within rocks from fault zones that have experienced earthquakes.  This project is studying rocks from the San Andreas Fault zone to uncover traces of dynamic weakening from earthquakes, and to understand what conditions might lead to such weakening.  The results from this work will enable improved models of the hazards posed by large earthquakes.  In addition, this project is educating students in a wide range of earthquake geology and fault rock topics via hands-on research experience, and communicating fundamental earthquake geology and physics, scientific drilling, and coring to broader audiences via social media, videos, and in-person presentations.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Abstract &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI team is using field observations and samples from the San Andreas Fault Observatory at Depth (SAFOD) core and the Cajon Pass drill core, combined with new and previous field and drill core samples of the San Andreas Fault, to elucidate evidence for thermally activated dynamic weakening mechanisms in large seismogenic faults.  The team seeks evidence for these mechanisms in samples that may preserve the texture and composition of slip weakening at depth. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The team is evaluating the distribution of these mechanisms across a range of spatial and temporal scales, and testing how well exhumed faults represent faults at depth. The team is integrating optical and scanning electron microscopy with detailed X-Ray diffraction mineralogy, micro-scale whole-rock geochemistry, and stable isotope analyses.  The PIs are examining slip surfaces with Laser Raman microthermometric spectroscopy on fluid inclusions to determine fluid compositions and temperatures in veins, and with Raman and X-ray Near Edge Spectroscopy to investigate potentially new indicators of thermally driven elemental changes of carbon, iron, and manganese on the faults. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of this work include: 1) Educating students in a range of earthquake geology and fault rock petrological topics, ultimately adding uniquely trained technical researchers to the STEM workforce; and 2) Increasing awareness of fundamental earthquake geology and physics, scientific drilling, and coring to broader audiences through the use of engaging hands-on activities, class exercises, videos, and social media platforms.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ We examined the nature, extent, and types of deformation and chemical alteration in the San Andreas Fault as sampled by the SAFOD drill hole.  The project retrieved core and cuttings, and we used these materials to study how faults operate.  Specifically, we examined the rocks to determine if, and how, they were weaker than other fault-related rocks.  Our results are significant in the following ways.     The work performed for this research incorporates a wide range of methods, and depending on the nature of research needs, illustrates an expanded toolkit that geologists may incorporate to examine deformed rocks.  We used microscopic studies of rock that used visible light, electron, and X-ray illumination to determine how rocks deformed and altered at the grain scale. We also used a range of chemical studies to determine what chemical reactions and processes may have  occurred during fault slip.  These studies revealed the importance of elemental carbon and hydrocarbons in the fault zone.  We also show that aqueous fluids (that is, water-based) became entrained in the fault zone.  We suggest that these chemical processes led to a weakening of the rocks outside of the main slip zone.  Such zones, termed damaged zones, or compliant zones, or zones of plasticity, may be very effective at adsorbing earthquake energy and this, have a strong reduction on how much ground shaking might occur far from a fault during an earthquake.  The chemical processes we document may work with physical slip processes to reduce the amount of slip that occurs during an earthquake in the shallower parts of faults.  SAFOD intersected the San Andreas Fault at 3 km depth, which is where other strike slip faults have transitions from the highest amount of slip during an earthquake to nearly 50% less at the surface.  The processes we documented in our work might help explain how this ?hidden slip? &ndash; slip that doesn?t occur during the earthquake, is accommodated.  We educated six graduate and undergraduate students in this work, and they all are going on in various science fields.  Several are going to work in energy-related work, and others are getting master?s or Ph.D.s in geosciences.  We performed a range of outreach activities for people, including young students, parents, and undergraduate students.        These studies have broad implications for seismic hazards studies.  Better models of how a damage zone affects ground shaking has major importance for understanding the amount and distribution of shaking.  The understanding of how slip might decrease near the earth?s surface during an earthquake, and how it subsequently is accommodated, might help us better interpret the slip geologists determine from other studies at the surface, in order to determine how much slip might occur at depth.
