<AbstractNarration>This project is a collaborative effort that supports the deployment of two instrument packages as part of the ATom campaign. The objective of ATom is to make "tomographic" type maps of the global distribution of aerosols, reactive gases, and short-lived climate forcing agents using aircraft measurements.  The NSF-supported HIPPO campaign previously demonstrated the feasibility and advantages of the tomographic sampling used in the design of the ATom mission.  In addition to the study of short-lived climate forcing agents, this project includes global-scale measurements that can advance other fundamental aspects of carbon and climate science, such as understanding the distribution of carbon sinks and the links between ocean biochemistry, carbon cycling, and climate change. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The NASA-supported ATom project consists of four deployments in order to map distributions in all seasons. The instrument packages to be deployed include the Airborne Oxygen Instrument (AO2), which provides rapid in situ measurements of atmospheric O2 and CO2 concentrations, and a flask sampler that collects samples for analysis of O2/N2, CO2 concentration, CO2 isotopes and Ar/N2.  By combining these measurements with large-scale atmospheric transport models, direct constraints on the corresponding air-sea fluxes of heat, O2, and CO2 are obtained.  Atmospheric O2 measurements can reveal the vertical and latitudinal extent of hemispheric seasonal ocean O2 outgassing and in-gassing signals and define spatial gradients at enough times in the seasonal cycle to derive climatological annual-mean distributions.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This award supported measurements of atmospheric O2, CO2, Ar, and CO2 isotope ratios on three global surveys conducted by the NASA DC-8 as part of the Atmospheric Tomography (ATom) mission from 2017-2018. A previous award supported these measurements on the first ATom campaign in 2016.  Our ATom measurements have mapped atmospheric O2 and CO2 with unprecedented detail and spatial extent. The 8 north-south transects, 4 each in the Pacific and Atlantic basins spread over the seasonal cycle, reveal the breathing of the Northern Extratropical terrestrial biosphere, the atmospheric signature of marine productivity in both hemispheres, and smaller scale features traceable to forest, surface ocean, and industrial emissions.

Furthermore, the O2 and CO2 measurements have proved useful in conjunction with measurements of other pollutants in constraining the mixture of CO2 emission sources from Northern Africa. Our additional measurements of deviations in the Ar/N2 ratio have provided a unique window onto lower stratospheric mixing via gravitational fractionation, and in the troposphere these measurements also show the imprint of seasonal air-sea heat fluxes.  Figure 1 shows interpolated altitude-latitude cross-sections from the NCAR AO2 instrument overlain with observations on flasks collected by the NCAR/Scripps Medusa whole air sampler for the southbound Pacific basin portion of ATom-4 in April-May of 2018. The CO2 cross-section shows concentrations elevated by over 5 ppm throughout the entire northern extratropical troposphere, with enhancements as high as 8 ppm north of 60 N. This reflects the seasonal accumulation of northern extratropical CO2 emissions over winter from a combination of net terrestrial respiration and fossil fuel burning.  The molar equivalent color scales in Figure 1 reveal larger northern extratropical depletions in O2 as a result of the greater than 1 oxidation ratio for fossil fuel burning and the additional ocean uptake of O2 resulting from both ventilation of northern ocean waters with accumulated respiration signatures and the cooling of surface waters. Conversely, at southern high latitudes, ocean heating and net marine productivity lead to O2 emissions over the austral summer which we observed as a strong accumulated O2 signal throughout the southern extratropical tropopause. The composite tracer atmospheric potential oxygen (APO = O2 + 1.1 ? CO2) is essentially conservative with respect to terrestrial processes and highlights this ocean signal.  Given the relative lack of land plants and industrial emissions at high southern latitudes, the observed southern hemisphere CO2 field was comparatively flat. APO suggests that the interhemispheric gradient in O2 at this time of year is approximately half owing to air-sea fluxes. These flights also intercepted stratospheric air poleward of 60 N and below 300 hPa, and in an isolated intrusion at 33 N and 300 hPa, with correspondingly high O3 and other stratospheric tracers.  North-south cross sections from all four ATom campaigns graphically illustrate the seasonally evolving gradients in CO2 and O2, both horizontally and vertically. Higher O2 and lower CO2 is seen near the surface in summer in the northern hemisphere. APO also undergoes a large seasonal cycle, mostly reflecting seasonal air-sea exchanges of O2. These measurements are allowing us to make quantitative estimates of hemispheric scale seasonal productivity for both land and oceans.  This award has directly supported one postdoc and one graduate student, and has indirectly supported an additional two postdocs and three graduate students who are using the measurements in their work. All measurements supported by this award are publicly available in the ATom data repositories at NASA and ORNL.       Last Modified: 12/15/2020       Submitted by: Ralph F Keeling]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
