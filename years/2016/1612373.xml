<AbstractNarration>Northern New Mexico College serves a 77% underrepresented minority and underprepared population with high attrition rates in the first two years. The College of Engineering and Technology is developing a research-generated knowledge base of how this student demographic best learns complex foundational Physical Science concepts by using the evidence-based Wright State model to create an introductory Physics course with project based activities that students will take prior to a theory-based Physics course. Students are being tracked to determine if this intervention leads to increases in learning, ability to apply concepts, and retention. Additionally, Native American and Hispanic students with high degrees of interdependent self-construal are being studied to determine if they respond better to active learning prior to theoretical learning. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigators will use a matched subjects samples methodology and a modification of the Solomon four-group research design. In addition, undergraduate research experiences are being studied to determine if they foster retention and greater clarity on future career pathways among these unique populations. The project expects to generate new scientific knowledge of effective interventions leading to retention in engineering among students from rural and tightly knit communities. For example, advances in understanding of how under-prepared populations best learn; contributions to education research regarding effective practices in engineering teaching and learning among understudied groups; and discoveries on successful strategies that can broaden participation of Native Americans, Hispanics and women in engineering programs. The proposed work is likely to produce a model that can be disseminated to other institutions facing similar challenges, or those that are focusing on diversifying engineering undergraduate population in their programs.</AbstractNarration>

Five different courses were redesigned to employ hands-on, engineering-contextualized, active learning methods to foster better engagement and learning among our unique underrepresented minority (URM; 77%, approximately 72% Hispanics) and academically underprepared students (approximately 83%). We have built and enhanced our laboratory facilities (including a grant-funded subsonic wind-tunnel, and several other Physics equipment), and incorporated them in our freshman Math and Physics courses. A total of 124 different students (including the EMET program and our other engineering technology program in Information Technology) were impacted so far with the new curricula and laboratory facilities. A total of 11 students (9 funded by the project) were trained in tutoring and mentoring, who served as peer-tutors in these classes and helped reshape the learning community.</p> <p class="Default">These initiatives resulted in the following significant outcomes: First, the retention rates among cohorts in the Engineering Math and Physics classes (Fall 2016- Fall 2019) have been significantly higher (80-100% from first to second semester, 62-88% in the third semester, and 57-79% in the fourth semester; as compared to NNMC&prime;s general student retention rates of 78%, 66%, and 50% in the second, third and fourth semesters, respectively). Secondly, the recruitment and retention efforts helped to grow the enrollment numbers from 23 in Fall 2015 (prior to the inception of the project) to 35 in Fall 2019, an increase by 52% (target was 45%). Finally, we see a significantly higher persistence and eventually graduation rate following the inception of the project in 2016.

Several of these students were engaged in research or internships for multiple semesters. Among the 18 graduates so far from the Bachelor in EMET program, 13 students were involved either in tutoring/mentoring, academic research or external internships. All of the graduates were impacted by the project, either through research/tutoring and mentoring training/internships, or they had been part of the new cohorts who went through the new Math and Physics curricula. Out of these 18 graduates from the EMET program, at least 78% are currently working in a technical job in STEM field, or in STEM education (most of them started working in these jobs even before graduation).
