<AbstractNarration>This research asks a significant scientific and humanitarian question: what happens when a smoothly functioning and sustainable socio-ecological system is disturbed by refugees from an external political crisis? The question is timely as well as scientifically important.  A valuable opportunity to investigate it on a small and thus manageable research scale is provided by the crisis in Northeast Nigeria. In the last two years, thousands of pastoralists have fled the insecurity caused by Boko Haram in Nigeria and moved with their livestock to the Logone Floodplain in the Far North Region of Cameroon. In earlier research, the researchers, Dr. Mark Moritz (Ohio State University) and his team, found that the mobile pastoralists who were already using the Logone region were sustainably managing these grazing resources without conflict. They had developed a decentralized and flexible system in which access was open to all, regardless of ethnicity, nationality, seniority, or socioeconomic status. This baseline research plus the disturbance provided by the refugee newcomers gives the researchers a rare opportunity to see how resilient a previously documented system is to an extreme perturbation. Will the ethos of open access survive when the influx of newcomers doubles the population the system must support?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cumulatively, the human, animal, and natural elements of the Logone plain comprise a complex adaptive system in which, even though there is no central authority, individual decision-making results in an ideal free distribution of grazing pressure over the available grazing resources. Now the researchers will look to see if there is still an ideal free distribution of pastoralists; if the influx of refugee pastoralists has affected the ethos and practice of open access; and what other changes the influx has brought about. They will use GPS/GIS technology to map the locations of pastoralist camps; document at intervals the current distribution of vegetative resources by using the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, a remotely sensed vegetative index that is refreshed frequently; document transhumance orbits to look for changes; and interview both Nigerian and Cameroonian pastoralists about their strategies. The urgency of this project, and hence the need for a RAPID award, is that at this particular moment the pastoral system is under the greatest stress, which allows the researchers to study in real time a socio-ecological system as it adapts or collapses.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The goal of this project was to examine the impact of the humanitarian crisis in Northeast Nigeria on the pastoral system in the neighboring country of Cameroon. In the last three years, thousands of pastoralists have fled the insecurity caused by Boko Haram in Nigeria and moved with their livestock to the Logone Floodplain in the Far North Region of Cameroon. The question we examined was how the influx of refugee pastoralists affected the management of common-pool grazing resources in the floodplain. In a prior research projected we have shown that mobile pastoralists were sustainably managing these grazing resources in a situation of open access and that management works as a self-organizing complex adaptive system in which individual decision-making results in an ideal free distribution of grazing pressure over the available grazing resources. While pastoralists previously emphatically argued that access is open for all, regardless of ethnicity, nationality, seniority, or socioeconomic status, it remained to be seen how strong this ethos of open access is when the number of newcomers increases a hundred-fold. In other words, the big question was how resilient the pastoral system is. We examined the resilience of the pastoral system in a number of ways. First, we examined whether there is still an ideal free distribution of pastoralists over the available grazing resources. Second, we examined whether and how the influx of refugee pastoralists strained the ethos and practice of open access. Third, we investigated other ways in which the refugee crisis is straining the pastoral system.</p> <p>To achieve the goal of our project, we engaged in the following research activities. To document the distribution of mobile pastoralists and assess whether the distribution of grazing pressure matches that of grazing resources in the Logone Floodplain we used a data collection and data analysis protocol that we have used successfully in prior studies. First we used GPS/GIS technology to map the locations of all pastoralists&rsquo; camps in our study area in the floodplain at three different times during the year (November, February, May). During these visits, we identified all the households in the camp, the number of herds, the name of the campsite, and whether or not the pastoralists were refugees from Nigeria, and how long they have been in Cameroon. Second, to estimate the distribution of the available resources in the floodplain we used remote sensing data, in particular the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), which is an indicator of the quality and quantity of forage. NDVI is one of the most common remote sensed vegetation indices for measuring the plant growth and vegetation cover. We have collected all the data and are currently in the process of analyzing the data. We hope to publish our findings in the coming year.</p> <p>We also conducted semi-structured interviews with Nigerian and Cameroonian pastoralists to understand how strong the ethos of open access is now the number of newcomers has increased many-fold, for example, to find out whether Cameroonian pastoralists were more likely to engage in territorial behavior because of increasing competition for grazing resources. We also sought to better understand the adaptive capacities of refugee pastoralists. In particular, we were interested how Nigerian pastoralists have used their social network and scouting strategies as they migrate to unknown areas.</p> <p>Finally, we interviewed Nigerian pastoralists and asked about the hardships of their migration and to assess their vulnerability. We have written a short article for the online magazine The Conversation in which we presented our preliminary findings that described the hardships of pastoralist refugees from Nigeria (https://theconversation.com/pastoralists-fleeing-boko-haram-face-new-challenges-in-cameroon-60411).</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 12/09/2016<br>      Modified by: Mark&nbsp;Moritz</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1600221/1600221_10404057_1481298641142_PastoralistRefugeeinCameroon-picturebyMouadjamouAhmadou--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1600221/1600221_10404057_1481298641142_PastoralistRefugeeinCameroon-picturebyMouadjamouAhmadou--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Pastoralist Refugee in Cameroon."><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1600221/1600221_10404057_1481298641142_PastoralistRefugeeinCameroon-picturebyMouadjamouAhmadou--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Pastoralist Refugee in Cameroon."></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Pastoralist Refugee in Cameroon.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Mouadjamou Ahmadou</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Mark&nbsp;Moritz</div> <div class="imageTitle">Pastoralist Refugee in Cameroon.</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1600221/1600221_10404057_1481298726100_Mark3--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1600221/1600221_10404057_1481298726100_Mark3--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Mouadjamou Ahmadou interviewing a pastoralist."><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1600221/1600221_10404057_1481298726100_Mark3--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Mouadjamou Ahmadou interviewing a pastoralist."></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Mouadjamou Ahmadou interviewing a pastoralist.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Mouadjamou Ahmadou</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Mark&nbsp;Moritz</div> <div class="imageTitle">Mouadjamou Ahmadou interviewing a pastoralist.</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
