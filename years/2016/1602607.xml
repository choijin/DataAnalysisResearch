<AbstractNarration>This project will increase the science return from the still operating NSF FIREBIRD-II CubeSat mission and apply lessons learned from this effort to broaden the objectives of other upcoming CubeSat missions.  CubeSats are recently developed economical tools that because of their size and low cost can carry aloft only a few instruments generally built using off-the-shelf components. Because of this, observations must be designed to narrowly focus on the specific science objectives of the mission. Despite this limitation, NSF's CubeSat program has demonstrated a high scientific output from CubeSats launched since the initiation of this program in 2010.  The ultimate goal of this project is to contribute to the design of multipoint networks and constellation-type campaigns that use simpler payloads but combined can be targeted to attack some of the more complex problems in the Geospace environment and related fields. The broader impacts of this project are significant.  The project builds directly on previous NSF investment in the FIREBIRD-II mission, and will maximize the benefits (both scientific and in terms of student education and training) from this and future CubeSat missions supported by NSF. The project will likely contribute to a better understanding of 'space weather' by better understanding the radiation belt sources and losses and thus indirectly contribute to more robust space infrastructure.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A key challenge to be addressed in this project is in integrating disparate types of measurements across platforms to address scientific problems that are beyond the original scope of the individual missions. For the FIREBIRD-II mission, this translates into the development of additional data products such as electron spectra that enable exploring science questions about the spatial scale of precipitation where coordinated measurements can get at the picture but the data needs to be transformed into forms that are comparable to other instruments.  To investigate the spatial scales of precipitation regions, electron observations by FIREBIRD-II can, for example, be combined with ground-based VLF receivers capable of detecting D- and E-region ionization due to precipitating radiation belt electrons or radars that observe the associated ionospheric heating signatures from lower energy electrons.  The lessons learned in this development will be applied to the upcoming AFRL DSX and VPM CubeSats scheduled for launch in the end of 2016 and early 2017, respectively. Combining these CubeSats with FIREBIRD-II and other existing space assets that measure radiation belt electron precipitation, lightning observing networks on the ground, radars, VLF receivers, and a sophisticated model of lightning whistler propagation and dissipation, a campaign will be developed to study for the first time the radiation belt - lightning interactions from the lower atmosphere to the ionosphere to space and observe the resulting precipitation.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The purpose of this work is to advance our understanding of sink and loss processes due to energetic particple precipitation from the radiation belts into the atmosphere.  Space plasmas are strongly inhomogeneous over a range of spatial scales.  Single point observations cannot distinguish between time and spatial variations of plasma phenomena, so multi-point observations are crucial to give a first approximation of the size of the active region.  In particular, microbursts are a key to understanding these dynamics as they repesent radiation belt losses, possibly removing the entire pre-storm outer zone in a single day.  To untangle the spatial-temporal ambiguities associated with measurements of electron microbursts, we use a CubeSat (FIREBIRD-II) to provide space-based measurements of precipitating electrons in low Earth orbit in conjunction with radar data collected by PFISR.  Our goal was to compare in situ space measurements of precipitating particles to ground-based remote sensing of the signature in the atmosphere.      Using space-based measurements, we use precipitating particle fluxes to find the ionization rate in the atmosphere using the Electron Precipitation Monte Carlo (EPMC) transport method.  The rate is then used to calculate the expected electron density in the D-region by applying chemistry models using the Glukhov-Pasko-Inan five speciales (GP15) atmospheric chemistry model.  This model is able to capture the small scale structure of the precipitation with values that are 1-2 orders of magnitude lower than the electron densities that are typically observed by radar.  This necessitates an inversion technique that can map the radar observed quantities to the spacecraft observables.       The inversion is divided into two steps.  First we take the electron density radar measurement and connect it to the ionization rate using a probabilitic approach using Bayes' theorem.  We then invert synthetic and radar data and produce ionization curves that are forward modeled to return the electron densities.  The parameter used to describe FIREBIRD flux observations is the characteristic energy of the exponential energy distribution.  This parameters maps to the slope of the energy distribution and gives an estimate as to how much flux we have in each observing channel.  The characteristic energy values for FIREBIRD-II obser vations are within a few hundred keV.  This means that the ionization produced by precipitating particles should create higher impact in the D-region ionosphere.  We achieved good agreement between the electron density and that produced by the inversion in the D region ionosphere over 3 orders of magnitude.  This ionization rate inversion technique is applicable to other chemistry models and can be used in higher regions of the ionosphere as well.     Our future work involves developing a sensitivity study and in particular, varying the chemistry model to determine how the coefficients can change the output.
