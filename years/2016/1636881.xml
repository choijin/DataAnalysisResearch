<AbstractNarration>The STEM +Computing Partnership (STEM+C) program seeks to advance multidisciplinary integration of computing in STEM teaching and learning through applied research and development across one or more domains; advancement of computer science in K-12; and broadening participation in computing fields. Investments are made in critical areas of pedagogy, pre-service and in-service teacher professional development. With the expansion of computing education in mainstream K-12 schools and the demand for teachers surpassing the number of teachers prepared to teach computer science, teacher preparation programs must be engaged to produce a scalable, sustainable pipeline of computer science teachers; thus, there's a need for computing education in the schools of education, including pre-service teacher development, faculty hiring, and research. This project proposes two workshop meetings designed to emphasize the importance of computing education in pre-service teacher preparation, provide models of computer science teacher preparation, and discuss challenges faced by education programs in advancing computing education alongside mathematics and science education. Given how integral computing is within the other STEM disciplines, the integration of computer science and computational thinking within the other STEM disciplines will be explored within the context of the workshop.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed workshops will bring together leaders from schools of education, teacher educators, educational researchers, and state administrators to discuss issues faced by schools of education and K-12 schools in the creation of computer science educator programs. Outcomes will include a list of issues that schools of education will need to face as they consider preparing computer science teachers. The conference will also produce a research agenda for subsequent examination of these issues. The conference organizers have been involved in the education of hundreds of computer science teachers and will lead discussions and record important outcomes to create a body of knowledge about computing education for K-12 schools.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   School leaders, such as principals and superintendents, are looking to hire teachers with requisite backgrounds for computer science instruction in their classrooms.

Faculty and PhD candidates who do research in computer science education will be able to apply for federal grants with a focus on computer science or interdisciplinary STEM education, and potentially bring private sponsorship into the college or university from technology companies and private foundations interested in supporting computer science education.    Through this project we have convened computer science education researchers, leaders from large departments of education, teacher education researchers, and computer scientists in a workshop held in April 2017 to create a guidance report for schools of education regarding computer science education. The report, Priming the Computing Teacher Pump,  shares the discussion outcomes and recommendations from the workshop group members. Additionally, the workshop talks and panels were recorded and are available at http://computingteacher.org.    In the report, the PIs offer a set of recommendations as actionable steps that schools of education together with other departments and school districts can take and&mdash;with appropriate resources and time available&mdash;build the foundation to house computer science education within their faculty, students, and teacher education programs.      In order to prepare the sections of the report, attendees at the April 2017 meeting participated in different working groups discussed issues related to each question and produced the following recommendations:    Teacher Education   What do Teachers Need to Know About Computer Science?  As CS becomes more integrated in many disciplines and careers, more teachers will need to know about computing in a way that?s relevant to their discipline and teaching practice. Clearly, not every teacher needs to know how to be or how to prepare future software developers. We need to define how CS is relevant in the context of pre-service teacher development.   Teacher Development Models for Computer Science Education. We need to figure out how teacher development for computing education fits into existing pre-service teacher education programs.      Content   Computer Science Education in Teacher Education. What are the computing education concepts that all teachers need to know as a part of general teacher education programs.   Standalone Computer Science Education in K-12. Some CS will likely be taught in mathematics or science classes, or maybe English, Journalism, and Economics classes. But some CS will be taught as a standalone class.   Integrating Computer Science Education into other Disciplines. CS is an important topic on its own, and is also an enabling medium to improve learning in other disciplines. As a kind of literacy, computing will end up being integrated into other disciplines, which creates a challenge for teacher preparation that crosses education programs.   Computer Science Education in grades K-8. Elementary school CS is qualitatively different than secondary school CS. We need to address a wider range of needs and possible outcomes, far beyond Advanced Placement exams.      Leadership   Preparing Educational Leaders to Support Computer Science Education. Adding CS into the U.S. K-12 education canon is more than a matter of teachers and curriculum. We also need the political will and the support of leaders in the K-12 education space.   Creating the Computer Science Education PhD Pipeline. CS education is a need for K-12, and computing education research is an important subdiscipline which will help us to understand CS learning better and to improve CS teaching. We need a pipeline of PhD researchers to grow this important research field.      The report was launched in April 2018, in an event preceding the American Educational Research Association meeting.
