<AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;PI: Scala, Melissa &lt;br/&gt;Proposal: 1554027&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposal focuses on developing a high-throughput imaging technology to measure drug response and cellular metabolism in tumor cells cultured with cells in their native environment. The data obtained will be used to predict tumor response to multiple drugs, providing information that can be used to optimize drug treatment for the individual cancer patient. The Educational Plan, which includes a new undergraduate course in optical imaging, has a strong emphasis on outreach activities directed at middle and high school students and girls.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Interference light sheet Fourier Fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (iLS-FP-FLIM) will be created and information obtained by imaging NADH and FAD coenzymes in human breast cancer cells grown in a mouse model. This will be used to predict tumor response to multiple drugs, providing information that can be used to optimize drug treatment for the individual cancer patient.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The goal of this proposal was to develop optical imaging technologies to assess drug response in patient tumors grown in the lab. These studies are important to develop new drugs for cancer patients that are based on response in human samples, rather than traditional models that do not accurately represent the human disease. We found several optical imaging technologies that can accurately assess drug response in these living patient samples. These technologies ranged in cost and complexity, including multiphoton microscopy, light sheet microscopy, and widefield fluorescence microscopy. Comparisons across technologies found that low-cost systems could be used for accurate drug response measurements, provided that careful analysis accounted for sample-to-sample variability. Characterization studies also focused on relating optical signals from cells to energy production in cells. These technologies successfully predicted drug response in patients and predicted treatments that would perform well in individual patients. Overall, these findings provide evidence for optical imaging methods to guide drug development and treatment planning in cancer patients. Over the course of these studies, we actively engaged in K-12 and community outreach. Some outreach efforts included (1) high school students in the lab who significantly contributed to research and earned authorship on papers, (2) outreach events through the Wisconsin Science Festival, (3) a virtual lab activity through Meet the Lab with PBS Wisconsin, (4) Rural Science Camp activities through Discovery Outreach, and (5) discussions with cancer survivors through Pancreas Cancer Awareness night, among many other efforts. In summary, this project advanced optical imaging technologies to impact cancer patient care while mentoring students and community members through the scientific process.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 07/19/2021<br>      Modified by: Melissa&nbsp;Skala</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
