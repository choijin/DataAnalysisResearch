<AbstractNarration>This project will respond to the needs of agricultural and green industries for more precision technicians.  Precision technologies are employed by growers across the U.S. to increase crop yield, reduce production costs and minimize negative impacts to the environment.   Precision technologies are used not only in production agriculture but by a vast number of agricultural and green industries including organic farming, nurseries and sports turf management. With the increasing use of technology, there is a need for more technicians to install, repair and maintain the new technological equipment.  Through the Precision Agriculture Program, Clark State Community College will partner with leaders in the precision agriculture industry and educational institutions to increase the number of students pursuing degrees in precision agriculture and in turn will support the needs of farmers and other green industries utilizing this emerging technology. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Clark State Community College will integrate precision agriculture and the geo-sciences by working with leaders in the precision agriculture industry and other educational institutions to  (1) grow the pipeline of Precision Agriculture students through targeted recruitment; (2) increase retention by expanding career and transfer options for precision agriculture students and (3) address the rapidly changing applications of precision technologies and prepare faculty to respond to ongoing changes in industry needs. The curriculum and knowledge developed through this proposal will be shared with other community colleges and universities through the NSF ATE National GEOTech Center website; through presentations at regional and national conferences; and through in-person faculty exchanges.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[Goals:  (1)  Grow the pipeline of Precision Agriculture students through targeted recruitment;  (2)   Increase retention by expanding career and transfer options for precision agriculture students;  (3)   Address rapidly changing applications of precision technologies and prepare faculty to respond to changes in industry needs.  Goal Progress and Results   Goal 1: Three major activities were planned:  1.1   Introduce precision agriculture technologies into Ohio high school curriculum.  1.2   Develop a summer bridge course for new students.  1.3   Increase veteran and active-duty military enrollment in precision agriculture.  Outcomes for Activity 1.1  The project called for two teacher workshops, (2017 and 2019). Due to positive feedback after the 2017 workshop and enrollment issues, a workshop was offered in summer 2018. The PIs decided to hold a third workshop in lieu of the planned summer bridge program.  Thirteen teachers attended year one, fifteen teachers in year two, and fourteen teachers in 2019. One notable difference in teacher demographics in years two and three is that the teachers were from throughout Ohio and not limited to the school districts close to the college service district. This state-wide participation is an indicator that the project is having a broader impact throughout Ohio thus achieving Goal 1.1.  These workshops introduced precision agriculture technology to teachers, with the goal of enabling them to teach this content as dual high school/college credit or as a part of their curriculum.  All teachers also stated they are now able to inform students about career opportunities in Precision Agriculture and about Precision Agriculture degree options.  Participant survey results indicated a greater understanding of the technology and how to use it in classrooms after workshop completion.  Outcomes for Activity 1.2:  Precision Agriculture AGR 1750 was developed and approved in year one. This new introductory course was developed with three purposes in mind:  Serve as the first course for students entering new college degree options.  Serve as the dual credit course for high schools.  Provide a summer bridge program for college students.  This course, was taught during fall for students entering the Precision Ag degree. The course is serving its intended purpose, however program enrollment remains a challenge.  There was interest from high school workshop participants, only two teachers offered the course. Faculty are working with the Ohio Department of Education to start a new career Precision Agriculture pathway.  Outcomes for Activity 1.3:  The PIs have encountered difficulties in attracting veterans.  Goal 2: Increase retention by expanding career and transfer options for students.   Two major activities:  2.1  Provide experiential learning for students.  2.2  Expand articulation with 4-year institutions.   Outcomes for Activity 2.1  100% of eligible students were placed into experiential learning. Positive results were noted by students and employers.  Outcomes for Activity 2.2  In year one, a new articulation was developed with Central State University. During year two, agreements were signed with four additional institutions.  Goal 3: Three major activities planned:  3.1  Create a new option that addresses the technical knowledge, skills, and competencies needed for precision agriculture technicians.  3.2  Provide professional development opportunities for faculty.  3.3  Assist institutions in updating and developing curriculum.  Outcomes for Activity 3.1 A new Precision Agriculture degree option that addresses the technical knowledge, skills and competencies needed for precision agriculture technicians was created.  Outcomes for Activity 3.2: Faculty development.  Significant collaboration has occurred with Parkland College, Illinois and Ellsworth College, Iowa for curriculum development. This relationship has proved to be very beneficial to all parties.  Outcomes for Activity 3.3 Assist other institutions in updating and developing precision agriculture curriculum.  The PIs attended the ATE conferences 2017 and 2018 and hosted a booth at both to share information with other institutions. In addition, the PIs made a substantial number of local, state, and national presentations, contributing to a broader project impact to assist learning about precision agriculture.
