<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award to the University of Pennsylvania provides support for workshop on Assessing Performance and Developing an Accountability System for Broadening Participation.  This workshop will convene a group of Committee on Equal Opportunities in Science and Engineering (CEOSE) members and experts from federal agencies, institutions of higher education, foundations, and nonprofit and for profit organizations for one and a half days of discussion, brainstorming, analysis, and planning on building an accountability system to measure the success of efforts to broaden participation of underrepresented groups in STEM.  It will be held at the NSF Headquarters, Arlington, VA in October 2016.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;This workshop will synthesize what agencies, foundations, and organizations currently do to measure the success of efforts they support for broadening participation and share new methods to better measure/assess broadening participation efforts. The project aims to respond to the recommendation made within CEOSE's 2015-2016 Biennial Report to Congress on developing appropriate performance measures for broadening participation by developing and disseminating  an evidence-based accountability system to advance broadening participation.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;The resources and outcomes of this project will enhance the work of Federal agencies in holding individual grantees and institutions (particularly institutions of higher education) accountable for investments made related to broadening participation and for realizing broadening participation goals.  Ultimately, the results of this workshop will be beneficial to the STEM community. These beneficial results are those that include the identification and discussion of challenges and barriers to and practices for increasing the workforce population of women, underrepresented group, and people with disabilities in STEM fields. In addition, the resources of the workshop will also be helpful to multiple communities, including the field of evaluation.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ NSF Grant No. OIA-1639188 awarded to Ira Harkavy (PI) and Louis Martin-Vega (Co-PI) supported the proposal, "Workshop on Assessing Performance and Developing an Accountability System for Broadening Participation." The goal of this proposal was to convene a group of experts from federal agencies, institutions of higher education, foundations, and nonprofit and for profit organizations for one and a half days of discussion, brainstorming, analysis, and planning on building an accountability system to measure the success of efforts to broaden participation of underrepresented groups in STEM.  In October 2016, the PI and Co-PI hosted a workshop at NSF that engaged 50 educators, administrators, and evaluators from all corners of the US science and engineering enterprise. A no-cost extension was secured to host a follow up meeting in July 2017 with a subset of workshop participants, to focus particularly on the role of higher education in developing an accountability system for broadening participation.  Two workshop reports, a blog, and a brochure were published:  "Better STEM Outcomes: Developing an Accountability System for Broadening Participation," workshop report by Ira Harkavy, Louis Martin-Vega, and Daryl Chubin (March 2017). "A New Accountability for Broadening Participation in STEM" by Ira Harkavy, Louis Martin-Vega, and Daryl Chubin (May 2017) "Assessing Performance and Developing an Accountability System for Broadening Participation: The Role of Higher Education," meeting report by Ira Harkavy, Louis Martin-Vega, Daryl Chubin, Rita A. Hodges, and Joanna Chae (October 2017) "Shared Accountability and Higher Education: A Compact Guide for Broadening Participation in STEM," brochure summarizing meeting findings and report (May 2018)   This project contributed to STEM education and STEM disciplines by beginning to address the intellectually challenging question of how to create an accountability system that would broaden participation in STEM, especially among underrepresented minorities. The project also identified the roles of institutions of higher education as leaders, and NSF as a catalyst to move principal investigators and institutions of higher education toward the goal of broadening participation.  Workshop participants discussed the pivotal role of the federal research and development agencies and other funding agencies, including NSF, toward the goal of broadening participation.  Among the recommendations for NSF?s grant review process, participants highlighted the following: While the NSF merit review system is sound, criteria could be strengthened as regards broadening participation. If intellectual merit is conceptualized to include broadening participation, the connection between inclusion and better science would be made clear. Given the impact that diversity has on intellectual creativity and the production of better science and engineering, conceptualizing broadening participation as a component of intellectual merit makes particularly good sense.  Other key findings from these meetings, which are highlighted in the published brochure, include:  An accountability system for broadening participation consists of a set of clear goals, assumptions, definitions, metrics, and a strategy for organizational change. Democratized science is inclusive, involving diverse populations in knowledge production, and results in increased advances to knowledge. Local experts who possess knowledge "on the ground" are essential to implementing an accountability system that helps to achieve community goals. Through sustained interaction, different organizational actors bring different assets&mdash;money, contacts, indigenous knowledge, specialized experience&mdash;to formulating approaches to problems of mutual concern and sharing accountability for solutions. Research cannot solely occur within the academy, but needs to be placed within real-world communities. Higher education leaders can also motivate an examination of the reward system across the university so that broadening participation becomes an indicator of institutional success. Among other things, NSF should be encouraged to fund place-based activities that involve multiple partners along the entire preK-20+ pathway.   The issue of broadening participation in STEM has received national attention, as described by numerous reports by the National Academies, National Science Board, and the President?s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology. To increase the numbers of women, underrepresented minorities, and persons with disabilities pursuing postsecondary STEM, a systematic approach is necessary that considers the K-16 pathway.
