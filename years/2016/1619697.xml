<AbstractNarration>Coral reefs have enormous social and ecological value but are killed by such stresses as water pollution and unusually warm water, which can cause corals to bleach and die.  The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has predicted that the current warm-water El Ni√±o event is especially strong and will likely bleach corals across the central and eastern Pacific during 2015-16.  Bleaching is most likely to occur in the central South Pacific, the location of the NSF-funded Moorea Coral Reef Long Term Ecological Research (MCR LTER) site, starting in February 2016.  The proposed research will support field experiments and collection of key data at the MCR LTER site to address how the coming warm-water event interacts with nutrient pollution to influence the prevalence and intensity of coral bleaching.  The investigation will focus on two aspects: (1) island-wide patterns in bleaching and coral loss with respect to nutrient availability across the landscape, and (2) how different forms and sources of nitrogen-based nutrients can either facilitate or mitigate bleaching.  The project will assess the interaction of two major global change drivers on coral reefs, elevated sea surface temperature and nutrient pollution.  Results from this work can inform resource managers and policy makers regarding the effects of nitrogen enrichment in two different forms (nitrate vs. ammonium) from two different sources (human- vs. fish-derived) on altering the probability different types of corals will bleach during major warm-water events.  Human activities can enhance nitrate pollution directly, and lower ammonium enrichment indirectly (via fishing or destruction of nursery habitat), both of which might adversely affect corals by increasing the probability they will bleach.  As such, the project can provide much-needed information about how human   &lt;br/&gt;activities can impact coral reefs.  The project will contribute to the training of two graduate students who will participate in the field research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nutrient enrichment is a major anthropogenic force altering coastal ecosystems worldwide, particularly in oligotrophic systems such as coral reefs.  Based on differences in how ammonium versus nitrate enrichment affect the physiology of corals, some coral reef biologists have speculated that under stress, nitrate enrichment from anthropogenic sources should weaken the coral-dinoflagellate symbiosis, whereas recycled nitrogen excreted by reef fishes could be beneficial.  Thus, different forms of nitrogen (nitrate vs. ammonium) and different sources of nutrients (fish-derived vs. anthropogenic) can have fundamentally different effects on coral biology, which may lead to contrasting effects on how they alter the susceptibility of coral to bleaching from warm-water anomalies.  Further, spatial heterogeneity in nutrient availability could shape landscape scale patterns in the intensity of bleaching and subsequent community consequences.  This research will assess the interaction of two major global change drivers on coral reefs, elevated sea surface temperature and nutrient pollution.  Two hypotheses will be tested: (1) that nitrate enrichment from anthropogenic sources will increase the susceptibility of corals to bleaching, and (2) that nitrogen in the form of ammonium will reduce it.  Given that much of the N enrichment on the reefs in the lagoons of Moorea is of anthropogenic origin, the investigators further hypothesize that on a landscape scale, corals in more nutrient enriched sites will incur greater bleaching and bleaching-associated mortality compared to corals at nutrient poor sites.  These relationships will be explored for the three major genera in the Moorea system (Pocillopora, Acropora, Porites), and then scaled up to explore island-wide patterns of bleaching as a function of landscape scale heterogeneity in nutrient availability.  Crucial pre-bleaching data from field surveys and WorldView-3 satellite imagery will be paired with subsequent post-bleaching data to explore bleaching patterns in relation to gradients in nutrient availability on the reef complex.  In addition, a field experiment will be initiated prior to the warm-water anomaly to test the hypothesis that different forms of nitrogen will have contrasting effects on the likelihood of bleaching.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Coral reefs provide critical ecosystem services to coastal human populations who depend on them for their livelihoods, and they are also among the most threatened coastal systems.  In 2015-16, for example, there was a worldwide coral bleaching event that resulted in widespread death of corals on tropical reefs.  Until recently, coral reefs demonstrated the capacity to recover from disturbances such as cyclones and bleaching that cause extensive loss of live coral.  Reefs were ecologically resilient in that coral would readily become re-established in the years following a disturbance.  However, increasingly coral reefs have been observed to transition to a state where seaweeds, not live coral, dominate the landscape.  The causes of these state shifts have been attributed to a combination of human-induced drivers that lower the ecological resilience, with nutrient loading hypothesized to be one key driver, as it can foster growth of seaweeds.   Nutrient enrichment is a major anthropogenic force altering coastal ecosystems worldwide.  On coral reefs, nutrient enrichment can result in rapid growth of seaweeds that can then dominate the reef and exclude corals.  One major source of nutrients entering coral reef systems is freshwater runoff, which can contain fertilizers (such as nitrates) from agriculture as well as wastewater, and these have been argued to be detrimental to the health of corals.  By contrast, nutrients such as urea and ammonium have been thought to be beneficial to corals as they are naturally produced in the ecosystem by fishes and other organisms and are taken up by corals.  These nutrients could enhance coral health and potentially help corals survive a bleaching event.  This research explored the effects of nutrient enrichment on the ability of coral to withstand bleaching.  In particular, it assessed whether nutrients typical of agricultural fertilizers (nitrate) impacted corals differently than nutrients that are normally recycled in the coral reef system (urea and ammonium) during the bleaching event of 2015-16.   The worldwide coral bleaching event of 2015-16 provided us an unparalleled opportunity to test explicit hypotheses regarding the influence of human- versus fish-derived nutrients in altering the susceptibility of three major types of corals to bleaching, as well as to map spatial patterns of bleaching onto landscape scale patterns of nutrient availability.  We obtained crucial ?pre-bleaching? data from field surveys and satellite imagery, paired with subsequent ?post-bleaching? data to explore bleaching patterns in relation to gradients in nutrient availability on the reef complex that surrounds Moorea, French Polynesia.  In addition, a large field experiment initiated prior to the warm-water anomaly enabled a test of the hypothesis that different forms of nitrogen would have contrasting effects on the bleaching probability of a coral colony.  Overall our results indicated that nutrient enrichment (nitrate) from anthropogenic sources (but not naturally derived urea or ammonium) was harmful to corals and predisposed them to bleaching and mortality.  The research project had a participatory, integrative-training component that provided hands-on experience for eight graduate students, one undergraduate and one postdoctoral student.  As part of that training the students had the unique experience of working alongside and in collaboration with the Principal Investigators and were exposed to their expertise in marine science.  The students also received hands-on field training as they conducted field sampling and experiments in Moorea.  This research contributes to our understanding of the socio-cultural, economic, and environmental influences on health of coral reefs.  Our findings will guide local community groups on Moorea and other locations with coral reefs in developing sustainable agricultural and wastewater management practices along with strategies for conservation and management of marine resources.  To disseminate the project?s findings as widely as possible, the Principal Investigators and graduate students have given presentations at conferences, scientific workshops, and public meetings, as well as produced technical publications in the scientific literature.
