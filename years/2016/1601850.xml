<AbstractNarration>This PFI: AIR Technology Translation project focuses on translating a novel photonic material with exceptional molecular recognition capabilities. Current molecular sensors are complex, expensive and suffer from limited reproducibility and scalability. These facts have hampered the adoption of molecular sensors despite immense industrial and scientific interest from the fields of forensics, toxicology, and biomedicine. Highly scalable and inexpensive, SERF (Sensitive Erasable Reproducible Flow-through) sensors will lead to an era of ubiquitous molecular identification devices for diverse applications such as biometric and health screening, trace hazard detection (biohazards, toxins, drugs, and explosive residues), and chemical quality control. In addition to affordable manufacturing, the SERF technology has a 7 fold higher sensitivity and greater uniformity than the leading commercial substrate (Klarite(TM); Renishaw Inc.). The SERF sensor also has first-of-a-kind capabilities in flow-through detection and surface cleaning for reuse. The project will identify the most commercially viable molecular target for the SERF sensor and optimize the material and a prototype for the detection of this molecule. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project addresses several technology gaps as it translates a laboratory discovery into a commercial application. First, composed of a high density of optically responsive nanopores rather than the low-density micropatterned features, the SERF sensor improves both the sensitivity and uniformity of detection compared to the leading photonic-based sensors. Second, as a porous structure the SERF technology allows sample flow through the sensor, overcoming diffusion limited response times that are impractical (days) for trace molecules with existing sensors. Finally, the SERF sensor can be reused or cleaned with the application of a small current through its contiguous metallic surface. This feature can be used to reset sensors and to overcome performance loss due to fouling.      &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project brings together a world-leading nanomembrane manufacturer (Roussie Co-PI; SiMPore Inc.) with a leading nanomembrane research laboratory (McGrath PI; University of Rochester) and world-class experts in photonics (Webb Co-PI; Nottingham University) to translate a novel laboratory discovery toward commercial impact in industries that improve human welfare. A University of Rochester graduate student and co-inventor of the SERF technology will receive hands on entrepreneurship training by working with PIs and Co-PIs in customer discovery interviews and in the development of a business model canvas.</AbstractNarration>
