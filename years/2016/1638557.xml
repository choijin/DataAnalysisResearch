<AbstractNarration>1638557 - Ronney&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed funding will be used to offset costs for students to travel to the 36th International Symposium on Combustion, Seoul, Korea, August 1 - 5, 2016. The supported students are expected to have authored or co-authored accepted papers and to present them in person at the Symposium. It is anticipated that the funds will support 40 students. The International Symposium on Combustion is the most prestigious technical conference in the combustion community. By attending this meeting, students will be exposed to the state-of-the-art combustion research and have a chance to network with other researchers and practicing engineers. This experience will greatly enhance their technical knowledge as well as professional careers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Over 80% of the world?s energy production and use is based on the combustion of fossil fuels.  Combustion is ubiquitous in traditional energy conversion systems such as automotive engines, stationary and aircraft gas turbines, rocket and space propulsion, electrical power generation, industrial furnaces, and home and institutional space heating.  Moreover, emerging technology areas such as hypersonic propulsion, microscale power generation and material synthesis depend critically on chemically reacting flow processes.  The world?s dependence on combustion processes has led to many technological challenges including air quality, energy efficiency, global warming, and fire/explosion safety.  Thus, combustion is still an active, vital area of research.  The International Symposium on Combustion is by far the largest and most important international meeting for dissemination of the results of basic and applied combustion research.  It is held biannually, in a different location each time.  Practically all of the most published, most cited and most respected members of the international combustion research community attend this Symposium.  Students attending this Symposium have a unique opportunity to meet these members of the community, discuss their research with them, and exchange ideas with both senior researchers as well as their student peers from around the world.  Thus, it is almost essential that fledgling combustion researchers attend the Symposium and present their work therein.   This project supported travel for 43 students to the 36th International Symposium on Combustion in Seoul, Korea, held from July 31 to August 5, 2016.  The Symposium included a full 5-day agenda including 1 keynote speaker, 4 plenary lectures, 4 topical review lectures, more than 350 contributed oral presentations (which had undergone a full rigorous peer review process; less than 40% of the submitted papers were accepted).  All students supported by this grant were  U.S. citizens or permanent residents Full-time students (priority was given to Ph.D. students) at an accredited U. S. university Supported by their academic advisor, as evidenced by a letter of recommendation An author or co-author of a contributed paper or poster accepted by the Symposium Program Committee The presenter of said paper or poster at the Symposium   A request for applications was advertised via the Combustion Institute website (http://www.combustioninstitute.org) and email announcements were sent to the US section members of the Combustion Institute.  The applications included:  A letter of endorsement by the academic advisor A list of other potential funding available to attend the Symposium Complete mailing address and e-mail address   The Combustion Institute supported this project by  1. Posting the announcement on its server  2. Sending emails advertising the support to the appropriate US members  3. Collecting the applications and forward them to the PI for approval and payment via USC          Last Modified: 05/26/2017       Submitted by: Paul D Ronney]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
