<AbstractNarration>The goal of flexible electronics is to combine electronic functionality with mechanical flexibility to enable applications such as flexible displays, wearable electronics and flexible lighting products. High performance electronic devices require fine dimensions and precisely aligned layers of multiple electronic materials; hence, a key challenge in the field is developing a manufacturing platform capable of economically producing these architectures on flexible substrates. This award supports fundamental research on a new, liquid ink-based manufacturing process known as Self-Aligned Capillarity-Assisted Lithography for Electronics (or SCALE). SCALE has the potential to be a disruptive technology in the field of printed flexible electronics, because it removes a significant technological barrier, the need to precisely align printed layers of functional ink, reduces cost, and makes possible flexible electronics-based new products that will improve our quality of life.  The fundamental studies will impact many scientific and engineering fields, including printed electronics, electronic ink development, fluid mechanics and interfacial phenomena.  The efforts also include research experiences designed to retain freshmen in engineering, development of manufacturing educational materials and outreach to industry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SCALE involves imprinting a multilevel, recessed open network of reservoirs, capillaries and device structures on a flexible substrate, delivering electronically functional inks into the reservoirs by inkjet printing and using capillarity to selectively and sequentially fill features to create electronic components, devices and circuits. SCALE has many advantages: it is additive, self-aligned, highly parallel, amenable to roll-to-roll (R2R) processing, and scalable in terms of manufacturability and substrate area. SCALE-based conductive networks, capacitors, resistors and thin film transistors have features sizes in range of ~5 Âµm and below, but the target reservoirs for ink delivery, on the other hand, are an order of magnitude larger, which enables the R2R approach.  This research uses a combined approach of fluid mechanics modeling, fundamental processing experiments, including high speed visualization, and electronic ink development to uncover the science and engineering of R2R SCALE. The team will use a unique Multifunctional R2R Coating and Printing Apparatus in the Coating Process and Visualization Lab, as well as a R2R nanoimprinting apparatus to demonstrate an all R2R approach.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The integration of electronic circuits into flexible plastic sheets using additive manufacturing methods, such as printing, has the potential to lead to a host of new applications in fields such as health diagnostics, information display, identification tagging and robotics.  One challenge in realizing the potential of these flexible printed electronics is the lack of a robust, efficient manufacturing technology.  The aim of our research project was to overcome this challenge by developing the science and engineering principles for continuous, roll-to-roll processing of flexible printed electronics using the self-aligned capillarity assisted lithography (SCALE) process.  SCALE harnesses the power of capillary flow, a phenomenon by which liquids are pulled spontaneously through channels. A common example of capillary flow is the wicking action of a paper towel on a liquid spill.  In SCALE, a precise network of open capillaries or channels is formed on the surface of a plastic sheet by process called imprinting and then inkjet nozzles deliver electronically functional inks to reservoirs incorporated in this network and capillary flow drives the inks to the appropriate locations to create an electronic circuit.  This manufacturing technology creates the small feature size and precise alignments between functional materials needed for electronic functioning in an additive process that minimizes material waste.   Several key advances were made in the course of this research.  First, we developed rigorous mathematical models that predict the capillary flow phenomena, such as the effect of liquid properties and channel dimensions on the flow distance.  The model predictions match the experimental data and enable the engineering design of the capillary networks for SCALE circuits.  New ways to control the flow of inks in capillary networks were also developed.  Second, we engineered roll-to-roll processes for imprinting the networks on the plastic sheet and for inkjet printing the functional inks onto the imprinted sheet.  Third, we engineered SCALE structures for electronic components, including resistors, capacitor and diodes, and demonstrated their electronic functioning and their ability to retain function after mechanical flexing.  These components are the building blocks of flexible printed electronic circuits.  Fourth, we coupled SCALE and electroless plating to create the essential high current carrying metal conductors for flexible electronic circuits.     This research has had broad impact on the fields of flexible electronics, printing processes, roll-to-roll manufacturing, fluid mechanics and microfluidics.  It has also supported the education of three graduate students and two undergraduate researchers, and prepared them for the complex, multidisciplinary challenges of their careers.  The research results have been widely disseminated to the scientific, academic and industrial communities through publications, presentations and a web site.
