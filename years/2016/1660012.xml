<AbstractNarration>There is considerable need to understand the biological and ecological processes that through net primary production fix dissolved carbon dioxide (CO2) into organic matter in the upper ocean, and the processes that subsequently transport this organic carbon in to the ocean's interior. Most of the particulate organic carbon flux to the deep ocean is thought to be mediated by sinking particles. Ultimately it is the deep organic carbon transport and its sequestration that define the impact of ocean biota on atmospheric CO2 levels and hence climate.  Currently, various methods are available to measure the amount of particles in the ocean that sink over a specified period of time commonly referred to as particle flux.  Unfortunately, all of these methods are used independently of each other with very little intercomparison, leaving some uncertainty as to which approach provides the most accurate estimates. This study seeks to be the first concerted effort to standardize particle flux measurements. Seeking to keep the cost modest, the researchers are taking advantage of a collaboration with scientists in the United Kingdom to participate in an already scheduled research cruise. The proposed research will have much greater impact that merely standardization of particle flux measurements because it will provide the science and modeling community the ability to quantify the transfer of carbon throughout the surface ocean.  Also, this project provides a variety of mentoring and training opportunities for students. A PhD student at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute will get their first sea-going experience and will learn all of the processing steps for the study of an isotope of thorium (234Th). Skidmore College will have an undergraduate participant in the research and the results from the cruise will also be an excellent additional component for undergraduate oceanography classes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Researchers from Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution and Skidmore College, in collaboration with a scientist from the National Oceanography Centre, Southampton will inter-compare direct, tracer, and optical-sensor methods used to determine sinking particle fluxes in the surface ocean. To do this, they will firstly conduct a comparison of two types of neutrally buoyant traps and one surface-tethered, drifting array. Secondly, measured trap fluxes will be compared to predicted 234Th fluxes from a 3D time-series of data. Lastly, optical sediment trap measurements will be compared to particle size distributions in the water column and gel traps, as well as size-fractionated particles on filters from large volume pumps. With this research, global ocean models, particularly carbon, will have greater accuracy and stronger conclusions will be able to be drawn from them.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The central focus of this project was an intercomparison of different methods for measuring the rate of sinking carbon due to biological processes in the upper kilometer of the ocean.  There are many methods in use, but no agreed-upon best way of making these measurements.  In this study we carried out simultaneous trials of different types of sediment traps (devices that collect sinking "marine snow"), cameras and light scattering sensors that detect marine snow, and one chemical tracer method that can detect how much marine snow sank in the several weeks prior to measurements.  This intercomparison had 3 main priorities:  1) a direct comparison of the amount and composition of marine snow collected by two types of robotic, depth-seeking sediment traps and one more traditional type of trap that is moored to a floating buoy.  2) a comparison of the sediment trap measurements, above, to the amount of marine snow that sank just prior to measurements using the chemical tracer method.  3) a comparison of trap and chemical tracers to optical (cameras and light sensors) methods that assess the amount of sinking marine snow, and the sizes of these particles.  Our main findings include     Cone-shaped sediment traps      appeared to collect lower amounts of sinking marine snow than cylindrical      traps but particles collected by all trap types had a similar composition.      These chemical measurements were consistent with images of the collected      particles in different trap types. Particles      filtered directly from the ocean with underwater pumps had similar      chemical compositions to the marine snow collected in sediment traps, except that particles      collected in cone-shaped traps were depleted in a chemical tracer that      indicates perhaps the smallest particles were not as efficiently collected. Chemical tracers of past      sinking marine snow flux agreed relatively well with sediment trap      measurements, although there was some variability over distances of around      10 kilometers. Different participating labs chemically      analyzed portions of the same samples, and found that their techniques      were in agreement.      Understanding the ocean?s role in the carbon cycle is important for broader societal issues, including estimates of the rate of expected climate change due to increases in CO2 in the atmosphere, some of which is transferred via sinking particles and stored in the deep ocean. Sinking particles also serve as an important mechanism for removal of man-made pollutants from the surface to the deep ocean. They are also a source of energy to the ocean mid and deep waters, impacting ecosystems and hence fisheries. Despite the importance of sinking marine particles in the cycling of carbon and other important ocean nutrients and chemicals, marine snow remains difficult to collect in a consistent, reproducible manner. We have tested various particle collection devices that are used in ocean sciences, and by making this intercomparison we have provided a community service in that their characteristcs have been quantified for future users who might use these instruments on ocean going research vessels.  In addition, we have migrated the one of the trap designs to a commercial float platform and are in the process of disseminating the design details to other users through the scientific literature.
