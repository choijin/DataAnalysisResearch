<AbstractNarration>Edge computing is new computing paradigm in which the resources for communication, computation, control and storage are placed at the edge of the Internet, in close proximity to mobile devices, sensors, and end users, and the emerging Internet of Things. Terms such as "cloudlets? and "micro data centers? have been used in the literature to refer to these small, edge-located data centers, while ?fog? has been used to denote architectures that use a collaborative multitude of client or edge devices to carry out storage, communication and management. They all represent counterpoints to the theme of massive data centers and core networks that has dominated discourse in cloud and mobile computing. This award will support the organization of a workshop to bring together industry practitioners, academic researchers, and government stakeholders to discuss the vision, challenges, and opportunities for edge computing research for the next 5-10 years. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research agenda of the workshop has the potential for broad and transformative impact on the US and beyond by identifying the grand challenges and lay the foundation of future innovations in computing. Furthermore, the workshop will engage early career scholars and those from diverse backgrounds and underrepresented groups to connect them with a broad community of academic and industrial researchers interested in edge computing, networking and services.</AbstractNarration>

On Oct 26, 2016, we had brought together a group of 48 experts from academia, government, and industry to Washington DC, assessing the vision, recent trends, state-of-the-art research, and impending challenges of the edge computing. An official report was released after the workshop and was made publicly available at http://iot.eng.wayne.edu/edge/finalreport.php.  This report serves as a collection of such input to government funding agencies and interested parties in industry and academia. We identified the top five grand challenges in each of the three areas, represented through the parallel breakout sessions in this one day workshop: Applications, Architecture, and Capabilities and Services.
