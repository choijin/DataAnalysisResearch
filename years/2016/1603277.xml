<AbstractNarration>The Langlands program is a mathematical framework that unifies questions in many different areas of mathematics, especially number theory and linear algebra. The traditional arithmetic Langlands program has been studied for more than fifty years, and this research has resulted in significant applications to solving classical Diophantine equations, for example, the proof of Fermat's last theorem. The geometric Langlands program, which is relatively new, is under rapid development thanks to powerful tools from algebraic geometry. This geometric formulation has led to a precise conjecture known as the global geometric Langlands conjecture that encodes deep connections between number theory and geometry. This research project is devoted to verifying a refined version of this conjecture.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In more detail, this project focuses on two topics in the general area of the geometric Langlands program: verifying the global geometric Langlands conjecture in the de Rham setting and duality for the Hitchin fibration. In previous work, the investigator introduced a corrected formulation of the global geometric Langlands conjecture, which led to a detailed roadmap towards the proof of the conjecture. The first goal of the project is to verify the refined conjecture.  The second part of the project studies a new approach to the duality of the Hitchin fibrations for Langlands dual groups based on the study of classical limits of the Hecke functors.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The research project focuses primarily on the Geometric Langlands Program. The Geometric Langlands Program takes its origin from the conjectures formulated by Robert Langlands in the late 1960's. The conjectures are very surprising in that they combine in a beautiful non-trivial way two branches of mathematics: number theory and representation theory.     In late 1970's, Vladimir Drinfeld and Gerard Laumon realized the importance of geometric methods for the Langlands conjectures. Thus, the Geometric Langlands Program was born. Ten years ago, Anton Kapustin and Edward Witten discovered deep connections between the Langlands Program and theoretical physics.    In summary, the Geometric Langlands Program is a major area of mathematical research, based on ideas from very different branches of mathematics (number theory, representation theory, algebraic geometry) and physics. In fact, Edward Frenkel, famous for his efforts to popularize mathematics, calls the Langlands Program (which is also his own area of research) "the Grand Unified Theory of Mathematics"!  Within the broad area, this project focuses specifically on the so-called quasi-classical limit of the geometric Langlands conjecture. Fundamentally, the Langlands conjecture predicts that two objects of very different nature (one ‘topological’, the other ‘geometrical’) are closely related by a kind of a Fourier transform. The idea of the quasi-classical limit is that, by varying parameters, it is possible to arrive at a version of the geometric Langlands conjecture where the two sides are essentially of the same nature. The limiting procedure is highly non-trivial: it is a mix of precise statements, informal parallels, and conjectural or missing claims. Even so, it is very important, because it allows us to apply powerful ideas and methods from the Langlands program to study different questions in algebraic geometry.  In my prior work, I have used the quasi-classical limit to prove a long-standing algebro-geometric conjecture and showed that compactified Jacobians of singular planar curves are self-dual. The present project extends this work in two directions:  The self-duality (more precisely, the construction of the Poincare bundle) is extended to non-reduced spectral curves for GL(2)   In the direction of the local Langlands correspondence, we define and study the quasi-classical limit of the Satake correspondence.   Both directions are interesting and important in their own right, in addition, they serve as a test for the general idea of quasi-classical limit of the Langlands conjecture. The results of this project would inform and guide future research in this promising new area. We also hope that the techniques developed under this project would find applications in other areas of algebraic geometry, and in mathematics in general.
