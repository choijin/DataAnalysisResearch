<AbstractNarration>Individual differences in children's early math understanding are driven, in part, by differences in children's early learning environments. However, it is unclear exactly how early learning environments should be structured to support the development of children's math understanding. Lack of such knowledge is a critical problem because, without it, scientists cannot explain and predict children's understanding of foundational math concepts, and parents and educators are left to rely on their own, sometimes erroneous intuitions when choosing learning materials for their children. In the current project, researchers from the University of Notre Dame will study how the design of one type of early learning material - children's counting books - affects children's book reading behaviors and early math understanding. In this way, the project will further the mission of EHR Core Research (ECR) program to advance knowledge of children's math learning and the early learning environments that support it.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The central hypothesis is that counting books with tactile features (e.g., pop ups, textured graphics) will be less effective than those without tactile features for supporting children's understanding of counting and associated math concepts. Books with tactile features are expected to elicit at least two behaviors that may hinder math learning: (a) attention focused on the individual objects rather than on the set as a whole and (b) off-task utterances and actions. The research team will work with a diverse sample of preschoolers from Head Start, Title-I preschools, and private early childhood programs. The research methods include a pretest-intervention-posttest randomized experiment in which children will read assigned books with a trained tutor in school over the course of several weeks, as well as a less structured experiment in which children will read assigned books with their primary caregiver in a more naturalistic shared book reading context. By combining these approaches, the researchers will not only be able to determine how different types of books affect pre-to-post changes in math understanding, but also be able to conduct detailed observations and analyses of the language and behaviors that emerge during shared book reading. The project will advance the science of early math learning by testing theory-driven hypotheses. Findings will inform best-practice guidelines for the design of counting books and, thus, will help parents and early childhood educators make more informed decisions when selecting learning materials for their homes and classrooms.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When children first learn to count a set of objects (e.g., "one, two, three, four"), they do not understand that the last word they say in the ordered count list indicates the total number in the set (e.g., "there are four"). Understanding this link between counting and cardinality is widely recognized as a foundational skill in early mathematics (NCTM, 2000). In this project, researchers from the University of Notre Dame examined counting books as one potential source of individual differences in children's understanding of counting and cardinality. There are many different types of counting books, including standard books with 2D pictures and books containing tactile features (e.g., raised textures to feel or poke-a-dots to pop as each object is touched and counted). Some theories suggest that non-tactile books are better for children's learning, whereas others suggest that tactile books are better. These competing hypotheses were tested in two experiments: one school-based, pretest-intervention-posttest study with a diverse sample of preschoolers, and one lab-based shared book reading study with parent-child dyads.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the school-based study, the goal was to determine how different types of books affect children's learning from scripted, shared book reading sessions. Preschoolers worked individually with a tutor once a week for six weeks. They were randomly assigned to read tactile counting books, non-tactile counting books, or storybooks in an active control condition. The script in the two counting book conditions was identical and included reading the book and asking children to both count and label the sets on each page. The script in the active control was based on Justice &amp; Ezell's (2002) print awareness intervention. Results showed that children across conditions improved their print awareness and early math knowledge from pretest to posttest. Condition mattered for children's learning outcomes in three important ways. First, replicating prior work, children's knowledge of words in print and alphabet knowledge were best after the active control condition (i.e., print awareness intervention). Second, children's counting skill was best after the non-tactile counting book condition. Third, the effect of tactility on children's number knowledge was moderated by children's race. Tactile counting books were better than non-tactile counting books for facilitating Black children's number knowledge, but non-tactile books were better than tactile books for non-Black children. This finding was not predicted at the project's outset, as race was suggested as a potential moderator by a graduate student who joined the project in its final year. However, the finding was robust, particularly on the standardized assessment of numeracy, and stood up to several robustness checks. If replicated in future work, this finding highlights the importance of recruiting diverse samples to understand how different materials interact with demographic and background characteristics to affect children's learning.
