<AbstractNarration>Interconnection is at the core of the functionality of our modern infrastructure, spreading ideas, technology and information. Future critical infrastructure, from self-driving cars to everything cloud computing promises to enable, exploit and depend on this interconnection and spreading capability. But as recent history shows, from denial of service attacks to state-driven cyberwarfare they will also suffer from it if vulnerabilities allow. The potential for broad destructive impact of malware is clear, particularly as the importance of mobile devices is on the rise. As more of our critical infrastructure becomes linked to devices end-users (consumers) control, and not merely a computer backbone whose hardware and software are centrally managed and controlled, the importance of maintaining the cyber-health of our devices will become increasingly critical, and much more difficult. The central theme of this proposal is its motto, if it spreads, it cannot hide. The motivation is to build a theory and accompanying algorithms that do not depend on the specifics of the network or devices, or on the specifics of what is spreading. If our defenses depend on detecting specific characteristics, by definition they miss any threat that does not share those. Rather, the high level idea is that if something spreads through a network, the spread itself will leave a signature independent of the design of the malware, or of the devices it is infecting. Moreover, the proposal is built on the idea that this can be done, even if locally it leaves no trace -- that is, even if looking at a single device over time, its behavior is statistically indistinguishable from normal behavior. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work proposes to do this by developing a new paradigm for network inverse problems: use plentiful but extremely weak or noisy signals as network forensics tools, to uncover hidden structure, properties, and phenomena spreading on the network. This requires using and developing new tools from high dimensional statistics and concentration, Markov chain coupling, graph dynamics and graph theory, to obtain a statistical theory that delineates the landscape of when global phenomena are statistically detectable, from local signals indistinguishable from noise. An equal part of the proposed work is then to develop efficient, scalable algorithms to do the detection. Building on this, the proposal tackles two fundamental challenges: developing efficient parallelizable and distributed algorithms with information requirements that do not scale in the size of the network, and second, using a notion of aggregate network feedback extracted through noisy signals, to enable network learning.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[     We live in an interconnected world. Goods and services flow at unprecedented rates from one corner of the globe to another. But that is not all that spreads. Information, disease, ideas, rumors and cyberattacks (malware) also spread.  Epidemic processes are a broad class of mathematical models and tools that  can model anything that spreads. As such, they are a useful tool for studying not only human diseases, but also network attacks, spikes in the brain, the propagation of real or fake news, the spread of viral tweets, and other processes.  Intellectual Merit:  The research funded under this award has largely focused on epidemics spreading on an underlying graph. Currently, most state-of-the-art research in this field assumes some form of perfect observation of the epidemic process, yet this is an unrealistic assumption for many real-life applications, as data is scarce and/or imprecise for human epidemics, and symptoms may appear in a non- deterministic fashion. Indeed, the AIDS epidemic, and more recenrtly COVID-19, are examples of how a latent period can greatly complicate efforts to understand precisely how the virus spreads in the wild, since someone can get infected after, yet develop symptoms before, someone else.  The work funded by this project has developed algorithms and analysis tools to study epidemics under uncertainty. Significantly, the work studied has considered a broad array of possible information settings, and thus the theoretical advances here link directly to both human viruses, technological viruses (malware), and also information spread on social networks.  Thus the work here lies squarely in the realm of cyberphysical systems.   Specifically, the work funded by this project has focused on three fundamental questions: (A) Early epidemic detection -- can we quickly detect abnormalities from very weak, noisy or corrupted signals, and therefore determine that something is spreading through a network? (B) What are the parameters of the problem (connectivity patterns of the population, spreading characteristics of the virus, accuracy of our diagnostic tests) that determine how much effort (quarantining, medical interventions, etc.) is required to halt an epidemic? (C) What are the main vectors that an unknown (not previously studied or understood) epidemic spreads?   Broader Impacts:  The COVID-19 pandemic has served as a tragic reminder of the importance of high levels of readiness in understanding epidemics as early in their trajectory as possible. Many of the challenging aspects of the pandemic, including asymptomatic transmission and differing latency periods, are among the central questions studied in the funded work. Thus the work may directly have broader impacts beyond the immediate intellectual contributions of the work.  The funded work has also significantly contributed to student education. The project funded the PhD studies of several students that The University of Texas at Austin, the the Computer Science Department, and the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department. In collaboration with these PhD students, we have also worked to create research opportunities for undergraduate students.
