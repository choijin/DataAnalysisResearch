<AbstractNarration>General Abstract&lt;br/&gt;Variation in skin colors are linked to significant differences in life experiences, both within and across racial groups. For example, darker-skinned African Americans have worse health outcomes, lower incomes, lower levels of education, lower rates of marriage, and even receive harsher criminal sentencing than lighter-skinned African Americans. This project explores how skin color might influence political phenomena such public policy outcomes and candidate support.  The work investigates this from the perspectives of both white and black people. This research has implications beyond just African Americans.  Studying skin tone identity among Latinos and Asian Americans, for instance, would provide interesting comparison points. Furthermore, this research provides a foundation for understanding the significance of skin tone biases on a global bases, not just the United States.  Investigating potential color-based discrimination will help inform strategies for addressing and mitigating such bias, to the benefit of political elites (such as political candidates from minority groups) as well as for the mass public who might face skin-color based discrimination in their everyday lives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Abstract&lt;br/&gt;The study of racial groups in political science tends to treat these as homogenous.  An implication of this approach is that such studies tend to overlook potentially important heterogeneity within racial groups, especially with respect to skin color.  The research utilizes a mixed-methods design, relying on multiple observational datasets, original qualitative interview data, and a series of experiments to explore the underlying significance of skin color in the political realm.  The findings from these multiple datasets and my in-depth interviews indicate that skin color is a socially and politically significant source of identity for many African Americans. This is especially true for darker-skinned African Americans. Further, skin color play a significant role in shaping political preferences in multiple domains. In contrast to existing theories of white racial attitudes towards blacks, I expect racially insensitive attitudes will not be equally directed at all African Americans, but will vary by skin tone. Overall, my research demonstrates that in addition to race, skin color operates as an important, yet poorly understood, factor in American politics.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>In contrast to a focus in mainstream political science of studying racial minority groups as monolithic, this project demonstrates the ways in which gradations within racial categories?such as those based on skin tone?are associated with views of politics and power. The evidence provided here has pointed scholars towards an important yet understudied facet of American politics. The legacy of colorism and continuing importance of skin tone in society has potential to manifest itself in multiple ways in the political realm. Using a mixed-methods approach?including novel survey experiments, national and nationally representative survey data, and original in-depth interviews?I demonstrated that race and color inform one?s political judgments and behavior in distinct ways in many instances. For example, I highlight the contexts in which skin color is associated with political preferences on redistributive policies, such that skin tone contributes to the well-documented chasm in public opinion between Black and White people. Additionally, perceptions of who benefits from racialized policies vary not just based on race, but also on the lightness or darkness of one?s skin. This is an important and novel finding with respect to our understanding of racialized policies, adding an even more nuanced view to traditional studies of racialized policies and the media.<br /><br />This project provides evidence for not just an awareness of, but a broad concern about skin color disparities in society. Despite a lack of questions related to color-based inequities asked in traditional surveys, I find a high level of recognition of color?s importance in society among Black people. However, I consistently find that darker-skinned people are more apt than those with light skin to agree that darker skin is associated with disadvantages with respect to jobs, policing, criminal justice, and more. Additionally, through the development of novel measures of skin tone as a distinct social identity from race, I demonstrate that one?s skin tone is meaningful to a sizable portion of the Black community?and especially so for those with dark skin. While racial identity did not vary significantly based on one?s skin tone on the whole, levels of race and skin tone identity are more comparable among dark-skinned individuals than for those with light skin. Moreover, the levels of skin tone identity captured in my surveys rival the levels of White identity that have recently taken on renewed relevance in American politics. This signals the importance of more deeply understanding the relevance and influence of skin tone and skin tone identity within the United States, much like work on skin color and colorism in other contexts around the globe.<br /><br />Going back to our nation?s founding, skin color has been an important tool of social division and yet has avoided a deep examination with respect to thinking about American politics. Although these issues present potentially thorny complications to our traditional understandings of race and racial groups, they are vital to understanding issues of power and inequity. Failing to recognize and engage with the importance of skin color and color-based discrimination has the potential to amplify the power of color in society rather than diminishing it. As many scholars have noted, even with changing demographics in the United States, there is an understanding that while the racial hierarchy may shift, it is unlikely that Black people will gain position in the racial hierarchy. The evidence presented here, in combination with work on colorism across disciplines, suggests there is an even smaller chance of improvement for dark-skinned Black people specifically.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 05/04/2020<br>      Modified by: Nicole&nbsp;Yadon</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
