<AbstractNarration>The IEEE International Conference on Computer Communications (INFOCOM) is a preeminent venue for world-leading scientists, researchers, and practitioners to present the latest research results and to exchange research ideas over a broad range of topics in computer communications and networking. Attending this conference is of paramount importance for the career development of students in the field. It provides students with opportunities to present their work, to learn the cutting-edge research, and to interact with leading experts and fellow students from worldwide institutions. This award will support approximately 25 students in the United States to attend the 2016 IEEE INFOCOM conference which will be held in San Francisco, CA, USA from April 10 to April 15, 2016. The travel grants will target graduate students, in particular female and underrepresented minority students. Priority will be given to the students who will substantially benefit from attending this conference but have limited travel funds.</AbstractNarration>
