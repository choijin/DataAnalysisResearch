<AbstractNarration>Currently, many young people - especially girls and youth of color - lose confidence and interest in science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) pathways due to a perceived disconnect between their own identity and STEM fields. To address this challenge, Twin Cities PBS (TPT) is implementing SciGirls CONNECT2. This three-year Research in Service to Practice award examines how gender equitable and culturally responsive teaching strategies influence middle school girls' confidence, interest and motivation around STEM studies, and their choices around STEM careers. A set of research-based strategies, called the SciGirls Seven, are currently employed in SciGirls, an NSF-funded informal STEM educational outreach program serving 125+ educational partner organizations nationwide. The goal is to update and enrich the SciGirls Seven, providing educators with a critical, current, and more effective resource to motivate girls in STEM studies and careers. It is funded by the Advancing Informal STEM Learning (AISL) program, which seeks to advance new approaches to, and evidence-based understanding of, the design and development of STEM learning in informal environments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Florida State University will conduct a formal research study investigating the hypothesis that STEM programs that use gender equitable and culturally responsive strategies contribute to girls' positive STEM identity development, including their sense of self-efficacy, persistence and aspirations around future STEM careers. This research will include a literature review and a study of girls' STEM identity creation. The mixed methods study will include quantitative and qualitative data collection and analysis measuring changes in students' STEM identity and teachers' confidence in STEM teaching. The quantitative data will come from the student, parent and teacher pre/post surveys. The qualitative research will be conducted via case studies at four sites and the qualitative data will include observations, focus groups and interviews. Girls at all partner sites will create videos that will allow the research team to gather additional insight. The independent firm Knight Williams, Inc. will conduct the project's external evaluation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will work with a subset of 16 current SciGirls partners. These geographically diverse partners will reach youth in all-girls and co-ed informal STEM education programs in a variety of settings. More than half serve Hispanic or other minority populations. The updated strategies will be disseminated to the 2,500 educators within the SciGirls partner network and the 18,800 STEM education organizations of the National Girls Collaborative Project (NGCP) network. Dissemination of the strategies and literature review will focus on the informal STEM education field through publications and presentations, posts at PBS LearningMedia, a free online space reaching 1.5 million teachers and educators.</AbstractNarration>

To achieve this goal, the team worked with 12 advisors and 16 <em>SciGirls </em>outreach partners to complete three deliverables.</p> <p>1. Evaluate educators' use and perceived efficacy of the&nbsp;<em>SciGirls</em>&nbsp;<em>Strategies.</em></p> <p>2. Conduct a comprehensive literature review of the latest gender equity research with a focus on cultural responsiveness.</p> <p>3. Implement a research study investigating the impact of the&nbsp;<em>SciGirls Strategies</em>&nbsp;on girls' STEM identity.</p> <p>Deliverable 1. Project partners ran <em>SciGirls </em>programs using the original strategies and then the newly updated strategies<em>.</em> During these programs, educators completed four rounds of evaluations on their use of the strategies through reflection surveys and interviews with evaluator Knight Williams, Inc. that were used to iteratively inform the refinement of the final strategies.</p> <p>Deliverable 2. Project staff completed a literature review of publications from 2013-2017 (140 articles) and finalized the <em>SciGirls Strategies</em> in 2018 based on the review and educators feedback. The <em>SciGirls Strategies</em> are:</p> <ol> <li>Connect STEM experiences to girls' lives.</li> <li>Support girls as they investigate questions and solve problems using STEM practices.</li> <li>Empower girls to embrace struggle, overcome challenges, and increase self-confidence in STEM.</li> <li>Encourage girls to identify and challenge STEM stereotypes.</li> <li>Emphasize that STEM is collaborative, social, and community oriented.</li> <li>Provide opportunities for girls to interact with and learn from diverse STEM role models.</li> </ol> <p>The strategies include an overarching framework of implementation for educators on the development of a STEM identity, designing an inclusive learning environment and the use of culturally responsive teaching (CRT) practices.&nbsp;<em>SciGirls</em> 50 STEM activities were updated to reference the new strategies, available at SciGirlsCONNECT.org and in book form. An article was published in the <em>Connected Science Learning</em> journal about the new strategies in 2019 and the literature review was published in the <em>Journal for STEM Outreach</em> in 2020<em>.</em></p> <p>Deliverable 3. The research team was led by Dr. Roxanne Hughes at the MagLab at Florida State University. The research question was: What effect does participation in <em>SciGirls </em>programs have on participants' STEM identity? Researchers used a mixed-methods approach that included, pre and post surveys of youth to measure STEM identity, observations of programs at three sites, interviews with educators and parents from sites and interviews with girls at sites.</p> <p>Quantitative findings. The quantitative portion focused on STEM Identity and STEM Self-Efficacy changes from pre to post for 148 youth who completed all consent forms in 4-9th grade at 11 sites. Overall, students' STEM Identity significantly increased, largely driven by participant perceptions of how others recognized them as STEM people.</p> <p>Qualitative findings. The qualitative study focused on three case study sites to determine what aspects of the <em>SciGirls</em> framework and strategies impacted participating girls' STEM identity. This part of the study supported the value of recognition highlighted by the quantitative findings. While the team found the sites to be effective in providing a safe and supportive learning environment, they did not identify CRT strategies, and were able to identify that educators did not fully understand CRT or how to use the construct.</p> <p>Overall, the findings indicate that the informal STEM education programs in this study positioned girls to explore and build on their multiple identities in ways that allowed them to see how STEM is relevant and valuable to their lives and a part of who they are.</p> <p>The research was presented to the National Girls Collaborative community as part of a Research-to-Practice series. Two papers were also accepted to the 2019 American Educational Research Association conference (cancelled due to the pandemic).</p> <p>Deliverable 4 (Supplement). A supplement allowed the team to hold a two-day workshop on CRT (to follow up on the research findings) with university researchers and <em>SciGirls</em> trainers and staff to share best practices in CRT, gather essential changes or additions to the existing <em>SciGirls</em> training, and articulate a definition of CRT within the <em>SciGirls</em> educational context (gender equity).</p> <p>Based on the workshop the professional development for educators was revised and recommendations for revising the Train-the-Trainer were collected.</p> <p>As a result of <em>SciGirls CONNECT 2</em>, the updated strategies provide educators nationwide with a critical, current resource to help engage girls in STEM with an overarching framework that includes culturally responsive practices and inclusive learning environments.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 04/13/2021<br>      Modified by: Rita&nbsp;Karl</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent"

SciGirls CONNECT is a national effort to encourage educators to adopt research-based strategies to engage girls in STEM. The SciGirls CONNECT community includes 204 organizations located in schools, museums, community organizations and universities and 5,000 educators who have hosted 1,600 SciGirls programs in 35 states reaching over 106,000 youth since 2010.
