<AbstractNarration>This award will support student travel to the 2016 31st International Conference on Logic in Computer Science (LICS) which focuses on theoretical and practical topics in computer science that relate to logic. The conference will be held in New York City, New York on July 5-8th 2016. Supporting student travel to attend professional conferences and workshops is a very important mission of the NSF.  This award provides travel grants that will allow highly talented PhD students to attend LICS, which will give them the opportunity to attend technical talks, and interact with established experts in the field. The broader significance and importance includes fostering the next generation of researchers in this research area, as well as providing international experiences to build a globally-aware workforce. The organizers will give priority to students from under-represented groups and from small universities.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The LICS 2016 Program for Student Volunteers gave full- or part-time university students from around the world the opportunity to attend and contribute to a premier forum for all areas of logic in computer science. LICS 2016 Student Volunteers interacted closely with researchers, academics and practitioners from various disciplines and met other students from around the world.  LICS offered a number of opportunities for student volunteers, who are vital to the efficient operation and continued success of the conference each year. The student volunteer program allowed students from around the world to participate in the conferences whilst assisting us in preparing and running the event.  Job assignments for student volunteers included assisting with technical sessions, workshops, tutorials and panels, checking badges at doors, operating the information desk, helping with traffic flow, and general assistance to keep the conferences running smoothly.  In return, the volunteers were granted free registration to the conferences (this includes all workshops), free access to affiliated workshops, and free access to the Logic Mentoring Workshop (LMW).  Six (6) students were funded as Student Volunteers at LICS 2016. We felt that these students had a valuable and inspiring experience. We hope that they will begin or continue to pursue research in Logic and Computer Science.       Last Modified: 08/27/2017       Submitted by: Eric Koskinen]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
