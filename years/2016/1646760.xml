<AbstractNarration>This award provides funding for the West Coast Number Theory Conference (WCNT) for three years, from 2016 through its 50th anniversary.  Since its founding by Emma and Dick Lehmer at University of California, Berkeley, WCNT has been held each December on or near the West Coast of the United States. Nearly 50 years later, WCNT continues to be a welcoming venue for young researchers and established mathematicians alike to share their work in an egalitarian environment.  Number theory is an ancient discipline that is still flourishing as an active and important branch of modern mathematics. Current applications of number theory include high-speed computation and data encryption.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At WCNT each talk receives equal time and every participant receives equal access to funding.  The daily talks span many different areas within number theory, fostering cross-pollination of ideas and collaboration across standard borders.  The conference includes formal problem sessions as well as informal evening group work sessions.  With permission of the presenter, open problems from these sessions are collected and published on the conference website.  Graduate students, postdocs, junior researchers, women, and minorities are especially encouraged to apply for funding. The conference website can be found at http://westcoastnumbertheory.org.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ First started by Dick and Emma Lehmer in Berkeley in 1967, the West Coast Number Theory Conference provides a welcoming, collaborative, mathematically rich environment for number theorists to present their research, discuss their findings, and collaborate on new projects. Due to the format of the conference, the talks typically span a variety of flavors of number theory in a short amount of time. There are no parallel sessions and the majority of attendees give a talk.  This exposes the participants to a range of different topics, which is extremely rare for a conference of its size.  The conference also features formal problem sessions where participants pose (and sometimes solve) open problems, as well as evening group work sessions.  These "workshop" aspects of the conference are particularly effective at stimulating interactions to between the more-established and junior researchers.   The exposure of the younger participants to more established mathematicians provides mentorship opportunities.   This grant allowed us to find the conference for 2016, 2017, 2018, and 2019.  This included the 50th anniversary celebration in 2019.  Over the course of the grant, the conference was attended by high school students, undergraduates, graduate students, post-docs, professors, and other professionals.  We saw a growth in attendance due to our increased outreach efforts and the availability of funds from this grant.  We were able to fund all students and early-career mathematicians that requested funding.       Last Modified: 04/02/2021       Submitted by: Kevin Mcgown]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
