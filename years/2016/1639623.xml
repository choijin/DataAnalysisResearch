<AbstractNarration>The acquisition of a new scanning electron microscope (SEM) will provide a major enhancement to the research infrastructure of the Institute of Meteoritics (IOM) and the Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences (EPS) at the University of New Mexico (UNM). The SEM will be integrated into the multidisciplinary research programs at UNM that serve the science community on campus and users from other universities -- both regional and nationwide. This new SEM, a cutting-edge research tool, which replaces a seriously outdated 1997-model SEM, will also serve as a training tool for students in earth and planetary sciences, biology and engineering. The SEM acquisition will support the education of graduate-level US science students through formal classes and hands-on training. Thus, the acquisition of a new SEM supports a broad spectrum of NSF funded research and education. The University of New Mexico is one of the most diverse major institutions of higher learning in our country. UNM is a majority-minority institution and federally classified Hispanic-serving institution with a large proportion of undergraduates from culturally diverse backgrounds. Accordingly, the EPS department has a long tradition of involving undergraduates in research activities and a significant proportion of these individuals are from underrepresented groups and minorities, in particular Hispanic and Native American.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Acquisition of a new scanning electron microscope (SEM) with attached energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDS) system and color cathodoluminescence (CL) detector will replace the present system at UNM. The instrument selected is a TESCAN Vega3 and an IXRF EDS. The Vega3 provides a large stage and chamber with additional ports for future added capabilities. High sensitivity backscattered electron imaging and color cathodoluminescence options will be included with the TESCAN, along with a LaB6 gun for improved resolution. The combination of analytical results of electron and X-ray excitation improves the overall accuracy of qualitative and quantitative analysis and enhances X-ray mapping capabilities. The rationale behind this acquisition is that we have a multi-faceted, active, productive, and dynamic research program at the University of New Mexico that will be greatly enhanced by this acquisition. We have an extensive track record for SEM and EPMA use and management, and a long history for allowing access to our labs to the scientific community.</AbstractNarration>

The SEM is integrated into the multidisciplinary research programs at UNM that serve the science community on campus and users from other universities -- both regional and nationwide. The combined infrastructure of IOM/EPS is the top facility with respect to analytical instrumentation on the UNM main campus, and has a long tradition of supporting state-of-the-art analytical equipment with laboratories specializing in techniques of geochemistry, radiogenic isotopes, stable isotopes, infrared spectroscopy, x-ray diffraction, and transmission electron microscopy. These labs support a wide range of studies in disciplines that span the physical sciences and engineering. The facilities also feature a high-pressure laboratory with devices designed to experimentally simulate the conditions that exist in the deep, inaccessible Earth. This new SEM, a cutting-edge research tool, which replaces a seriously outdated 1997-model SEM, will also serve as a training tool for students in earth and planetary sciences, biology and engineering. The SEM acquisition supports the education of graduate-level US science students through formal classes and hands-on training. For example, the EPS Department offers an upper-level class (EPS 518: &ldquo;Scanning Electron Microscopy and X-ray Microanalysis&rdquo;) which is a rigorous course in the fundamentals of the SEM and electron microprobe. When students have passed this course they then possess a technical skill that makes them more competitive in the post-graduate job market and prepares them along their path towards a career in scientific research. All students taking this course receive the opportunity to gain fundamental theory and hands-on experience on the SEM instrument. In the past five years the SEM instrument has had 67 student users, along with 41 faculty and research staff users. Thus, the acquisition of the new SEM supports a broad spectrum of NSF funded research and education.
