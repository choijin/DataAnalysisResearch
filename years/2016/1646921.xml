<AbstractNarration>This project aims to control destructive environmental processes such as forest fires, oil spills, and agricultural pest infestations through the intelligent, coordinated intervention of a group of robots.  This requires the development of fundamentally new control theoretic and algorithmic tools to drive the robots to take control actions to regulate the environmental process.  The robots' control actions close a large-scale feedback loop around the robots and the environment, giving rise to complex dynamical phenomena.  The project proposes control strategies for this coupled robot-environment system in three different timescale regimes:  (i) the environment changes slowly compared to the robots' dynamics, (ii) the environment and robot dynamics are on the same timescale and immediate control effect is sought, and (iii) the environment and robot dynamics are on the same timescale and long-term control effect is sought. Three different optimization based techniques are proposed to generate decentralized control strategies for each regime. Stability, convergence, and optimality properties of the robot-environment system under these strategies are studied.  Furthermore, experiments with a network of quadrotor aerial robots, both in the lab and outdoors, demonstrate the practicality of the control strategies. The project also incorporates a comprehensive education and outreach program using quadrotor robots as teaching tools to reach students from diverse backgrounds at all grade levels.  Ultimately, the project seeks to alleviate the economic, social, and ecological damage caused by oil and other chemical spills, forest fires, pest infestations, and other ecologically destructive phenomena by laying the foundations of a new robotic technology.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project was focused on developing algorithmic tools for a group of autonomous robots (e.g. autonomous aerial vehicles, or autonomous ground robots) to work together to control harmful, large-scale environmental processes.  A motivating example used throughout the project was that of a fleet of forest management drones working together to track and control a forest fire. Several of the most destructive forest fires in US history have occurred in recent years, for example the Camp Fire of 2018, which destroyed most of the town of Paradise, CA, including 18,804 buildings and 85 lives lost, and the Tubbs Fire of 2017, which destroyed parts of the city of Santa Rosa, CA, burning 5,643 structures and taking 22 lives.  This project developed a broad range of tools which we hope will eventually lead to fast, responsive, safe, and effective ways of controlling such environmental disasters using a fleet of robots.  While forest fires served as the main motivating example, this grant led to wide ranging work with potentially broad impacts across a variety of applications.  For example, we also considered ground and aerial robots working together to herd wildlife or livestock, and ground and aerial robots working together to transport large objects along a desired trajectory (e.g. working together to lift and transport a fire retardant container to dump on a forest fire).  The ultimate goal was to enable a group of robots to autonomously coordinate their actions, working together to intelligently control environmental processes that are too large in scale to be controlled by more traditional means.   The project made intellectual contributions mainly in the field of robotics and control.  Specifically, we developed a mathematical model of forest fires based on a tool called a Graphical Markov Model.  The model considered the probability of any single tree igniting, given the state of the neighboring trees in the forest, with the probability being higher if neighboring trees are already on fire.  The effect of adding fire retardant was included in the model as increasing the probability of a tree switching from a state of "burning" to a state of "burnt."  While the model provides a flexible and expressive tool for predicting forest fire behavior, it also comes with several computational challenges.  Specifically, this model can have an enormous number of possible states, which makes existing tools for estimating the state of the model or controlling the state of the model ineffective.  Hence, two of the core contributions of the project were (i) a scalable and computationally tractable algorithm for the robots to estimate the state of the forest fire given noisy partial measurements of the fire (as would be obtained by cameras mounted on drones flying over a fire), and (ii) a scalable control method for the robots to intelligently apply fire retardant to control the fire.  The state estimation algorithm uses an approximate recursive Bayesian filter obtained by using variational techniques.  The control method uses an approximate dynamic programming approach formulated as a linear program.  Beyond these algorithms, we also studied control algorithms learned using a deep reinforcement learning technique, and also developed distributed scheduling and routing algorithms related to this problem.  Beyond the specific scenario of forest fires, we also developed a method for a fleet of robots to critically evaluate the health of their on-board sensors by comparing their sensing measurements with their neighboring robots.  The method was implemented as part of an adaptive controller with mathematically proven performance properties, and was validated in hardware experiments with robots in a controlled laboratory environment.   We also developed an algorithm for aerial robots to determine their positions with respect to one another, and to control their positions to a desired formation, using only on-board cameras aimed at the ground.  We also obtained formal mathematical proofs of performance for this algorithm, and validated the performance in laboratory experiments.  Overall, the project has resulted in 15 conference papers published in top-tier robotics and controls conferences to date, as well as 7 journal papers in top-tier robotics and controls journals.  We hope that this body of work will contribute to robotic technologies that will save lives and prevent costly property and environmental damage by enabling robots to help people control destructive environmental processes.
