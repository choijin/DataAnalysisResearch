<AbstractNarration>American society is becoming more diverse, in part due to the influx of populations with various linguistic backgrounds; linguistic misunderstanding among speakers from different linguistic backgrounds sometimes occurs, with consequences for social interaction. There are many possible sources of linguistic misunderstanding, one of which is the cross-linguistic influence of the first language on the learner's second language. This dissertation project aims to examine the role of cross-linguistic influence in the domain of pronoun resolution. More specifically, this project investigates how Korean-speaking learners of English interpret English pronouns as well as Korean pronouns. Korean and English pronouns are known to have different properties, yet there has been no prior empirical investigation of their differences. By comparing the patterns of pronoun interpretation in Korean and English, this project can provide insights into misunderstandings due to misinterpretation of English pronouns by Korean-speaking learners of English as a second language. This project also has the potential to inform educators, language teaching professionals and developers of language teaching software about learners' pronoun use.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project examines grammatical knowledge and real-time comprehension of pronouns, with a focus on how native speakers of Korean process pronouns in their native language, and how the properties of Korean pronouns influence the way that Korean-speaking learners of English interpret English pronouns. Six experiments with various psycholinguistic methods are conducted to achieve the goals of the study. The first set of experiments use two different offline judgment tasks to measure learners' grammatical knowledge of Korean and English pronouns. The second set of experiments use the eye-monitoring methodology to track the time course of participants' application of grammatical constraints on pronoun resolution during reading, in both Korean and English. This project will contribute to the fields of theoretical linguistics and psycholinguistics by providing information on grammatical knowledge and processing in both native and non-native language. Given that Korean is a relatively understudied language, this project furthermore increases the visibility of Korean, and of East Asian languages more generally</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Natural languages make use of anaphoric expressions like pronouns (e.g.,&nbsp;<em>she/her, he/him</em>),  whose interpretations are under-determined and dependent on context.

One of the two primary goals of this dissertation research is to  understand why there is such difference in the interpretation of  pronouns in English and Korean. The second primary goal is to explore  whether cross-linguistic influence is a possible reason for the  misinterpretation of pronouns in second language (L2) acquisition, when  the L2 (English) and the learners' first language (L1, Korean) have  different grammatical and processing constraints on pronoun  interpretation.  The specific goals of this project were the  following: 1) to examine the interpretations assigned to overt third  person pronouns in Korean (kunye ?her?), 2) to investigate the  role of syntactic constraints during real-time overt pronoun resolution  in Korean, and 3) to explore the cross-linguistic influence effects in  L2-English pronoun resolution by testing L1-Korean L2-English learners?  interpretation and processing of English pronouns.

Specifically, kunye is able to take a local antecedent given an appropriate context, unlike her. There may be two different grammatical representations available for kunye, which may contribute to the unique characteristics of kunye.  2)     Grammatical constraints (specifically, Principle B of Binding Theory,  which states that a pronoun cannot take a clause-mate antecedent) do not  fully constrain the real-time antecedent search process of overt  pronouns in Korean, unlike in English; structure building while  establishing dependency between kunye and the potential antecedent is delayed until a clause-final verb is reached.  3)     L2 learners? pre-existing grammatical and processing constraints on  Korean overt pronouns appear to affect how the learners comprehend  English pronouns.  The outcomes of this project indicate that  Korean overt pronouns have a unique status, and cannot be assimilated to  pronouns in English and other well-studied western languages.
