<AbstractNarration>It is well known that many of the geometric objects encountered in daily life can be described using equations.  Furthermore, fundamental and interesting objects can often be described using polynomial equations (for example, consider the familiar equation for a circle).  Though polynomials are based upon some of the most elementary operations (namely, addition and multiplication), they are able to describe a rich variety of phenomena, and can sometimes behave in mysterious and complicated ways.  This research project concerns the mathematical field of commutative algebra, that is, the study of polynomial equations.  This field has many important applications; for example, it is used in cryptography and physics.  The broad goal of this project is to understand mathematical structures that arise in the study of polynomial equations.  Many of the methods employed in the research project involve techniques from other areas of mathematics.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is to advance the understanding of some fundamental objects in commutative algebra.  In particular, it aims to shed light on the structure of local cohomology modules, rings of mixed characteristic, Bernstein-Sato polynomials, and singularities in characteristic p.  The investigator is especially motivated by the deep connections between these topics.  The project seeks to do the following: (1) to study local cohomology modules using group actions and D-module theory;  (2) to use the Lyubeznik numbers (and variants introduced recently by the investigator and collaborator) to compare rings of equal characteristic and mixed characteristic, and to understand rings of mixed characteristic; and (3) to find explicit formulas for F-thresholds and use these to produce roots of the Bernstein-Sato polynomial.  The techniques employed use invariant theory, noncommutative algebra, and combinatorics.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The results of this project advance the theory of commutative algebra, the mathematical field stemming from the study of polynomial equations.  Central to this area of mathematics are objects called rings and ideals; a fundamental example of a ring is the collection of all integers.  The project successfully advanced the understanding of several notions that are central to the study of rings and ideals:  local cohomology modules, rings of mixed characteristic, numerical invariants in prime characteristic, and functional equations of differential operators.  Moreover, the techniques developed toward the goal of understanding these notions touch on a diverse variety of mathematical areas, including noncommutative algebra, algebraic geometry, singularity theory, and combinatorics.   Though they are defined algebraically, local cohomology modules capture significant geometric information.  The results from this project show that local cohomology characterizes connectedness properties in exciting and previously unknown ways.  In mixed characteristic, the PI and her collaborators proved a "second vanishing theorem" for local cohomology, as well as negatively answer a 25-year-old question of Lyubeznik on the injective dimension of local cohomology.    Given a ring of prime characteristic p, the Frobenius map sends an element to its p-th power.  This map has been used to study deviation from regularity, and this project makes progress in this direction, in several ways.  This project made progress by shedding light on numerical invariants called F-thresholds, with a special focus on the F-pure threshold.  The research establishes new results on the properties of F-thresholds.  It also defines and applies a real-valued notion of a Frobenius power of an ideal, which can be thought of as a new "test ideal," and which has some of the desirable properties of multiplier ideals that test ideals lack.  The Bernstein-Sato polynomial is defined via a functional equation involving differential operators, and has numerous interpretations in mathematics.  With her collaborators, the PI established the existence of such a functional equation for this polynomial in the first non-regular setting, and develops the theory of V-filtrations, and studies multiplier ideals, in these contexts.  The PI and her collaborators created two packages for the computer algebra software Macaulay2, which are publicly available for use by researchers and educators.  This award funded an REU program in 2017 focused on algebra and number theory, co-directed with Daniel Hern&aacute;ndez.  All seven participants came from underrepresented groups in mathematics: five underrepresented minorities, two women, one with a disability, and two non-traditional students.  This program aimed to expand opportunities for participants through mathematical training, research exposure, and mentoring.  All four 2018 graduates now attend math graduate school, while only one had considered applying prior to the program.  During the award period, the PI served as a Mentor for the National Alliance for Doctoral Studies in the Mathematical Sciences and the Association for Women in Mathematics (AWM) Mentor Network, and for students on academic probation at her institution. She led professional development sessions for graduate students at her institution, spoke at the Fall School in Commutative Algebra at Centro de Investigacon en Matem&aacute;ticas (2017), was an Invited Panelist at the Nebraska Conference for Undergraduate Women in Mathematics (2019), and was on the Jedel Excellence in Mathematics Education Award Committee for K-12 teaching in greater Kansas City (2019-20).  She organized the KUMUNU conference (2016), and Special Sessions at the Joint Mathematics Meetings in honor of Karen Smith's Noether Lecture (2016), and at an AWM Research Symposium (2017).
