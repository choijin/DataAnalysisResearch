<AbstractNarration>Many data sets can profitably be viewed as points in a&lt;br/&gt;high-dimensional space: think of employee salary and seniority,&lt;br/&gt;weather stations' hourly reports of temperature, humidity, wind speed,&lt;br/&gt;and direction, or even the images from your cellphone camera as color&lt;br/&gt;values per pixel.  Geometric retrieval problems seek to preprocess&lt;br/&gt;multi-dimensional geometric data for rapid access; for two examples,&lt;br/&gt;"nearest neighbor queries" could find images similar to a query image,&lt;br/&gt;and "range queries" could find all times with temperature and humidity&lt;br/&gt;above given thresholds.  These queries are of fundamental importance throughout&lt;br/&gt;engineering and science, and have applications in knowledge discovery&lt;br/&gt;and data mining, pattern recognition and classification, machine&lt;br/&gt;learning, data compression, multimedia databases, document retrieval,&lt;br/&gt;and statistics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The high computational complexity of nearest neighbor and range queries in high dimensions has&lt;br/&gt;inspired research into approximate solutions. The work of this project&lt;br/&gt;deepens and broadens our understanding of the computational&lt;br/&gt;complexity of these two problems. It studies new, more efficient solutions to&lt;br/&gt;key special cases, including&lt;br/&gt;low-complexity approximations to convex bodies, faster algorithms for&lt;br/&gt;polytope membership queries, applications to approximate nearest&lt;br/&gt;neighbor searching, efficient approximation algorithms for Euclidean&lt;br/&gt;minimum spanning trees, and range searching with structural queries.&lt;br/&gt;These improved algorithms will lead to more efficient solutions in the&lt;br/&gt;applications described above.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Software systems and libraries developed as part of this project will be&lt;br/&gt;made freely available over the Web to help scientists and engineers in&lt;br/&gt;other disciplines. The algorithms developed as a part of this project&lt;br/&gt;will be incorporated into graduate and undergraduate courses at the&lt;br/&gt;University of Maryland. Course materials will be made available over the&lt;br/&gt;Web as a resource for researchers interested in learning more about this&lt;br/&gt;area.</AbstractNarration>
