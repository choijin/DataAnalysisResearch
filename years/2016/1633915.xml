<AbstractNarration>Why do the members of one community experiencing catastrophic economic and social loss retain an optimistic outlook for the future and others under similar circumstances experience stress and despair?  This Early Action Grant for Exploratory Research (EAGER) award supports the development of a new theory and methodology in the social sciences for investigating and understanding communities facing increasing uncertainty about their social and economic future.   Substance abuse is just one manifestation of social stress that characterizes communities where viable futures are increasingly difficult to grasp for large segments of the population.   This project is rooted in the investigator's four decades of anthropological field research in communities in the north Atlantic Canadian province of Newfoundland and Labrador, and similar comparative experience in the communities of Robeson County North Carolina.   Both communities have experienced economic and social stress brought about by relocations, factory closures, and natural disasters.  However, the majority of members from each community have experienced and interpreted these events in very different ways.   The insights gained from this project hold promise for understanding the different ways communities experience social and economic uncertainty.  From these insights, the researcher hopes to gain new knowledge about the relationship between these stressors and a vision for a viable future; insights that can inform intervention methods that support community health and well-being. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports a comparative study of communities in severe economic and social stress, seeking to understand the very different ways that the communities themselves conceptualize the causes and consequences both of the stressors and of their very different reactions to social and economic uncertainty.  This research will examine the data from two communities in the north Atlantic Canadian province of Newfoundland and Labrador, with comparative research with two communities in Robeson County North Carolina.  In both places local communities, since the mid-1990s, have experienced major declines in employment and wages, plus declining social support programs.  The researcher points out that there have been locally constructed and fairly intense efforts both to help those who suffer and to mitigate the consequences of social and economic stress, yet the differences persist.  The emphasis in this research begins with seeking to understand the range of responses from community to community.  Using these circumstances as a starting point, the Principal Investigator will develop new theories and methods for the study of "everyday life histories" as a means for assessing locally constructed concepts of risk and uncertainty. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research builds on the concept and methods for studying "everyday histories" first developed at the Max Planck Institute for History.  This research project further develops these concepts and methods by a examining of how people have lived and currently live within and against a history that stretches into what they see as an increasingly uncertain future. Toward this end the researcher will be reviewing and reinterpreting decades of his field notes on these communities, and further developing research methods which focus both on socially constructed silences in communities and obstacles to the social recognition of both "open" and "half-hidden" pleas for help.  The research will contribute not only to a more nuanced and powerful theory of social stress and stressors but has the potential developing a methodology for uncovering the complex relationships between stress as a social phenomenon and the negative behavioral and physical responses to it.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ For the past 14 years I have been trying to usefully understand the epidemics of youth and young adult suicide, substance abuse, and domestic violence among the Inuit and Northern Cree in Labrador, North Atlantic Canada.  These peoples both have what are reputedly the highest youth and young adult suicide rates in the world.  Three years ago at an NSF conference on Arctic peoples, I mentioned that I have also worked, since 1967, in one of the poorest and most stressed areas of the southern US, and the African American youth and young adults there ? the population that in general has the most intense stresses from imposed poverty and cultural abuse -- scarcely ever commits suicide.  Indeed they have an even lower suicide rate than local Whites.  I ended my comments by saying ?I wonder what accounts for the difference??  That quickly led to this grant to ?go find out.?  Would that it were so simple, for the issue is indeed potentially quite important.  It is very difficult to find out why something does not happen, but for the past three years I have been trying, and the effort has been productive so far, although past the formal end of this research grant the analytical and interpretative work continues, still rather intensely.  This research has focused on three key issues.  The main one is what I am calling ?the problem of tomorrow:? How what seems, to many local people, to be an impending tomorrow lives within and against the concrete problems of today.  To put this issue in easily seen terms, the problem of tomorrow is the problem of either taking a sick child to the doctor or paying the rent, of buying food or medicine.  The current situation in May 2020 is making this problem more widespread and more intense, from major increases in unemployment.  The point here is not just how tomorrow is understood, but people living their everydays within and against a tomorrow that can not be understood.  The second problem is the problem of aggression and anger among deeply vulnerable peoples, and how to understand how this is and is not expressed.  The widely noted massive current increase in domestic violence, during the Covid 19 confinements, is likely to not just be about more people confined to home, but more people feeling increasingly vulnerable.  My work on this very much continues, for the issue of the relation between vulnerability and anger is beyond complex and difficult to usefully grasp.  The third issue at stake in this research is the most uncertain: it may or equally may not turn out to be useful to pursue as the work and the analysis continues past the end of the formal research project.  That issue is grasping what may be the underlying dynamics of the changing substance abuse epidemics among the US population (and other populations of course).  The major substances of abuse, to put it simply here, have changed from mood elevators (however transient) to pain killers.  My research on the responses of societally abused youth might -- emphasis might ? have some bearing on this larger issue.  My interpretations and analyses continues, probably for the rest of 2020.  What I am discovering is already being included in a forthcoming book, perhaps published in 2022, tentatively entitled The Problem of Tomorrow.
