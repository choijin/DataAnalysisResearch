<AbstractNarration>Power electronics - electronic circuits that process energy - plays a key enabling role in a wide range of energy-efficient and renewable-energy technologies, and is also essential for powering other types of electronic systems.  Smaller, more efficient, and less costly power electronics are critical to continued improvement of all these systems. Magnetic components such as inductors and transformers are typically the largest and usually lossy components in power electronics.  Moreover, limitations in magnetic component design have been a major obstacle to realizing substantial improvements in miniaturization.   To date, advances in power electronics have been enabled by increases in operating frequency, but limitations in magnetics technologies are inhibiting continuation of this trend.  This project will develop design methods for high-frequency magnetics, mitigating these limitations, and will apply them to develop miniaturized, high-efficiency power electronics.  The results will be useful across many different applications in electronic systems, efficient end-use of energy, and renewable energy systems, reducing their cost and improving their energy efficiency.  The project will engage undergraduate and graduate students in the research, strengthening their skills in this important area.  Participation of under-represented groups will be sought, and research participants will be carefully mentored.  An ongoing research collaboration between Dartmouth and MIT will be strengthened and extended to include educational activities, including outreach to K-12 students to promote science and engineering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A key route to improvement of power electronics is the development of converters that operate efficiently at substantially higher switching frequencies than are presently used (e.g., in the High-Frequency, or HF, range of 3-30 MHz). Higher switching frequencies result in reduced energy storage requirements of the passive components (including magnetic components), which can be leveraged to reduce size and cost of power electronics, and to improve performance (e.g., higher bandwidth.)  Joint advances in high-frequency power circuits and magnetic component design are needed to realize these benefits.  Advances have been hindered both by a lack of performance data for HF magnetic materials and a poor understanding of how to design power magnetics for HF.  Recent work has revealed that some commercial low-permeability magnetic materials have high performance in this frequency range, enabling substantial miniaturization of power electronics (e.g., factors of 2-10 reduction in overall size) if magnetic component and circuit designs leveraging these materials can be developed.  The proposed research program will develop design methods for power magnetic components at HF frequencies utilizing low-permeability materials, and will further investigate how these components can best be applied to realize high-density, high-efficiency power electronics.  The research will develop design techniques for achieving reduced core and winding losses with low permeability materials; investigate optimized core and winding geometries; create improved models and designs for high-frequency windings, and develop new self-shielding HF magnetic structures.  Moreover, power converter designs that can effectively leverage the capabilities of these HF magnetic components will be investigated and applied to realize miniaturized power electronics operating at HF.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Power electronics are critical to all kinds of electrical and electronic equipment, and can be a key factor determining the size, weight, energy consumption and performance of a system.  There is a pressing need for power electronics that are smaller, more efficient and less costly to meet the needs of present and future systems.    A key route to meeting this need is the development of power electronics that operate efficiently at substantially higher switching frequencies than are presently used (e.g., in the High-Frequency, or HF, range of 3-30 MHz).  Higher switching frequencies result in reduced energy storage requirements, which be leveraged to reduce size and and cost of power electronics, and to improve their performance (e.g., higher bandwidth.)  Magnetic components (e.g., inductors and transformers) are typically the largest and most lossy components in power converters.  Moreover, limitations in magnetic component design have been a major obstacle to realizing substantial improvements in miniaturization through frequency increases.  Advances in high-frequency magnetic components have lagged, both because of a lack of performance data for HF magnetic materials and a poor understanding of how to design power magnetics for HF.   The proposed research program has developed new design methods for power magnetic components, including both inductors and transformers.  A first technology that has been developed is a hybrid magnetic/electronic structure &ndash; a "Variable-Inverter-Rectifier-Transformer" &ndash; that (1) enables lower loss and higher efficiency of transformers in high-step-down power converters, and (2) power converters that operate efficiently over wider ranges of conditions.  A second technology that has been developed is a design and construction method for inductors operating at HF that can achieve significantly higher efficiency than conventional designs, and which can cover a wide range of power levels and applications with relatively few constituent components.  Each of these technologies has been experimentally demonstrated power converters for various applications including grid-interface rectifiers for computer power supplies, and found to be highly effective.  Multiple undergraduate research students have been trained in the course of this research program, three of which have now become graduate student researchers in the field.  Moreover, multiple graduate students have been trained carrying out this research, including one who has now become a faculty member in the field.
