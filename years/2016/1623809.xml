<AbstractNarration>The increasing availability of large-scale data to capture major activities in science"publications, patents, citations, grant proposals, as their associated meta-data"has created an unprecedented opportunity to quantitatively explore the patterns of scientific production and reward. This workshop brings together social, computational and natural scientists to discuss the science of science and innovation policy and its potential to transform the practice of science, the redesign of institutions, and the practice of science policy. Participants include leading researchers from various disciplines, program directors from the Department of Defense, and private philanthropic foundations, scientific publishers and companies that conduct R&amp;D and provide scientific services. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Researchers from a wide range of disciplines have begun to use science as an observatory to probe social phenomena that are more universal and widely applicable than the institutions of science themselves. As such, the tools and perspectives vary, involving social scientists, information and computer scientists, economists, physicists and mathematicians, with results published in venues with non-overlapping readership. In contrast with standard bibliometric studies, the recent surge in quantitative studies of science is characterized by a few distinct qualities: (i) They typically rely on large-scale datasets to study science, ranging from hundreds of thousands to millions of authors, papers and citations; and, (ii) Instead of only evaluating metrics, they also use models to more deeply probe the mechanisms driving science, from knowledge production to scientific and social impact, systematically distinguishing predictable from random patterns.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The International Symposium on the Science of Science highlighted several critical insights regarding science, in particular the importance for a broad range of sciences to be involved and also for a broad range of policy-areas that fund science and technology, especially including both civilian and military agencies.  This prompts us to articulate a brief statement regarding "All the Science of Science: of the sciences, by the sciences, for the sciences." Throughout the history of science, new instruments like the microscope, telescope, and cyclotron have punctuated advance by augmenting our ability to sense, measure and reason about the world. Today, the windfall of digital data including tens of millions of grant proposals, research articles, preprints, white papers, patents and the products (and their web descriptions) to which they lead, represents our latest instrument, which, like the microscope or telescope, is catalyzing a multidisciplinary revolution that has the potential to unlock enormous scientific, technological, and educational value. Indeed, recent advances and interest in the Science of Science (SoS) has featured contributions from scientists ranging from the information and library sciences to the social, physical, and biological sciences to engineering and design, each using their distinct disciplinary models, skills, intuitions, standards and objectives to address and evaluate different aspects of the scientific enterprise. This instrument, however, is different from the microscope or telescope, because it is an instrument "of the sciences, by the sciences, for the sciences." This powerfully illustrates how a science of science that relies only on the information sciences, social sciences or engineering will miss critical aspects of an enterprise that is growing larger, more complex, and more interconnected, at an exponential rate.   Our symposium promoted and advocates for a science of science that draws upon the talents, traditions, and heuristics from all the sciences is necessary to maximize the efficiency and contributions of the scientific establishment, essential to making science most beneficial for all of the society worldwide. The symposium articulated changes in science and the science of science that advocate for greater collaboration, potentially through an annual conference.  Many disciplines are at the threshold of fundamental transition. The growing size and complexity of science make one size fits all SoS insights/metrics increasingly inadequate. While most disciplines have their own SoS producers, helping solve their own institutional problems, this work is appreciated disproportionately by their respective disciplinary consumers. As sciences grow larger and more complex, insights from the SoS that are oblivious to discipline-specific peculiarities will become increasingly inadequate. There is a growing and urgent need for disciplines to promote a "CIO" for their scientific domain, rather than a "consultant" with a one size fits all strategy (e.g., simple citation metrics.) This is because significant disciplinary differences in culture, habits, and preferences (e.g. multi-author publications, the order of authors, tenure requirements, choices of publication venues such as proceedings vs journals), together with the consequential nature of decisions based on these differences, make cross-domain insights difficult to consume and implement. Moreover, the "domain native" SoS analyses performed by a scholar within the field are characterized by a level of depth that is otherwise difficult to achieve. E.g., A Century of Physics in Nature Physics (Barabasi, a physicist); Seeking a New Biology Through Text Mining in Cell (Rzhetsky, a biologist); How Does the Market Use Citation Data in American Economics Journal (Ellison, an economist). In the business world, shifting from outside consultants to having one?s own CIO office is inevitable as organizations become larger and more complex. Over the course of the symposium, it became clear that the exponential growth of science over the past centuries has put all disciplines at the threshold of such a transition.   The widespread reproducibility crisis plaguing social and natural sciences, and the rising importance of meta-research suggest the importance of disciplines to use their understanding of science to evaluate and "police themselves." Moreover, different disciplines bring a diversity of objective functions that they optimize, contributing these to the whole field of science of science, in addition to their each respective domains, and attenuate the problems associated with Campbell?s law, Goodhart's law, and the Lucas critique, that the "more any quantitative social indicator is used for social decision-making, the more subject it will be to corruption pressures and the more apt it will be to distort and corrupt the social processes it is intended to monitor."  Where are we now? While science of science research covers a broad swath of researchers, being consumed by all the sciences, they contribute unequally. More could be performed in science and innovation policy funding to help rectify this, for the benefit of science.
