<AbstractNarration>Gamma-rays are the highest energy form of electromagnetic radiation.  Observations of astrophysical gamma-rays serve as probes of physical conditions and processes in the most extreme environments throughout the Universe, and can be used to test fundamental physics.  The High Altitude Water Cherenkov (HAWC) observatory, located on the slopes of the Sierra Negra in Mexico, is a ground-based facility designed with unique capabilities to observe very high energy gamma-rays.  This award supports scientists at the University of Maryland College Park in their leadership roles in the operation of the observatory and in the scientific analysis of the HAWC data.  The PI serves as U.S. Spokesperson for HAWC and the Co-PI serves as HAWC Data Manager.  They will continue developing analysis algorithms and simulation tools for the observatory, and pursue scientific research on transient gamma-ray sources and spatially extended Galactic sources.  This award will allow the group to continue and expand their outreach efforts, which include outreach to the Hispanic-American community with bi-lingual products related to HAWC.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With its large instantaneous field of view and continuous operations HAWC surveys two-thirds of the sky every day.  HAWC will perform a deep survey of the gamma-ray sky and detect a large sample of gamma-ray sources with measurements of flux, spectra and variability.  HAWC's wide field and high sensitivity enable studies of extended sources and diffuse emission from the Galactic plane.  The University of Maryland group will exploit HAWC's unique capabilities to study rare transients, search for high-energy emission from gamma-ray bursts, and probe the spectra and morphology of extended sources.  In addition they will continue their leadership roles in operating and improving the performance of the observatory.</AbstractNarration>

HAWC is is a wide field of view, continuously operating TeV (Terra-electron Volt) gamma-ray telescope that is exploring the origin of cosmic rays, studying the acceleration of particles in extreme physical environments, and searching for new physics at the TeV-PeV scale. The main HAWC detector array consisting of 300 large (200,000 liter) water tanks instrumented to detect Cherenkov light produced by cosmic ray air showers was completed on March 20, 2015 with an outrigger array of 300 smaller water Cherenkov tanks being completed in 2018.&nbsp; This grant covered the period of August 2016 to August 2020.&nbsp;</p> <p><span>&nbsp;</span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;HAWC has provided a new look at the TeV sky, discovering new sources and new source classes, setting new limits on dark matter and playing a crucial role in multi-messenger observations. HAWC is a unique survey instrument offering a view of the TeV sky that is orthogonal to the current array of IACT experiments and the upcoming CTA project. While HAWC has less instantaneous sensitivity to point sources when compared to IACTs, its wide field-of-view and continuous operation give a much higher exposure (more than 1000 times higher measured in steradian-hours), which leads to significant advantages when studying gamma-ray source variability, source extension of the order of the typical field-of-view of IACTs, and emission energy beyond 10 TeV.&nbsp; HAWC provides daily unbiased monitoring of variable sources including nearby active galactic nuclei (AGN). HAWC is particularly well suited to study extended and diffuse sources, which are challenging targets for IACTs.</p> <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Maryland's science focus has been on development of reconstruction tools, point source and extended source analysis, untriggered gamma ray bursts, and multi-messenger astrophysics.&nbsp; The UMD group is primarily responsible for overseeing HAWC operations and data analysis. We have been playing a key role in the development of the next reprocessing pass&nbsp; (Pass 5) for all of the HAWC data where we are responsible new algorithm developments leading to higher sensitivity at both low and high energies. In addition, we are working on incorporating the outriggers in our reconstruction which will be Pass 6. Also we have had a lead role in a number of HAWC publications, as well as issuing and responding to real time alerts. We are nearing the publication of our third HAWC catalog containing over 55 individual TeV&nbsp;sources including 20 newly discovered sources and updated spectral information on previously seen sources.</p> <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Since the commissioning of the experiment HAWC's scientific output has risen steadily. Since the beginning of 2017, HAWC has published 30 papers in refereed journals including papers in both Science and Nature and issued 13 Astronomer's Telegrams (ATELs) and 40 GCN Notices.</p> <p class="p1"><strong>Broader Impacts:</strong></p> <p class="p1">&nbsp; &nbsp; HAWC is one of the most visible science projects in Mexico.
