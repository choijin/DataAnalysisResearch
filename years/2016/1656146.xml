<AbstractNarration>General Audience Summary   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports research on a previously unknown trial on evolution that took place in 1924; it is America's first courtroom battle over the teaching of evolution, having occurred one year prior to the infamous Scopes trial, which has until now been regarded as the first such trial.  The researcher will develop new scholarship on public understanding of evolution and its history in the United States, based on his discovery of the 1924 evolution trial. The researcher will communicate the results of this research to a broad audience by the publication of a book and by articles in both academic peer-reviewed journals and in popular mainstream publications. This project builds on previous scholarly work of the researcher and expands his inquiries into the relationship between STS and other disciplines, including fields of disability studies, migration studies, and education policy. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Summary     &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The discovery of an unknown evolution trial in American history, one that supplants the infamous Scopes trial of 1925 as the earliest known trial, is itself groundbreaking and promises to make a significant contribution to the study of STS and US history. This project goes beyond simply calling attention to this unknown event by developing new insights into both the public understanding of science and the historically changing place of the schoolteacher as a figure in the center of controversies over public acceptance of science. The project will also explore the way that the trial's plaintiff, a Pennsylvania Dutch man with a disability, understood his role as a mediator of scientific knowledge. As such, this project explores new intellectual connections between the fields of STS and disability studies by examining the way that one's identity as fit or disabled shaped the way one could perform the role of knowledge mediator. It promises to compel a substantial revision in the history evolution and its use in education policy, and to encourage greater engagement between policy makers and the social studies of science and technology by its contribution to ongoing discussions.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In 1924 in a court case took place in Lincoln, Nebraska involving a teacher accused of teaching evolution. But unlike the Scopes trial in Tennessee nine months later, David Domer?s slander lawsuit attracted no national attention. Domer had been labeled "unfit, morally and mentally" to teach by a Lutheran church pastor in Rising City and eight members of his congregation resulting in Domer?s job contract being rescinded and leaving the schoolteacher unable to find employment in that part of the state. In the courtroom, the defendant sought to justify their slander by arguing that "Darwinism" was contrary to the Bible, and that a man who taught it should not be in the profession of teaching children. Domer, himself a church leader in another denomination, pointed to his decades of experience in teaching and his certifications and degrees to refute the claim that he was unfit. He also drew a distinction between teaching about Darwin?s theory and endorsing it or any irreligious conclusions one might justify from it.   This project examines this previously unknown trial, potentially America?s first evolution trial. While science-religion conflicts were certainly debated in the courtroom, the course of events that led to the lawsuit showed how the evolution issue was intertwined with larger issues about the role of education and authority and scientific knowledge in rural America. Domer?s moral and mental qualifications as a school superintendent in Rising City were affected by public perceptions of his physical disabilities. At a time when eugenics and questions of "fitness" dominated the social landscape, Domer?s identity as disabled affected how people were willing to see him as an expert and authority on matters of scientific knowledge.   This trial also emerges in the context of World War One-era nativism and anti-German sentiment that found particular expression in laws governing the schools. For a community of mostly German immigrants and their immediate descendants in Nebraska, this experience colored their perception of the schoolmaster and the scientific knowledge he presented to the community. German-American Lutheran responses to evolution were different from those of most other American Protestant communities (both those opposed to evolution and those who supported it) in part because their reactions were shaped by the different reception of evolutionary theories in Germany and in translation to the German language&mdash;compounded by their experience as immigrants.   Ultimately, the lawsuit?s obscurity and the way that it contrasts with the trial of John Scopes, debunks one of the most pervasive interpretations of American attitudes towards evolution &mdash; that the clash of scientific and religious ideas themselves led inexorably to open social conflict between two opposing sides. America?s first evolution trial, this slander suit that was not even thought of as an "evolution trial" until after the fact, reveals that ideological differences can and did function as post-facto justifications instead of as primary motivations of science denial and opposition. This history suggests ways to think about other seemingly intractable issues in science communication and public understanding of science.  Results of this project have been presented at several academic conferences and written work is currently being completed and revised for publication in both journal articles and book manuscript form.
