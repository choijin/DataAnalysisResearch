<AbstractNarration>The Chemical Synthesis Program of the Chemistry Division of NSF supports the project by Professor Gregory S. Girolami of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign to develop new and better molecular precursors for the chemical vapor deposition (CVD) of thin films.  The current work will develop new classes of transition metal compounds, especially as they relate to the use of such molecules as precursors for the deposition of metals and metal oxides on surfaces with deep vertical features. The research will lead to a better understanding of the chemistry of volatile transition metal compounds and how they can be used to uniformly fill such deep features with a focus on better ways to deposit the wires and insulators that are key components of modern-day computer chips.  The work will enhance already existing interactions between Professor Girolami?s group and leading companies in microelectronics development. This project will contribute directly to the education and training of B.S. and Ph.D. students, and the results will be disseminated by presentations at international conferences, and by publication in reputable scientific journals.  This award will contribute to the education of a diverse group of undergraduate and graduate students, and enable Professor Girolami to write short radio spots highlighting recent scientific advances of interest to the public. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A vital national scientific need is the development of new and better molecular precursors for the chemical vapor deposition (CVD) of thin films. The current project is contributing directly to this need by investigating the synthesis of new volatile compounds (especially of the transition metals), investigations of their chemical reactivities, and studies of their volatilities and utilities as thin film precursors. Some of the specific objectives of the current project are the synthesis of new complexes containing hard-soft chelating ligands, and the synthesis of high molecular weight but still highly volatile compounds, which are expected to be useful for the CVD of superconformal thin films. In parallel, investigations of the use of these new compounds for the CVD of thin films will be carried out collaboratively with experts in these techniques. The development of these new molecules will lead to better performing materials and new fabrication methods that will enable the continued miniaturization of integrated circuits. In this way, the Girolami group will contribute to achieving one of the most important "Difficult Challenges" of the International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors: the rapid introduction of new materials/processes for the chemical vapor deposition (CVD) of thin films. The project lies at the interface of inorganic and materials chemistry, and is well suited for the education of scientists at all levels.  Professor Girolami?s group is also well positioned to provide the highest level of education and training for students underrepresented in science.  Outreach activities involving the production and broadcast of TinyTech radio spots will also be part of the funded project.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Developing new and improved chemical methods for making faster, more powerful, and less expensive computer chips has been one of the main objectives of this funded research.  With support from the National Science Foundation, this research program led by Dr. Girolami resulted in the development of new molecules that can serve as chemical starting materials for the deposition of thin films of a variety of metals, metal diborides, metal nitrides, and metal oxides.  One of the main challenges facing the microelectronics industry is to find methods to grow the films at temperatures as low as possible, often below 300 degrees Centrigrade.  Dr. Girolami and his research group have been successful in developing new chemical starting materials able to convert at such low temperatures into useful thin films.   Another challenge is to develop methods to grow thin films in very tiny recessed features, because this ability enables a number of key chip manufacturing steps, such as forming wires that connect the electrical components in computer chips together.  During the project period the PI and his coworkers and collaborators developed several new methods to achieve this goal of growing films in such nooks and crannies.   As part of our broader impacts, the PI has contributed directly to the education and training of B.S. and Ph.D. students, and the results of their research were disseminated to other scientists through presentations at international conferences and by publication in scientific journals. The work is also helping companies in the microelectronics sector to develop better methods to make computer chips in the future.
