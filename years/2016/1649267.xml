<AbstractNarration>The Morgan State University INCLUDES project will build on an existing regional partnership of four Historically Black Colleges and Universities that are working together to improve STEM outcomes for middle school minority male students that are local to Morgan State in Baltimore, North Carolina A&amp;T in Greensboro, Jackson State in Mississippi, and Kentucky State in Frankfort. Additional partners include SRI International, the National CARES Mentoring Network, and the Verizon Foundation. Using the collective impact-style approaches such as planning and implementing a Network Improvement Community (NIC), developing a shared agenda and implementing mutually reinforcing activities, these partners will address two common goals: (1) Broaden the participation of underrepresented minority males in science and engineering through educational experiences that prepare them for careers in STEM fields; and (2) Create a Network Improvement Community focused on STEM achievement in minority males.  Program elements include high-quality instruction in STEM content, mentoring, and professional development. The project will expand to include eight additional partners (six HBCUs and two Hispanic-Serving Institutions) and schools and districts in communities local to their campuses. The INCLUDES pilot will help scale innovations that target impacting minorities in STEM. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will develop STEM learning pathways for middle school minority males by harnessing the collective impact of 12 university partners, local K-12 schools and districts with which they partner, and surrounding community organizations and businesses with a vested interest in achieving common goals. Products will include a roadmap for addressing the problem through a Network Improvement Community, a website that will contribute to the knowledge base regarding effective strategies for enhancing STEM educational opportunities for minority males, and common metrics, assessments, and shared measurement systems that will be used to measure the collective impact of the Network Improvement Community.</AbstractNarration>

Roadblocks that continue to challenge minority males include: disparity in access to high quality STEM educational resources, a lack of role models, and a shortage of highly trained, minority STEM educators. The Early STEM Engagement for Minority Males (eSEM) through a Network of Minority Serving Institutions targets these challenges through a collaboration between informal learning programs in computing and engineering for middle school-aged minority males, primarily African-American and Hispanic. Goals were to broaden the participation of underrepresented minority males in science and engineering through educational experiences that prepare them for careers in STEM fields and to create a Network Improvement Community focused on STEM achievement in minority males. Through the eSEM website and project resources that highlights project activities and resources for researchers and practitioners (http://esem-includes.org), this effort builds stakeholder awareness regarding the need for mentorship, role models, and STEM educational activities for minority males in middle school, who may lack access to these important resources. The national reach of the eSEM program helps to build awareness among the families of these students. The efforts included mentoring, working groups, workshops, and webinars. As a result of the efforts, student participants showed an  increase in engagement, academic performance, interest in STEM subjects, interest in technology proficiency, soft skills, and awareness of and interest in STEM careers.
