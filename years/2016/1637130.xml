<AbstractNarration>The size, shape, mineralogy, and physical behavior and evolution of magma chambers beneath ocean ridges determine the geochemical, geophysical, hydrothermal, and tectonic characteristics of ocean crust, which forms over 70 percent of Earth's surface (i.e., all that occurring under the sea).  To learn more about slow-spread ocean crustal structure, a major community-driven effort to drill deep bore holes into magmatic rocks on the seafloor by the International Ocean Discovery Program and involving more than 30 scientists from around the world, was carried out in 2015-2016 on the Southwest Indian Ridge at a location called the Atlantis Bank.  The research that will be carried out under the auspices of this award is divided into two parts. One part consists of creating the foundational geochemical analytical data for over 300 igneous rock specimens of the 789 meter-long core, with the second part involving targeted studies of discrete core intervals to look at the origin of local features.  Results of this stratigraphic work will be compared to similar data collected from an ocean drilling core taken 2.2 kilometers away a number of years ago.  Broader impacts of the work include strong international collaboration with French, German, Italian, and Chinese scientists, support of a multi-national science program to understand the composition and magmatic section of the seafloor, and the training of two graduate students, one US and one Chinese, with the second being paid for by the Chinese government. Efforts will be made to transmit findings to the public via podcasts and the participation of a professional science communicator.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The laboratory part of the research consists of carrying out and creating a geochemical database of whole rock and mineral major and trace element data.  Each sample will be examined petrographically to determine mineral and textural relationships and discriminate between primary, secondary, and alteration phases and features. In addition, rare earth element compositions in coexisting plagioclase and pyroxene will be used as geothermometers to develop chemical zoning profiles and thermal histories of the various magmatic bodies within the stratigraphic section. These data will form the basis for the testing of the hypothesis that there is a continuity of igneous process across the Atlantis Bank, reflecting steady-state conditions of emplacement of a core complex.  Results of this work can be extrapolated to help us understand other slow-spread crustal areas along the mid-ocean ridges.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p><em>Earth is a dynamic planet, with a convecting mantle beneath the crust that produces seafloor spreading. This results in constant tectonic and volcanic activity along the ocean ridges where 3/5<sup>ths</sup> of Earth?s crust forms. There the major exchange of heat, mass, and volatiles between the Earth?s interior, oceans, and atmosphere occurs; key to understanding the global carbon cycle, ocean chemistry, and natural resources. The magmas forming the crust are created in the mantle as it is pulled up between the diverging plates where low pressure causes it to melt. This melt aggregates and pools in magma chambers above the mantle. First it forms a crystal mush that then solidifies after lava is extracted to erupt on the seafloor. This causes the composition of the melt to change, becoming richer in iron, sodium, potassium, titanium, and depleted in elements like magnesium, chromium and nickel. Thus, the composition of mid-ocean ridge basalt is controlled by the mantle?s initial composition, the processes that occur as it aggregates and rises through it, and also by processes in the lower crust that further modifies it, including chemical reaction with previously crystallized rock. Little has previously been known of what happens there, with what we know largely inferred from remoted geophysical sensing, theoretical calculations, and the composition of the lavas: leading to tenuous conclusions about the composition of the lavas that arrived from the mantle, and how they changed before eruption.</em></p> <p><em>We studied drill cores of the lower crust from Atlantis Bank, a sunken tectonic island in the Indian Ocean (Fig. 1) that exposes some 255 square miles of the remains of ancient magma chambers, unroofed, and tectonically exposed at the ridge for 2.7 Myr, beginning 13 million years ago (Fig. 2), now sitting 46 miles to south. Due to a unique set of ocean currents and tectonics, rocks normally covered with sediment were surveyed using seafloor rock sampling (Fig. 3), submersibles, and remotely operated vehicles (Fig. 4), in a detail that can normally only be done on land. Initially we synthesized the results of the surveys, producing the 1<sup>st</sup> ever geologic map of a the lower ocean crust (Fig. 5). We then focused on the study of cores from 809-m deep Hole 1473A, the 3<sup>rd</sup> of 3 holes, including 1508-m Hole 735B and 158-m Hole 1105A, drilled by the Ocean Drilling Program and its successors. We then had a unique opportunity to study the lower ocean crust in 3 dimensions.</em></p> <p><em>This shows the lower ocean crust is not uniform (Fig.6), with a core dominantly composed of magnesium-rich rocks, that grade upwards, and outwards to iron-titanium rich rocks, where elements like copper, gold, silver, and valuable rare earth elements should be concentrated: thus, providing clues for future mineral exploration. These rocks also intruded laterally into the mantle where no lower ocean crust formed, validating the premise that they are not part of a single layer beneath the seafloor, but are discontinuous, with large gaps where lavas were erupted directly over the mantle. Accordingly, with only a thin veneer of basalt overlying it, seawater can easily access mantle rock at shallow depth, reacting with it, potentially capturing and storing CO<sub>2</sub>, while releasing magnesium and other elements into the ocean. This could significantly modify the global carbon budget, potentially affecting global warming at long time scales. Focusing on the rock cores, we produced several studies that show that the lower crust formed there has a good deal in common with that formed at ridges, like the East Pacific Rise with higher magma budgets where partially molten crust extends to the base of the lavas frozen in the dikes that tapped the magma chambers to feed seafloor volcanism. It also has a great deal in common with crust formed at ridges with low magma budgets, like the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, where most new magma intrusions are sufficiently widely spaced that they solidify independently, and thus, there is no long-lived crystal mush zone extending up to the base of the dikes. The Atlantis Bank stratigraphy is unique, however, with an intermediate magma flux it had a long-lived crystal mush zone, but it did not extend up to the base of the dikes. With ongoing tectonic extension forced by the diverging tectonic plates, it had a hot lower crust, and much of it pulled apart as plastic solids, rather than extending by cold brittle faulting, as at the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. The lower crust beneath East Pacific Rise, on the other hand, simply crystallized directly from the mush up to the base of the dikes without solid-state deformation. Thus, the lower crust formed at low, moderate, and high rates of magma supply are each unique, with the intermediate case sharing features otherwise unique to each end member, and features unique to itself.</em></p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 10/13/2020<br>      Modified by: Henry&nbsp;J&nbsp;Dick</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1637130/1637130_10448135_1602619671109_Fig2AtlantisBankLocation--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1637130/1637130_10448135_1602619671109_Fig2AtlantisBankLocation--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 1 Shaded relief location map for Atlantis Bank"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1637130/1637130_10448135_1602619671109_Fig2AtlantisBankLocation--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 1 Shaded relief location map for Atlantis Bank"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Shaded seafloor topography color coded by depth from blue (deep) to orange (shallow).
