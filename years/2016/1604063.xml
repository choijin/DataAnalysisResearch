<AbstractNarration>This project will enhance knowledge of landscape response in coastal floodplains to extreme rainfall events, which could aid coastal communities to better prepare for flood hazards. This project will also provide: an opportunity to further advance the career of a Native American scientist; research experience for a Hispanic female technician; and quality educational opportunities for undergraduate students. Reporting of the project results at the Society for Advancing Chicanos/Hispanics &amp; Native Americans in Science (SACNAS) undergraduate research conferences will attract underrepresented groups to pursue careers in geoscience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will examine the landscape and hydrological response of the Santee River Floodplain to an extreme rainfall event that occurred between October 3-5, 2015, in South Carolina (two-day rainfall totals up to 400 mm on the coastal plain, 300 mm in the piedmont, and 250 mm in the upstate). The team will collect perishable data from coastal floodplains, develop scientific criteria for locating sampling sites, and enhance hydrodynamic modeling capabilities with potential broad applications in coastal floodplain landscapes.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The subject of this report is a small research project designed to acquire perishible data associate with a catastrophic "1000 year" flood that occured in South Carolina early October, 2015.  There were two main objectives: 1) to identify "high water" marks over a floodplain and to survey the estimated fres surface elevation associated with the flood.  This was accomplished in the field with high precision GPS survey and measurmennts.  2) We installed three pressure transducers and a current meter on the forested floodplain floor to continuously estimate the direction and slope of the free surface during a flood.  These readings were combined with current meter observation and together the data highligh the dynamics of flow over a flooded floodplain.  Results from the water marks survey show that the free surface flood elevations were highly varaible.  After correcting for floodplain slope the collective set of data varied by 0.27 m.  This result implies that the free surface was strongly affected by local roughness, or vegetation patterns and the buildup of floating debris.  The results from the pressure sensors show that the flow direction can change as much as 33 azimuth degrees in as little as 1.5 hours.  These results show that floodplain circulation is highly dynamic, and the overall hydraulic connectedness of the landscape is not fully resolved.
