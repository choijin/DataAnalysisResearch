<AbstractNarration>Conformal and holomorphic maps are fundamental to many areas of mathematics, physics, engineering and probability. These are two  special kinds of maps that preserve angles and complex structures. For example, Brownian motion (a mathematical model of continuous random paths) can be studied using conformal analysis and the project will use this approach to investigate some well known problems, e.g., to determine what types of simple sets are covered by Brownian motion. Another focus of the project is the iteration theory of holomorphic functions. The PI will study the size, shape and behavior of the Julia and Fatou sets associated to entire functions (holomorphic functions defined on the whole plane). Traditionally, most work has focused on the special case of polynomials; the case of more general entire functions is known as "transcendental dynamics", but has  been much  less studied so far. The project will also consider several problems in analysis that can be attacked using ideas from discrete and computational geometry. Successful completion of this work could result in faster algorithms related to meshing, as used in graphics, medical imaging, and a wide variety of design and manufacturing applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project divides into several broad areas: transcendental dynamics, Brownian motion, and the interactions of analysis with computational geometry. Continuing earlier work, the PI will study problems such as computing the dimension of Julia sets of entire functions, investigating the existence of wandering domains with bounded orbits, and studying the escaping set (points that iterate to infinity). The PI will also work on related geometric problems for random sets such as Brownian motion, considering both well known questions (does Brownian motion cover any rectifiable arcs?) as well as more novel ones (is Brownian motion removable for conformal maps? Does the set of cut-points lie on a rectifiable curve?) Finally, the PI will work on extending his earlier algorithms for optimal meshing, triangulation and conformal mapping using ideas from analysis, geometry and topology. The most interesting generalization would be to three dimensions, where no rigorous complexity bounds are known, but where the most important applications lie. The proposal also considers problems in "pure" analysis that might be solved using strengthened versions of known results in computational geometry; one such problem is the connectedness of the space of chord-arc curves in the BMO topology; another is the factoring of general bi-Lipschitz maps into bi-Lipschitz maps with small constants.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Almost exactly a century ago, Gaston Julia and Pierre Fatou initiated the study of holomorphic dynamics, that is, the study of the sequence of iterates  z, f(z), f(f(z)),...  where f is a holomorphic function from the complex numbers (usually identified with the 2- dimensional plane) to themselves.

Baker and his students starting in the 1960's.  Because transcendental functions form such a large and diverse class, there are only a  few general results that apply to all such functions, and a great deal of attention has been devoted to special  families of functions, such as exponential functions, or to certain classes of functions such as the Eremenko-Lyubich class and the Speiser class.  Much of the work of the PI has been to understand the geometric properties of general functions in these special classes, without restricting to families given by particular formulas.  Except for very simple examples,  all holomorphic functions have singular values, that is, places where the function does not have a well defined inverse function. For polynomials, these are exactly the critical values., i.e., the values of the function at the points where it has zero derivative.  For a polynomial this is a finite set.  The iterates of these special points are very important in the theory and determine many properties of the Julia set. For example, the famous Mandelbrot set is a picture of the quadratic polynomials whose single critical value has a bounded orbit, and these are exactly the quadratic  polynomials with a connected Julia set.   For transcendental functions, critical values are also singular, but other types of singular values occur as well. The number of singular values may be infinite in general, but the Speiser class is defined to be the set of transcendental functions that, like polynomials, have finite singular sets. The Eremenko-Lyubich class  is defined by having singular sets contained in a bounded disk of the complex plane (but they might consist of infinitely many points inside this disk). How are these classes like or unlike polynomials?  A celebrated result of Sullivan in the 1980's says that all the non-chaotic points of a  polynomial eventually display a certain type of periodic behavior (the "no wandering domains" theorem), and his proof was quickly generalized to the Speiser class by various investigators.  Previously, Baker had shown it fails for some transcendental functions, but whether Sullivan's  theorem extended to the Eremenko-Lyubich class remained open for thirty years until a counterexample was produced by the PI using a method called "quasiconformal folding". The method consists of constructing "by hand" a non-holomorphic function that has certain certain topological  properties that an Eremenko-Lyubich function must have,  together with   certain geometric properties you wish to achieve,  and then solving a certain partial differential equation to produce an actual holomorphic function with very similar geometry.  Among the advantages of this concrete and geometrical approach is a high degree of control over the singular values, which is a prerequisite  for controlling the dynamical properties of the function.  Work under this proposal has focused on extending and sharpening the quasiconformal folding method to gain an understanding of  the Eremenko-Lyubich class, the distinctions between it and the Speiser class, and answering various questions in transcendental dynamics and complex analysis.  Instead of searching among various formulas for an example with a desired property, one can ``draw a picture'' of the desired geometry and prove that a function with that geometry must exist.  This gives a powerful method of creating examples and testing conjectures. It has solved problems not just in dynamics, but answered fundamental questions about the growth rates of holomorphic functions, triangulations of Riemann surfaces, and the geometry of conformally natural drawings of trees and graphs (dessins d'enfants).  Other work done under this proposal includes studying the fractal dimensions of Julia sets of transcendental functions (including answering a 40 year old question about what the smallest dimension can be), investigating how fractal dimensions can change under quasiconformal mappings (again answering a long standing question), and applications of complex analysis ideas to the construction of new, exotic 4-dimensional manifolds; understanding the possible geometries of such  objects is one of the mathematical foundations of the study of space-time  in physics.
