<AbstractNarration>Youth environmental education (EE) programs often serve as gateway experiences in which diverse audiences engage in informal science learning. While there is evidence that these programs can have positive impacts on participants, little empirical research has been conducted to determine what makes one program more successful than another. To be able to conduct such research, this Exploratory Pathways study will (1) develop and statistically validate ways to measure meaningful outcomes for participants across a variety of programs and (2) test observational methods that will enable research that can determine which elements of program delivery most powerfully influence participant engagement and learning outcomes in different contexts. These efforts will include consultations with diverse subject matter experts from the National Park Service, nature centers, and academia; survey research with participants in afterschool and free-choice EE programs; and observations of EE programs designed to fine tune the measurement of program delivery elements and student engagement. Developing valid and reliable outcomes measures and observational protocols will enable a larger investigation that will specifically address the following research question: What program characteristics lead to the best learning outcomes for program participants in different contexts?  This research will result in empirically tested guidelines that will enable educators to design and deliver more effective programs for a wide range of audiences in a wide range of contexts. It is funded by the Advancing Informal STEM Learning (AISL) program, which seeks to advance new approaches to, and evidence-based understanding of, the design and development of STEM learning in informal environments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This effort will refine methods necessary to undertake an unprecedented study (and future AISL Research in Service to Practice proposal) to examine the linkages between pedagogical approaches, participant engagement, and learning outcomes in informal STEM-focused youth EE programs. The larger study will involve systematically observing a large number of programs to assess the use of different approaches and to link those approaches to engagement and learning outcomes through both observation and survey research. In this current study the team will develop and refine crosscutting outcome measures to ensure validity, reliability, and sensitivity by drawing upon the literature and consultation with key stakeholders to develop suites of indicators for subsequent psychometric testing and revision. They will also refine observational techniques for assessing pedagogical approaches through extensive testing of inter-rater reliability. Finally, techniques for measuring participant engagement, incorporating both observational techniques and retrospective participant surveys will be refined.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The work will be conducted by researchers at Clemson University and Virginia Tech, in partnership with the U.S. National Park Service, the North American Association for Environmental Education, and the American Association of Nature Center Administrators. This work represents the first step in a longer research process to determine the "best practices" most responsible for achieving outcomes in a wide range of contexts.</AbstractNarration>

We then developed survey items based upon these definitions, often adapting pre-existing scales from the literature, and again, received input from a wide range of subject matter experts over the course of six months. The resulting surveys were then implemented across eight pilot study sites, including three single-day field trip programs (Appalachian Highland Science Learning Center, Everglades National Park, and US Forest Service River Snorkeling Program), one free-choice natural science museum setting (North Carolina Natural Science Museum), and four residential STEM-based EE programs (Oregon Outdoor Schools, NorthBay Education Foundation, Glen Helen Nature Center, and Cuyahoga Valley Environmental Education Center). The programs were intentionally diverse in their settings, audiences, and locations. We tested both pre/post and retrospective survey designs and collected over 150 surveys at each site, enabling both cognitive testing and psychometric analysis of our survey items, including confirmatory factor analyses with invariance testing of these outcomes measures. The process resulted in statistically valid measures designed to gauge participants? outcomes reflective of the roots of the field as well as emerging directions.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Second, we developed and refined systematic observational methods to measure the degree of use and quality of pedagogical approaches, structural design elements, contextual factors, and participant engagement in STEM-related EE programs for adolescent youth. Building on prior research, we iteratively refined and tested observational techniques in multiple settings. First, two researchers conducted observations during 81 lessons with 17 different educators at the NorthBay Education Foundation in Northeast, MD. Following the refinement of concepts and measures, our larger research team, including the two PIs, six graduate students, and three research technicians, observed seventeen additional programs together at seven unique sites to further refine and test observation measures. In each case, we scored each program as individuals and then compared and discussed at length any issues with scoring. We used this process to ensure consistent, reliable, and valid scoring across the graduate student researchers.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Third, we developed and tested methods for exploring the links between program characteristics, self-determination, participant engagement, and cross-cutting outcomes. We worked with our partners, the NAAEE, the National Park Service (NPS), and ANCA, to identify the program providers that offer single-day STEM-related EE field trip programs for youth, grades 5-8 from across the country.&nbsp; Leveraging this NSF AISL Pathways grant, we garnered additional external funds to expand our data collection efforts that used four pairs of researchers to collect field data over a period of six months and observed 334 programs from over 90 different organizations located across 23 states and Washington, DC. Our sampling scheme was focused on ensuring diversity in location, program participants, program providers, and program types. Data collection included surveys with program providers, systematic observations of the programs, post-experience surveys with program attendees, and surveys with visiting teachers to account for pre-experience activities that could influence student outcomes.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Intellectual merit and broader impacts: </strong>The Exploratory Pathways project established the viability of innovative methods for answering key questions about the field?s biggest assumptions regarding what works (or doesn?t) in informal STEM-related EE programs.

The broader impacts of these developments are significant and meaningful in multiple ways.
