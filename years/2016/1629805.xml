<AbstractNarration>Folded rocks are common, highly aesthetic features of mountain belts and their ages constrain the timing of mountain building events, regional patterns of deformation, continental evolution and (economic) mineralization of the Earth?s crust. This geochronological  study will  improve and test a novel  fold dating method based on the dating of illite clays, determine timing of folding in the central Appalachian Mountains of the eastern United States, and demonstrate the method?s potential for other locations around the world.  In addition to the scientific goals of the project, it is providing support for  the research of a doctoral scientist and is providing  research experiences for undergraduate students, thus contributing to educational work force development in an important STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) discipline. In addition, the principal investigators research and educational outreach will be broadly distributed through professional publications and by presentations at professional meetings and public presentations. The research will also be feature in an online textbook, and will be used in class and field experiences for undergraduate students.  Illite dating also has direct application for industry and societal resource needs, as fossil fuel and mineral industries typically involve the same geologic setting and conditions that are examined in this study.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Principal investigators have recently developed a method for fold dating using argon geochronology of neocrystallized illite and tested its application in a case study of the  Mexican Fold-Thrust Belt.  The method relies on the quantification of illite in grain-size fractions of a single sample, and their respective ages; extrapolation of dated grain size fractions determines the ages of deformation and their errors.  The Appalachian Valley-and-Ridge project has two primary goals: (1) improve the illite dating method by developing better clay quantification approaches that also reduce error estimates; (2) determine fold ages in the well-known central Appalachians, where forward fold progression has been hypothesized; currently, fold ages are stratigraphically bracketed as Upper Paleozoic; (3) directly constrain the timing of regional paleomagnetic remagnetization, mineralization and economic deposits in the eastern United States.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The research focused on characterization and age of 'diagenetic' clays in deformed rocks of the frontal Appalachians and flat-lying foreland deposits of the eastern US.  The specific objectives are the timing of low-temperature mineralization and fluid sources of the central Appalachian frontal mountain range and foreland rocks.  Clays were analyzed and dated with Ar chronology and quantitative X-ray methods that were developed at U-Michigan.  Samples were also analyzed for H and O isotopes to determine the ancient fluid source from which they grew.  The age of authigenic illite in foreland rocks is 308&ndash;318 Ma, reflecting Upper Carboniferous diagenesis. Widespread clay mineralization in the foreland is slightly older than mineralization in folded rocks of the orogenic front, reflecting the delayed exhumation of deformed and thickened rocks in the orogen during the Late Paleozoic.  The fluid sources for newly-grown clays are similar in foreland and orogen, showing that surface fluids are the main source of orogenic fluids that are responsible for mineralization.  Results from the study challenge the popular hypothesis of hot, deep fluid infiltration into the foreland from the evolving Appalachian mountain belt (‘squeegee model’) as the origin of regional mineralization and associated phenomena (e.g., remagnetization).  Instead of far-traveled fluids, ample volumes of surface fluid penetrated downward in the region during orogeny, producing extensive mineral growth in the rocks.    The project supported the research of two PhD students, who have since moved into professional positions in industry, and several undergraduate students assisted in aspects of the study.
