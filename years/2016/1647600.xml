<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is that it will for the first time make it possible to create voice technologies whose performance in speech and speaker recognition does not significantly degrade due to the presence of interfering voices or environmental sounds. This issue has kept many voice technologies out of both the mobile and IoT markets. It is expected that the company's unique artificial intelligence platform will deliver a fully scalable, real-time software solution. Solving this challenge will make the currently noisy world of smartphones more realistic for voice technologies (like voice authentication) that to date have avoided the space. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project concerns a novel technology that is the result of innovatively combining advanced signal processing, broadcast studio methodologies, and artificial intelligence techniques to perform aggressive separation of voice from background voices and sounds. It also automatically repairs the biometrics of the separated voice signals on the basis of empirically formulated signal-dependent rules. The technology has already been demonstrated through informal tests to be significantly better than existing technologies in separating two-person conversations from highly overlapped background voices and sounds captured on a pair of closely spaced (few centimeters) omnidirectional microphones. This SBIR Phase I project seeks to firmly establish the clear superiority of this technology over any other existing voice separation technology. The ultimate goal of the project is to demonstrate that when the proposed technology is properly optimized as a frontend to state-of-the-art automatic speech recognition or state-of-the-art automatic speaker recognition, the recognition error rates in noisy multi-voice environments are comparable to those obtained in noiseless single-voice environments.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[Project Outcomes Report Yobe Inc.     This Phase I SBIR project succeeded in objectively and quantitatively demonstrating the practical effectiveness of Yobe Inc.?s technology for tackling the so-called "Cocktail Party Problem" in the context of speech recognition and speaker authentication. Capable of being coded for real-time operation on cell phone hardware, our unique signal processing algorithms are designed to seek and track the "DNA" of individual voices in indoor and outdoor noisy conditions.  The results of this Phase I research imply that a major bottleneck has been removed from bringing advanced voice technologies (such as speaker authentication and speech recognition) to the mobile and Internet-of-Things (IoT) markets.  As a consequence, we conservatively estimate that our solution will add $1.6 billion in revenue to the current voice technologies market.     The ability of our technology to separate voices from other voices and from environmental sounds (both directional and ambient) was tested against a large database (collected as part of this Phase I SBIR) of conversations in noisy indoor and outdoor venues. In the context of speaker authentication in noisy conditions, we demonstrated that Yobe technology helps to reduce by a factor of 10 the likelihood that the actual claimant of a voice would be rejected while still ensuring that an impostor (one who is falsely claiming the voice) has a suitably low likelihood of being accepted. This brings speaker authentication into the realm of practical effectiveness over realistically noisy channels in mobile and IoT applications.
