<AbstractNarration>The Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP) through Targeted Infusion Projects supports the development, implementation, and study of evidence-based innovative models and approaches for improving the preparation and success of HBCU undergraduate students so that they may pursue STEM graduate programs and/or careers. The project at Lincoln University seeks to create an affordable mobile application (app) that focuses on the application of mathematical concepts to biological problems. This research will develop, test, and evaluate a novel, low cost, independent app to facilitate the teaching of biology application problems and to enhance student quantitative literacy. Both the content and the app will be developed by students from underrepresented groups, with subject matter expert oversight. It is expected that this app will increase student engagement which will contribute to greater student success in performing biology application problems. This app will help students improve math competency at their own pace, and allow the professor to help them at the point where they are having difficulty. Thus, this app will improve faculty ability to address one important stumbling block that can prevent students from continuing in STEM fields. One expected benefit of wide scale use of this app is increased retention of students in STEM majors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project's overall goal is to provide students with learning opportunities to apply mathematical concepts to life science problems and to provide instructors with real time information on student learning outcomes through the development and validation of a low cost interactive math app. To achieve this goal: 1) students will be recruited to assist in development of the app, 2) student focus groups will be formed to test app content and provide feedback, 3) math and biology faculty will be recruited to develop curricular modules that incorporate the app, and 4) the app will be evaluated in three Biology courses. The features of the app, including multiple levels of difficulty, tutorials, sample problems, and feedback to students and instructors coupled with the extensive question bank, will assist in strengthening the quantitative literacy of students at a wide range of universities.</AbstractNarration>

Safford</p> <p>This project created an interactive math app that can be used on both Android and iOS platforms. The app provides tutorials, example problems, practice and test problems and feedback. Student use and performance data are available to faculty who assign the app, but students can use it as a stand-alone app to assist them in a course. App language and content was written with the assistance of mathematics and biology professors to facilitate information transfer between math and biology classes, to assist students in grasping the connection between courses. Tutorials and problem sets were created for several disciplines including basic statistics for use in both math and biology courses; common genetics problems, including monohybrid and dihybrid crosses and chi-square analyses; and physiological problems such as calculating surface area and volume ratios and the effect of animal classification and size on bioenergetic needs. Several different levels of problems were created, so students can start with the most basic applications and build on them. This design allows students to better understand the connection between more complex problems in advanced courses and basic problems introduced in introductory courses.</p> <p>Surveys showed that 80% of students would use an app if it were available. The two main reasons given were instant feedback and ease of searching for assistance with a problem as they would already be on a digital device. A majority (80%) of those surveyed indicated they preferred a mix of paper and digital problems, thus an app such as Ashmun Express would be an important tool, but not an exclusive way for students to practice and learn. When the app was initially tested in a statistics classroom, a bare majority of students (50-55%) found the app easy to use and helpful in learning statistics, primarily because a recent update of Apple?s operating system was incompatible with the coding language. The issue was repaired and the next time the app was used in the statistics classroom, a larger percentage of students (59-65%) found the app easy to load and use, and helpful in learning statistics topics. The random nature of the questions and the practice questions before the quiz were given the highest ratings (65-69%) as features that students liked.</p> <p>Part of the Intellectual Merit of this project lies in the training provided to 17 students in creating a template, problems and coding language to produce an interactive app that students found useful in their learning. From ongoing surveys, this project showed that learning tools with significant student input provided a learning environment that was well-received by other students. The broader impacts are that this app was created by underrepresented students at an HBCU and will soon be available through App stores to students around the world.</p> <p>The app continues to be updated as part of ongoing student research and will be reintroduced into classrooms post covid-19 and placed in app stores for students outside of Lincoln University to use.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 12/17/2020<br>      Modified by: Susan&nbsp;E&nbsp;Safford</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1623208/1623208_10453678_1608223387081_PracticeProblem1jpeg--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1623208/1623208_10453678_1608223387081_PracticeProblem1jpeg--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Probability Level 1 Practice Problems"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1623208/1623208_10453678_1608223387081_PracticeProblem1jpeg--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Probability Level 1 Practice Problems"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Practice problems are provided before students take a test so they can identify strengths and weaknesses and review before they take the test.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Susan Safford</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Susan&nbsp;E&nbsp;Safford</div> <div class="imageTitle">Probability Level 1 Practice Problems</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1623208/1623208_10453678_1608221796339_ScreenShot2020-05-25at10.02.45PM--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1623208/1623208_10453678_1608221796339_ScreenShot2020-05-25at10.02.45PM--rgov-800width.jpg" title="App Log in Page"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1623208/1623208_10453678_1608221796339_ScreenShot2020-05-25at10.02.45PM--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="App Log in Page"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">This is a screen shot of the log-in page to set up a new account or log-in to an existing account on Ashmun Express App</div> <div class="imageCredit">Chidera Iguwe</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Susan&nbsp;E&nbsp;Safford</div> <div class="imageTitle">App Log in Page</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1623208/1623208_10453678_1608222330517_ProbabilityTutorialjpg--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1623208/1623208_10453678_1608222330517_ProbabilityTutorialjpg--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Tutorial for Probability Level 1"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1623208/1623208_10453678_1608222330517_ProbabilityTutorialjpg--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Tutorial for Probability Level 1"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">This is a sample tutorial.
