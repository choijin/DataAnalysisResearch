<AbstractNarration>This project supports the participation of US based researchers in a conference on braid groups to be held from May 22, 2017 until May 26, 2017  at the International Centre for Mathematical Sciences (ICMS) in Edinburgh, Scotland.  Informally, braid groups encode the way that a collection of particles can move around each other in space. They were introduced by Emil Artin in the early 20th century and have since played an increasingly important role in both mathematics and physics.  New applications for them continue to be found, often in areas of research that seemingly have little connection to braid groups' humble physical origins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This conference will bring together researchers in a wide variety of fields in which braid groups play a role.  Areas of particular focus include algebraic geometry, number theory, low-dimensional topology, and geometric group theory.  Though these subjects all make use of braid groups, workers in them often are not aware of the tools used to study braid groups in other fields.  The purpose of this conference is to bring all these different people together to learn about the problems that are of interest in other subareas and to foment inter-disciplinary collaboration.  The website of the conference is&lt;br/&gt;http://www.icms.org.uk/workshop.php?id=421</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This grant supported US participation in a workshop hosted by ICMS in Edinburgh entitled "Braids in algebra, geometry, and topology".  This workshop was held May 22-26, 2017.  Braid groups play a fundamental role in many areas of mathematics and physics.  Though they have been heavily studied since the early 20th century, they continue to find new applications.  The purpose of this conference was to bring together senior and junior researchers working in the different areas touched by braid groups to exchange ideas, foment collaborations, and chart the future of the subject.  A special emphasis was made to bring together researchers who work on braids, but from such different perspectives that they typically do not attend the same conferences and thus are not exposed to each other's work.  The workshop had 54 registered participants representing a variety of different nationalities, areas of mathematics, and career stages.  Activities included 23 hour-long addresses by senior mathematicians describing state-of-the-art research, 16 five-minute "lightning talks" by junior mathematicians that allowed them to advertise their work and network with senior people, an address to the general public by Benson Farb of the University of Chicago, and a problem session.  There was also ample time set aside for less formal collaboration and discussion.            Last Modified: 08/19/2018       Submitted by: Andrew Putman]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
