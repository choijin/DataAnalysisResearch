<AbstractNarration>The principal investigator will study mathematical models of microscopic interactions in solid materials.  More specifically, the PI will study the scaling limits of such models, which capture macroscopic effects of microscopic structure.  The PI is interested in three important classes of models arising from statistical physics.  First, there are cluster growth models for corrosion of metals and crystal formation.  Second, there are models of electrical properties of randomly composited materials.  Third, there are models which lie in the intersection of the previous two categories, such as those for fluid flow in porous media.  Many unresolved questions surround these models and are now of great interest in probability theory.  The PI aims to resolve some of these questions by (1) using computer simulation to identify new phenomena and (2) applying tools from analysis, combinatorics, and probability to rigorously understand the new phenomena.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The models alluded to above share a common theme; each is a diffusion processes on the integer lattice whose scaling limit can be interpreted as the solution of a nonlinear elliptic partial differential equation (PDE).  The PI is primarily interested in three models: the Abelian sandpile, random walks in random environments, and first passage percolation.  The PI will study the interplay between the asymptotic statistics of the diffusion process and the regularity properties of the solutions of the limiting PDE.  Since the two sides here are tightly coupled, it is often possible and fruitful to transfer results between them.  The strategy will be to carefully adapt the regularity machinery of the limiting PDE to the discrete setting, since this occasionally leads to the discovery of new phenomena.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ As one often sees in the real world, small-scale disorder and randomness can give rise to large-scale smooth behavior.  For example, air and water appears to flow smoothly in spite of being comprised of tumbling collections of individual atoms.  We have all seen that sand dunes appear smooth from a distance but are quite rough when we are close enough to see the individual grains.  These types of scaling limits are everywhere in science and this project studied a small sample of such limits.     To be more specific, this project studied the macroscopic behaviour of several microscopic models from statistical physics.  This included models of fluid flow, droplet formation, and electron transport in randomly composited materials.  The five main models studied were:     1. Bressan's mixing conjectures suggests bounds on rate at which two incompressible fluids can be mixed together.  The difficulty lies in understanding the interaction between the microscopic and macroscopic scales.  2. Convex hull peeling is a model for outlier detection in data sets that behaves in a smooth way on large random inputs.  3. The Abelian sandpile is a model for self-organized criticality in physical systems that has an unexpected connection to number theory.  4. Free boundary problems on periodic backgrounds model the formation of water droplets of rough surfaces.  5. Anderson localization models the electrical behavior of amorphous solid materials whose disorder makes them semiconductors.     One of the overarching themes of this project was to use the theory of nonlinear partial differential equations to gain a better understanding of the discrete microscopic models.  One of the main techniques was to find microscopic analogues of the macroscopic principles discovered by other researchers.  In doing so, we were able to find unexpected ways of leveraging the results of past research to answer open questions and discover new phenomena.     For each of the five models mentioned above, this project produced fundamental new results.  These results either answered long-standing open problems or identified new phenomena for further exploration.  All of the results are publicly available on arxiv.org and on the principle investigators website.       Last Modified: 12/06/2018       Submitted by: Charles K Smart]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
