<AbstractNarration>In this research program, with support from the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program of the Division of Chemistry, Professor Sunghee Lee of Iona College and her undergraduate students gain greater fundamental understanding of how living cells maintain their water balance - a property that is essential to life. They use nature-inspired techniques to create tailor-made particles - these particles are cell-sized water droplets which are used as models for natural cellular systems. A large number of undergraduate students are engaged in this research and many of these students publish peer-reviewed manuscripts. Diverse outreach seminars and science symposia involving high school students and teachers are conducted to inspire and encourage the next generation of STEM educators. Professor Lee reaches out to underrepresented groups in particular. In addition to understanding the water balance in living cells, the research could also have industrial applications in the design of reverse osmosis systems used to purify water.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project focuses on understanding how supramolecular aggregates assembled at liquid-liquid interfaces (including surfactant bilayers) mediate the passage of small molecules and direct biomineralization. Systematic studies determine the effect of bilayer-incorporated materials (e.g., nanomaterials) upon the characteristics of water transport through the droplet interface bilayer (DIB). Experimental activities primarily focus on acquisition of water permeability parameters for osmotic flow in conjunction with the determination of electrical properties, and compositional studies via Raman quantification.  Experimental strategies provide insight into how bilayered supramolecular assemblies promote the crystallization of important targets (biominerals and proteins), through nucleation studies of biomineral formation.  Biomineralization is the process by which living organisms produce minerals that are often used to harden or stiffen existing tissues.</AbstractNarration>
