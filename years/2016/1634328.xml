<AbstractNarration>This award supports research to characterize the effective mechanical strength and ductility of polymer nanofiber networks for nanofilamentous materials such as gels, rubber, tissue scaffolds, cellulose products and non-wovens. Although macroscale fiber networks are quite well understood, nanofibers behave differently from their macroscale counterparts due to the coupled effect of their outstanding ductility and strength that are not observed in microscale fibers, and the relatively strong adhesion between nanofibers. These two distinguishing features lead to currently unexplored opportunities for controlling and vastly improving the effective mechanical strength and ductility of polymer nanofiber networks. Ordered and random networks of nanofilaments composed of polymeric or biological materials are omnipresent in biological tissues, tissue scaffolds, biomedical implants, electrospun air filtration systems, cellulose products, etc. Undergraduate researchers will work with the faculty and graduate students to develop web-based, interactive educational classroom modules to introduce students to the concepts of fiber networks and design.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research focuses on regular and random quasi-2D nanofiber networks with bonded and non-bonded (cohesive) interactions between polymeric nanofibers, to identify ways for constructing networks with exceptional strength and toughness. To this effect, a tightly integrated experimental/computational research program will be followed in which the mechanical response of polystyrene (PS) and polyacrylonitrile (PAN) nanofibers (100-500 nm diameter), and the strength of bonded fiber interactions and adhesive PS-PS and PAN-PAN fiber contacts will be determined using novel experiments. The data will be employed to calibrate a computational model for the network mechanics, which will account for bonded, adhesive and topological interactions of nanofibers and will be used to determine the relative importance of these interactions in the overall mechanical behavior of networks with various network architectures and parameter sets. The model will be validated based on targeted experiments performed on regular and random fiber networks, and will be applied to perform optimization of the network structure for enhanced strength and toughness.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Fiber networks are broadly used to manufacture various types of fabric-type consumer products, such as wipes, special clothing, filters, baby and personal care products, face masks, scaffolds for tissue growth and wound healing, etc. The total annual worldwide production of non-woven fiber mats and fabrics is almost 4 billion tons. Despite the widespread use of these materials, major gaps in our understanding of the relationships between their structure and their mechanical properties persist. The aim of this project was to begin addressing these issues and obtain the fundamental background by experimental and computational means, in order to enable the effective design of strong and tough non-wovens.  The intellectual merit of this project stems from the novel experimental and computational methods and tools that were developed and the understanding that was obtained through a coordinated experimental and computational effort, transcending the material systems studied herein.  In particular, this project focused on polymeric networks (mats) of nanofibers and, within them, in the way two nanofibers interact with each other, which has not studied before. As opposed to microscale fibers, the significant contribution of intermolecular forces in the case of polymeric nanofibers increases their mutual adhesion dramatically. In this project, by means of a novel class of experiments and thorough analytical modeling, we showed for the first time that when two nanofibers made of Polyacrylonitrile (a common and technologically very important polymer) are brought in contact they adhere so strongly that they have to yield (deform permanently) in order to detach from each other. It was also shown that this high adhesion could be very beneficial for fabrics and air filters synthesized from Polyacrylonitrile nanofibers because when these fabrics are stretched a lot, the fibers may slip but will stick again to each other right away in a different location thus preventing catastrophic tearing. This behavior is reminiscent of the manner spider networks hold together due to their ?stickiness? even when they are stretched by large amounts. The experimental results of the properties of polymer nanofiber junctions supported the computational modeling effort of this project, which focused on the evolution of random nanofiber networks under stretching. The computational models developed to study networks forming by laying fibers onto each other without special bonding (namely with only van der Waals interactions forming between fibers), showed that such networks are tough and can deform significantly without catastrophic brittle failure. The computational models identified the parameters of the network, such as density, bond density, fiber diameter and segment length, which control the macroscale mechanical behavior and the strength of such random networks.  The computational results facilitate the deterministic design of networks comprised of random nanofibers, and the capability to design new classes of micro and nanofiber network-based products, which is one of the broader impacts of this research. Furthermore, the computational modeling tools developed in this program were also applied to natural nanofiber networks comprised of collagen fibrils, showing excellent agreement with prior experimental data from mammalian collagenous tissues. This project has trained a diverse group of undergraduate and graduate students, and post-doctoral fellows including students from underrepresented groups in engineering and female engineers, who worked collaboratively on materials synthesis, experimental testing, and computational modeling.    Figure Caption: Force required to slide two polymer nanofibers (blue lines in inset), following stick-slip behavior. The red line is the force used to press the nanofibers together while sliding. The inset shows two micro-tools (smaller than 1 mm) which are force sensors to measure the normal and tangential forces    Figure Caption: Computational models predict how inter-fiber adhesion modifies the network behavior. As-deposited networks re-organize due to adhesion. The stress-strain curves for networks with increasing adhesion become softer and with longer linear regime, both desirable features in tissue engineering.
