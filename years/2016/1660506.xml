<AbstractNarration>Recruiting and retaining mathematics and science educators responsive to the needs of underrepresented communities is critical for the STEM pipeline. This project funded by the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship program will prepare 35 mathematics and science majors with experiences, skills, and knowledge to become highly effective inquiry-based teachers committed to working in high-need urban schools. In addition to being one of the largest teacher preparation providers in the state, Metropolitan State University of Denver (MSU Denver) serves the highest percentage of minority students in Colorado and demonstrates a strong commitment to inclusive equity. Many students at MSU Denver are first generation college students who often take multiple pathways into and through their university studies, including from partner and a neighbor institution, the Community College of Denver. Grant funding will be used as a tool for recruitment and retention of qualified junior and senior STEM majors to become secondary teachers through scholarships, guidance, and a community of support.  This Noyce project, the Inclusive STEM Teaching Preparation at an Urban Commuter University (U-STEM) effort, which builds upon work done through a Noyce Capacity Building project, will strengthen the university's science and mathematics licensure programs, and create opportunities for integrated STEM teaching and learning aligned with the needs of its K-12 and community partners. Particular emphasis will be placed on recruiting underrepresented students into STEM majors and the teaching pipeline. MSU Denver currently partners with more than 20 metropolitan area school districts; this grant will be used to expand and enhance these relationships to positively impact schools and districts throughout the extended Denver metro area. The project aims to recruit and fund at least 35 U-STEM Scholars through graduation and hiring, improve collaborations with high-need school districts in meeting STEM teacher needs, and establish an innovative induction program for U-STEM Teachers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Goals and objectives for the proposed U-STEM program include increasing the number of students recruited into and graduating from STEM licensure programs; increasing the diversity of students recruited into and graduating from STEM licensure programs; preparing Noyce Teachers to work in high-need districts; assisting districts with professional development for STEM equity; establishing an innovative induction program for Noyce Teachers serving in high-need districts; improving mentoring of in-service teachers; and creating opportunities for Noyce Teachers to further their learning through professional learning communities. U-STEM will produce at least 35 new secondary teachers with baccalaureate STEM degrees in biology, chemistry, environmental science, mathematics, or physics. Research questions align with program goals and objectives, with a focus on illuminating promising practices for supporting STEM undergraduates at an urban commuter university as they take a variety of pathways to become teachers in high-need schools. A mixed method research design will yield findings of interest for educational institutions in urban contexts, researchers aiming to diversify the teaching population, and STEM programs striving to better serve underrepresented students.</AbstractNarration>
