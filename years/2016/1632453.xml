<AbstractNarration>Attracting and training new students in linguistics is essential to meeting the nation's needs for research in language and communication. This award will provide travel support for two teams of American high school students to participate in the 14th International Linguistics Olympiad, which will take place in Mysore, India, from July 25th through July 29th, 2016. More than 100 of the world's brightest and most motivated high school students will gather for the Linguistics Olympiad. The American teams, each comprised of four students, were top finishers in the 2016 North American Computational Linguistics Olympiad (NACLO). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The International Linguistics Olympiad provides students with a hands-on experience of the scientific approach to linguistics and the documentation and analysis of language. Unlike math and science Olympiads, which focus on material that students have already mastered, linguistics Olympiads introduce new material through logic puzzles in languages unfamiliar to the students. In the course of solving a puzzle, the students can discover something about the grammar or sounds of a language, its conceptual system, its associated culture, or its historical relationship to other languages. In addition to fostering insight into human linguistic and cultural diversity, this competition fosters meta-linguistic reasoning that is essential for computer science, language technologies, and indeed any career involving analytical problem-solving skills and the ability to present a logical argument supported by data.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  The purpose of this grant was to provide travel and preparation support for the North American Computational Linguistics Olympiad (NACLO). This grant has enabled the two United States teams to participate in the annual International Linguistics Olympiad (IOL). The period covered includes two IOLs, Dublin (2017) and Prague (2018).    Currently, linguistics, computational linguistics, and language technologies are taught primarily at the graduate level and to some extent at the undergraduate level.  There has been no systematic study of foundational skills that can be introduced before college and can prepare students for college and graduate level courses.  The intellectual merit of NACLO is to identify those foundational skills and work them into a curriculum of training exercises and contest problems.   NACLO provides an opportunity for high school students to become familiar with linguistic and computational problems associated with language in an olympiad-style competition.  Students compete in the CL Olympiad by solving challenging problems using data from a variety of languages and formal systems the students have never learned previously. This year students solved a total of 17 problems. In most of these, students were given some data from a language they weren't expected to know anything about and asked to figure out something of the structure of the language.
