<AbstractNarration>This project considers changes in East African precipitation during the March to May "long rains" season, which has received less attention in the literature than the October to December "short rains".  While the short rains season has stronger interannual variability and stronger links to El Nino, the long rains have experienced a decline between the periods 1999-2009 and 1980-1998. This decadal trend in rainfall has been linked to increasing SST in the Indian Ocean, which in turn  has been attributed to anthropogenic climate change.  However, climate change simulations from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project version 3 (CMIP3) show a robust projection that East Africa will become wetter over the 21st century.  The climate processes which drive the long rains and their interannual variability are not well understood, and a  better understanding of these processes could help to determine whether the model projections are credible, and what factors lead to the dichotomy between long-term model projections and the shorter-term observed trend. The research is divided into three tasks: 1) Identifying the key features of the anomalous large- and regional-scale atmospheric and sea surface temperature (SST) patterns that are linked to observed seasonal rainfall variability and its recent decline in East Africa; 2) Employing climate model simulations and idealized climate model experiments to discern the main drivers of the observed features and changes; and 3) Identifying dynamical and thermodynamical processes in climate model projections associated with changes in long rains precipitation in East Africa during the twenty-first century in the CMIP5 experiments, contrasting results with those found in analysis of CMIP3 experiments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;East Africa is one of the most food-insecure regions of the globe, and a better understanding of the causes of drought and the likelihood of future rainfall change could play a critical role for the development of the region.  Work under this award will be highly relevant to organizations including the Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FEWSNET) and the International Federation of the Red Cross (IFRC), both of which have close ties to the PIs' home institution.  The work thus has important broader impacts in addition to its scientific merit.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This study sought to investigate the underlying physical causes of a recent rainfall decline in East Africa and to explore why climate model projections tend to make the region wetter as a result of increasing anthropogenic greenhouse gases.  In terms of the recent rainfall decline, the analysis of observational data combined with climate model experiments identified a link between the drier conditions and the cold phase of decadal variability in sea surface temperatures in the tropical Pacific.  The drying in East Africa was found to be part of a global scale pattern of rainfall changes that are fairly consistent when comparing patterns during previous cold phases of the phenomenon.  The climate model response to de-trended, global sea surface temperatures still generated drying in East Africa suggesting the importance of natural variability.  The recent drying in East Africa also appears to be more severe than during previous cold phase events in the Pacific.  Thus, anthropogenic climate change (particularly via warming of sea surface temperatures in the western equatorial Pacific) may have acted to enhance the recent drying in East Africa, with the timing of the rainfall decline (in the late 1990s) tied to a shift to colder sea surfacetemperatures in the eastern Pacific at that time.  To place climate change projections for East Africa in historical perspective, the physical drivers that shape the character of the current climate of the region were examined.  These were in turn compared to the current climate as revealed in the latest generation of coupled climate models.  The models showed several systematic biases in simulating the climate of East Africa, including an inability to properly capture the annual cycle of the region's climatological precipitation and associated changes in sea surface temperatures, particularly in the equatorial Indian Ocean.  Climate model projections for a wetter future as a result of increasing greenhouse gases were foubd to be related to the warming of sea surface temperatures in the eastern tropical Pacific and an Indian Ocean Dipole type pattern in the Indian Ocean. The latter, however, represent a tendency of the coupled models to amplify model biases in simulating the current climate, casting doubt on the reliability of current climate change projections for East Africa.
