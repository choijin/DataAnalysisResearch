<AbstractNarration>The growing ability to generate digital information and the hunger to consume that information create a need to communicate information at ever-higher rates. Free-space optical and millimeter wave wireless communication systems strive to achieve rates exceeding 100 Gbps.  Optical fiber supports terabit-per-second communications.  These systems require high-speed decoding circuits that currently sacrifice performance to meet latency requirements with available computational resources.  This research develops new techniques for high-throughput communications with a goal of achieving theoretical performance limits while meeting latency requirements with reasonable complexity.  In addition to providing a new path for practical solutions for high-throughput systems, the broader impacts of this research include the training of graduate students to support continued leadership of the United States in communications technology as well as hands-on research experiences for undergraduates to maintain the pipeline that will supply our country?s continuing need for diverse, well-trained, and innovative engineers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research explores a new paradigm in which many low-complexity decoders work in parallel, decoding variable-length codes with short average block-lengths.   Fixed-length codes with short block-lengths cannot approach the Shannon capacity, but variable-length codes with short average block-lengths do approach capacity.   Variable-length codes are traditionally implemented with feedback so that incremental redundancy is transmitted only when requested by the receiver.  This research transmits incremental redundancy without the use of feedback, utilizing techniques such as network coding and ergodicity to deliver redundancy only to those parallel decoders that need it.  The problem of delivering incremental redundancy without feedback is framed as a joint source-channel coding problem with side information at the receiver.   The primary goal of this research is to produce low complexity systems that can approach capacity at high throughput.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project successfully developed a new technique that allows communication systems to approach Shannon's limit on achievable rate (known as the channel capacity).  The practical value of this new technique is that it meets the need for low-complexity high-throughput communication, for example over optical fiber.  This is accomplished by a novel structure that approaches capacity while still allowing a highly parallel decoding architecture that feature short block-length decoders and does not require feedback from the receiver to the transmitter.   Previously, capacity has been approached by practical systems in two distinct ways:  a fixed-length code that has a long blocklength that can be used without feedback or a variable-length code with a short average blocklength that uses feedback to inform the transmitter when to terminate transmission.  The new technique uses variable-length codes with a short average blocklength, but does not require feedback because the variable length codes share a pool of incremental redundancy that is accessed through a peeling decoder.  This technique produces a single long blocklength code that can approach capacity without feedback but can be decoded with the low complexity of decoding many short variable-length codes in parallel.  These variable-length decoders have access to incremental redundancy that is produced by the peeling decoder.  This is virtually identical, from the perspective of the variable-length decoder, to having recieved the incremental redundancy in response to feedback to the transmitter.  The key papers describing the new technique overall are the 2019 Transactions on Communications paper doi:10.1109/TCOMM.2019.2919626 and the conference papers doi:10.1109/GLOCOM.2018.8647962  and doi:10.1109/ISIT.2017.8006510.  To approach capacity, the new technique requires excellent variable-length codes with short average blocklengths.  This project made significant progress in developing such codes. In particular, using serial list Viterbi decoding on a convolutional code with a cyclic redundancy check (CRC) code optimized specifically for the convolutional code provided better frame error rates than polar codes described in 5G standards documents.  See doi:978-1-7281-0962-6/19/  for details on this accomplishment.    An unexpected second list-decoding result from this project is a demonstration of how list decoding provides a low complexity maximum likelihood decoder for high-rate Bose Chaudhuri Hocquenghem codes as described in doi:978-1-7281-0962-6/19/.   These two results identify list decoding as a promising area for further research to meet the current need for new reliable codes both for the short messages that are ubiquitous in internet-of-things applications and for low-complexity maximum likelihood decoding of high-rate codes required in memory applications.  The project also developed new variable-length LDPC codes, which outperform the LDPC codes in 5G standards documents as described in doi:10.1109/TIT.2019.2895322.  For the best performacne, variable-length codes require that the transmission lengths be optimized.  This project has provided practical solutions to this important problem as described, for example , in doi:10.1109/GLOCOM.2018.8647619.  Typically a CRC is reqiured to determine when to terminate the decoding of a variable-length convolutional code.  However, we explore a low-complexity alternative in doi:10.1109/ACSSC.2018.8645539.  This project provided extensive research experiences to undergraduates.
