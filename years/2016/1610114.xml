<AbstractNarration>Non-Technical Abstract: &lt;br/&gt;This award supports experimental research aimed at understanding a newly-discovered class of materials and enabling future advanced electronic devices.  The research focuses on topological materials, called "topological"  because their properties depends primarily on the topology, or geometry, of their electronic structure.  By fabricating and measuring a series of advanced devices that integrate these topological materials with superconductors, the capabilities and limitations of this rapidly emerging field will be explored.  In addition to their possible technological applications, these unique materials can be implemented in electronic circuits to create a new type of computer platform in which the information is stored in states protected from the detrimental effects of the environment. This is a unique feature of topological devices that has the potential to extend dramatically the speed and capability of large-scale computers.  In addition to the new science and applications that may arise from this project, this research program exposes a diverse cadre of postdoctoral researchers, graduate research students, and undergraduate students to scientific issues and experimental techniques relevant to the development and applications of new materials and phenomena.  This training at the interface of materials science and device physics has been demonstrated to be highly effective in launching the careers of scientists and engineers in high technology fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Abstract: &lt;br/&gt;Exciting new phenomena have been predicted to arise in hybrid superconductor-topological insulator systems in which pair correlations induce an effective complex superconducting order parameter exhibiting chiral edge states, topologically-protected surface states, and Majorana fermions, exotic excitations that are their own antiparticles.  This project focuses on schemes to nucleate these exotic excitations and manipulate them in controllable ways to verify their existence and explore their stability and dynamics.  A series of specific experiments are designed to reveal their unique non-Abelian statistics and to develop functional approaches to image, manipulate, readout the parity that encodes their critical phase information, and braid them to perform logical operations, all critical steps toward understanding the underlying physics of these novel states and crafting a technology for quantum information processing, quantum metrology, and quantum simulation/computing. Key experiments fall into four interwoven categories: (1) mapping the location of Majorana fermions via spectroscopy and imaging, looking for the zero-energy states in the gap that are signatures of these unique states, (2) probing the dynamics of Majorana fermions by phase-sensitive Josephson interferometry, searching for the periodic current-phase relation that is a characteristic signature of the Majorana fermions states, (3) manipulating and detecting the parity of Majorana fermions, exploring ways to measuring the parity via direct measurements of specific components of the supercurrent using Josephson electronics, and (4) verifying and using the non-Abelian statistics of Majorana fermions, the most characteristic and intriguing aspect of Majorana fermion modes and the property that makes them highly attractive for quantum information processing and computing.  The field of topological physics is very new and researchers worldwide are collectively just starting to explore the materials, measurements, and theoretical concepts that will be important in achieving an understanding of Majorana fermions and how to exploit them in electronic circuits.  This project explores the key unsolved problems in this field and paths for making significant advances in understanding the nature of exotic Majorana fermions and implementing them in functional superconductor circuits.  It also provides opportunities to train students in the science and technology of this field that is anticipated to grow in the coming years.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Topological materials and devices are predicted to support exotic excitations called Majorana fermion bound states that could serve as the basis for topologically protected qubits for quantum computing.  This project focused on the development of one such system that is based on networks of lateral superconductor-topological insulator-superconductor (S-TI-S) Josephson junctions in which Majorana modes are localized at locations where the phase difference across the junctions is an odd-multiple of p, bound to the Josephson vortices.  This approach offers distinct advantages over many other topological platforms, because the Majorana fermion can be nucleated in weak magnetic fields and can be manipulated easily by applying currents to achieve braiding and fusion operations.  In terms of intellectual merit, a major focus and outcome of this project was to explore evidence for and against the existence of Majorana modes in this system.  A key result was evidence for that for the most part supports these modes and verifies some of their expected properties.  The primary signatures are:  (1) a lifting of the odd-nodes in magnetic field modulation patterns that suggest a 4p-periodic contribution to the Josephson current-phase relations, (2) discrete entry features at the magnetic fields at which the Majorana states enter the junctions, evidence for mobile localized states, and (3) the observation of switching between parity states, a direct indication of the degrees of freedom in which quantum information can be encoded.   Progress was made on more advanced experiments designed to directly image the location of Majorana states using scanning probe microscopy and to read out the parity using single-electron transistor that are sensitive to the charge state of Majorana pairs.  Significant improvements have also been made in the fabrication of S-TI-S devices and the topological insulators and their interfaces that control the performance of this device platform.  In parallel, designs were developed for circuit architectures in which the Majoranas can be braided to perform logical applications.  This work has motivated further work on this system through new funding from NSF and DOE.      In terms of broader impact, showcasing S-TI-S junctions as a promising qubit candidates by way of journal articles and dissemination in conferences has garnered significant attention.  Graduate students involved in the project have developed extensive experimental skills required to participate in the growing quantum workforce.  Concepts developed in these projects have also been integrated into advanced physics course work, such as a course on "Superconductor Devices for Quantum information Science." This work are stimulated significant investments in facilities and equipment in the Materials Research Laboratory at the University of Illinois and helped nucleate a new quantum center on the Urbana campus, the Illinois Quantum Information Science and Technology Center, that promises to grow rapidly in the coming years and to have national reach, as well as a collaboration with other Illinois research programs in the Chicago Quantum Exchange.  Scientifically, the platform proposed in this work will continue to be explored, and time will tell if it will emerges as a viable technology for achieving topologically protected qubits, a development that would greatly enhance the potential for future quantum simulation, quantum communication, and quantum computing.
