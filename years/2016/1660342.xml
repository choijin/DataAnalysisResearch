<AbstractNarration>What are the broader political consequences of former felon disenfranchisement in the communities where they reside? How does living near individuals who cannot vote affect legally enfranchised individuals? feelings of political efficacy and engagement? This RAPID investigates these questions, and associated underlying mechanisms, by adding specific questions in a Collaborative Multiracial Post-Election Survey and analyzing the results.  Current research proposes that legally enfranchised individuals who live in communities with individuals who are disenfranchised as a result of felony convictions are less likely to engage in politics and less likely to vote?through a combination of social network effects and feelings of lower political efficacy. This proposition is investigated as is the possibility that political campaigns might work to counteract these tendencies in competitive election settings. The research considers how social networks affect political participation and voting behavior and how the participation of community members and friends in politics affects feelings of political efficacy and inclinations to participate in politics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this RAPID project is to test several key theoretical mechanisms related to the community-level consequences of former felon disenfranchisement.  Placing survey questions on the Collaborative Multi-Racial Post-Election Survey (fielded in cooperation with the Latino Decisions survey project at UCLA) and subsequent statistical analysis of the collected survey data, researchers investigate key causal mechanisms including: how social networks and feelings of political efficacy relate to political participation and civic engagement, and the extent to which campaigns might be able to counteract these effects.  While most of the questions are observational, there are also specifically designed experimental treatments embedded in the survey, which will test the causal effects of electoral competitiveness and living in communities where many individuals cannot vote on feelings of political efficacy and inclinations to participate in politics.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This award produced original survey data from a nationally representative oversample of minorities in the US.  The award also produced two journal article manuscripts.  The first article, which has been submitted and received an invitation to revise and resubmit the manuscript at Perspectives on Politics, argues that African Americans who know more individuals likely disenfranchised due to a felony are they themselves less likely to participate.  We find evidence to support this argument, drawing on questions from the survey, matched to geographic data regarding severity of disenfranchisement laws where survey respondents reside. The other manuscript will be submitted to Politics Groups and Identities this winter.  This manuscript features a survey experiment we designed to show that, on average, individuals are less likely to vote, even in competitive election, when they know that many of their fellow community members cannot vote.  At the same time, we are able to show that these effects vary dramatically by race of respondent.  We have already presented this research at the 2016 annual meeting of the Midwest Political Science Association, and plan to present it at the 2017 annual meeting of the Southern Political Science Association.  This research has also been featured in Bustle, an online women?s magazine, and in the Sentencing Project?s Disenfranchisement News newsletter.
