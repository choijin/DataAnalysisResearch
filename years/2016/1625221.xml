<AbstractNarration>Dr. Chelsea P. Scott has been granted an NSF EAR Postdoctoral fellowship to carry out research and education activities at Arizona State University. The investigation will aim at improving constraints on fault slip rates estimated from both geologic and geodetic datasets. Accurate slip rates are critical to properly estimate future seismic activity in a region. Dr. Scott will use a novel approach of combining high-resolution topography and satellite radar datasets, bringing together complementary constraints on near- and far- field ground deformation. The improved understanding of fault mechanics from this study will result in better determination of fault slip rates in the geologic record and on quantified uncertainties of paleoseismic slip rates. In addition, the PI will lead workshops at the NSF-sponsored Open Topography facility, co-develop undergraduate courses at ASU, and promote computer-coding skills with high school women.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will focus on using near- and far- field constraints on the magnitude and distribution of surface strain to infer the depth variability of fault slip. The fault slip models produced with InSAR data typically suggest little fault slip in the upper several kilometers of the crust, which is at odds with the topography data. The first goal of this project is to examine the distribution of fault slip inferred from the joint inversion of InSAR and differential topography data. The second goal of the project is to examine the implications for strain accumulation over many earthquake cycles. The study will improve constraints on the relative proportions of coseismic fault slip in the seismogenic crust. The improved understanding on fault mechanics will serve as input to further work in this project that will focus on quantifying the long-term variation in along-strike coseismic fault slip and the ratio between slip at the surface and at depth over many simulated earthquake cycles.</AbstractNarration>

My research addressed the processes that control fault propagation in the shallow crust and the distribution of slip along both the main and secondary faults. I examined if the full fault slip at depth reaches the surface along the main fault or along secondary faults or stops short of the surface. These end-member behaviors are controlled by the frictional properties of the upper crust. The conclusions further our understanding of seismic hazard from the new insights into how faults work, controls of fault zone width, and the relationship between near- and far-field deformation. To measure the deformation along faults in surface rupturing earthquakes, I advanced high-resolution topographic differencing methods. These are critical to observing deformation adjacent to faults in surface rupturing earthquakes in the near-fault area where other geodetic datasets typically lack spatial resolution. &nbsp;</p> <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> <p><strong>The M7 Kumamoto, Japan, Earthquake: </strong>I applied 3D differential lidar topography methods to measure the near-field surface deformation produced by the M7 2016 Kumamoto, Japan, earthquake. I showed that 36+/- 29% of the horizontal deformation was accommodated off the main fault, and that larger amounts of off-fault deformation were concentrated in zones of complex fault geometry. The elastic strain limit was often exceeded over a 250 m width surrounding the fault. Likely, this near-fault area spatially overlaps with the compliant or weaker fault damage zone resulting from the many past M7 earthquakes along this fault. I developed new topographic differencing methodology, including a displacement error calculation and showed the error correlates with topographic relief. Ultimately, these new differencing methods facilitate measuring deformation along and adjacent to the surface rupturing faults in locations where other geodetic datasets such as Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) and Global Positioning System (GPS) cannot always resolve the deformation.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> <p>Reference: Scott, C.P, J.R.

I solved for the variable fault slip during the M7 2016 Kumamoto earthquake from a combination of differential lidar topography, satellite optical image correlation and InSAR. I showed that the maximum slip occurs at a depth of 4.5 km and propose that the missing slip in the shallow crust is accommodated as inelastic off-fault deformation. I compared these results with other published slip inversions constrained from seismic and geodetic datasets. In the latter, the slip is deeper and less localized.
