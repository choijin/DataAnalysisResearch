<AbstractNarration>1605744 / 1604369  &lt;br/&gt;PIs: Ismail, Ahmed / Bardhan, Jaydeep &lt;br/&gt;Institution: West Virginia University Research Corporation / Northeastern University&lt;br/&gt;Title: Collaborative Research: SusCHEM: Hybrid mixed-resolution solvation models for chemical processing in ionic liquids&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A major bottleneck in the quest for large-scale replacement of petroleum feedstocks with ones derived from cellulosic biomass is the difficulty posed by the physical, chemical, and biological pretreatments that are necessary for converting the native biomass into industrially-useful feedstocks. And while the mechanical and biological pretreatment routes are largely well understood, substantial uncertainty remains in how to chemically pretreat biomass to enable further processing. The goal of this collaborative project is to advance multiscale models of molecular solvation to better understand dissolution of cellulosic biomass in ionic liquids. Ionic liquids are an important class of materials, which have a broad spectrum of applications. The project will (i) apply multiscale solvent models to ionic liquids; (ii) establish the use of X-ray solution scattering experiments to validate multiscale models; (iii) apply these models to understand why small concentrations of dissolved water limit cellulose dissolution; and (iv) integrate research with education and outreach efforts to advance cross-disciplinary training and broaden STEM participation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research will elucidate the fundamental relationships between ionic liquid structure and performance, and how these relationships depend on temperature and water content. These dependencies are key to enabling the rational engineering of ionic liquids for robust performance during chemical processing in ionic liquids. The computational techniques that will be developed will link the microscopic details with macroscopic behavior using a novel multiscale approach that drastically reduces the computational costs associated with atomistic molecular dynamics and coarse-grained simulations. By reducing the number of atoms present in the system, the cost of calculating electrostatic forces, the dominant cost in molecular dynamics simulations of charged systems, will be greatly reduced, allowing for much larger and longer simulations with the same set of available computational resources. This approach will allow for much more in-depth studies of the interactions between ionic liquids and cellulose than is currently possible. The ultimate objective is the identification of the dominant criteria for selecting ionic liquids that will enable the design of more economical and more efficient chemical processes for cellulose dissolution.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>A new multiscale solvation theory incorporates the details of molecular shape and atomic interactions into a continuum model that enables prediction of thermodynamic properties with superlative accuracy and several orders of magnitude speed-up over atomistic modeling. The multiscale method solves long range electrostatics with boundary element solutions of Poisson-Boltzmann theory using a solvation-layer interface boundary condition (SLIC). SLIC incorporates the effects of solvent shape asymmetry and polarizability that can be determined unambiguously from atomistically-detailed, molecular simulation. The multiscale approach also accounts accurately for &nbsp;hydrogen bonding, London dispersons and cavity formation. For the first time experimental solvation Gibbs energy, entropy and heat capacity are predicted accurately without temperature-dependent parameters. The model has been validated with the largest dataset assembled for solutions of simple small molecules as well as ionic liquids. We demonstrated that the SLIC theory solved with the boundary element method can accurately model biological membrane deformation mechanics using explicit forcefield partial charges without having to postulate a phenomenological continuum elastic energy. The method enables the accurate simulation of square microns of phospholipid bilayers with atomistic precision in orders of magnitude less time and resource complexity than all known methods published to date. This new computational method is also developed to design antibiotic nanoparticles. Solvation theory has also been applied to provide mechanistic insights into the role of water on high strength fiber softening and to provide insights into the solubilization of novel two-dimensional polymers.</p> <p>There were several broader impacts resulting from this award. The project enabled the research of one post-doctoral scientist, three doctoral students and three undergraduate projects at Northeastern University. The COVID-19 pandemic began during the last year of this award. Instead of suspending research, PI Lustig answered the call for help from local Massachusetts hospitals that faced severe shortages of medical grade N95 respirators and procedure masks. PI Lustig teamed with the local hospital and the CEO of Joan Fabrics to design effective respirators and masks from commonly available fabrics. This diversion enabled hospitals and other institutions to create alternative, but protective equipment. Several institutions and businesses benefitted from the work on transport of aqueous aerosols containing virus-like nanoparticles to create alternative, safe personal protective equipment during the COVID pandemic. The findings and recommendations from this work were incorporated in the World Health Organization (WHO) "Mask Use in the Context of COVID-19" guidelines published December 2020.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 12/20/2020<br>      Modified by: Steven&nbsp;R&nbsp;Lustig</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1604369/1604369_10451031_1608491133655_Picture3--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1604369/1604369_10451031_1608491133655_Picture3--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Accurate predictions of Gibbs energy of solvation"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1604369/1604369_10451031_1608491133655_Picture3--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Accurate predictions of Gibbs energy of solvation"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Molecular dynamics shows increasing epistemic error in systems with strong solvent-solute interactions (right graph), wherease the SLIC/CDC model error is mainly limited by experimental aleatoric error (left graph).</div> <div class="imageCredit">Ali Mehdizadeh Rahimi & Steve Lustig</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Steven&nbsp;R&nbsp;Lustig</div> <div class="imageTitle">Accurate predictions of Gibbs energy of solvation</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1604369/1604369_10451031_1608491010034_Picture2--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1604369/1604369_10451031_1608491010034_Picture2--rgov-800width.jpg" title="The Solvation Layer Interface Condition"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1604369/1604369_10451031_1608491010034_Picture2--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="The Solvation Layer Interface Condition"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">The Surface Layer Interface Condition (SLIC) is a new boundary condition between the electric potentials of the continuum solvent and molecular solute.
