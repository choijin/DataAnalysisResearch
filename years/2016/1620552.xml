<AbstractNarration>The Faculty and Undergraduate Research Student Teams (FURST) program brings together small research groups comprised of undergraduate students and faculty from primarily undergraduate institutions (PUI) in order to provide them with a year-long research experience. The program also provides a one month long intensive summer immersion for its participants at an established summer REU site at Fresno State. FURST students get an opportunity to participate in professional workshops, presentations and academic discussions along with the REU students, whereas FURST faculty can take advantage of an on-site, in-person research collaboration with their peers within the FURST program. The program's main goal is to foster both student and faculty research at PUIs, with the specific goal of producing student and faculty authored publications, as well as presentations. The program is designed to be inclusive and accessible to teams from institutions with varying research focus and support, in order to mitigate cultural changes at institutions which may not consider research a quintessential component of higher education.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;FURST students will be working on open problems in mathematics under the guidance of their faculty mentors. Research topics include community detection problems in networks, expanding the framework and analysis of the cop and robber game, the use of coarse Ricci curvature in data analysis and interpolation problems, the study and solution of the non-linear Riccati-Ermakov equation, as well as other non-linear dispersive partial differential equations. Strengthening their background in the selected research topic through readings and lecture at their home institutions will prepare FURST students to engage in research at the same speed as the REU students during the immersion phase. Students will be expected to submit the end product of their research for publication in a peer reviewed journal. FURST faculty will engage in solving open problems in their area of research while building collaborations with faculty at other institutions. Faculty are also expected to produce publishable work as a result of participating in the program. In accordance with the stated goals, the program will improve access to research for students at PUIs, where such opportunities are typically limited. It will also (re)-energize faculty at PUIs so that they remain active in research. By doing so, FURST will help transform the research culture at the participating institutions, especially since the bulk of the research activities will take place at FURST teams' home institutions. While FURST student participants will learn skills through the program that are invaluable in graduate school and in the scientific workplace, the program will broadly impact the students at the involved PUIs by demonstrating to them (through student talks and presentations) that research can be part of the undergraduate educational experience. Finally, through the immersion in an active REU site, FURST students will gain exposure to the workings of an REU program, and will be able to make better informed choices about applying to REU as a potential next step in their academic development.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Ricci curvature is a fundamental concept in Riemannian geometry. Recently, a coarse notion of Ricci curvature has been introduced which applies to Markov chains in metric spaces, and in particular, to graphs. This notion has recently been the subject of intense scrutiny.  We resolved a conjecture by providing a formula for graph curvature in a special case of strongly regular graphs, and demonstrated that outside of this special case, a general formula is not possible. This result will be of benefit to researchers in pure math, as well as electrical engineers and computer scientists working with discrete geometric structures derived from datasets, with applications to data science and machine learning.  The main results concern curvature results for graphs with certain symmetry properties, namely, strongly regular graphs. In addition to all n vertices having the same degree d, in a strongly regular graph, it is further required that any two adjacent vertices have the same number &alpha; of common neighbours, and that any two nonadjacent vertices have the same number &beta; of common neighbours. We were able to give exact formulas for strongly regular graphs of girth 4 or 5 in terms of the parameters (n,d,&alpha;,&beta;). For girth 3, we were able to give estimates, and also to show (by example) that there is no general formula purely in terms of these parameters. (All strongly regular graphs have girth 5 or less.)       Last Modified: 08/09/2019       Submitted by: Erin Pearse]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
