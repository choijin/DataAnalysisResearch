<AbstractNarration>PI: Fisher, Jonathan&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: 1641133&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Existing monitoring methods have technological limitations, such as the inability to detect flow changes in small blood vessels, as well as practical ones, such as portability and safety issues involved in bedside monitoring. Cost is an additional limitation for current clinical diagnostics; small hospitals often do not have such capabilities. Transcranial optical techniques such as diffuse correlation spectroscopy (DCS) can provide rapid, real-time monitoring of brain activity for a fraction of the cost of other methods. The PI will evaluate diffuse correlation spectroscopy (DCS) as a noninvasive optical methods for monitoring real-time changes in cerebral blood flow. The proposed research will partner researchers, faculty and postdocs at the New York Medical College, the University of Colorado, the University of Pennsylvania, and the FDA. The proposal includes a well-designed mentoring plan to be implemented by the PI. The plan includes tracking progress through Individual Development Plans; informal discussions to assess satisfaction with the mentoring program' and tracking progress toward career goals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will provide information on the types of changes that can be interrogated using the low-resolution diffuse correlation spectroscopy (DCS) technique. Direct comparison to a high resolution technique will provide necessary information on sensitivity and specificity for DCS. The use of stimulated changes during monitoring will provide the types of necessary detail on the populations of blood vessels that can be assessed. Cerebral blood flow can be used to inform medical interventions in cases of neurological injury or disease.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project investigated the nature of signals detected by diffuse correlation spectroscopy (DCS), an emerging NIR technology that is putatively sensitive to hemodynamics in tissue microvasculature. While the technique holds promise for neurological applications, the detected light can originate from photons that have migrated far beneath the surface of the tissue. Consequently, significant regulatory questions remain regarding the sensitivity and specificity of DCS in the context of future human medical devices.  To investigate the underlying nature of the signals, we combined DCS measurements of sensory-evoked brain activity, in mice, with simultaneous, co-localized high-resolution measurements of microvascular blood flow obtained using optical coherence angiography (OCA). Combining the optical approaches enabled us to achieve the project?s specific goals, which collectively aimed to "interpret" the DCS signals by identifying the diameters and depths of blood vessels whose cerebral blood flow trends were most strongly represented in the diffuse measurements.  Regarding the DCS signal itself, we successfully performed detailed characterization of the functional cerebral blood flow signals that are evoked by sensory stimuli (Jang et al., Neurophotonics 4(4), 2017). Using novel 3D-printed miniaturized probes that permitted co-localized DCS measurements together with OCA, we were also able to obtain a high-resolution depiction of blood flow during both global physiological perturbation, induced by anesthesia concentration change, as well as more focal evoked activity, induced by somatosensory stimuli.  In terms of the broader goal of increasing diversity of training settings for young scientists, the work further provided an opportunity for a postdoctoral scientist to perform research in a hybrid government/academic context.
