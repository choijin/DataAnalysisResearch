<AbstractNarration>The ACM SIGPLAN Conference on Programming Language Design and Implementation (PLDI) is a premier forum for sharing advanced academic and industrial research focused on all areas of programming language research, including the design, implementation, theory, and efficient use of languages. PLDI emphases include innovative and creative approaches to compile-time and runtime technology, novel language designs and features, and results from implementations. The conference will be held in Santa Barbara, CA on June 13-17, 2016. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PLDI seeks to increase student participation in conference and the field. The proposed funding would support the travel of 12 eligible US students to the conference. Recipients would be able to attend the main conference, workshops, and tutorials. A special effort will be made to reach out to women and under-represented minorities. These efforts are anticipated to broaden the participation in the conference and, by extension, the research field.</AbstractNarration>
