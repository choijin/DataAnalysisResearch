<AbstractNarration>While advances in sensing, hardware and wireless communications are permitting for previously unmeasured phenomena to be observed across unprecedented scales, it is the ability to act on these data that promises to transform modern geoscientific experimentation. The importance of real-time scientific data (data that are used as soon as they are collected) is ever increasing, particularly in mission critical scenarios, where informed decisions must be made rapidly. Many of the phenomenon occurring within the geosciences can benefit from better coverage of real-time data. Geosciences phenomenon range from hurricanes and severe weather, to earthquakes, volcano eruptions and floods and real-time data are essential to understand these phenomena and predict their impacts. The National Science Foundation funds many small teams of researchers that reside at Universities whose measurements can be of benefit to a better understanding of these phenomenon in order to ultimately improve forecasts and predictions. This is where Cloud-Hosted Real-time Data Services for the Geosciences, or CHORDS, fits in.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CHORDS makes it simple for small research teams to make their real-time data available to the research community in standard formats. By following a few simple steps, a CHORDS ?portal? can be created for a research team and their data can be streamed into it very easily. CHORDS can also be used to access data from large NSF research platforms like radars, aircraft, ships and operational networks of sophisticated instrumentation. Once these data are ingested by a CHORDS portal, they are exposed in standard formats and are available to complex scientific tools such as prediction models and other analysis or decision-support systems. Since the CHORDS concept will be exposed to small research teams at Universities, this will allow college students to learn about the importance of real-time data and how to incorporate these data into their analysis. By having more and higher quality measurements available thorough CHORDS, models and other tools can make more accurate forecasts and provide better-informed decisions to mitigate the impacts and improve the understanding of these phenomenon.</AbstractNarration>
