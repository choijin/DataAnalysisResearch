<AbstractNarration>With Capacity Building funds from the NSF Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program, partners from the University of Alaska Southeast School of Education (UAS-SOE), the University of Alaska Fairbanks School of Education (UAF-SOE), the University of Alaska Anchorage College of Education (UAA-COE), the University of Alaska Fairbanks College of Natural Science &amp; Mathematics (CNSM), in collaboration with the Yukon Koyukuk School District (YKSD) and Nenana School District (high- need local Education Agency) will establish the infrastructure and collaborations that will lead to increasing the number and diversity of highly-qualified mathematics and science teachers in high-need and rural schools across Alaska. The State of Alaska has a particularly large number of very small rural schools that often have only one teacher who is responsible for all STEM subjects and across grade levels. In addition, Alaska has one of the lowest high school graduation rates and one of the lowest college-going rates. This project will serve as a catalyst and opening doors to new, sustainable partnerships and ideas in the collaborative pursuit of increasing the number and diversity of effective mathematics and science teachers who are prepared to teach in rural villages and Alaska Native communities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Project partners will develop a long-term plan for increasing the number of mathematics and science teachers who are prepared to integrate crosscutting STEM concepts in the curriculum to engage student learning. Specifically, project partners will (1) develop relationships for a collaborative approach to recruiting and preparing secondary STEM teacher candidates; (2) collect baseline data to determine interest, need, and capacity, as well as study successful practices from current Noyce projects; (3) explore effective program structures and timelines for future pre-service teachers while utilizing mathematics and science major university programs for the development of a modern, flexible, and effective pathway toward math/science teacher licensure; (4) design a framework for a multilayered, sustainable recruitment program focusing on diversity participation (Alaska Natives) in teaching of STEM; and (5) establish collaborative structures with Alaska high-need local educational agencies (LEAs) to facilitate teaching experiences, employment, and mentor training. The project will develop a model that can be adapted for other rural contexts, while reflecting the needs of stakeholders in Alaska.</AbstractNarration>

Objective 2:  Collect baseline data to determine the interest, need, and capacity for the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program Track 1 and studying successful practices from current Noyce recipients.  The development of a needs survey to determine interest, need and capacity for participating in a Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program Track 1 program was discussed.  The needs survey was only discussed and was not completed. Current Noyce programs were researched and studied.  Successful structures and recruitment options were scanned for elements that might work in Alaska.  Objective 3:  Explore course(s) of study for future Noyce scholars while utilizing existing teacher licensure program structures for the development of a modern, flexible, and effective math and science teacher preparation program that integrates STEM concepts and teaching strategies for candidates who will serve as teachers in high-needs LEAs.  Partners from the three universities in the University of Alaska system looked at current programs and coursework in the STEM areas, including secondary MAT programs at UAA and UAS, M.Ed. programs in Mathematics Education, Science Education, and Learning Design and Technology at UAS were explored to see what might be utilized in the a program.  Undergraduate programs in STEM fields were examined for structure and content.  Best practices at each of the three universities were researched with an emphasis on Alaska Native ways of knowing and engineering.  Objective 4:  Designing a framework for a multilayered, sustainable recruitment program focusing on diversity participation (Alaska Natives) in teaching of STEM.
