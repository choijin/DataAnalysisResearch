<AbstractNarration>The Gordon Research Seminar (GRS) on Genomic Instability, subtitled 'Molecular Interplay of Chromatin Organization, Replication and Repair', will be held on July 23-24, 2016 at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology and will precede the Genomic Instability Gordon Research Conference (GRC), which will run from July 24-29, 2016. The objective of the GRS is to bring together graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, from throughout the world, including members of underrepresented communities, to discuss new developments and directions on a variety of topics in Genomic Instability, including mechanisms of DNA damage signaling, replication fidelity, DNA recombination, and chromosome segregation, as well as the impact of these processes on development, aging, and disease. The GRS will include oral presentations selected from submitted abstracts, poster sessions, a keynote presentation, a session on grant writing, and a closing career panel with speakers representing academia and industry. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Participation in the GRS provides a significant training experience for young researchers, who represent the future of science in the US. The meeting is designed to promote networking, career development, and leadership skills, and as an international meeting, will expose US-based early stage researchers to new colleagues, new collaborators, and different styles of science and scholarship. This is the first offering of the GRS, although the meeting will build on the success of the first Genomic Instability GRC, held in 2014 at the same site, which attracted 158 participants from all parts of the world, including 43% from Asia, 33% from N. America, 23% from Europe and 1 participant each from Australia and Israel&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The requested funds will be used for fellowships to help defray travel and meeting costs for 8 students and post-docs. The organizers will prioritize support for underrepresented groups with NSF funds.</AbstractNarration>

Seminar Feedback  Participants had an opportunity to provide feedback at the end of the Conference. The feedback collected from the meeting was extremely positive. Evaluations included numerous positive remarks regarding how interactive the meeting was, excellent discussion periods, and great speakers.    GRC would like to thank the National Science Foundation for its continued support of the meetings.  The contributions received from the National Science Foundation have been critical to the success of the conferences and are having a measurable impact in advancing the frontiers of science worldwide.
