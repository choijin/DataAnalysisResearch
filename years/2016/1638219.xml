<AbstractNarration>How does web-based malware spread? We use the term web-based malware to describe malware that is distributed through websites, and  malicious posts in social networks. We are in an arms race against web-based malware distributors;  and as in any war, knowledge is power.  The more we know about them, the better we can defend ourselves. Our goal is to understand the dissemination of web-based malware by creating "MalScope", a suite of methods and tools that uses cutting-edge approaches to build spatiotemporal models, generators and sampling techniques for malware dissemination. From a scientific point of view, this project brings together two disciplines:  Data Mining and Network Security. The outcome is a suite of novel, sophisticated, and scalable techniques and models  that will enhance our understanding of malware dissemination at a large scale. We use two types of  web-based malware dissemination data: (1) user machines accessing dangerous sites and downloading web-based malware; and (2) Facebook users being exposed to malicious posts. We already have and will continue to obtain more data from our industry partners (e.g. Symantec's WINE project), open-access projects, or collect on our own (e.g MyPageKeeper).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of our  work is that it will  enable the development of security solutions for end-users and  industry.  A 15-minute network outage costs a 200-employee company  about $40K, while identity theft costs about $1,500 per person on average. By knowing the enemy better, security researchers and industry can more effectively stop the interconnected manifestations of Internet threats: identity theft,  the creation of botnets, and DoS attacks. The PIs have a track record of technology transfer, with collaborators at industrial labs (Yahoo, MSR, Symantec, AT&amp;T, IBM), national labs (LLNL, Sandia), open-source software ("Pegasus"), and spin-off startups (StopTheHacker). Educational impacts include developing a new course, providing publicly available educational material, and open-source software.</AbstractNarration>

The goal of the project was exactly to understand how malware is spread on the Internet, through websites and social media, and to detect malicious behavior of user on social media. The project achieved its ambitious goal as the PIs: (a) increased the fundamental understanding of how malware and malicious activities manifest and spread, and (b) developed innovative techniques and tools to detect malware and their dissemination through websites,  and to identify malicious users on social media. The project pushed the state of the art on models and tools for identifying malicious activities, achieving high detection accuracy. Some of our algorithms are used by FaceBook, and a large on-line retailer.  In terms of scientific merit, the project was able to bridge and leverage the diverse expertise of the PIs to combine computer security, network measurements, data-mining and graph-mining. As a results the models and detection techniques leverage the power of spatio-temporal data-mining with the power of graph-based techniques that capture the "social" behavior of users and have managed to achieve detection accuracy in the range of 80-90% with computationally efficient methods that can process millions of activity records.  As its key overarching contribution, the project proposes the combination of group dynamics and temporal properties in order to model and detect malicious activities in the Internet and in social media.  a.

A group of users that spread malware or push an idea on social medium can be detected by modeling their behavior as a graph of interactions and applying the appropriate graph-based detection techniques.

Lock-step temporal behavior: The project found that malicious users can be detected if we examine their behavior in time. Namely, malicious users often work in lockstep, in a very synchronized way: (eg., they all give ?thumbs up? to the same set of bad products) - and we developed algorithms to detect such lockstep behavior using state of the art mathematical tools such as belief propagation, matrix decomposition, and tensors.  c. Combining social and temporal properties for detection. A suite of tools for detecting malicious behavior: The project produced various tools for detecting malicious behavior. Our research shows how to define and extract useful features from time-weighted networks, and how to exploit and integrate network-based and intrinsic features in detecting malicious behavior. Our tool is able to overcome the problems that collective classification has in presence of uncertainty by the natural boundaries of malicious behavior.  The tangible outcome is that the techniques developed in this project will help make the Internet safer by detecting malware that infects people?s computers, and by identifying malicious users on social media.   In addition, the project trained 6 graduate students in critical data analytics and security technologies both of which are high demand areas for the US industry.
