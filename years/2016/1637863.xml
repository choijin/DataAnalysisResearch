<AbstractNarration>PI Ramasamy, Ramaraja P.    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposal No 1637863 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rapid and early detection of pathogens during food processing operations is strategic for preventing contamination, improving food safety, quality and hygiene. The proposed project would provide a near-ideal solution for this identified problem.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rapid and early detection of pathogens in food processing operations is strategic for preventing contamination, improving food safety, quality and hygiene. The proposed project will develop a near-ideal solution to this problem. A novel method for simultaneous isolation (enrichment) and detection of a foodborne pathogen, Listeria monocytogenes, from complex food matrices using bacteriophage as bio-recognition entity will be characterized. Because available antibodies for Listeria monocytogenes have poor avidity, the PI will genetically engineer bacteriophage for this specific purpose. Specific research objectives are:  (1) isolate L. monocytogenes by magnetic separation from model food matrix using recombinant A511 phage. (2) Demonstrate rapid detection of L. monocytogenes on A511 modified electrodes using AC impedance.  Education and outreach objectives are to broaden participation of women in engineering, promote diversity in STEM disciplines and provide interdisciplinary education for engineering undergraduate students. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
