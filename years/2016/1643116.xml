<AbstractNarration>Age related bone fractures are a major concern in an aging population such as in the United States. Currently, bone mineral density (BMD) is used as an indicator of fracture risk, yet it is becoming increasingly clear that is has poor predictive ability on an individual basis. It recently has been demonstrated that bone quality is variable between people in a way that is not understood medically, but which might be understood using advanced mechanics methods.  Dimensional analysis has led to the insight that there is a material lengthscale for materials that can predict fracture and fatigue damage of engineering materials.  This research project is a collaboration between an advanced mechanics laboratory and an advanced bone mechanics laboratory that will create novel analytical methods for the problem of bone failure while, at the same time, the bone fracture problem will be a new challenge for the engineering analysts.  This research will provide a biomechanical foundation for understanding a fundamental underlying feature of bone strength and fatigue resistance.  Demonstration of the existence of an intrinsic lengthscale and its dependence on intrinsic material toughness could significantly change our fundamental understanding of how microstructured biological materials function.  It also could be a seed towards developing a future bone assessment approach, which considers both bone microstructure and bone tissue properties in failure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In mechanics, dimensional analysis has led to the insight that an intrinsic lengthscale L* (a ratio of fracture toughness and strength or endurance) for a material emerges as a natural outcome of any boundary value problem of fracture and fatigue damage. When including a lengthscale in considerations of mechanical loading, the fracture/damage response becomes dependent on microstructural feature size, leading to a deterministic mechanical size effect of damage and ultimately failure.  Intrinsic lengthscales have been documented experimentally for fracture experiments of bone.  The research work will provide an early foundation for a new approach to the understanding of bone degradation and the severity of fracture risk and the degraded mechanical performance of aging bone which considers both bone microstructure and bone tissue properties in failure.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Fractures linked to osteoporosis constitute a major concern in an aging population. The amount of bone present in a subject is measured as bone mineral density. Yet to know only how much bone is present is not enough when one seeks to understand the risk of fracture. Besides the bone quantity it is necessary to know the quality of bone. The presence of small defects - what is known as microcracks - contributes to degrade the quality of bone. In this project researcher studied the formation and growth for such defects. Then they assessed the consequence of their presence in bone. This project is a collaboration between investigators at Purdue University, at the Indiana University School of Medicine and at Indiana University-Purdue University at Indianapolis.</p> <p>Researcher investigated trabecular bone. This bone is also called cancellous bone. It exists as the porous bone in the interior of long bones and in interior of vertebrae. Researchers used microscale computed 3D X-ray tomography on small bone cubes. They imaged the bone cube once. Then they soaked the bone in a solution of barium sulfate depositing the salt in the bone defects. The salt acts as a contrast agent. In a second scan the defects are thus visible. Use image processing software, researchers overlay the two images. Thereby, they determined the three-dimensional shape and location of the defects in the bone cube. They discovered the shape of microcracks to be of a saddle-shape form within the interior of the branches of the trabecular bone tissue.</p> <p>Researcher sought to understand the processes of the formation of the microcracks seen in their images. To this end, researchers used the tool of finite element analysis. Thereby, the bone structure is divided into small volumes (elements). This allows to use efficient computer algorithms for calculation of stresses on the bone tissue. With such models, researchers found that the biomechanical anisotropy of the bone tissue plays a central role. In bone tissue, anisotropy emerges from the natural growth process of bone. Bone forming cells deposit mineralized collagen fibrils on existing bone. This aligns the fibrils all parallel to the surface. Researchers this include this anisotropy in their models. Then, they can predict the correct location and shape of the microcracks. With their computer models, researchers created virtual bone conditions representative of aging. They show that in such conditions microcracks can then form from the exterior of the bone branches. Such microcracks then growth across a bone branch. Researchers compared the resistance of bone to these two types of microcracks. They found bone tissue anisotropy and interior microcracks to be a main contributor to bone fracture resilience.</p> <p>Researchers applied the new understanding of the biomechanics of microcracks to bone remodeling. They used their computer model make predictions on bone's capability to create new bone. Such a process replaces damaged bone with healthy one. Researchers used the finite element model to calculate a parameter called the osteogenic index. This number - proposed earlier by Carter and Wong - combines stress measures of volume and shape change. Researchers in this study found anisotropy to strongly affect the osteogenic index. They predicted remodeling drivers highest near interior microcracks but less for exterior microcracks.</p> <p>Researchers in this study also advanced scientific tools for bone research. This includes new computer code, sharing of bone models, and visualization of 3D images. Senior investigators mentored and trained next generation scientists in biomechanics. Results of the research have published in scientific journals. Researcher presented results at scientific conferences and to the general public.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 10/23/2019<br>      Modified by: Matthew&nbsp;R&nbsp;Allen</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1643116/1643116_10431453_1571854578771_NSF-FIG1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1643116/1643116_10431453_1571854578771_NSF-FIG1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Trabecular Bone with Microcracks"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1643116/1643116_10431453_1571854578771_NSF-FIG1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Trabecular Bone with Microcracks"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">A three dimensional composite image of microcracked trabecular bone is obtained by x-ray tomography.
