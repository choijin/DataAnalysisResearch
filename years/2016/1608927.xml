<AbstractNarration>Non-technical Description: Growing bulk crystals by freezing them from a liquid is a well-established method for making highly perfect semiconductor materials for a host of applications including electronics, and the detection or emission of light. A crystal growth process that is used to produce very small (tens to hundreds of nanometers) diameter semiconductor wires is investigated in this project. The focus is on growth of germanium-tin wires that have the potential to enable exciting devices, such as lasers that can be grown directly on silicon. The principal investigator and his graduate students are studying how unusually large concentrations of tin atoms can be frozen into these semiconductor wires as they grow. This project also integrates undergraduates in the experimental effort by involving research-experiences-for-undergraduates (REU) students in all three years of planned activities. In parallel with their research experiences, the REU students work with the principal investigator to develop simple laboratory demonstrations and presentation materials on semiconductors, light-solid interactions and crystal growth. Finally, this research effort is used as a vehicle for science outreach to low income San Francisco Bay Area high school students, through participation in Stanford RISE summer internship program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Description: This project extends to the nanoscale the study of solute trapping as a means of achieving metastably high semiconductor alloy compositions. In so doing, it exploits the large liquid supersaturations and deep subeutectic temperatures possible with vapor-liquid-solid (VLS) Ge nanowire growth. The project focusses on growth of free-standing Ge-Sn binary alloy nanowires, which are of great interest for their high carrier mobilities and the possibility of achieving a direct band gap for very efficient light absorption and emission. Research on epitaxial thin films suggests that Sn alloying of diamond cubic Ge can decrease the energy of the Gamma valley of the conduction band relative to the L valley. In practice, Sn alloying up to the predicted &gt; 6 at.% composition required to achieve a direct gap in an unstrained thin film is difficult. The equilibrium solubility limit of Sn in bulk Ge is &lt; 1 at.%. Moreover, the lattice mismatch of Ge-Sn to Ge and Si induces compressive biaxial strain in films deposited on these most useful substrates that shifts the sub-band energies in opposition to the effect of Sn addition, thus requiring even larger Sn concentrations. These considerations make clear the potential scientific and technological impact of developing methods to produce free-standing, single crystal Ge-Sn nanowires without coherency strains. A comprehensive experimental approach is used to probe solute trapping in Ge-Sn nanowires grown from either Au or Sn nanoscale catalysts, including energy dispersive spectroscopy in the transmission electron microscope, and local electrode atom probe tomography. In parallel with these studies of VLS solute trapping kinetics and mechanisms, optical probes such as photoluminescence and transient absorption are used to study the effects of Sn incorporation on alloy band structure and carrier recombination dynamics.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit:  Semiconductor materials are widely used in devices for light absorption (e.g. photodetectors) and light emission (e.g. lasers).  There are important applications for semiconductors that absorb or emit light at mid-infrared wavelengths.  However, the set of known mid-IR active materials is quite limited and these materials are almost all chemically incompatible with silicon, making them difficult to integrate with electronic circuitry.  Thin film alloys of germanium (Ge) and tin (Sn) are an exception to the rule, and they have been increasingly studied for mid-IR optoelectronic devices.  The major challenges for using Ge-Sn alloys in such devices are the need to produce thin films with tin composition exceeding 10 atomic % in order to achieve the most efficient light emission and absorption properties, while minimizing the crystalline defects and mechanical strain in Ge-Sn films that would compromise their performance.  In this project, we demonstrated that deposition of Ge-Sn thin films around small (~ 50 nm) diameter nanowires (see attached image) could be synthesized so that they are nearly strain-free and had no crystalline defects (dislocations).  Furthermore, by investigating the details of the chemical vapor deposition process used to grow the Ge-Sn films, we were able to achieve uniform growth of alloy films have tin content greater than 10 at%.  We were able to observe strong mid-IR light emission at wavelengths exceeding 2 &mu;m from single nanowires that are approximately 200 nm in diameter and 3 &mu;m in length.  These nanowires can be grown in ordered arrays on silicon wafers, opening up a new route to integration of efficient Ge-Sn mid-IR active materials with silicon electronic circuitry.       Broader Impacts:  The students and postdoc involved in this project have gained knowledge and access to a wide range of fabrication and characterization tools important for making and evaluating optoelectronic materials and devices. They have had numerous opportunities during this project for professional development including attendance of and presentations at local, national and international conferences.  The project has supported the research of three Ph.D. students and one postdoctoral scholar (female), Dr. Siying Peng.  The project has also supported research by a female M.S. student, and by two undergraduates (one of them female).  The PI has used results from this research project to develop new lecture materials for courses.  For example, results on semiconductor nanowire nucleation and growth were used as examples and problems in the PI?s core Materials Science and Engineering graduate course, MatSci 207 Rate Processes.  Finally, research support provided by the project permitted our group to host two visiting graduate students from Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne in Switzerland, who performed portions of their thesis research under the PI's supervision.  This ongoing international collaboration with their EPFL advisor, Prof. Anna Fontcuberta-i-Morral, also led to a major new article reviewing, for a broad scientific audience, semiconductor nanowire fabrication methods and the fundamental materials science and technology they can enable.
