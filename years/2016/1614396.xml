<AbstractNarration>In plants, water is transported from the soil through a complex network of conduits from roots to trunks, branches and leaves. As soils dry, water columns in the plant can break, resulting in a reduced water transport capacity and eventual death if the dry conditions persist, as with drought. We know that the physical characteristics of the pores, which link adjacent water transport conduits in trees, relate to drought tolerance in roots, trunks and branches, but little research has focused on these pores in leaves, despite their being the gateway to plant photosynthesis and therefore overall growth and survival. In this project, the Fellow will work with Dr. Brendan Choat ? an expert in plant water transport at the Hawkesbury Institute for the Environment at Western Sydney University, Australia ? to measure these interconnecting pores in leaves of three economically vital evergreen tree species using laser-based and electron-based high resolution imaging systems.  Analyzing the anatomical structure of the pores will increase foundational knowledge and help to enhance accuracy of drought-induced forest dieback predictions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although leaves are the gateways of overall plant growth and productivity, their hydraulic function has been studied much less than other plant organs. Research has shown that there is a correlation between bordered pit/torus-margo morphology and drought resistance in roots, stems and branches, but these structures remain largely unquantified in leaf xylem.  In this project, the Fellow will work with Dr. Brendan Choat ? an expert in plant hydraulics at the Hawkesbury Institute for the Environment at Western Sydney University, Australia ? to image and quantify numerous aspects of pit and torus-margo morphology in leaf tracheids and transfusion tracheids in three economically vital conifer species using confocal laser scanning microscopy and electron scanning microscopy.  Anatomical characteristics are necessary components of leaf and soil-plant-atmosphere models; understanding bordered pit morphology may contribute to enhanced predictions of altered plant function and species distributions under changing climate regimes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award under the East Asia and Pacific Summer Institutes program supports summer research by a U.S. graduate student and is jointly funded by NSF and the Australia Academy of Science.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Anatomical characteristics are a necessary component for inclusion into leaf and whole plant hydraulics models, ultimately resulting in models capable of predicting altered plant function and species distributions under changing climate regimes. In addition to broad climate change implications, this field of study is highly relevant both socially and economically in regards to forest productivity and output yields in light of increasing global demand for timber, wood products, fiber, biofuels, and ecosystem and aesthetic benefits. Knowledge of the foundation for hydraulic functioning and drought resistance in plants would contribute to the success of tree improvement programs and drought-induced forest diebacks predictions.    Leaves are the hydraulic gateways of plant functioning and thus plant productivity, and yet relatively little in known in regards to leaf water transport cells, especially the interconnective holes, or pits, which connect adjacent cells, ultimately resulting in a complex water transport network. Research has shown that these pits are a critical component hydraulic functioning in roots, trunks and branches, but are currently an unknown component in the hydraulic functioning of leaves.  The results indicated that the interconnective pits may be different from other parts of the plant, even within a single individual tree.  Leaf pits may be hydraulic bottlenecks that limit maximum leaf hydraulic capacities and entire plant water conductivity.   The discovery raises some interesting questions regarding selective pressures and potential fitness tradeoffs associated with these pit pores in leaves as well as how prolific these types of pits are in leaves of other genera of woody plants.
