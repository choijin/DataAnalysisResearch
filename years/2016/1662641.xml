<AbstractNarration>Soft robotics is a rapidly growing field in which soft materials, such as polymers, are formed into devices whose mechanical response can be triggered by physical or chemical stimuli. Magnetically responsive polymer composites containing embedded magnetic particles are especially attractive for soft robotics, because they allow for non-contact actuation with electromagnets or permanent magnets. Furthermore, chaining the magnetic particles within the polymer imparts an enhanced, directional response. This award supports fundamental experimental and theoretical research to investigate the processing and performance of chained magnetic particle composites for soft robotics. Soft robotic devices based on chained magnetic particle composites developed in this research will be immediately useful in practical applications, including non-contact peristaltic pumps and remotely actuated microfluidic valves and mixers for next-generation medical diagnostic devices. Theoretical tools developed in this research will also drive innovation by providing easily accessible metrics to inform the design and evaluate the performance of chained magnetic particle actuators. Themes and results from this research will be integrated into education and outreach activities designed to inspire and recruit the next generation of scientists and engineers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While there have been many reports of magnetoactive elastomers for soft robotics, the design of these materials is usually empirical rather than guided by a predictive model, resulting in missed opportunities to optimize their design and performance, such as with chained-particle formulations. This research aims to develop a framework and figures of merit for predicting the behavior of magnetoactive elastomer actuators and to employ them for designing useful devices with enhanced capabilities. Using these tools, the torque in chained-particle magnetoactive elastomers generated in applied magnetic fields will be maximized, elasticity of the polymer and elastic instabilities will be incorporated in device function, and shape memory polymers will enable realization of magnetoactive elastomer materials and devices that are reconfigurable and selectively addressable. This research will advance the field of chained-particle magnetoactive elastomers by developing tools to guide their design for applications in soft robotics and by demonstrating the capabilities of these materials and devices.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ "Soft" robots are emerging as a new class of machines that can flex and deform in ways that have been inaccessible to traditional robotics. These new motions can augment the capabilities of current devices &ndash; softer grasping to pick out blueberries in a production line; deformable bodies to wriggle through tight spaces &ndash; or they may lead to new capabilities yet to be imagined.  Materials for soft robotic elements are generally composed of pliable polymers rather than rigid metals. Some of these polymers include embedded magnetic particles, which could enable remote control of a robotic device with magnetic fields. Other materials include shape-memory effects, which allow materials to be repeatedly deformed, locked into new configurations, and returned to the initial state.  In this work, we recognized the potential for enhancing magnetic control of soft-robotic materials by organizing the embedded magnetic particles into ordered chains within the polymer; these chains boost magnetic torques and enable new modes of actuation. In addition, we combined the chained-particle architecture with a shape-memory polymer, which ultimately resulted in a multifunctional smart material that could perform a range of programmable behaviors.  Over the course of the project, we demonstrated a series of prototypical soft-robotic elements, including flexible lifter devices that use magnetic torque to bend against a load; elastic snapping devices that store or release elastic energy upon magnetic stimulation; accordion-folded structures which either contract, like muscle tissue, or extend; and large arrays of hair-like cilia structures that lay flat or stand erect as directed.  Each of these devices incorporated a shape-memory polymer which softens when heated. Since heating could be accomplished with an infrared light source, which is strongly absorbed by the magnetic particles, portions of devices could be selectively softened to actuate upon magnetic stimulation, and all devices could be locked, by cooling, into any configuration, held for an arbitrary time, and then released with heat back to an initial configuration.
