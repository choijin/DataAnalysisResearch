<AbstractNarration>The violent star explosions, known as supernovae, are responsible for&lt;br/&gt;many features of our Universe.  They produce and distribute many of&lt;br/&gt;the heavy elements that make up stars, new planets, and also people.&lt;br/&gt;The energy supernovae release into the interstellar gas heats and stirs it,&lt;br/&gt;and some of that energy goes to accelerating a few subatomic particles&lt;br/&gt;to extreme energies -- the enigmatic cosmic rays that fill our Galaxy&lt;br/&gt;and constantly rain down on the Earth.  In the last few thousand years,&lt;br/&gt;several Galactic supernovae were visible at Earth and carefully&lt;br/&gt;recorded by naked-eye observers. The remnants of those supernovae,&lt;br/&gt;expanding gas clouds emitting radio waves, X-rays, and visible light,&lt;br/&gt;can now be studied in detail, along with hundreds of older remnants&lt;br/&gt;from supernovae too distant to be seen on Earth with the naked&lt;br/&gt;eye. This proposal will model the effects of supernovae that occur in &lt;br/&gt;systems with two stars gravitationally bound to each other. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recent evidence suggests that many supernovae originate in binary systems, &lt;br/&gt;pairs of stars orbiting one another.  The more massive stars shed material as they &lt;br/&gt;age, particularly in the stages just prior to explosion, so the explosions &lt;br/&gt;take place in a complicated environment of gas.  These investigators will compute&lt;br/&gt;state-of-the-art simulations of pre-supernova environments, and then model&lt;br/&gt;the explosion, to see what effects it has on the appearance of the supernovae &lt;br/&gt;at the time of the event, and on the remnants of the events, which are still&lt;br/&gt;thousands of years later.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigators hope to identify particular features that such supernovae&lt;br/&gt;and remnants might show that would be clues to the environments that&lt;br/&gt;gave rise to them.  In addition, a few particular objects, such as&lt;br/&gt;historical remnants from supernovae seen at Earth in the last few&lt;br/&gt;hundred years, will be studied, to try to identify the types of stars that &lt;br/&gt;created the explosions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigators will use high-performance computing systems at national &lt;br/&gt;facilities, and will train students in the most up-to-date applications of &lt;br/&gt;computing to complex problems.  Improving our understanding of supernovae adds an&lt;br/&gt;essential piece to the grand narrative of the nature of our Universe&lt;br/&gt;and the place of humanity in it.</AbstractNarration>

Comparison of our simulations with observed events can lead to better understanding of the nature of the stellar explosions.  Our calculations required sophisticated numerical techniques and supercomputer resources to simulate the surprisingly complex gas flows in the vicinity of the two stars.

Further away from the stars than several times their separation, the flows are well described as disks, with the pole-to-equator density ratio and the angle containing half the mass as simple classifiers.  These simulation results represent the first of our two goals for this project.  Calculating their consequences for the appearance of the supernova and its eventual remnant is our second goal.  We created a modeling code that can use these simulation results as input to calculate the "light echos" from the initial burst of supernova light, as it passes through the disk, destroying dust grains near the stars and heating dust at larger distances, producing a variable infrared signal which can last for months.  The predictions can be compared with observations.  We also developed a calculational framework to predict the radio signal from the supernova shock wave traversing the disk.  Preliminary results have been obtained.  Predictions for the much later appearance of the supernova remnant should be forthcoming soon.  We expect our work to have impact beyond the community of researchers performing similar calculations.  We expect that the framework we have developed to calculate the distribution of stellar-wind material in binary star systems, and its effect on the eventual supernova explosion of one of the stars, will be applicable to many observed events, and will be an important tool for the observational community to use in interpreting future supernova detections.  Our calculated distributions of circumstellar material will be made available to other researchers as input to other types of theoretical calculation, as well.

We are proud of our contribution to the development of a sophisticated national scientific workforce.  In general, we hope to have contributed to the growing understanding of supernovae, whose effects have shaped the nature of the Universe we live in.
