<AbstractNarration>This award provides funding to help defray the expenses of participants in the conference "SEAM 2016: The 32nd Southeastern Analysis Meeting" that will be held March 13-15, 2016, on the campus of the University of South Florida.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This event is the latest installment in a thirty-one-year-long series of conferences covering a wide spectrum of subareas of analysis. In particular, SEAM has become the leading conference venue in the U.S. for function-theoretic operator theory. SEAM 2016 will again span a broad swath of analysis, featuring three plenary speakers who will address topics in complex analysis (Stephen Gardiner), harmonic analysis (Alexander Volber), and approximation theory (Doron Lubinsky). A highlight of the meeting will be invited talks by five junior mathematicians: Tom Alberts, Kelly Bickel, Greg Knese, Shahaf Nitzan, and James Pascoe. The conference program provides ample opportunity for graduate students, postdocs, and other young scientists to present their work.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  The 32nd Southeastern Analysis Meeting (SEAM 2016) was a successful scientific event, a meeting of young and experienced researchers from the Americas, Europe, and Asia (China, India, the Middle East).  The invited lectures delivered by eminent speakers or by younger (but already well-known enough) researchers have been exemplar model of mathematical research for the graduate student and postdoc participants of SEAM 2016. Undoubtedly, the meeting generated not only many new research ideas but also future collaborations between the participants. The invited talks of our four junior level researchers (one of them, a female) have been significant for their careers and for wider spreading of their interesting and important works.  Many graduate students, postdocs, and other participants had chances to present their own research in the meeting. Such talks usually have generated productive discussions, which have been helpful for the speakers in particular. As a result, the young speakers have been gaining new ideas and perspectives related to their work.   In addition to the core traditional topics usually discussed at SEAM conferences, the SEAM 2016 talks included a series of talks related to applications of mathematics, which has been quite interesting and refreshing also for the participants who normally have been following "pure theoretical" lines in their research.
