<AbstractNarration>This project will allow the PI and co-PIs to acquire a powerful small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) instrument equipped with a collection of in situ sample stages that will accelerate and enhance a broad range of research activities in priority areas at the University of Texas at Austin (UT Austin) with an impact on advanced manufacturing, clean energy, and bioscience for human health. The new instrument will be incorporated into the existing user facility infrastructure at UT Austin, ensuring its availability to a diverse user base. In particular, the instrument to be acquired substitutes and in some ways exceeds the capabilities of remote facilities, allowing more materials characterization research to be carried out on campus without requiring students to travel. As such, the diverse undergraduate student population of UT Austin, who are very active in research, will be exposed to state-of-the-art X-ray scattering methods as a result of the acquisition. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI will acquire a SAXSLAB Ganesha 300XL+ system featuring a high brilliance microfocus X-ray source, scatterless slits, and a high dynamic range Pilatus 300k detector. These specifications will bring to UT Austin the ability to interrogate low-contrast samples such as block copolymers and bio-molecular assemblies; studies that have previously been confined to synchrotron-based investigations. Besides readily exchangeable sample stages for quantitative scattering on solutions, bulk samples, and thin films (including grazing incidence), the instrument features a number of in situ stages to enable investigation of dynamic evolution of mesoscale structures. These capabilities in a user-accessible, campus-based instrument are ideally suited for investigating structural evolution in biological environments, informing design of adaptive materials systems, developing effective materials processing strategies, and diagnosing materials degradation pathways. Currently, researchers at UT Austin fulfill a majority of their need for SAXS by traveling to synchrotron facilities, though none are located nearby. The existing SAXS instrument at UT Austin predates modern advances in bench top X-ray instrumentation from the source to the detector. A modern instrument, well-equipped for both routine and sophisticated in situ experiments, will have an immediate and major impact on research activities at UT Austin.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The SAXSLab Ganesha small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) instrument was acquired and installed in the second project year. Complete with its suite of in situ accessories, the instrument is now a regular part of the Texas Materials Institute (TMI) user facility, where on-going training and operation is supported by TMI staff member, Dr. Steve Swinnea. Three student super users were trained directly by the manufacturer to facilitate the use for their own research and enable them to assist with training and development of standard operating procedures. This first generation of super users are now approaching their graduation and new students are being trained to take over those responsibilities. In all there are 30 trained student and staff users of the instrument associated with the research groups of 12 faculty principal investigators, including one faculty from outside of the University of Texas at Austin. The instrument is used, averaging 196 active operating hours per month for the last year. Although the instrument was not fully installed until late in the second project year, there are already 8 peer-reviewed publications making use of the instrument and acknowledging the MRI grant. The instrument is regularly used for both solution-phase samples in capillaries (transmission mode) and thin film samples (transmission or grazing incidence). In addition, the automatic changes in detector distance has allowed users to easily collect data over a range of q to fully analyze microscale structure. This capability has proved useful for solution-based assemblies of colloidal nanocrystals, for example, where the low q range is relevant for the long-range organization and the higher q range for the short-range packing arrangements of the nanocrystals.
