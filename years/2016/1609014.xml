<AbstractNarration>This action funds an NSF National Plant Genome Initiative Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology for FY 2015. The fellowship supports a research and training plan in a host laboratory for the Fellow who also presents a plan to broaden participation in biology. The title of the research and training plan for this fellowship to Mallorie Taylor-Teeples is "The Role of Protein Degradation in Plant Growth Patterning" The host institution for the fellowship is the University of Washington and the sponsoring scientist is Dr. Jennifer Nemhauser.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Increasing crop yield is essential to meet the rising demand for food, feed and fuel. One major area for improvement is the manipulation of plant architecture. The patterning of flowers along the shoot (phyllotaxy) determines the positioning of grain or fruit along a stem. A key player in the process of phyllotaxy is the plant hormone auxin. Recent research in the Nemhauser Lab has found that phyllotactic patterning in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana can be altered by changing one protein in the auxin response pathway. This project aims to test whether these findings can be applied to multiple plant species. If successful, this work will pilot a pipeline for rapid engineering of desirable agronomic traits into diverse crops with limited genomic infrastructure. Research findings will be disseminated through publications and presentations at scientific conferences. Public outreach will include workshops with high school and middle school students to facilitate understanding of basic biological concepts surrounding plant biology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Evolution has given rise to a staggering diversity of body plans. Effective methods for altering the patterning of organ emergence around the shoot are of agronomic interest, as phyllotactic patterning affects light harvesting capacity and determines the density of grain or fruit along a stem. Through the novel application of plant synthetic biology tools, the Nemhauser Lab has found that phyllotactic patterning can be altered by re-programming degradation rates of IAA28, an auxin repressor protein. Auxin-mediated degradation of repressive Aux/IAA substrate proteins via the E3-ubiquitin ligase pathway induces auxin-mediated transcriptional responses. BARREN INFLORESCENCE 4, a putative ortholog of IAA28 in Zea mays, also plays a role in phyllotaxy, suggesting that that the diversity in natural phyllotactic patterns across plant species can be explained in part by variation in auxin repressors. This project focuses on the readily tune-able parameter of auxin-induced degradation rate as a potential mechanism to precision engineer new body plans. These studies will be performed in parallel in three plants: Arabidopsis thaliana, Zea mays and Brassica rapa.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In plants, body shape is largely determined by the arrangement of leaves or flowers around a plant stem, known as phyllotaxy. How these phyllotactic patterns arise has intrigued biologists and mathematicians for over a hundred years. Being able to precisely manipulate phyllotaxy is important for crop improvement. Control of when and where on the stem new flowers arise ultimately determines the positioning of grain or fruit, affecting plant architecture, a critical factor for yield.  The small, widely-used model plant Arabidopsis thaliana exhibits spiral phyllotaxy, with each floral organ arising approximately 137 degrees apart from the previous bud. While outwardly very different, the flowering stem of Arabidopsis is developmentally equivalent to maize ears and tassels.    Auxin is vital for proper floral organ spacing.

New flowers initiate at regions of high auxin concentration. These auxin maxima act as sinks, depleting the surrounding cells of auxin. This prevents new organs from forming adjacent to one another, and ultimately determines the phyllotaxy. The mechanism that drives the dynamic formation of this pattern of auxin accumulation and depletion has been extensively modeled mathematically, but the underlying genetic pathway is still poorly understood. Changing the dynamics of the auxin signaling pathway increases irregular angles between organs, or phyllotactic "noise" (Moss et al., 2015; unpublished data by Taylor-Teeples et al.). By manipulating individual components of the auxin pathway, we can start to perturb the patterns of auxin accumulation and depletion and unravel the role of auxin signaling and transport in this fascinating developmental program. The phyllotactic patterns of Arabidopsis plants expressing a wild-type, slow degrading, or stabilized version of the repressive substrate protein IAA28 were quantified by measuring the divergence angles between successive seed pods on the inflorescence stem. As the IAA28 degradation rate decreases, there is a significant increase in phyllotactic noise. We wondered whether the degradation rate of IAA28 would be altered in plants with opposite, rather than spiral, phyllotaxy. To this end, auxin induced-degradation dynamics of IAA28, as well as homologs from Zea mays, Brassica rapa, and Brachypodium distachyon were measured. Despite the different inflorescence architecture of Brachypodium (opposite) compared to the other plant species (spiral), these homologs display remarkably similar degradation dynamics. Changes in IAA28 degradation rate are therefore not likely to be responsible for developmental differences in inflorescence phyllotaxy. We also discovered that meristems that arise first exhibit less noise than those arising later. Why this occurs is currently unknown, but we hypothesize that differences in auxin transport between primary and secondary meristems could play a role. Flux and polarization of active auxin transport is known to help set up and stabilize spatiotemporal patterns of gene expression, cell division, and growth. We are therefore further exploring this hypothesis by using a set of synthetic promoters driving an auxin transport protein to engineer plants with increased auxin flux.  Thus, while still ongoing, this work has furthered our understanding of the complex role auxin plays in phyllotaxis and has expanded out into new questions about this facinating process.
