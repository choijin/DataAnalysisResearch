<AbstractNarration>The understanding of basic ligand-metal interactions translates to the development of new catalysts to promote important and challenging chemical transformations using relatively simple precursors.  Although the 1,2,3-triazole ring system was introduced to the chemical community via "click-chemistry," with numerous applications applied to chemical, biological and materials research, most of the reported efforts focused on the application of this efficient linking strategy to bring functional groups in close proximity.  In contrast, little is known about the fundamental reactivity of TAs upon interaction with catalytic metals.  This grant will develop an extensive set of catalysts based upon such interaction.  This project is also integrated into an outreach program to introduce undergraduate students from the state of West Virginia to advanced organic synthesis and catalysis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Through this award, funded by the Chemical Synthesis Program (SYN) of the Division of Chemistry, Prof. X. Shi from the West Virginia University investigates the coordination ability of 1,2,3-triazoles (TAs) toward transition metal cations.  With the ability to prepare various TA-derivatives, Prof. Shi's lab has studied TA-coordination with various transition metal cations over the last five years, with novel TA complexes obtained with excellent stability and striking reactivity.  These discoveries have challenged the assumption that TAs are poor ligands.  In this project, new TA-complexes are being synthesized and investigated, both for fundamental reasons and for industrial applications (new catalyst design).  These systems include triazole-Au-catalyzed alkyne activation and triazole-directed C-H activation.  &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

Scientific accomplishment under research goals:  1)   Systematically studied triazole coordination with gold cation and developed Lewis acid activation strategy for triazole-gold activation as a fundamentally novel approach to achieve more reactive gold catalyst with improved catalyst stability;  2)   Applying the novel triazole gold catalytic system developed in this project for several challenging transfromations, including A) intermolecular enole addition to alkyne; B) vinyl sulfone synthesis; C) intramolecular hydroboration; D) intermolecular cascade homopropargyl alcohol addition to alkyne for the synthesis of electron rich diene; E) azaborine synthesis.  3)   Discovering gold-diazonium reaction with base promoter and initiated new approach for gold redox catalysis;  4)   Initiated triazole-reaction mechanism investigation and discovered the coordination mechanism for TA-Au catalysis;  5)   Investigated triazole directed metal catalyzed C-H activation.  We identified several new C-H activation strategies with triazole derivatives as directing group using Pd, Ni and Co metal cations.        In addition, besides the basic coordination chemistry, findings from these investigations could also help new catalyst development and new synthetic methodology for complex compound preparation. This information will greatly benefit chemical, material and bio medicinal research.  Meanwhile, having undergraduate students working on STEM related projects will have the society to encourage more students working in the field as their potential future career consideration.  This is important since the society is clearly running shortage of STEM oriented work force.             Last Modified: 10/19/2018       Submitted by: Xiaodong Shi]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
