<AbstractNarration>The goal of this project is to promote informal STEM education in polar research through a novel interactive learning display that uses virtual and augmented reality technology. A new display system will be developed that combines the successful techniques of touch-enabled tabletop displays with new low-cost, head-mounted display technology to deliver an immersive 3D learning experience for the IceCube Neutrino Detection system located at the South Pole. The system will provide new means for engaging the public in learning about the IceCube Neutrino Dectection system and the challenges of Antarctic research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposal relies on collaboration between three groups on the University of Wisconsin- Madison campus, including the Living Environments Laboratory (LEL), the Wisconsin IceCube Particle Astrophysics Center (WIPAC), and the Games Learning Society (GLS). Once developed, the display system will be installed at the Wisconsin Institutes for Discovery Town Center, a public space that attracts close to 50,000 people per year. This proposal was submitted as an Exploratory Pathways proposal, meaning that it represents a chance to establish the basis for future research, design, and development of innovations or approaches. Outcomes from this project will inform the PIs of how best to extend the system to add more 3D environments for other research locations in Antarctica. The system will be implemented in an extensible fashion so that a user can select from one of several Antarctic research station locations, not just IceCube, from the main menu of the system and suddenly be immersed in a 3D world that seeks to teach users about polar research at that location. Contents of the interactive learning display will be translated into Spanish, and users will be able to choose which language they want to use. Evaluations of the system will also inform designers about how these museum-type systems impact learning outcomes for the general public.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project was submitted to the Advancing Informal STEM Learning (AISL) program, but will be funded by the Division of Polar Programs. AISL seeks to advance new approaches to, and evidence-based understanding of, the design and development of STEM learning in informal environments. This includes providing multiple pathways for broadening access to and engagement in STEM learning experiences, advancing innovative research on and assessment of STEM learning in informal environments, and developing understandings of deeper learning by participants.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The goal of this project was to utilize novel technologies (virtual reality and multi-touch displays) to promote new forms of informal learning. Many concepts in astrophysics research can be difficult for a lay individual to understand or to comprehend their importance, such as the IceCube Neutrino Observatory, which detects high-energy neutrinos at the South Pole in Antarctica. The observatory uses information from detected neutrinos originating deep in outer space to better understand astrophysical phenomena like black holes or exploding stars. Unfortunately, it is often difficult for the public to understand how these pieces fit together towards creating a more complete understanding of our universe.&nbsp;</p> <p>Recent advances in low-cost virtual reality (VR) technology have enable new directions in informal teaching and learning. In the recent past, head mounted display (HMD) technology cost upwards of twenty thousand dollars, while today the same hardware costs a fraction as much. This cost reduction has made it much easier for informal learning centers such as libraries and museums to adopt HMD VR technology and the challenges for these informal learning centers have shifted from procuring hardware to the development of educational content.</p> <p>In means of creating a novel point of engagement around the targeted learning concepts, two interactive exhibits were created, one incorporating a large multi-touch table and the other utilizing a virtual reality experience on a head mounted display. The team installed these exhibits in the publicly accessible Town Center, located in the Discovery Building on the University of Wisconsin - Madison campus. Over a three and a half month time-period the exhibits were studied for their ability to provide informal learning outcomes.&nbsp;</p> <p>The touch table exhibit was designed as a fast-paced puzzle game in which the player takes the role of a scientist whose goal is to determine the direction of neutrino events as they propagate through the IceCube array. The game represents the neutrino events through a visualization method used by actual IceCube scientists. When the events appear within the array, the player must use the visualization to determine the direction that the neutrino is traveling. If the indicated direction is within the target accuracy, the source of that neutrino event is discovered from eight possible cosmic phenomena known to produce neutrinos, such as blazars, quasars, or black holes. After sixty seconds the game shows a summary screen of detected sources and descriptions of each cosmic phenomena.&nbsp;</p> <p>The VR exhibit takes users on an immersive experience from the IceCube lab at the South Pole through four different levels of outer space, ending in deep space where they are face-to-face with a black hole. Progress in the VR scenario occurs via gaze-based navigation where the user follows the directions provided by a narrator. The exhibit provides both audio cues and captions for all presented narration. At the beginning of the scenario the user performs orienting tasks, such as looking at targets within the environment, and receives introductory information. The user starts their journey at the IceCube station, observing the detection of neutrino event. From this, the user can follow the path of the event, warping themselves through a portal out into the solar system. Users can switch from visible light, x-ray, or neutrino vision to explore the world around them. Successful gameplay sessions result in the user completing their mission and returning back to earth.</p> <p>The exhibits were evaluated both formally and informally around their effectiveness of providing STEM learning opportunities. The evaluations showed that both exhibits increased basic understanding of neutrinos and IceCube. While VR participants showed a greater increase in basic understanding compared to the tabletop exhibit, both exhibits demonstrated the ability to spark the curiosity of participants. While learning outcomes were different between genders, gender played no role in the exhibit's ability to spark curiosity.&nbsp;</p> <p>Over the span of the project, the publicly accessible exhibits were experienced over 10,000 times. As the team gathered user feedback, features and improvements were added to make the exhibits more accessible. These included adding closed captioning for the hearing impared, alternative voiceover translations for Spanish and Portuguese and interactive tutorials to aid in orientating the user. In means reaching a larger audience, deployable versions of these exhibits were created for tablets and portable VR devices. These deployable versions were shown at several worldwide events and conferences including the World Science Festival, the American Geophysical Union Meeting, the Council of Managers of National Antarctic Program and South by Southwest. Finally, free downloadable versions of the developed products were created in the Google Play Store and Oculus Store and all project source code was made available on GitHub.</p> <p><br /><br /></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>&nbsp;</span></p> <p><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>&nbsp;</span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>&nbsp;</span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p dir="ltr">&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 12/28/2019<br>      Modified by: Kevin&nbsp;B&nbsp;Ponto</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1612504/1612504_10453249_1577594653601_vr5-768x499--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1612504/1612504_10453249_1577594653601_vr5-768x499--rgov-800width.jpg" title="VR"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1612504/1612504_10453249_1577594653601_vr5-768x499--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="VR"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">A Screen shot from the VR system.</div> <div class="imageCredit">WID Virtual Environments</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Kevin&nbsp;B&nbsp;Ponto</div> <div class="imageTitle">VR</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1612504/1612504_10453249_1577594642452_TT--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1612504/1612504_10453249_1577594642452_TT--rgov-800width.jpg" title="TouchTouble"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1612504/1612504_10453249_1577594642452_TT--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="TouchTouble"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">A screenshot from the touch table system.</div> <div class="imageCredit">WID Virtual Environments</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Kevin&nbsp;B&nbsp;Ponto</div> <div class="imageTitle">TouchTouble</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
