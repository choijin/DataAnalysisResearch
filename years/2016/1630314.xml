<AbstractNarration>A request is made to fund new and replacement instrumentation on the R/V Atlantic Explorer, a 168? general purpose research vessel owned and operated by Bermuda Institute of Ocean Science (BIOS) as part of the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System.  BIOS is a U.S. 501 (c) 3 and 509 (a) not-for profit research and educational institution incorporated in the state of New York, and geographically located on the Island of Bermuda. The mission of the ship is to support funded science research throughout the Central Atlantic but specifically work in support of the BATS program. RV Atlantic Explorer had 157 days funded in 2015, all but 38 of which (76%) were for NSF. In 20165, the vessel is scheduled to sail 160 days with 120 (75%) of them funded by NSF. With this proposal, BIOS provides technical descriptions and rationale for the acquisition of the following Oceanographic Instrumentation:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CTD System Upgrades $156,617&lt;br/&gt;Meteorological System Upgrades $20,367&lt;br/&gt;Data Acquisition System and Network Upgrades $20,260&lt;br/&gt;      $197,244&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;The principal impact of the present proposal is under Merit Review Criterion 2 of the Proposal Guidelines (NSF 13-589). It provides infrastructure support for scientists to use the vessel and its shared-use instrumentation in support of their NSF-funded oceanographic research projects (which individually undergo separate review by the relevant research program of NSF).  The acquisition,  maintenance and operation of shared-use instrumentation allows NSF-funded researchers from any US university or lab access to working, calibrated instruments for their research, reducing the cost of that research, and expanding the base of potential researchers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Bermuda Institute of Ocean Science (BIOS) supports a UNOLS research vessel, R/V Atlantic Explorer, which provides a platform for innovative research in the fields of oceanography, marine biology, geology and atmospheric science. The primary goals of this Oceanographic Instrumentation (OI) award has been to undertake the following: (1) upgrade the CTD System; (2) upgrade the Meteorological System, and; (3) upgrade the Data Acquisition System and Network aboard the ship.  We have completed the objectives of the OI award through upgrades of three three critical systems for conducting scientific research at sea.  The significant results of this OI award are that: 1. We have improved the data acquisition system and network upgrades for all users of the ship; 2. We have achieved full redundancy of the CTD system upgrades to allow for appropriate calibration of the CTD sensors on a timely turnaround; and, 3. The upgrade of the meteorological system is providing data for all users of the ship.  The key outcome of this OI award is that the support of data acquisition systems for all scientific users of the R/V Atlantic Explorer has substantively improved.  The support of this OI award to BIOS provided opportunities for training, improvement of skills and experience, and professional development for several Marine Technicians.  The upgrades to the R/V Atlantic Explorer systems has been disseminated to the UNOLS ship time request forms so that potential users are notified of improved service.
