<AbstractNarration>This project seeks answers to two of the overarching questions central to nuclear physics: "How does subatomic matter organize itself and what phenomena emerge?", and "Are the fundamental interactions that are basic to the structure of matter fully understood?". The Standard Model (SM) of particle physics is successful at describing interactions of elementary particles, but it is known to be incomplete, because the SM fails to describe phenomena that shape our universe, like the difference between matter and anti-matter or the nature of dark matter. Furthermore, the mechanisms by which the strong force binds three light elementary particles, quarks, to make massive composite particles, proton and neutrons, are not well understood quantitatively.  Over ninety nine percent of the mass of the visible matter in the universe is generated by the strong force in this way. In this context, the PIs are involved in two experimental programs using the electron beam at the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility, first to investigate the internal structure of the proton as a means of investigating the nature of the strong force, and second to search for physics beyond the Standard Model by performing precision measurements of interactions with precise Standard Model predictions. The PIs will train two graduate students and undergraduate students in carrying out the research program, and will engage in STEM outreach activities through the "Adopt a physicist" program. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will support in part the use of Deeply Virtual Compton Scattering of electrons from the proton to produce a 3-D tomographic picture of the internal structure of the proton against which models of the strong force can be tested. Roche is one of the spoke persons for experiment E12-06-114 at JLab, and this project will support the data taking and data analysis for this experiment. The immediate goal of this experiment is to test the hypothesis of scaling on which the Generalized Parton Distribution formalism used to interpret this kind of experiments is based. The second project supported by this award will further the involvement of the PIs and their students in the JLab parity violating electron scattering experiments, QWEAK and MOLLER.  These experiments test the Standard Model by studying the electromagnetic and weak forces in electron-proton and electron-electron scattering. The PIs will continue their work with QWEAK up to publication of the final results, and will use their expertise in data acquisition and software development for the preparation of the MOLLER experiment.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This grant supported a group at Ohio University whose research focuses on understanding the internal structure of the nucleon using electrons as probe. The research was mainly performed at the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility (JLab) in Newport News, Virginia.  The group made major contributions in two experimental areas:  the study of the internal landscape of the nucleon using Deeply Virtual Compton Scattering, and the use of parity violation in the search for physics beyond the Standard Model of particle physics.  PI Roche is one of the spokespeople for DVCS experiment E12-06-114 at JLab. The goal of the experiment is to study the internal structure of the nucleon in a novel formalism that allows the simultaneous mapping of the position and momentum distribution of the nucleon constituents.  This approach can be compared to a tomography.  E12-04-116 was chosen as one of the first experiments after the JLab facility energy upgrade because it was recognized for its potential scientific high impact.  The experiment collected data through the first year of this award, and analysis of this experiment and the prior experiments has continued throughout the entire period, resulting in three peer-reviewed papers and eight conference talks (three of them by students) over this period.  This project supported five undergraduate student projects.  Four graduate students were supported on this project, with one completing their doctoral dissertation, and another completing a masters thesis.  PI King is a leader within the parity-violating electron scattering community at JLab, in which precise measurements of very small electron scattering asymmetries allow exploration of the limitations of the widely successful Standard Model of Particle Physics.  The analysis of the Qweak experiment continued, culminating in the publication of the final results in Nature.  Following this, the group contributed to analysis of ancillary measurements taken during the Qweak, and began software development for future parity violation measurements at JLab.  In this award period, this aspect of the project supported two undergraduate students, one of whom participated two summers in a row.  Two graduate students completed masters theses, and one of them has continued in the doctoral program with the group.  The broader impacts of this award were three-fold: "training the next generation of scientists", "broadening the participation of under-represented groups", and "enhancing infrastructure for research". In this period, the group supported seven undergraduates and six graduate students.  Of those eleven students, two were female, two were from underrepresented minorities, six were first-generation students, and two were age-atypical.  Collectively these numbers testify to the emphasis the PIs put on accessibility, which results in broadening of participation.  In the same spirit, the PIs take part in regular meetings with the community at large, for example, taking part in the fall sessions 2016-2018 of the "Adopt a Physicist" online program that fosters exchanges with middle and high school students.  Finally, the PIs are part of executive committees of relevant professional associations like the Division of Nuclear Physics of the American Physical Society and the Jefferson Lab User Organization.
