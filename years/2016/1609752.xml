<AbstractNarration>In this project, funded by the Environmental Chemical Sciences Program in the Division of Chemistry at the National Science Foundation, Professor Jonathan Raff of Indiana University is investigating how reactive nitrogen oxide (NOy) gases interact with soil surfaces.  NOy is generated during fuel combustion and is an important precursor to the radicals that both control the lifetime of pollutants and generate harmful byproducts (e.g., ozone and particulate matter). Removal of NOy through adsorption to soil surfaces is a process that remains largely unexplored despite the fact that soil is a substrate with high reactivity and high surface area.  Soil comprises vast areas of the Earth's surface. Additional activities include providing graduate students (including those from groups that are underrepresented in the science) with opportunities to perform cutting-edge and pertinent research in the environmental chemical sciences.  Dr. Raff is developing an outreach program that provides local middle and high school students and their teachers with access to portable pollutant monitors for field trips and in-class experiments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the research is to study how fast NOy adsorbs onto soil and the chemical processes that "recycle" nitrogen species back into the atmosphere. The multiphase chemistry of several NOy species on a variety of soil-related substrates are studied under environmentally relevant conditions using soil chemistry, physical chemistry, and biochemistry techniques. Results from the activities ultimately contribute to an improved understanding of the fate of reactive nitrogen in soil and the protection of human health against poor air quality.  As air quality standards for ground-level ozone become more strict, background levels of NOy that are influenced by soil emissions and multiphase chemistry of NOy on ground surfaces become more important. The kinetics studies allow modelers to more accurately parameterize soil NOy emissions in the chemical transport models.  Such simulations are used to predict the formation and movement of pollutants and inform pollution control policy.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The World Health Organization estimates that air pollution is responsible for seven million deaths per year worldwide. Understanding the chemical sources and chemical reactions that cause air pollution is essential to enact effective pollution control measures that save lives. A class of chemicals that plays a major role in air pollution includes the reactive nitrogen oxides, which are emitted from fossil fuel combustion and biomass burning. Changes in nitrogen oxide concentrations directly impact production of ground-level ozone, which is another pollutant that has been implicated in chronic illness and increased mortality. Although much is known about the gas phase chemistry responsible for air pollution, far less is known about how pollutants like nitrogen oxides interact with terrestrial surfaces such as soil.  This is unfortunate since the atmosphere-terrestrial interface is where most life exists and, hence, where air pollution has its greatest impacts.  This project used state-of-the-art chemical analysis techniques to understand how reactive nitrogen oxides and their reaction products interact with soil surfaces, and how they can impact chemistry at the atmosphere-terrestrial boundary layer.  One of the most reactive components of soil is organic matter--the part of soil that is derived from the decomposition of living organisms.  Our project focused on studying reactions of soil organic matter with the reactive nitrogen oxides dinitrogen pentoxide, nitrous acid, and nitrate.  We hypothesized that reactive oxides of nitrogen adsorb to soil and react either directly (or indirectly through their decomposition products) with soil organic matter.  As a result, soil organic matter is broken down and nitrogen is incorporated into soil. Previously, it was thought that the loss of reactive nitrogen oxides to Earth's surface was permanent and that these species could not participate in further atmospheric chemistry.  Our work shows that deposition of atmospheric nitrogen to soil is not a permanent loss mechanism as was once thought.  Instead, we discovered this nitrogen is re-released later under certain conditions where it can participate again in air pollution.  For one project, we studied the interaction of the gas dinitrogen pentoxide and nitrous acid with soil organic matter.  Dinitrogen pentoxide is a gas that appears at nighttime when nitrogen dioxide reacts with ozone, while nitrous acid is produced by bacteria and reactions of nitrogen oxides on ground surfaces throughout the day; both gases are important sources of free radicals that can decompose organic molecules in the atmosphere and lead to air pollution events.  In this project, we explored how dinitrogen pentoxide and nitrous acid react with different types of organic matter samples extracted from soil and aquatic sources.  Because organic matter is so complex, we used unique state-of-the-art instruments at Pacific Northwest Laboratory's Environmental Molecular Sciences Laboratory (EMSL) to study the composition of organic matter and how that composition changed when exposed to reactive nitrogen oxides.  In all cases, we found that nitrogen is incorporated and temporarily stored in organic matter in unstable forms that are then released subsequently upon exposure to acids or sunlight.  In another project, we studied what happens to the ubiquitous pollutant nitrate when exposed to sunlight.  We made aqueous solutions of nitrate and irradiated them with simulated sunlight in the presence of various types of dissolved organic matter.  During the exposure to light, we monitored oxygen free radicals and reactive nitrogen species such as nitrous acid and nitrogen dioxide formed simultaneously.  This was done using state-of-the-art instruments that detects these reaction products at concentrations in the parts-per-trillion range. Our experiments show that the free-radical scavenging ability of organic matter plays a critical role in affecting the reaction outcome of nitrate degradation in sunlight. Specifically, organic matter helps convert the nitrogen dioxide formed into nitrous acid gas, which escapes to the atmosphere, where it can participate in smog chemistry.  This is an important finding since it was previously thought that nitrate was not a source of air pollutants.  Project results stemming from this award were presented at conferences and published in scientific journals, with further scientific articles in development.  Graduate students and postdoctoral researchers received their training in environmental chemistry working on projects funded by this award.  Two of the postdoctoral researchers used their experience as a springboard to start their own independent careers in academia. As part of this project, we participated in teaching ozone chemistry to around forty high school students per year, many of whom attended college in pursuit of degrees in a science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields.
