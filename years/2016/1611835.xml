<AbstractNarration>This research project is focused on the study of the space of solutions to the self-duality equations, differential equations arising in mathematical physics. Higgs bundles, the solutions to these equations over a two-dimensional space, appear at the interface of geometry, physics, and representation theory. Understanding Higgs bundles through spectral data allows one to see a beautiful interplay between physical objects and properties of different Higgs bundles. This approach is appealing not only because of its intrinsic interest, but also because it is wonderfully suited for collaborations among several branches of mathematics and physics. The main goal of the project is to understand how Higgs bundles and their spectral data can provide new tools to study various geometric and physical questions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Remarkably, there are often elegant and simple characterizations of topological invariants of the moduli space of surface group representations (and of branes in the A- or B-model) in terms of combinatorial and geometric values associated to the spectral data of the corresponding Higgs bundles. The spectral data approach may be extended to Higgs bundles with singularities, and the PI is currently carrying out a program to do so. By considering the hyperkahler structure of the moduli spaces of Higgs bundles, the PI and a collaborator constructed a triple of natural anti-holomorphic involutions whose fixed point sets are new examples of branes in the A-model and B-model, some of them closely related to the representation variety of 3-manifolds. Obtaining a better understanding of the relation between the topology of 3-manifolds and subspaces of Higgs bundles is something the PI is pursuing, in particular by studying the relation of Higgs bundles with knot and graph compliments. Finally, the PI is also considering Langlands duality by looking at the Fourier-Mukai transform on the spectral data for the families of branes, which should provide some of the necessary objects needed for quantization of character varieties and moduli spaces of Higgs bundles from the perspective of curve and brane quantization.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The moduli space of Higgs bundles is a subject with roots in Hitchin and Simpson's work from the 1980's, and appears as the space of solutions to the self-dual Yang-Mills equations. These equations are a special case of Yang-Mills theory, a non abelian generalization of Maxwells equations which underlies much of modern physics. More recently, Higgs bundles have received much attention from mathematicians and physicists: for example, they were recently related to mirror symmetry, led to a physical derivation of the geometric Langlands, and were a key tool in Ng^o's proof of the fundamental lemma, for which he was awarded the Fields medal. One of the main features of the moduli space of Higgs bundles is that it has a hyperk#ahler structure, through which it manifests as both at connections and representations, fundamental objects which are ubiquitous in contemporary mathematics, and closely related to theoretical physics. It is through this hyperk#ahler structure that the moduli space of Higgs bundles also ts within Kontsevich's set up of homological mirror symmetry, in which two Calabi-Yau manifolds are said to be mirror dual if the derived category constructed from the Fukaya category of the rst is equivalent to the derived category of coherent sheaves on the other.     In views of the applications within mathematics and physics, and in particular homological mirror symmetry and representation theory, it has thus become fundamental to understand Lagrangian submanifolds of the moduli space of Higgs bundles supporting holomorphic sheaves (A-branes), their dual objects (B-branes), and correspondences between them. In 2006, Kapustin and Witten introduced the rst studies of branes of Higgs bundles in their fundamental work on electromagnetic duality, and since then not many advances had been made constructing examples of these objects, understanding their geometry or how they would transform under dierent dualities. It was only a decade later that together with David Baraglia, the PI introduced the first families of branes that naturally appear within the moduli spaces of Higgs bundles, and more generally, within hyperk#ahler spaces. In those papers, they also conjectured what Langlands duality should be for such families and since then, many researchers have working on proving their conjectures and on extending our methods other settings (e.g. to frame instantons, quiver varieties).    During the grant period the PI developed her research program, inspired on the above results, and which is divided into three interrelated parts, whose unifying theme is the study of branes and their correspondences in the moduli spaces of Higgs bundles and connections, and which build on the novel ingredients I have introduced in recent years.
