<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) will be to help enhance disease resistance in poultry and increase yields due to the delivery of only healthy, fully vaccinated chicks to farms.  These healthier chicks will reduce the need for antibiotics in poultry, helping in the movement to combat antimicrobial resistance.  This technology has immediate applications in other food animal industries and fisheries and allows for data capture on numbers of animals and types of treatments given.  Broader applications would include any image capture and analysis that relies on analytics to identify target areas and deliver substances to live animals or humans.  In addition, the proposed system will lead to increased productivity, allowing the poultry industry to meet the world's growing nutritional needs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This SBIR Phase I project proposes the development of technologies for screening and vaccinating live animals.  This proposal brings innovation to the care of food animals allowing producers to move away from flock health, focusing instead on the care of individual animals.  Individualized care is not practiced due to the high throughput needed to keep pace with large-scale commercial hatchery operation.  The overarching objective of this proposal is to develop a system that safely and effectively processes 100,000 chicks per hour, preform health checks and target recognition, and delivers a vaccine to individual chicks.  This specific SBIR project will focus on two main goals:  1) Development of an automated system to determine the health status of a day-of-age chick.  The system will recognize unhealthy chicks and target them for removal.  2) Development of a targeting system to determine the position of a chick using key features and provide the system?s master controller with the coordinates for proper delivery of vaccines and/or biologicals to the correct location on the chick.  Achieving these objectives will allow for further development of the product, adding in multiple lines for processing, leading to a fully commercial product.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In Phase I project, our project focused on the development of a device for health screening, orientation detection, and vaccine delivery to day of hatch chicks.  This project addresses the need for improved health screening and vaccine delivery needs to ensure that only healthy and fully vaccinated chicks are placed on farms, improving animal welfare and dependence on antibiotics.  Our Phase I efforts focused on the fundamental research to evaluate enhanced applications of various excitation, illumination, and high-speed imaging techniques and develop appropriate image analysis algorithms to allow for high-speed recognition of certain features of day of hatch chicks. Our R&amp;D project initiated with the development of the prototype system in Phase I and some preliminary testing.  In Phase II, we will expand on this testing to validate that the modules developed in Phase I are sensitive and accurate enough to achieve our desired results.  During the Phase I project, we successfully designed and developed a prototype system and confirmed the device could capture images of chicks for the health screen as well as for vaccine delivery, analyze the images, and deliver vaccine to the chicks.  This prototype system allowed us to achieve our key objective of building a system to determine the health of a chick (Objective 1) and determine the position of the chick for targeted vaccine delivery (Objective 2).  The end results from Phase I was the detection of key feature of the chicks needed for Health Determination in over 90% of the chicks for the Health Identification Module and detection of the beaks for Target Identification in over 96% of the images.    The prototype developed in Phase I consists of conveyors on which chicks are placed and loaded onto the health identification system.  We developed guiding systems to position the chicks for optimal image capture for the Health Determination. A single line indexing conveyor was designed to facilitate appropriate timing for single transfer of chicks to the chick carrier cups on a conveyor. These conveyor cups allow the chicks to orient themselves upright, allowing for easy imaging of their facial features for Target Identification.  The Target Identification system communicates with the master control system to determine which vaccine spray system to activate to deliver vaccine to the face of the chick. The newly developed device?s master controller system includes a vision system computer, associated programable logic controllers, and servo motor controllers to control each conveyor segment?s speed, direction, image capture and analysis.
