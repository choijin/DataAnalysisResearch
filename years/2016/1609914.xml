<AbstractNarration>Non-Technical: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award by the Biomaterials program in the Division of Materials Research to University at Buffalo, The State University at New York is to develop a novel drug-gene co-delivery system with potential applications in cancer treatment. Biodegradable polymers with two building blocks per molecule will be prepared.  One building block will attach chemically anticancer drugs; the other building block will carry positive charges and can physically adsorb negatively-charged anticancer genes. The biodegradable polymers will assemble to form core-shell nanoparticles (NPs) in aqueous solutions, with inner core domains for drug loading and outer shell domains for gene loading. Comprehensive studies will be conducted to investigate the preparation and assembly of the biodegradable polymers, therapeutic delivery and degradation behavior of the assembled NPs, as well as the biomedical effects of the drug-gene co-delivery system on cancer cells and tissues. This project can lay a significant foundation for the further development of drug-gene combination therapies for the synergetic treatment of cancers. Outreach will be conducted through YouTube broadcasting of short polymer videos and educational activities directed to kids in local schools. Research participation of students from underrepresented groups will be guaranteed. Substantial efforts will also be made to update a classic polymer textbook.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is to develop multifunctional biodegradable nanocarriers enabling not only noncompetitive high loadings of drugs and genes but also sustained release of these therapeutics. To this end, amphiphilic biodegradable di-block polymer-drug conjugates (PDCs) with a drug-conjugated block and a cationic block are designed as novel biomaterials for the preparation of multifunctional NPs, to integrate combination therapy, controlled release, imaging, targeting and biodegradability into one well-defined nanoscopic system for the precise delivery of both drug and gene. Well-defined di-block PDCs, as well as the corresponding assembled NPs with anticancer drug-conjugated cores and cationic shells, will be prepared and characterized. Drug conjugation, complexation with anticancer genes, drug/gene release profile, degradation behavior and multifunctionalization of the NPs will be studied. In vitro and in vivo studies using breast cancer models will be performed, and the anticancer efficacy of the multifunctional NPs with conjugated drug and complexed gene as compared to various controls will be evaluated. These NPs can serve as unique platforms for detailed systematic studies to understand and optimize the parameters governing the success of the co-delivery approach. The project will provide excellent interdisciplinary research opportunities for various students, including these from underrepresented groups. Broad educational outreach activities will be conducted.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p><span>The goal of this project is to develop a novel drug-gene co-delivery system with potential applications in cancer treatment. Block copolymers with multiple building blocks for therapeutic-specific delivery were proposed as the carriers for such a co-delivery system. To demonstrate the concept, a model triblock polymer was designed, synthesized, and studied. It had a water-insoluble block linking an anticancer drug (doxorubicin), &nbsp;a water-soluble block carrying positive charges for physical adsorption of negatively-charged anticancer gene, and a water-soluble PEG block to enhance biomedical-relevant properties (Figure 1). Because of the presence of both water-insoluble and water-soluble blocks, it self-assembled in aqueous solutions to form nano-sized micelles with a protective environment for therapeutic agents. Due to acid-sensitive linkages between doxorubicin and polymer chain, doxorubicin release was significantly faster at an acidic pH matching tumor acidity than a physiological pH. The colloidally stable nanocomplex of the polymer with GTI2040 (an anticancer short-chain nucleotide) was readily taken up by cancer cells, with much higher&nbsp;cellular internalization&nbsp;efficacy than free therapeutic agents. The polymer/GTI2040 nanocomplex further showed significantly higher therapeutic efficacy to kill MCF-7 cancer cells than positive controls. Taken together, these results support the promising potentials of block copolymer-based drug-gene co-delivery systems.</span></p> <p><span>Substantial research efforts were also made to investigate the design of biodegradable polymer blocks for therapeutic-specific delivery, which can be eliminated from biological systems without causing considerable long-term side effects. Hydrolyzable aliphatic polyesters, including polylactide (PLA) and polycaprolactone (PCL), were chosen as the base polymers. PLAs chemically linked with anticancer drugs and modified with either PEG or highly water-soluble zwitterions were studied (Figure 2). Their therapeutic effectiveness to kill cancer cells and/or limit tumor growth was verified. Co-delivery of multiple anticancer drugs by these systems was demonstrated. Bioimaging groups were also incorporated with the polymers to enable tumor imaging. Relative to PEG-modified systems, the zwitterion-modified systems led to longer <span>systemic&nbsp;</span>circulation time, which may promote therapeutic delivery effectiveness. With higher hydrolytic stability and longer shelf-life in aqueous solutions than PLA-based polymers, PCL-based polymers were also studied for therapeutic delivery. PEG-modified PCLs chemically attached with&nbsp;doxorubicin&nbsp;were studied (Figure 3), and showed remarkable therapeutic effects in killing cancer cells. PCLs carrying positively charged groups, with or without PEG modification, were also investigated (Figure 4), and they demonstrated remarkable physicochemical properties that are promising for gene delivery applications.
