<AbstractNarration>The mathematical concept of a group, a set together with an operation for combining two elements to produce another element, plays a central role in mathematics and its applications because it encodes intuitive notions of symmetry in a precise manner. The classification of the collection of finite groups known as finite simple groups is a monumental achievement of modern mathematics that has led to a revolution in using group theory to study other fields. The utility of group theory has been greatly expanded by advances in computation. One goal of the project is to describe useful presentations of finite simple groups that lead to more computational efficiency. This will lead to solutions of fundamental problems in number theory.  Another goal of the project is to study a group-theoretical problem that will lead will lead to results showing the existence and construction of expander graphs, which have been of great importance in computer science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In more detail, one goal of the project is to prove a generalization of the fact that if H is a finitely generated Zariski dense subgroup of a semisimple algebraic group, then H contains a strongly dense subgroup. This will give some new results about superstrong approximation in number theory and results on expander graphs. A second goal of the project is to prove the conjecture that every finite simple group has a presentation with two generations and at most four relations.  This will lead to advances in computational number theory. A third goal of the project is to classify generic stabilizers for simple algebraic groups in irreducible linear representations.  This will fit into the program of Bhargava to solve classification problems of algebraic families. A fourth goal of the project is to classify monodromy groups of coverings of low genus Riemann surfaces.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project involved fundamental questions about permutation and linear representations of finite and algebraic groups.   Results of this nature have applications to geometry, number theory, physics and many other areas.  We discuss below some of the highlights of this research. A fundamental notion for an algebraic group acting on a variety is that of a generic stabilizer.   A generic property is one that holds on a nonempty open (dense subset) -- i.e. it holds for most points.  We especially considered a simple algebraic group acting linearly.  Over the complex numbers, Richardson showed that most stabilizers are a single conjugacy class.  In joint work, we show the same is true in positive characteristic by actually computing them and showing typically the generic stabilizer is trivial.   This was used to get precise results about the essential dimension of a simple algebraic group (this has a technical definition but is an important intrinsic property of the group).   In two series of papers (one joint with Garibaldi and another with Lawther), we prove that generic stabilizers exist for simple algebraic groups and compute them in all cases.   We also produce an example to show that the result fails for semisimple algebraic groups.  Another basic notion in the theory of permutation groups is about fixed point free permutations or derangements.  It goes back to Jordan that any finite transitive group contains derangements.  Indeed, as far  back as 1708, this was studied by Montmart in analyzing some card games.   Answering a question posed independently by Shalev and Boston,  the PI and Fulman showed that the proportion of derangements when a finite simple group is acting is bounded away from zero.   Rather surprisingly, this fails if the simplicity hypothesis is weakened at all.   This result has had numerous applications already.   Moreover, the techniques developed in  this series of papers have had numerous application.   In other work on algebraic groups and quantum groups, we (with Garibaldi and Nakano) show that E8 acting on its Lie algebra has other unique properties.  This answered a question of Dick Gross about globally irreducible representations for algebraic groups.  We also extended this result to quantum groups at roots of unity.  Answering a question of Kessar,  Guralnick and Tiep obtained bounds on cohomology in terms of local properties of the finite group.  In work with Liebeck, Shalev and Tiep some natural word maps were shown to be surjective for all finite simple groups.   The project also resulted in many other related and fundamental results in the area motivated by problems in group theory and other areas of mathematics.  In terms of broader impact,  Guralnick also gave quite a number of plenary talks about these works to broad audiences at top international conferences in Oxford, Bristol, Vancouver,  Jerusalem and Vietnam.
