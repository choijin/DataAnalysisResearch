<AbstractNarration>Shared Consciousness and Collective Action&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This dissertation investigates the origins and influence of Africans' collective consciousness (or shared identity and way of thinking) in the years prior to the 1791-1804 Haitian Revolution, the most successful slave uprising of the modern era. This research proposes to examine the relationship between collective consciousness and important forms of resistance between the years 1750 and 1791. The project addresses the following questions. What was the role of Africa-inspired rituals in shaping collective consciousness? How did this collective consciousness influence patterns of escape from enslavement? How and why did patterns of escape from enslavement change over time and space in the few decades before the Haitian Revolution?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Preliminary results suggest the following hypotheses. First, Africa-inspired ritual events were gathering spaces for rebels to raise oppositional consciousness, campaign for freedom, and mobilize recruits. Second, runaways' social ties, knowledge of specific destinations, self-assertive behaviors, and longer durations of escape seem to be reasonable indicators of an oppositional consciousness. Third, runaways strategically responded to structural and environmental windows of opportunity (such as natural disasters, changes in colonial law, and geographic proximity to isolated zones). To test these hypotheses, the Co-PI will perform (a) qualitative and quantitative content analysis of over 11,000 digitally archived Haitian runaway slave advertisements; (b) a systematic review of primary documents held in several key archives in the Americas and Europe; (c) a systematic review of critical secondary sources published during and since the period of study; and (c) qualitative field research in present-day Haiti. The findings on antecedents to the Haitian Revolution will improve our understanding of the role of shared consciousness, social ties and networks, and human cultural expressions in collective action processes.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The major goal of the project was to understand how diaspora populations? shared consciousness translates into collective action. Specifically, the project combined theoretical literature from African Diaspora Studies and the social movements field with archival and field research data to study ritual life and escapes from enslavement (mawonaj) during the years leading to the Haitian Revolution.  Eddins travelled to France to conduct archival research at the Archives Nationale d?Outre-Mer in Aix-en-Provence and the Archives Nationale in Pierrefitte-Stains.
