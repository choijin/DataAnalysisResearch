<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project focuses on content and data analytics design to attract patients with chronic diseases to navigate web and mobile based educational and self-care tools. It will also provide clinicians with surveillance for their practice and easy outreach in times of urgent need for vaccinations and health information, as well as to reduce care gaps in annual wellness visits and needed follow-up care.  Patient and provider usability will generate big data analytics to improve care and manage resources specific to the needs of the community. With millions of patient and health providers as users, the big data derived from these users will provide information to reduce healthcare costs for patients, providers, payers, the government and society.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project is to incorporate and improve patient-centered care using web and mobile based custom software tools to support patients managing their health. Our research will allow for practitioners to focus on improving patient-physician engagement by measuring skills and behaviors of the patient when diagnosing and treating them. We will develop engaging content and software tools using secure and private web and mobile based health applications to promote smoking cessation, nutrition education, substance abuse reduction and cardiovascular care, providing data analytics from patients managing their disease on the platform to the care team's electronic health records or on the dashboards we provide.  This research, if successful will impact how big data analytics and outcomes measurement is communicated through consumerism and in the healthcare industry. The technology will incorporate customized IP dashboard for providers and patients; business decision modeling systems to make smarter decisions within the care continuum; custom analytics solutions that will offer relevant insights and reporting; advanced visualization of big data analytics that will provide very clear and concise representation of insights in an easy to interpret form, preventing the end-user from being bogged down with complex data; and predictive analytics to support clinical and patient decision making providing futuristic insights.</AbstractNarration>

The CDC also notes that chronic diseases and conditions in the U.S., such as type II diabetes, are the most common, costly, and preventable of all health problems.

The platform biometrics will be able to demonstrate a reduction in A1C at 6 and 18 months, show fewer acute symptoms, show increased exercise regimentation, demonstrate improved patient self-efficacy and improve patient/provider communication.

The Advaita&trade; solution will support existing providers by reducing excessive use of office visits and emergency room visits while teaching patients improvements in self-care and chronic disease management.
