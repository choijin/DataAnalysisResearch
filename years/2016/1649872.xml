<AbstractNarration>GenCyber Initiative, co-sponsored by the National Science Foundation and the National Security Agency, started in 2014 to provide summer cybersecurity camp experiences for students and teachers at the K-12 level. In 2016, there are 135 camps involving approximate 6000 students and 1200 teachers. To help assess and achieve one of the goals of GenCyber, understanding correct and safe on-line behavior, the proposed project aims to develop an innovative tool, the Cybersecurity Judgment Questionnaire (CJQ), for assessing middle and higher school students' understanding of cybersecurity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CJQ is based on the heuristics and biases theory by Daniel Kahneman and focuses on cybersecurity judgment rather than on cybersecurity behavior or cybersecurity awareness because ordinary people's daily behavior is significantly influenced by their intuitive thinking and thus it is important to get into young cyber users' minds and compare their intuitive and rational cybersecurity thinking. The questionnaire employs the survey experiment approach that integrates the strengths of both surveys and experiments to collect data effectively and efficiently. In addition, to assess authentic cybersecurity judgment, it will use a real-life scenarios and ask young cyber users to judge the risk intuitively and rationally rather than asking participants to answer simple multiple-choice questions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will attempt to verify and extend Daniel Kahneman's theory of heuristics and biases in the cyberspace in general and in the cybersecurity domain in particular. It will use the scenario-based survey experiment with the factorial design to develop, validate, and test the measurement of cybersecurity judgment. The measurement provides a tool to assess cybersecurity understanding of GenCyber student campers. In addition, young cyber users can see both their specific vulnerabilities for possible cyber-attacks and their potential strengths for protecting cybersecurity.</AbstractNarration>

It examines the human side rather than the technology side of cybersecurity protection. This awarded project has generated one core outcome and three key findings that contributes to the psychology of cybersecurity behavior as the principal discipline of the project.</p> <p>(1) One core outcome: The <em>Cybersecurity Judgment Questionnaire for K-12 School Students </em>has been designed, developed, piloted, validated, and used in GenCyber Camps successfully. This questionnaire has already been used by nearly 10 research groups in the world. See Images #1A and #1B for details.</p> <p>(2) Key Finding #1: This project has generated strong psychometrical evidence, indicating that the questionnaire as the first assessment tool of this kind can assess K-12 students? cybersecurity judgment validly and reliably. See Image #2 for details.</p> <p>In cybersecurity behavior research, two major challenges exist, i.e., how to improve the validity and reliability of cybersecurity assessment as <em>a weak hypothesis</em> and how to mitigate cybersecurity risks among the K-12 school population as <em>the weakest link</em> in cybersecurity practice. To address these two challenges, the validation study aimed to verify the validity and reliability of one newly developed questionnaire, <em>Cybersecurity Judgment Questionnaire for Middle and High School Students</em>, using the Rasch modeling. A total of 398 middle and high school students from the GenCyber Camps participated in this study. The results of the Rasch model analysis show that (a) the Cybersecurity Judgment Questionnaire was unidimensional, measuring one single construct of cybersecurity judgment; (b) the questionnaire had acceptable item construct validity and person construct validity; (c) the item reliability and person reliability of the questionnaire was also acceptable, and (d) a few items might need revisions to increase item difficulty and reduce redundancy if this would be confirmed by more replication studies with more representative samples.</p> <p>(3) Key Finding #2: The project has generated the first large-scale empirical baseline evidence that the K-12 school students and teachers as a whole are at moderate risk in judging cybersecurity risks, while 865 (32.42%) of them are at high risk but only 66 (2.47%) of them are at low risk. See Image #3 for details.</p> <p>The past ten years have witnessed rapidly increased concerns about cybersecurity and cyber privacy in schools. This creates an urgent need for a large-scale assessment on whether our students and teachers are at risk in cyberspace. This study is a large experimental survey study based on Daniel Kahneman?s cognitive judgment theory, examining intuitive and rational judgment of cybersecurity risks among 2667 K-12 students and teachers who participated in 45 GynCyber Summer Camps nationwide. Four main findings are: (1) these students and teachers as a whole are at moderate risk in judging cybersecurity risks; (2) 865 (32.42%) of them are at high risk and only 66 (2.47%) of them are at low risk; (3) elementary school students are a high-risk group in cybersecurity judgment, while middle school students, high school students, and teachers are moderate risk groups; and (4) no significant differences were observed in intuitive judgment and rational judgment among K-12 students, except for K-12 teachers.</p> <p>(4) Key Findings #3: The project has produced the first large-scale empirical evidence of both risk factors and protective factors are associated with both intuitive and rational cybersecurity judgment of K-12 students and teachers. See Image #4 for details.</p> <p>K-12 students and teachers are a vulnerable population for cybersecurity risks. Identifying both risk factors and protective factors associated with intuitive and rational judgment of cybersecurity risks would help them develop strategies to tackle cyber risks. A total of 2703 K-12 students and teachers from 45 GenCyber Summer Camps participated in the experimental survey study at the beginning of the camps, and a total of 1021 K-12 students and teachers participated in the follow-up experimental survey at the end of the camps. Two major findings of the study include: (1) three significant risk factors associated with both intuitive and rational cybersecurity judgment were Age Group, Region, and Prior GenCyber Camp Experience. That is, younger students, the campers from the West region, and participants attending the camps before tended to have a lower level of cybersecurity judgment; and (2) two significant protective factors were Cyber Use Length and Current GenCyber Camp Experience, i.e., the experiences of both using computers, Internet, cellphones and participating in the current camps having significant advantages in judging cybersecurity risks intuitively and rationally. Thus, it is critical to use both the push strategy to minimize the risk factors and the pull strategy to maximize the protective factors. It is concluded with a summary of limitations and future studies, i.e., replicating the findings in regular K-12 schools, examining more risk and protective factors, conducting longitudinal studies, and studying underlying mechanisms.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 07/06/2021<br>      Modified by: Zheng&nbsp;Yan</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1649872/1649872_10440733_1625583862947_$Image#2Risks--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1649872/1649872_10440733_1625583862947_$Image#2Risks--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Image #2 Risks"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1649872/1649872_10440733_1625583862947_$Image#2Risks--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Image #2 Risks"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">The high risk, moderate risk, and low risk groups based on the number of students and teachershowed their correct rates of cybersecurity judgment at the beginning of the GynCyber Camps</div> <div class="imageCredit">Zheng Yan</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Zheng&nbsp;Yan</div> <div class="imageTitle">Image #2 Risks</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1649872/1649872_10440733_1625582730571_$image#1af--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1649872/1649872_10440733_1625582730571_$image#1af--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Image #1A"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1649872/1649872_10440733_1625582730571_$image#1af--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Image #1A"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">The Cybersecurity Judgment Questionnaire for K-12 School Students Part A</div> <div class="imageCredit">Zheng Yan</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Zheng&nbsp;Yan</div> <div class="imageTitle">Image #1A</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1649872/1649872_10440733_1625582923655_$image#1bf--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1649872/1649872_10440733_1625582923655_$image#1bf--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Image #1B"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1649872/1649872_10440733_1625582923655_$image#1bf--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Image #1B"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">The Cybersecurity Judgment Questionnaire for K-12 School Students Part B</div> <div class="imageCredit">Zheng Yan</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Zheng&nbsp;Yan</div> <div class="imageTitle">Image #1B</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1649872/1649872_10440733_1625583465980_Image#2Map--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1649872/1649872_10440733_1625583465980_Image#2Map--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Image #2 Map"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1649872/1649872_10440733_1625583465980_Image#2Map--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Image #2 Map"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Wright Person-Item Map of Cybersecurity Judgment Questionnaire.
