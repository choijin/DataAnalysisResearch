<AbstractNarration>Non-technical abstract:  &lt;br/&gt;Growing research needs across many disciplines demand new patterning and fabrication techniques that extend into the third dimension.  The Nanoscribe Photonic Professional GT system meets those needs, acting as a 3d printer with resolution down to features 500 times smaller than the diameter of a human hair.  This tool will be the first of its kind in Texas, and will enable transformative research in diverse science and engineering areas including optoelectronics, energy storage materials, neuroscience, lab-on-a-chip applications, tissue engineering, and cancer biology.  The Nanoscribe will be included in the Rice Excellence in Secondary Science Teaching (RESST) program that impacts teachers and students in the largest school district in Texas and the 7th largest in the nation, which has an enrollment of 88% Hispanic and African American students.  In addition, this tool will impact separately funded Research Experience for Teachers (RET) and Research Experience for Undergraduate (REU) projects on campus.  Lastly, this nanofabrication tool will also be available for hands-on instruction in 20 nanotechnology-related courses already being offered at Rice.  The Nanoscribe will be a regional hub for nanofabrication in the third dimension, and a component of training the next generation of a diverse technological workforce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical abstract:&lt;br/&gt;The Nanoscribe Photonic Professional GT system acquired through the MRI program is able to function as either a 3d additive manufacturing system or as a direct-write, maskless, 2-photon photopatterning tool with 150 nm feature sizes and 3d positioning.  This tool will be the first of its kind in Texas, and will enable transformative research in diverse science and engineering areas including optoelectronics, energy storage materials, neuroscience, lab-on-a-chip applications, tissue engineering, and cancer biology.  The Nanoscribe will be overseen through Rice's faculty-centric approach to shared research infrastructure that currently manages several facilities.  This stewardship ensures best user training practices, accessibility for external academic and industrial users, and a stable financial basis for ongoing operations, including staff support.  The Nanoscribe will be a regional hub for the growth of nanofabrication into the third dimension.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This award supported the acquisition of a Nanoscribe Photonic Professional GT, a tool for three-dimensional nanofabrication based on confocal optical microscopy and two-photon photochemistry.  Because the Nanoscribe can fabricate three dimensional structures with nanoscale resolution from a variety of constituents (polymers, biopolymers, ceramics), the system is ideally suited to support work across traditional disciplinary lines.  The intellectual merit of this acquisition is to enable state-of-the-art research across multiple disciplines, including physics, materials science, fluid mechanics, biological engineering, chemical engineering, and electrical engineering.   The instrument was delivered to Rice University in February, 2017 and installed in a temporary location during the construction of Rice?s revitalized cleanroom/nanofabrication facility.  As of this writing, the Nanoscribe has just been relocated into its location in the new cleanroom, which opens October 1.  The Nanoscribe is administered as a piece of shared research infrastructure through Rice?s faculty-led Shared Equipment Authority (SEA), and a member of the cleanroom technical staff is responsible for training and oversight of the instrument.  This instrument is the first of its kind in Texas, and one goal of its acquisition was to have the Nanoscribe become a regional resource, accessible to outside-Rice researchers through the SEA?s external user framework.  The broader impact of the instrument is its effect on the undergraduate, graduate student, and postdoctoral scholars who acquire research skills from its use, and the availability of the instrument as a regional resource.  Students and postdoctoral researchers from several research groups across multiple disciplines have been trained to use the instrument.  Users from outside the university (primarily in institutions that are part of the Texas Medical Center) have also been trained, demonstrating that this tool is going to fulfill the goal of being a regional nanofabrication asset.   Here are several examples of projects enabled by the Nanoscribe:  Structured microfluidic environments have been created that function to confine and trap bubbles and emulsions.  Observations can then be made of the dynamics of interfacial phenomena such as bubble-bubble coalescence and pinch-off.  These structures and experiments enable an improved understanding of these basic physical processes, critical for such industrially important phenomena as multiphase fluid flow.  (Image 1). Nanoscale optical resonators have been created, to study optoelectronic properties of materials at wavelengths of relevance to telecommunications.  (Image 2). Mechanical "metamaterials" that have enhanced mechanical properties due to three-dimensional nanostructuring.  (Image 3). Complex patterned dielectrics that act as "phase masks".  Combined with appropriate mathematical techniques, these structures make possible lensless, flat cameras for applications including medical imaging.  (Image 4).    The academic papers reporting results from these projects are in various stages of the publication process.  The Nanoscribe Photonic Professional GT has been a successful addition to the micro/nanofabrication infrastructure of Rice University.  The expectation is that it will continue to be an excellent tool for training the next generation of the diverse technological workforce for years to come.
