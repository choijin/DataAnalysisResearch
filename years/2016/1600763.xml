<AbstractNarration>The insect collection of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Drexel University holds one of the world's most important collections of grasshoppers. The Academy proposes to digitize and make accessible information associated with approximately 54,000 of its grasshopper specimens from the southwestern United States. These data will benefit the general public and research scientists, as they will facilitate the understanding of grasshopper distribution, the identification of pest species and species new to science, and contribute to understanding how species respond to environmental change. Field notebooks documenting geographic and associated species information will be scanned and made available on the World Wide Web. The notebooks are important beyond the specimen information they contain. They include observations from the early 20th century regarding vegetation, climate, land use, animal communities, native peoples and their life styles. This information potentially informs other disciplines including ecology, history and anthropology. This project establishes a collaborative framework involving Academy researchers, college students, and high school students, including individuals from groups under-represented in STEM, with an interest in the biodiversity sciences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Academy of Natural Sciences of Drexel University (ANSP) has partnered with the Symbiota Collections of Arthropods Network (SCAN) as a Partner to an Existing Network (PEN) to build OrthopNet. The OrthopNet project will capture specimen level data from approximately 54,000 specimens of southwestern Acrididae (grasshoppers) and serve this data to SCAN. These data will aid in understanding grasshopper distributions, identify pest species and species new to science, and inform global biodiversity issues.  The Academy of Natural Sciences is the oldest natural history museum in the Americas, founded in 1812. The Academy's Acrididae (grasshopper) collection is one of the best and most comprehensive in the world. The targeted collection was accrued by Academy researchers surveying grasshoppers in the southwestern United States starting in the early 1900s. The Academy's archives also contain field notebooks associated with these southwestern US collecting expeditions. These documents will be imaged following the Smithsonian Libraries Macaw metadata collection protocol, and hosted on the World Wide Web by the Biodiversity Heritage Library. Mining these notebooks for additional locality information will aid in georeferencing specimen records, linking field notes and other specimen information, further enhancing the value of the collection. The historical information obtained from the field notebooks will inform other disciplines including ecology, history and anthropology. Funding for Academy researchers, university students, and underserved high school students is also provided. Products generated from the project will be available at http://symbiota4.acis.ufl.edu/scan/portal/.</AbstractNarration>

This data is freely available through the Symbiota Collections of Arthropods Network ( https://scan-bugs.org/portal/collections/misc/collprofiles.php?collid=228) .  The complete  field notebooks were photographed from 6 expeditions spanning 1902-1926 and four of these were completely transcribed.  These notebooks can be accessed at the Biodiversity Heritage Library ( https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org ).  Digitized records of specimens from these expeditions have a direct link to the relevant field notebook, and in cases to the direct mentioning of the specimens in the field notes.  Additional habitat or host information noted in the field notes, and not part of the specimen labels, was added to the digital specimen records enriching the original label data.   38,618, or 63% , of specimen records were georeferenced and the field notes were able to give more detailed collection location  Significant Results include  making data from over  60,000 insect specimens  freely searchable online to any researcher, including the actual field notes written at the time of the collection  of the specimens.  Specimens were found from localities no longer existing (e.g. inundated by Lake Mead).  These data are more accessible for researchers documenting changes  in  environments and range and elevation shifts  by insects during the last century.  Of additional importance is a  better understanding of the Academy entomologists who surveyed the Orthoptera, the grasshoppers, katydids and crickets, of the western United States in the early twentieth century.

Training and professional development included seven environmental science undergraduates who worked on the project in addition  to 3 Academy volunteers.  Two project undergraduate alumni  are now in PhD program  in Entomology, two are Master degree candidates, and the remaining students continue as Drexel University undergraduates.  The OrthopNet project was promoted and discussed at museum events such as donor programs, the Academy?s yearly BugFest (3-4000 visitors/year), Pfizer STEM Career Day, and behind the scenes Entomology Departmental tours.
