<AbstractNarration>University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee (UWM) is requesting to join an existing Phase Two I/UCRC center, Grid-connected Advanced Power Electronic Systems (GRAPES), which was established in 2009 with University of Arkansas as a lead and University of South Carolina as a site. The GRAPES has been providing significant benefits to the members and nation through advancing the knowledge in grid-connected power electronics and developing intellectual properties. The goal of the UWM site is to supplement and complement the existing expertise, capabilities, and facilities to better achieve mission of GRAPES to accelerate the adoption and insertion of power electronics into the grid in order to improve system stability, flexibility, robustness, and economy. UWM will add another geographical area and population center, diversity, cutting edge facilities of power electronics, microgrids, protection, energy efficiency, and energy storage into GRAPES. Milwaukee has traditionally been one of the largest power electronics hubs in the nation, home to many large and medium power companies. Majority of focus at the proposed UWM site will be on distributed generation integration, AC and DC Microgrids, distribution and protection, ancillary services, smart distribution, grid connected energy storage systems, and SiC-based converters. UWM will bring Midwest market and region to GRAPES. The facilities include a 350 kVA microgrid system, center for sustainable electrical energy systems, energy storage systems and interface, test setups for high voltage wide band gap devices, DC protection setups. UWM faculty expertise in converter level wide band gap devices, fault and protection, power electronics systems, energy efficiency, power electronics reliability, and integration of distributed generation greatly support the existing activities and capabilities at GRAPES. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee (UWM) will join an existing Phase Two I/UCRC center, Grid-connected Advanced Power Electronic Systems (GRAPES). The objectives of GRAPES are three folds: (i) develop advanced technologies for grid-connected power electronics, power distribution, and smart loads, (ii) develop software and embedded controls for power electronics converters and systems, and (iii) develop workforce for the power and energy conversion and control industry. A group of four core faculty and a larger group of affiliated faculty at UWM with extensive experience and expertise in power electronics converters, controls, and systems, and strong support from industry will conduct cutting edge research on design, modeling, simulation, implementation, and testing of grid-connected power electronics devices and systems. The goal is to increase the penetration of power electronics into utility grid at all levels of generation, distribution, and smart load, in order to increase efficiency, reliability, sustainability, and to lower cost. UWM site will mainly focus on distributed generation integration, AC and DC Microgrids, distribution and protection, ancillary services, smart distribution, grid connected energy storage systems, and SiC-based converters.  The main broader impact is to provide the highest quality integrated education, research, and engineering to meet the emerging workforce and needs of the nation?s energy industry. To conduct research, team members including professors, graduate and undergraduate students, and industry experts will collaborate. UWM GRAPES site will have broader impacts at many levels: high school students, UWM students, working professionals, minority and underrepresented groups, and member companies. Research results from projects will be integrated with courses for students and will be disseminated to industry through monthly webinars, semi-annual meetings, short courses, and publications. The center activities will also have profound impacts on the energy conversion and controls industry in Wisconsin and broader Midwest by developing new technologies and intellectual properties.</AbstractNarration>
