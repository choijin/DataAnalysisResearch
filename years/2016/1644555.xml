<AbstractNarration>This I-Corps L project from Northwestern University (NU) will focus on scaling and sustaining of an educational innovation, nScope, one of the centerpieces in the parent NSF project funded under the "Engaged Student Learning" track in the IUSE: EHR program. The nScope system is a USB-powered device that plugs into an electronics prototyping breadboard. The nScope is equipped with an oscilloscope, power supply, two function generators and two pulse generators. The hardware is accompanied by a graphical interface and an open application program interface (API) for custom control from any platform - PC, Mac, and Raspberry Pi. The current version is easy and safe for beginners, yet powerful enough for experts. The versatility makes nScope a potent educational tool for all types of  STEM learners.  This I-Corps for Learning project will investigate ways to increase the impact of this innovative project so that more STEM students can benefit from the capabilities of nScope. Possible paths to be explored include partnerships and collaborations with universities, community colleges, and engineering licensure boards. Tutorials or modules will be tailored to the user needs. The scaling of the innovation will investigate means of sustaining the project including potential commercial outlets. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research has established that the learner-centered, knowledge-centered, assessment-centered, and community-centered aspects of a course enhance student learning. Aspects of hardware improvement, tutorial development, learning module customization, and the way that the users interact with the products play roles in whether the education innovation embodies principles of effective learning. Broader adoption outside the classroom where end users are much more diverse provides an opportunity to consider more demographic factors in assessing the education innovation and in designing materials that take those factors into account. The customizable features and low cost of nScope have the potential to make some types of STEM instruction more interactive and effective for a variety of students.  The project will help advance knowledge regarding how to support successful adaptation of experiential modules across different curricula, multiple engineering disciplines, and a range of institutional cultures.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit:  nScope was created at Northwestern University (NU) to make electronics easy and affordable, and to provide a tool that is safe for beginners and powerful enough for experts. nScope is an integral component of the NU biomedical engineering (BME) courses that are part of the IUSE grant and four NU mechanical engineering (ME) courses. nScope is a USB-powered device that plugs into an electronics prototyping breadboard. In addition to the oscilloscope and power supply, nScope is equipped with two function generators and two pulse generators.

Broader Impact:  Given the limited opportunities community colleges are able to provide hands-on experience to its students, wide adoption of this powerful tool is expected to make a significant impact in attracting students, especially the many underrepresented minorities who enroll in a community college as their first postsecondary institution, to the STEM field.  Summary of Outcomes:  nScope has proven very popular with university programs that teach introductory electrical engineering to non-electrical engineering major students. The departments of Mechanical and Biomedical Engineering are the most common clients.  Over the funding period, the following schools have adopted nScope for at least one course: Johns Hopkins University, CU Denver, Tufts, Griffith University (Australia), University of Maryland, University of Dayton. The following schools have tested a small number of nScopes for running a trial course: CU Boulder, Carnegie Mellon, ASU Polytechnic, CEEPS (Spain), Kentucky State University, CSLUB, University of Delaware, GRIPS (Japan), Ohio Northern University, UMass Amherst, UIUC.  Outside academia, the main distributor for nScope to the general public is Amazon,com. The EL has signed a distribution contract with Newark.com in September 2017 to distribute nScope internationally.   Maker Faires gave the nScope team the opportunity to meet and interact with the community of STEM users and educators who are not familiar with nScope. These included practitioners, teachers, young people in K-12, and other members of the general public.  The PI formed a new team and received another NSF I-Corps grant in 2018 with a Master's student as EL and a new industry mentor. Some of the initial testing of the product has been done with nScope. The EL for the project "A Quantitative Approach to Detecting Meltdowns in Individuals with AutismSpectrum Disorder" has made a succssful project pitch for the NSF SBIR and received an invitation to submit a full proposal that is due in June 2019.
