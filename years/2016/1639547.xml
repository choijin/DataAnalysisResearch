<AbstractNarration>Scientific reproducibility -- the ability to independently verify the work of other scientists -- continues to be a critical barrier towards achieving the vision of cross-disciplinary science. Federal agencies and publishers increasingly mandate and incentivize scientists to, at a minimum, establish computational reproducibility of scientific experiments. To comply scientists must connect descriptions of scientific experiments in scholarly publications with the underlying data and code used to produce the published results and findings. However, in practice, computational reproducibility is hard to achieve since it entails isolating necessary and sufficient computational artifacts and then preserving those artifacts in a standard way for later re-execution. Both isolation and preservation present challenges in large part due to the complexity of existing software and systems as well as the implicit dependencies, resource distribution, and shifting compatibility of systems that evolve over time -- all of which conspire to break the reproducibility of an experiment. The goal of the GeoTrust project is to understand the research lifecycle of scientific experiments from conception to publication and establish a framework that will improve their reproducibility. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GeoTrust will develop sandboxing-based systems and tools that help scientists effectively isolate computational artifacts associated with an experiment, use languages and semantics to preserve artifacts, and re-execute /reproduce experiments by deploying the artifacts, changing datasets, algorithms, models, environments, etc. This reproducible framework will be adopted by and integrated within community infrastructures of three geoscience sub-disciplines viz. Hydrology, Solid Earth, and Space Science. Using cross-disciplinary science uses cases from these sub-disciplines, and engaging independent evaluators, we will assess the effectiveness of the framework in achieving reproducibility of computational experiments. Finally, verified results will be associated with ?stamps of reproducibility?, establishing community recognition of computational experiments. The framework will be developed as an EarthCube capability, with software developed and released as per EarthCube requirements. Early adopters across other geoscience sub-disciplines will be continually sought.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The main goal of this EarthCube project was to further develop and demonstrate a new technology that makes it easier for scientists (and geoscientists in particular) to capture, bundle, share and reproduce computational workflows.  Computational workflows typically involve a large number of files of different types and sizes, including model source code, executables and input files that contain data in a variety of formats.  Some of these files may reside locally on the user's computer while others may exist on remote servers, but this collection of files related to a given computational task can be viewed as a single entity or unit.  In the EarthCube GeoDataspace project -- a predecessor to the current GeoTrust project -- these units were referred to as "geounits".  In the GeoTrust project these units are now referred to as "sciunits" to emphasize their applicability beyond just the geosciences.  The GeoDataspace and GeoTrust projects are built on top of the successful Globus Online platform (see: https://www.ci.uchicago.edu/research-projects/globus-online, https://www.globus.org), which is known for its popular GridFTP and more recent "Globus for Google Drive" products.  The GeoTrust project extended the work of the GeoDataspace project in at least two important ways.  First, GeoTrust (via the GDClient software) now allows users to bundle all of the files used in a computational workflow into a single, easily shareable Docker image (https://www.docker.com).   This bundling process has come to be known as "dockerization" and goes a long way toward solving the problem of reproducibility, since GeoTrust automatically identifies and includes all of the dependencies that are needed for the given workflow.  Second, GeoTrust aims to generalize the concept of a sciunit beyond something that is static -- in the sense that all users of the sciunit are using exactly the same input files and options and should therefore get the same output -- to something that is dynamic.  A "dynamic sciunit" allows users to use the sciunit with their own input files instead of the ones used by the person who created the sciunit initially.  This is potentially a powerful extension of the sciunit concept, but introduces new technical challenges.  In order to explore and tackle these issues, the team included scientists from different domains that worked on demonstration projects for their domain.  PI Peckham used his TopoFlow toolkit for this purpose, which provides reproducible, component-based, plug-and-play hydrologic modeling (Peckham et al., 2017).
