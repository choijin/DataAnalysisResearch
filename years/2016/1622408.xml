<AbstractNarration>1622408&lt;br/&gt;Prakash&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The sustainability of the rural Alaskan lifestyle is increasingly suspect. This proposed food-energy-water nexus workshops will lead to collaborations and results with the potential to add to this public discussion on the sustainability of this lifestyle. Attendees will be a diverse group representing academia, agencies, communities, organizations, and industry. The agenda emphasizes active participation to facilitate discussion and progress in key fields. The key result of the event will be a report including a summary of discussions, ideas for further study in the food-energy-water field, and recommendations for ways to transform workshop results into visualizations, decision-support tools and other concrete deliverables.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Of the greater than 25 food-energy-water nexus workshops recently funded by the NSF, none have addressed the unique and significant challenges to food, water, and energy production and acquisition posed by high-latitude environments and "islanded communities." These include extreme swings in weather and daylight hours and the isolation of many Arctic communities from the main transport network and electrical grid. As a result, islanded communities are especially vulnerable to fluctuations and disruptions in supplies of food, energy, and water. Short growing seasons make agriculture difficult, water pollutants and hygiene are constant concerns, and imported energy costs are exorbitant. In addition, the local renewable energy sources are sporadic in nature and difficult to maintain. These issues make it incumbent upon the research community and the nation to find ways to improve the stability, efficiency, and affordability in all three areas of the nexus for islanded communities. The growing emphasis on the food-energy-water nexus has yet to be extended to islanded communities, making these areas both a crucial and fertile area for examination and research. Furthermore, the self-contained nature of these communities makes them excellent places to examine the FEW nexus as a relatively closed system. The workshop is organized around three areas: 1. Infrastructure Engineering, including topics such as efficient greenhouses, improved equipment to store and manage intermittent energy loads from renewables, and infrastructure to affordably provide clean drinking water and proper sewage disposal, 2. Environmental Engineering, including topics such as bioaccumulated toxins in subsistence foods, and the high energy levels needed to provide clean water in islanded communities, and 3. Society and Economy, including topics such as the rising energy requirements (and hence prices) of subsistence practices and the need for improved security of water sources.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>A group of faculty at the University of Alaska Fairbanks (UAF) used this award to support three events on the UAF campus focused on the food-energy-water (FEW) nexus in high-latitude environments. The goal of the events was to identify issues, needs, challenges and opportunities in FEW research in <em>islanded</em> high-latitude communities &ndash; communities isolated from the electric grid and from easy access to food imports. These communities face unique challenges to food, energy and water production and use, such as extreme swings in weather and daylight hours and high transport costs for food, fuel and other daily needs.</p> <p>The first event was entitled &ldquo;The Food-Energy-Water (FEW) Nexus in Islanded Communities and High Latitudes: Issues, Pathways, and Implications,&rdquo; or HLFEW 2016 for short. Held in September 2016, the workshop drew 45 people, who took part in breakout sessions and rich discussions that helped to identify the major issues, gaps in research, and research priorities for achieving a sustainable FEW nexus in high-latitude and islanded communities. The workshop was organized around three focus areas:</p> <ul> <li>Infrastructure Engineering includes topics such as efficient greenhouses; improved equipment to store and manage intermittent energy loads from renewables; and infrastructure to affordably provide clean drinking water and proper sewage disposal.</li> <li>Environmental Engineering includes topics such as bioaccumulated toxins in subsistence foods, and the high energy levels needed to provide clean water in islanded communities.</li> <li>Society and Economy includes topics such as the cost of food imports, the rising energy requirements (and hence prices) of subsistence practices, and the need for improved security of water sources.</li> </ul> <p>The workshop had six concrete outcomes: identification of new FEW challenges and priorities; new collaborations; solidification of follow-up plans; outreach materials, including a poster and <a href="http://hlfew16.alaska.edu/hlfew16.html" target="_blank">website</a>; identification of FEW &ldquo;grand challenges;&rdquo; and pinpointing of energy as the  largest FEW challenge for high-latitude islanded communities.</p> <p>As part of small-group activities, attendees developed a list of &ldquo;grand challenge&rdquo; questions to guide future research of the FEW nexus at high latitudes, then voted to rank the questions in order of importance. The three largest vote-getters were:</p> <ol> <li>How do we design resilient communities with FEW systems as designed by communities?</li> <li>What are the impacts of climate change on social and cultural practices related to FEW security?</li> <li>How is a changing climate affecting the distribution and access of FEW resources?</li> </ol> <p>Another key conclusion reached by attendees was to rank energy as the most significant of the three challenges. Some participants convincingly argued that low-cost energy production and distribution in high-latitude islanded communities would provide the necessary tools to address both food and water needs.</p> <p>The second event was a June 2017 training and networking session for participants in the Arctic Remote Energy Networks Academy (ARENA), a yearlong program through which 17 individuals from communities in the U.S., Canada, and Greenland learned about rural energy systems through technical instruction, site visits, individual mentoring, and community case study projects. FEW funding provided travel support for 13 people for the event, at which attendees visited renewable energy facilities; attended classroom presentations on microgrid analysis, technologies, and operation; and took part in roundtable discussions with community leaders and project developers. Outputs of the program included energy projects in each participant&rsquo;s community, as well as professional networks established as a result of the program</p> <p>The final event was an April 2018 kickoff meeting of MicroFEWs, a National Science Foundation-funded project that had its origins in discussions at HLFEW 2016. MicroFEWs has the ultimate goal of developing a process through which researchers and community members together characterize how renewable energy infrastructure might impact the FEW nexus in isolated northern communities. To address these questions, MicroFEWS researchers are focusing on three rural communities in Southcentral, Interior and Southwest Alaska (a fourth community was subsequently added as a result of discussions at the meeting). The meeting brought together researchers and community stakeholders to discuss the project, to advance a common understanding of current FEW systems in Alaska, and to develop goals for future activities.
