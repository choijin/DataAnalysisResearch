<AbstractNarration>PI:  Larson, Ronald&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: 1602183&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the proposed research is to develop predictive methods for coating material properties and to even prescribe these properties by designing materials from the molecular level up. The results of this research would find many applications in engineering and in the industry, since the utility of coating materials in everyday life is unequivocal. Most of the objects around us are coated with a material that either enhances their usefulness or their life time (computer and tablet screens, furniture, metallic objects and tools, walls etc.). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While there has been great interest and effort in the area of multi-scale modeling, there have been few, if any, successful predictions of colloidal scale transport properties based on multi-scale modeling starting with atomistic inputs for materials of large-scale commercial interest. Here, it is proposed to integrate a set of methods developed in recent years to allow prediction of the impact of surfactant, polymer, and colloidal composition on the rheological properties of latex coatings. Latex coatings contain surfactant molecules, polymer molecules with hydrophobic "sticker" end groups, and colloidal particles that are bridged by the polymer molecules to form a transient network. The simulation tools to be implemented and integrated are molecular dynamics simulations at the atomistic, coarse-grained (CG) and implicit-solvent CG levels, Brownian dynamics simulations using coarse-grained polymer chains using finitely extensible (FENE) spring models, population balance methods for tracking numbers of bridging polymer chains between pairs of colloidal particles, and Stokesian dynamics methods for computing the hydrodynamic interactions of colloidal particles undergoing shear flow. Also to be exploited are methods of computing free energies of microscopic transitions, such as free energy of transition of a bridging to a looping chain, and free energy of compression of polymer chains bound to colloidal particles. While all of these tools have been developed or exploited in the Larson group over the past decade, and integration of many of the methods has been carried out at the level of thermodynamics, the proposed new research is to map the transport properties of these methods onto each other, so that transport rates determined at the finest levels allow input parameters and time-scales of coarser-grained methods to be specified. The mapping will also be validated and improved upon, through comparison with experimental data. Accomplishment of this project will lead to a set of inter-locking modeling tools that will not only allow prediction of the rheological properties of latex coatings, but will establish a paradigm to be followed for modeling many other complex materials and multi-scale transport processes. Broader impacts include interactions with industry. An outreach to minority students will be undertaken and a Ph.D. student will be recruited and trained both through the work at Michigan and through summer internships at Dow Chemical Company. An open source software package for prediction of the rheological properties of polymer/colloid materials will be developed and international collaborations with Edinburgh University and Durham University at the UK will be established.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The project represents the first multi-scale model of polymer-colloidal networks, with application to the formulation of latex water-borne coatings, used in industry and home applications.  Latex coatings consist of mixtures of colloidal particles and water-soluble polymers that contain end groups, or so-called stickers, that are hydrophobic and therefore bind to the surfaces of the latex particles, to form a network.  The network provides the high viscosity needed by the paint to prevent settling of the latex particles and to prevent dripping or running of the paint after application to a surface. Yet the network is easily broken under shear, allowing the coating to be applied easily to a surface.  The design of the paint must be done carefully to provide the optimal properties, and involves adjustment of the size and concentration and other properties of both the colloidal particles and the polymers.  To date this has been done largely empirically since no quantitative model had been develop that is able to cope with the complexity of the network and the multiple time and length scales of the problem, which extend from the local interactions of polymer stickers with the surfaces of the colloidal particles, to a network of a large enough collection of particles and polymers to represent the network behavior.     Our research under this project has directly tackled this problem through a series of simulation tools.  First, we used a conventional Brownian dynamics simulation that accurately represents the polymer molecules and used this to simulate the structure of polymer loops,  whose two ends are both attached to the particle surface, as well as bridges in which one end is attached to one particle surface and the other end to the surface of a different particle.   While this method gives the structure and interactions of densely coated loops and bridges on particle surfaces, and get give the effective gap-dependent interaction between two such polymer-coated particles, it is not able to simulate realistically a network of such particles bridged by many thousands of polymers.  To cope with this challenge, we developed two novel coarse-grained simulation tools.  The first is a self-consistent field theory (SCFT) of particle structure on particles surfaces and the interaction between a pair of polymer-coated particles, including the effect of polymers bridging the two.  This self-consistent field theory provides a fast method to obtain an inter-particle potential that we were able to show captures correctly the effect interactions between the two particles predicted by the more detailed Brownian dynamics simulations,  but at much cheaper computational costs.     The second tool we developed is a population balance Brownian dynamics(Pop-BD) simulation method that replaces explicit representation of individual polymer molecules by a  set of population balance equations that track the number of bridges connecting neighboring particles as a function of time as the particles move through the solution.  These population balance equations, along with the effective repulsive potential arising from the many loops on the surfaces of the particles, derived by the SCFT, field theory, provides a complete, but fast, simulation package, that can be applied to predict the phase behavior and flow properties of a network of colloidal particles, bridged by polymers.     The development of these methods required development of deep insight into polymer-colloid interactions, and revealed and exploited a number of polymer and colloidal physical phenomena, including polymer loop-to-bridge dynamics, effective colloidal interaction potentials controlled by polymer excluded volume and bridging interactions, and the phase behavior of polymer/colloid mixtures, providing a rich intellectual impact on polymer and colloidal physics.     The novel Pop-BD simulation package has been implemented on an open source programming language,  HOOMD-blue at the University of Michigan, developed by the Glotzer group.  This allows it to be run on large networks of fast GPU computers, greatly speeding the computation, and making the method available to the thousands of HOOMD-blue users.     Other broader impacts of the work include the interactions with Dow Chemical company, which manufactures latex coating materials and is deeply interested in our work.  Monthly meetings with Dow scientists provided impact on commercial understanding and potential design of such materials, and exposure of students and group members to industrial research.  Dow Chemical company has hired three Larson group members in recent years, including two Ph.D. students and a postdoc, resulting from interactions with Dow facilitated through the research work. Dow Chemical also has access to the software designed as part of the research, available to them directly and through access to HOOMD-blue. In addition, two undergraduate students have been trained through the research work.  The faculty member (Larson) and Ph.D. student Alyssa Travitz were also engaged in a summer  outreach to local high school teachers both in 2018 and 2019.  Finally, Larson, was invited as a Higgs Fellow to the University of Edinburgh in the UK to discuss work on colloids and other topics in 2018.
