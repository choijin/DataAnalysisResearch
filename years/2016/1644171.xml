<AbstractNarration>A nontechnical description of the project &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary scientific goal of the project is to test whether Taylor Valley, Antarctica has been eroded significantly by glaciers in the last ~2 million years (Ma).  Taylor Valley is one of the Dry Valleys of the Transantarctic Mountains, which are characterized by low mean annual temperatures, low precipitation, and limited erosion.  These conditions have allowed fragile glacial landforms to be preserved for up to 15 Ma.  Sediment eroded and deposited by glaciers is found on the valley walls and floors, with progressively younger deposits preserved at lower elevations. Scientists can date glacial deposits to understand the process and timing of past glacial erosion.  Previous work in the Dry Valleys region suggested that extremely cold glaciers like Taylor Glacier, a major outlet glacier entering the valleys, were not erosive during the last several million years.  This research will test a new hypothesis that glacial erosion and sediment production beneath Taylor Glacier have been active in the last few million years.  This hypothesis will be tested using a new isotopic dating method called "comminution dating' which determines when fine-grained sediment particles called silt were formed.  If the sediment age is young, then the results will suggest that glacial processes have been more dynamic than previously thought.  Overall, this study will increase our understanding of the nature and extent of past glaciations in Antarctica.  Because the silt produced by erosion sediment is a nutrient for local ecosystems, the results will also shed light on delivery of nutrients to soils, streams, and coastal zones in high polar regions.  This project will be led by an early career scientist and includes training of a Ph.D. student.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A technical description of the project &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is a long-standing scientific controversy about the stability of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet with much evidence centered in the Dry Valleys region of South Victoria Land.  A prevailing view of geomorphologists is that the landscape has been very stable and that the effects of glaciation have been minimal for the past ~15 Ma.   This project will distinguish between two end-member scenarios of glacial erosion and deposition by Taylor Glacier, an outlet glacier of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet that terminates in Taylor Valley in the Dry Valleys region of Antarctica.  In the first scenario, all valley relief is generated prior to 15 Ma when non-polar climates enabled warm-based glaciers to incise and widen ancient river channels. In this case, younger glacial deposits record advances of cold-based glaciers of decreasing ice volume and limited glacial erosion, and sediment generation resulted in glacial deposits composed primarily of older recycled sediments. In the second scenario, selective erosion of the valley floor has continued to deepen Taylor Valley but has not affected the adjacent peaks over the last 2 Ma. In this scenario, the "bathtub rings" of Quaternary glacial deposits situated at progressively lower elevations through time could be due to the lowering of the valley floor by subglacial erosion and with it, production of new sediment which is now incorporated into these deposits. While either scenario would result in the present-day topography, they differ in the implied evolution of regional glacial ice volume over time and the timing of both valley relief production and generation of fine-grained particles.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The two scenarios will be tested by placing time constraints on fine particle production using U-series comminution dating. This new geochronologic tool exploits the loss of 234U due to alpha-recoil. The deficiency in 234U only becomes detectable in fine-grained particles with a sufficiently high surface-area-to-volume ratio which can incur appreciable 234U loss.  The timing of comminution and particle size controls the magnitude of 234U loss.  While this geochronologic tool is in its infancy, the scientific goal of this proposal can be achieved by resolving between ancient and recently comminuted fine particles, a binary question that the preliminary modeling and measured data show is readily resolved.</AbstractNarration>
