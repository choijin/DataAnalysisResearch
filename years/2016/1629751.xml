<AbstractNarration>A request is made to fund additional and back-up Shipboard Scientific Support Equipment for the R/V Pelican, a 116 foot Coastal vessel operated by the Louisiana Universities Marine Consortium (LUMCON) as part of the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS) research fleet. The vessel is owned by the LUMCON and the mission of the ship is to support funded science research in the Gulf of Mexico.  With this proposal, LUMCON provides technical descriptions and rationale for the acquisition of the following equipment:&lt;br/&gt;       &lt;br/&gt;1) Hawboldt SPRE-2244/RS Appendix A&amp;B compliant CTD Winch $205,800&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts &lt;br/&gt;The principal impact of the present proposal is under Merit Review Criterion 2 of the Proposal Guidelines (NSF 13-589). It provides infrastructure support for scientists to use the vessel and its shared-use instrumentation in support of their NSF-funded oceanographic research projects (which individually undergo separate review by the relevant research program of NSF).  The acquisition,  maintenance and operation of shared-use instrumentation allows NSF-funded researchers from any US university or lab access to working, calibrated instruments for their research, reducing the cost of that research, and expanding the base of potential researchers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Final Report for Award 1629751  Funding was approved by NSF on July 20, 2016 to allocate $205,800 to Louisiana Universities Marine Consortium to purchase a Hawboldt SPRE-2244/RS Appendix A&amp;B compliant CTD winch for use aboard the R/V Pelican.    The R/V Pelican was designed and outfitted to conduct a variety of oceanographic research missions. The reliability, utility and seaworthiness of this vessel have been well demonstrated. The R/V Pelican successfully conducts scientific trawling, large box core sampling, thirty-foot piston cores, shallow seismic surveys, current meter array and benthic boundary array deployment and recovery. The R/V Pelican has also successfully conducted plankton sampling, hydrographic casts with CTD-rosette system and underway sampling with SCS water sampling systems.  The R/V Pelican is operated by Louisiana Universities Marine Consortium (LUMCON) as an Oceanographic Research Vessel as designated by the United States Coast Guard and is maintained as an American Bureau of Shipping (ABS) load line vessel. The Consortium is a member of UNOLS and the R/V Pelican is a designated UNOLS vessel. The vessel is available for legitimate research and education programs of Consortium members, state and federal agencies, other nonprofit groups, and oceanographic industries.    The cost of the winch was $293,000 with $205,800 funded by NSF and $87,200 funded by Louisiana Universities Marine Consortium (LUMCON). The winch was immediately ordered and delivered June 15, 2017.  LUMCON delivered 5,000 meters of .322 electro-mechanical cable for spooling onto the winch.    The winch was installed aboard the RV PELICAN using institute funds during a maintenance period in March 2018. Commissioning of the winch was completed by Hawboldt representatives prior to a March 19th cruise aboard the RV PELICAN.  During this March 19thcruise, the winch was extensively tested and was successful.    Currently, the winch has been use during each research cruise since it was installed and the R/V Pelican has been at sea for 137 days since March of 2018.  It is estimated that 240 CTD casts have been conducted during this time period.  The winch has performed flawlessly and is an asset to the vessel?s scientific operations and missions.
