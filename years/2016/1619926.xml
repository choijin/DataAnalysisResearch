<AbstractNarration>This award funds the research activities of Professors Eric D'Hoker, Michael Gutperle, and Per Kraus at the University of California, Los Angeles.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;String theory remains the most promising candidate for the unification of the fundamental forces of nature within a framework consistent with quantum mechanics, the physics of the microscopic world.   Developments in string theory over the past few decades have spawned progress in many other fields, and the subject continues to attract and inspire some of the brightest graduate students and postdoctoral researchers in theoretical physics, thereby serving the national interest by promoting the progress of basic scientific research and training the next generation of scientists.  The proposed research aims to deepen our understanding of string theory, both through sophisticated calculations at the frontier of string theory and through the exploration of new theoretical ideas associated with possible unexpected behaviors for our universe. This project will also have significant broader impacts.  The PI's actively mentor graduate students and postdoctoral researchers. This includes holding group meetings and organizing conferences with other universities in Southern California, the latter serving to introduce junior physicists at UCLA to the broader community of researchers.  The PI's are also involved in outreach to the general public, including visiting local elementary, middle, and high schools, and interacting with the students.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At a more technical level, Professor D'Hoker plans to advance the subject of superstring perturbation theory, focusing on two-loop amplitudes.  Applications include deducing new terms in the low-energy effective action of supergravity, and studying implications for the theory at high energy. Professor Gutperle will investigate aspects of entanglement entropy, including the effects associated with non-local operators and spatial defects, metric structures associated with entanglement, and the concrete calculation of the modular Hamiltonian.  Professor Kraus proposes further investigations into higher-spin gravity and its relation to the conformal-block structure of theories with non-linear symmetry algebras. He also plans to continue his study of the structure of black hole microstates.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The outcomes of the grant "Topics in String Theory", held from 2016 to 2019 by principal investigators Eric D'Hoker, Michael Gutperle, and Per Kraus at the Mani L. Bhaumik Institute for Theoretical Physics at UCLA are in the area of theoretical particle physics, string theory, and black hole physics.  The outcomes of the intellectual merit part of the grant include results include the following.  Due to string theory effects, Einstein gravity receives small corrections which may be relevant to future experimental detection of string theory. One outcome is the development of a mathematical framework to evaluate such corrections systematically in terms of so-called modular graph functions, which associate a modular function to a certain type of Feynman graph. Modular functions and forms arise ubiquitously in Mathematics, for example in the proof of Fermat's Last Theorem. Important progress was made in understanding modular graph functions and in using them to evaluate the one-loop amplitude for the scattering of gravitons.  While our current understanding of the physics of particles and their electro-weak and strong interactions is in terms of the Standard Model based on quantum field theory in four-dimensional space-time, string theory predicts that quantum field theories also exist in five and six dimensions. One outcome of this grant is the quantitative study of five-dimensional quantum field theories, in their superconformal phase,  using holographic duality in Type IIB string theory. The holographic dual supergravity solutions were obtained exactly using sophisticated methods of integrable systems, and their properties were related to various brane-web constructions of the five-dimensioal theories, finding perfect agreement whenever a comparison could be made.  A special case of the holographic correspondence involves the duality between quantum gravity in three spacetime dimensions and conformal field theories in two spacetime dimensions.  In these dimensions the conformal symmetry group is infinite dimensional, which can be used to elucidate various aspects of the duality.   One outcome in this direction was a demonstration that thermal correlation functions computed on the two sides  will agree provided that the low energy theory in the bulk has a sufficiently sparse spectrum.  Another outcome involved developing the relation between gravitational Wilson lines in anti-de Sitter spacetime and their dual representation in the conformal field theory.  Such Wilson lines were used to compute the late time behavior of correlation functions in thermal AdS.  Additionally, universal bounds were established on the effect of heavy operators exchanges on correlation functions of light operators in conformal field theory.    The outcomes of the broader impact of this grant include extensive mentoring and training of graduate students and postdocs; disseminating research results in leading peer-reviewed journals; co-organizing the bi-annual Southern California String Seminar; presenting lectures at summer schools; presenting invited talks at international conferences and workshops; and collaborating with mathematicians and giving invited lectures at interdisciplinary conferences on physics and mathematics.
