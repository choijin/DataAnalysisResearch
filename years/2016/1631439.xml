<AbstractNarration>1631439-Jabbarzadeh&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is a profound need for bone regeneration strategies due to trauma and various musculoskeletal diseases. Current approaches to treat bone defects are associated with limitations such as shortage of donors and risk of disease transmission. Strategies built on tissue engineering offer alternative avenues to repair and regenerate bone tissue. The transfer of tissue engineering methodology from the lab to the clinic is limited by the inadequate vascular growth and host inflammatory response.

Through a systematic investigation of the effects of resveratrol on the interactions between immune cells and stem cells, this research will pave the way for a solution to the major clinical problem of bone regeneration. Successful completion of this work will impact a wide range of patients suffering from debilitating musculoskeletal conditions.

Current approaches to treat bone defects include autografts and allografts that are associated with limitations such as shortage of donors and risk of disease transmission. Strategies built on tissue engineering offer alternative approaches to repair and regenerate tissues. The transfer of tissue engineering methodology from the lab to the clinic is limited by the failure to adequately vascularize scaffolds following implantation. The goal of this project is to promote the neogenesis of bone and supporting vasculature in a synchronized manner similar to the physiological process of bone growth during maturation. The project is transformative in nature in that contrary to conventional methods, instead of trying to counteract inflammation, the proposed approach establishes the proof of principle for the use of resveratrol, a natural polyphenol, to regulate immune cell behavior and use their secreted signaling molecules to drive vasculogenesis and bone formation. The approach involves the use of (i) a resveratrol, a natural polyphenol found commonly in grapes and berries, (ii) a biomimetic scaffold with native bone extracellular matrix protein components, and (iii) mesenchymal stem cells. Rapid perfusion throughout an implanted scaffold is a critical issue for engineering the repair of a wide variety of tissues in addition to bone. The study delineate the potential of resveratrol as a potent physiological cue to control inflammatory response with many applications beyond the fields of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine (e.g. tumor inflammation). The educational goals include development of an elective course on principles of stem cells engineering and promoting participation of students from underrepresented groups in the field of biomedical engineering.</AbstractNarration>
