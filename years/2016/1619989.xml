<AbstractNarration>This workshop will bring together researchers from around the world to identify and explore topics at the frontier of nonequilibrium quantum systems. This topic is linked to profound open problems in condensed matter and statistical physics. Recent technical advances in both experimental and theoretical techniques have led to a spate of exciting developments in this area. The topics covered will include nonequilibrium transitions; dynamics during and after a "quench"; thermalization and the approach to steady state; and dynamics in the presence of a driving potential. This workshop, whose results will appear in a formal report, will capture the excitement and promise of this rapidly growing field of research.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The purpose of this award was to contribute partial financial support for a scientific workshop organized and hosted by the Rice Center for Quantum Materials in May, 2016.  The topic of the workshop was "Interacting Quantum Systems Out of Equilibrium".  This is a frontier topic in physics today, and the stakes are high, as the competition between different ordered states can lead to dramatic effects (high temperature superconductivity, unusual magnetism, phase transitions between different quantum states) of fundamental and potential technological interest.   The workshop took place over two days in Houston, Texas, incorporating 30 minute invited speaker talks (13 the first day, 6 the second) and an extended poster and discussion session the second day.   The intellectual merit of the workshop was in the discussions and scientific cross-fertilzation that resulted from bringing together of both experimental and theoretical experts in this exciting open topic.  Nonequilibrium quantum systems are linked to profound open problems in condensed matter and statistical physics.  Recent technical advances in both experimental and theoretical techniques have led to a spate of exciting developments in this area.  The fifteen invited speakers included experts in electronic measurements, ultracold atomic gases, and ultrafast optical response of materials.  These talks led to extensive discussions, identifying and articulating critical challenges in nonequilibrium quantum systems across the disparate experimental platforms.  A particular intellectual outcome was the seeding of new research collaborations among the participants, on topics including quench dynamics (responses to sudden perturbations) in otpically (THz frequency) pumped superconductors; the magnetic response of ultracold atomic lattices in response to strobe-like optical modulation of the lattice; and the conductivity response of carbon nanostructures to the optical excitation of particular vibrational modes.  The broader impact of the workshop was primarily in the interactions between younger researchers (undergraduates, grad students, and postdocs) and established thought leaders in the discipline.  The workshop was well attended by researchers from area universities (University of Houston, University of Texas, Texas A&amp;M, Tulane), including minority-serving institutions (Sam Houston State, Texas Southern).  The poster session provided an opportunity for junior researchers to present their work and interact with top experts in the field.  The content of the meeting was reported and discussed on the PI's blog (http://nanoscale.blogspot.com/2016/05/interacting-quantum-systems-driven-out.html and subsequent links).  The invited speakers' slides are available for download via the Rice Center for Quantum Materials webpage, under "past events".
