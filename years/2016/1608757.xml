<AbstractNarration>This project is funded by the Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program of the Division of Chemistry at the National Science Foundation. Professor Stephen Weber and colleagues at the University of Pittsburgh address limitations of liquid chromatography. The team is improving the ability of liquid chromatography techniques to distinguish one substance from another, as well as improving the ability to measure trace concentrations in a variety of samples.  Chromatography is based on the principle of partitioning, the tendency of a substance to prefer an oily substance to water-based solution.  The outcomes of this project include obtaining more and better information from samples with lower cost and lower environmental burden than has been previously realized. Collaborations with scientists in the fields of proteomics (for example, health, pharmaceuticals, and biochemistry research) and two-dimensional liquid chromatography (for example, pharmaceuticals, chemical industry, agriculture, and the environment) demonstrate the effectiveness of the project goals. The broader impacts are evidenced in that improvements in chromatographic processes that are useful across many fields and applications. Liquid chromatography is used in virtually every industry, for example, environmental, pharmaceutical, nutritional, forensic, toxicology, polymers, chemicals, and cosmetics. A Girl Scout merit badge project is also being developed by Dr. Weber to explore chromatography methods and its uses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project uses temperature control of the column to achieve greater solute focusing and to control retention in a predictable way. Retention enthalpies, which control the sensitivity of a particular compound to changes in temperature, are determined for a number of related organic compounds. These data are used to determine molecular fragment enthalpies. The temperature dependence of the retention of novel compounds are then predicted. Software to predict chromatographic behavior in the face of changing column temperature aids in chromatographic method development. The temperature control, when used to aid solute focusing, significantly improves concentration detection limits.</AbstractNarration>

It is widely and successfully applied because it is eminently flexible. The general approach can be adapted to almost any question of, "What is the composition of this stuff?" This project has been focused on increasing the power of using temperature in so-called liquid chromatography, one branch of chromatography. Chromatography separates the components of a small sample of a mixture by passing the mixture through a tube, called a "column", containing a porous medium, called a "stationary phase". In liquid chromatography, the mixture is introduced as a solution and carried through the column dissolved in a liquid called the "mobile phase". The individual components of the mixture spend time in both mobile and stationary phases thus establishing an average velocity through the column. In an ideal circumstance, all the components have different average velocities and thus come out of the column at different times. The components are typically detected by one of many electronic means so that each component’s passage out of the column is registered in sequence. The detection is quantitative, so how much there is of each component can be established. The problem is that the velocities of some components may be the same. The only way to make them different is to alter the conditions in the column. Our rationale was that it is very easy to change the temperature of the critical component in a chromatography system, the column which includes the mobile and stationary phases as well as the components of the sample, in principle, but in practice it is not easy, and changing temperatures is slow.
