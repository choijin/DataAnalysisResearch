<AbstractNarration>Building and transportation are two essential and interactive elements for the society. Various means of transportation convey occupants among different buildings/communities via modern transportation networks. Occupants are central to operation of buildings and communities, especially in terms of energy use. Predictive information on building occupancy can be dramatically beneficial for improving the efficiency of building energy management. As occupants are transported to buildings/communities, the occupant arrival information can be predicted to through Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), enabled by vehicle-to-infrastructure communication and data analytics. This is expected to significantly benefit the optimization of energy management for buildings and communities. For occupant-carrying plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs), such predictive arrival information can also help optimize the charging management and vehicle-to-grid operation. This EArly-concept Grant for Exploratory Research (EAGER) award supports an exploratory research on integrating the ITS to energy management of Smart Communities, i.e. enhancing the building/community energy management with ITS predicted occupancy information. The results of this research will address major fundamental issues relevant to the integration of ITS and Smart Community, which will benefit the technology development. The findings of the project will be disseminated to a broader community via a dedicated website showing animations and video clips based on simulation results. In addition, seminars and workshops for government, K-16 faculty and students, and general public are planned to illustrate and disseminate the results of the research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two scenarios of community level energy management are used to demonstrate the potential benefits brought by such community-ITS integration: 1) predictive energy management of community/district cooling system under demand response, enhanced with aggregated stochastic estimation of arrival time of upcoming building occupants; 2) decentralized charging management of parking-lot PEV enhanced with stochastic estimation of arrival time and arrival battery state-of-charge (SOC) of upcoming PEVs. With the moving-horizon prediction of in-coming occupant/vehicle arrival information enabled by ITS integration, stochastic prediction of arrival time will be performed, as well as the PEV arrival SOCs. Through aggregation of the stochastic arrival time estimation, dynamic data-driven modeling of occupant-to-load relations, and weather information, a stochastic model predictive control (MPC) strategy is applied for district cooling of community buildings with a central chilled-water plant, under demand response operation. An important issue of uncertainty propagation will be addressed in order to gain the understanding on how the stochastic estimate of occupant arrival information would affect the ultimate performance of the stochastic MPC and stochastic optimization for the energy management problems.</AbstractNarration>

In order to address these research challenges, the following work has been carried out during the project period.  1) A high-fidelity dynamic simulation model is developed in Modelica for an illustrative smart community system, which includes a chilled-water plant with three chillers in parallel, three buildings with water-based air-handling units (AHUs) for ventilation and air conditioning, and electric vehicle charging station at each building. Such simulation model allows design and evaluation of the model predictive controllers (MPCs) designed in this project.  2) A scenario-based stochastic model predictive control (SMPC) framework is developed for a smart community system that contains a multi-chiller chilled-water plant, three buildings and electric vehicle (EV) charging stations. The SMPC controller is designed to minimize the total electricity consumption for the smart community that includes both time-of-use (TOU) and demand charges, with the thermal comfort regulation and EV charging demand satisfaction.  3) As for the design of the SMPC based energy management controller, a time-varying aggregated uncertainty model is developed for the arrival time and arriving state-of-charge (SOC) for the upcoming electrified vehicles, which is then incorporated into the SMPC controller design framework. An uncertainty propagation analysis is then conducted to evaluate the impacts of the forecast inaccuracy on the possible violations for the constraints of power limit and zone temperature regulation. The results reveal that the frequency of constraint violations increases steadily with worse forecast accuracy, while the ‘violation depth’ does not change much.  4) A distributed MPC (DMPC) controller is designed for the integrated energy management community, in which the three buildings and the chilled-water plant are treated as individual agents. The simulation results are shown to be reasonably close to the energy performance of a centralized MPC benchmark.  During the project period, the PI and his graduate research assistants have prepared two conference papers, with one paper selected a finalist for the Best Student Paper Award for the Energy Systems Technical Committee at the 2018 ASME Dynamic System and Control Conference. Also, two journal manuscripts are in preparation for submission.  As for the broader impacts of the project, the research outcomes have also been disseminated to the public at the poster session of the 2018 Texas System Day, as well as in a seminar in the Mechanical Engineering Department at The University Texas at Dallas.
