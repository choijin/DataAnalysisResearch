<AbstractNarration>Traditionally, a signal is measured by acquiring every component in the signal and then compressing the signal with an appropriate computational algorithm. For example, digital cameras capture an image with a huge number of pixels and then a compression scheme such as JPEG is used to reduce the size of the digital image for storage or dissemination. In many applications, the costs and challenges associated with acquiring measurements are considerable. In compressed sensing and matrix completion, the measurement process is altered in order to drastically reduce the number of measurements, but the signal reconstruction process is necessarily more difficult. Compressed sensing and matrix completion transfer the workload from the measurement process to computational resources dedicated to the signal reconstruction. Typical applications include compressive radar, geophysical data analysis, medical imaging, and computer vision. This project will take a holistic approach to data acquisition and algorithm development for compressed sensing and matrix completion where theoretical guarantees often rely on computationally expensive subroutines and apply to computationally burdensome measurement processes. Increased efficiency can be achieved through sparse measurement operators, relaxed subroutine requirements in iterative greedy algorithms, and the implementation of these algorithms on computation accelerating hardware.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Compressed sensing combines the acts of signal acquisition and compression into a single operation. Computationally efficient algorithms then produce accurate approximations to sparse signals by exploiting the underlying simplicity that the signal has relatively few important components. Matrix completion similarly exploits the simplicity of the target matrix having only a few independent columns; in other words, one recovers a low rank matrix from a limited number of measurements. While leading greedy algorithms for compressed sensing and matrix completion have theoretical guarantees defining the number of measurements required for accurately recovering the underlying low dimensional signal, these guarantees require many more measurements than practical for applications. Furthermore, many of the algorithms employ theoretically useful but computationally expensive subroutines. Observed performance of more computationally efficient measurement operators encourages the adoption of techniques in practice that lack worst case, uniform guarantees for acquisition and reconstruction. This project seeks to balance the competing desires for theoretical guarantees and fast, efficient algorithms. The project will pursue theoretically viable algorithms which are also practically useful and provide solutions to linear inverse problems in reasonable amounts of computational effort including power, time, and affordable hardware. At the same time, establishing empirical performance characteristics for computationally efficient measurement operators and recovery algorithms which lack precise guarantees will help guide practitioners and theorists in future research. To provide near real time solutions to these computationally intensive algorithms, the project will also further accelerate computation by designing and disseminating algorithm implementations which exploit the massively parallel computations available on high performance computing graphics processing units.</AbstractNarration>

Compressed sensing and matrix completion transfer the workload from the measurement process to computational resources dedicated to the signal reconstruction. Typical applications include compressive radar, geophysical data analysis, medical imaging, and computer vision.   Compressed sensing combines the acts of signal acquisition and compression into a single operation, typically by using a randomized sensing technique.  While some applications have the flexibility to engineer the theoretical randomness into the sensing process, it is highly desired to reduce the reliance on randomness. Reconstruction algorithms then produce accurate approximations to sparse signals by exploiting the underlying simplicity that the signal has relatively few important components. This project has produced three significant outcomes.     Rank Aware Row Thresholding.  When sensing multiple similar signals, it can be advantageous to attempt the reconstruction of the signals simultaneously.  When the multiple signals share a similar underlying simplicity in that the location of the important information is consistent across the signals, algorithms can be designed to exploit this additional information and thereby reconstruct all the signals more efficiently.  This project studied the theoretical underpinnings of this phenomenon for the ubiquitous hard thresholding operator.  When combining the signals into a matrix, the shared information pattern is modeled by row sparsity where only a few rows contain information.  This project provided theoretical, average case understanding for the number of measurements required for simultaneous reconstruction of multiple independent signals, connected these results to known results on related algorithms, and demonstrated empirically that the theory closely predicts performance.   Deterministic Frames for Compressed Sensing.  Much work has been done to find deterministic matrices that can be used for dimensionality reduction problems including compressed sensing.  Other researchers showed a collection of nine deterministic frames which perform well in compressed sensing tasks.  This project provides the first software library, DetFraCS, for these deterministic frames in both a standard implementation and in a massively accelerated, parallelized implementation for graphics processing units.  This freely available software can be incorporated into other computational work including compressed sensing software.   Deterministic Frames and Conjugate Gradient Iterative Hard Thresholding.  It was shown previously that sensing signals using the deterministic frames in DetFraCS for signal acquisition and then using convex optimization for signal reconstruction is as effective in practice as performing the compressed sensing process with random matrices.  To improve efficiency in the recovery process and thereby have both deterministic sensing and highly efficient reconstruction, this project combined the deterministic frames in DetFraCS with Conjugate Gradient Iterative Hard Thresholding (CGIHT), a highly efficient greedy algorithm for compressed sensing.  Rather than matching the theoretical predictions, combining deterministic frames with CGIHT often results in substantially exceeding theoretical guarantees.  The attached figure shows examples of three combinations of deterministic sensing with CGIHT reconstruction exceeding theoretical expectations of random sensing with convex optimization reconstruction.    Broader Impacts.  In addition to the scientific advances described above, a primary impact of this work is the training of undergraduate students as computational scientists through their full involvement in the research.  This project included five undergraduate coauthors who have all continued on in computational science in graduate programs, national laboratories, and industry.
