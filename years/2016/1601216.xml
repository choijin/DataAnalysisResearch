<AbstractNarration>Technician training and industry practices have not yet kept pace with sustainability initiatives recommending reduced landfill use. This project will advance knowledge across multiple fields and industries, and provide technicians with the foundational knowledge, skills and abilities needed to handle composite waste stream materials, treating them as a new resource. The project will create a platform to develop protocols and best management processes with industry while simultaneously creating curriculum scalable to certificate and associate degree pathways for student learners and incumbent technicians.  Community college students, graduate students, university and community college faculty, and industry partners will work alongside one another in an educational environment to define the functions necessary for technicians to properly work with composite waste stream material. The focus is on technician education in an emerging demand field, and will enhance educational infrastructure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Skagit Valley College (SVC) and The University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) will collaborate to create curriculum for composite technicians working with composite waste stream material. With industry subject matter experts, the project team will develop protocols and processes for the identification and proper handling of recaptured fiberglass and carbon fiber composite material; develop curriculum modules to educate technicians; and develop a template for a database learning tool to identify and track waste stream material. Project results will be disseminated nationally and internationally through ATE Central, the community and technical college system, the four-year university system, open source formats and professional and standards-based organizations. Internationally, companies are seeking the methods and means to reduce waste and waste management costs, as highlighted by the European Union initiative Zero Waste Communities. This project will show linkage between composites recycling and both environmental and economic benefits.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Composites Recycling Technician Education Program (CRTEP) &ndash; a collaborative project between Skagit Valley College, the University of Alabama at Birmingham, Peninsula College, and the National Resource Center for Materials Education (MatEdu) at Edmonds Community College &ndash; has created a foundational initial curriculum that addresses the emerging need for composite and material science technicians who identify, sort, handle, catalogue, and use composite fiberglass and carbon fiber waste stream material in manufacturing settings. As an open educational resource, students, technicians, and industry firms can use CRTEP curriculum modules to better understand composite scrap materials as a viable resource to be used in new applications rather than as a material to be diverted to a landfill.   Each of the curriculum modules &ndash; 1. Overview on Materials Recycling, Composites 2. Manufacturing Methods: Thermoplastics and Thermoplastics, and 3. Sources of Scrap Materials in Production Facilities &ndash; have been populated with lectures that are intended to be delivered in approximately 50 minutes each in an on-ground, hybrid, or online modality. Instructors at various levels (K-12, community and technical colleges, universities) can take the appropriate level of content from the various modules and utilize it in their curriculum. Similarly, industry can use relevant portions from the collection of curricula and adapt it to professional development and training programs as composite recycling becomes increasingly prevalent in the workforce training landscape.   Curriculum developed by the project team has been disseminated through the MatEdu website. The published versions of CRTEP Module 1 and CRTEP Module 2 are available in PowerPoint and PDF form for educators and industry to use for training purposes.  Concurrently, the CRTEP project team developed a beta version of an internet-based, searchable, database learning tool &ndash; the Composites Scrap Database (CSD) &ndash; which contains relevant data of composite scrap materials.
