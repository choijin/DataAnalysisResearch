<AbstractNarration>A request is made to fund additional and back-up equipment on the R/V Marcus Langseth, a 235? Global seismic vessel with general oceanographic capabilities. The vessel is owned by NSF and operated by Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory of Columbia University under a cooperative agreement. The Langseth is different than other vessels in the Academic Fleet in that it is a designated National Facility. It provides a unique combination of capabilities for imaging the oceans, the seafloor and the solid earth beneath the sea. It is the only vessel in the word dedicated to academic research that is capable of conducting 3D seismic surveys as well as extended offset 2D surveys. The tuned, linear source array, consisting of up to 36 air-guns, with a total capacity of 6,600 cu in is also unique asset of this vessel. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 2015, R/V Langseth completed 194 days, 130 (67%) of which were NSF funded. In 2016, the schedule shows 165 days, all of which are for NSF. Oceanographic Instrumentation requested in this proposal includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Kongsberg Seapath 330 $44,320 &lt;br/&gt;Gun Umbilical and Utility Winches Wireless Controls $96,959 &lt;br/&gt;Two SEAL Streamer Communication Units $56,160 &lt;br/&gt;      $197,439 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts &lt;br/&gt;The principal impact of the present proposal is under Merit Review Criterion 2 of the Proposal Guidelines (NSF 13-589). It provides infrastructure support for scientists to use the vessel and its shared-use instrumentation in support of their NSF-funded oceanographic research projects (which individually undergo separate review by the relevant research program of NSF).  The acquisition,  maintenance and operation of shared-use instrumentation allows NSF-funded researchers from any US university or lab access to working, calibrated instruments for their research, reducing the cost of that research, and expanding the base of potential researchers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The 2016 Ocean Instrumentation award funded 3 critical packages of new science system equipment and upgrades for the R/V Marcus G. Langseth.  The first was the purchase of a Sercel Streamer Communication Unit and associated equipment that alllows a towed marine seismic hyrophone streamer greater than 10km in length to broadcase data down the streamer cable back to the ship. The new Sercel 408 marine seismic system installed in 2015 allows for towed streamers up to 15km in length so such units are required.   The second science package is a replacement for and upgrade of our satellite navigation unit. A Kongsberg SeaPath 330 unit replaces an unsupported and failing SeaPath 200.  This satellite navigation unit is a critical piece of equipment that allows great accuracy in locating the vessel and the towed marine seismic equipment and acquired seismic data.  The new SeaPath 330 has much improved accuracy and compatibility with other equipment on the R/V Langseth.  The 3rd science system upgrade was the addition of wireless controls for the four source control winches that deploy and retrieve  the sound sources during marine seismic acquisition.  The new Rapp-Hydema controls integrate into the ship wide wireless controls already in place and allow for much safer and efficient control of the source control winches.
