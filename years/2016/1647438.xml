<AbstractNarration>General Abstract&lt;br/&gt;This project investigates what happens when individuals gain legal rights.  The work seeks to determine whether these individuals exhibit increased trust of the state and therefore increase their political participation, or, alternatively, find that these individuals disengage from the state. This study seeks to understand whether the formal recognition of a right -- in particular, a formal property right to land -- affects an individual's incentives to engage in politics. The PI conducts a cross-national analysis of three rural land-titling programs. These titling policies offer a unique opportunity to study how an often marginalized group, small-holding farmers, react when the state formally grants them a legal property right. This study is poised to make a meaningful contribution to the fields of political science and legal studies. These areas have long recognized the potential of legal rights to legitimize the state or spark political mobilization, but have not explored the relationship between the formal recognition of rights and the corresponding influence on political attitudes and behavior. This project will also evaluate the effectiveness of proposed land ownership formalization efforts, helping to distinguish meaningful extensions of rights from ineffective ones. Additionally, the study can also provide evidence on whether the recognition of victims' rights can promote reconstruction and build trust toward state institutions in the aftermath of armed conflict.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Abstract&lt;br/&gt;This research investigates whether the extension of a formal, legal right causes an individual to trust in and/or engage more with the state. This study seeks to understand whether the formal recognition of a formal property right to land changes an individual's incentives to engage in politics. Despite the centrality of legal rights in normative and social movement theories, two significant questions remain unresolved. First, does a legal right itself, as a symbolic justification of a claim, have an effect on political behavior beyond the underlying endowment or entitlement the right protects? Secondly, do rights create an incentive to participate disengage politically?  Scholars debate the power of rights-based claims to promote political mobilization and to engender political change. Indeed, if receiving a formal right increases the right-bearer's feeling of security over an interest, there may be little incentive to engage in "costly" political activities. However, others argue that rights are powerful symbols, and question why they incentivize mobilization in some instances, but dampen participation in others.  This project uses a multi-method, cross-national research design that combines analysis of qualitative and quantitative data from three rural land-titling programs. These programs provide an opportunity to study a specific change in legal status, yet does not significantly alter the underlying distribution of land, thereby isolating the impact of the change in legal rights.  This funding will sponsor the field research data collection through focus groups and small-holding farmers in rural villages. These new data will help to interpret the results from statistical analyses on land formalization.  Notably they will provide important insight into the causal mechanisms that underlie any effect associated with changes in the status of rights recognition. In turn, this will contribute to the study's impact on our theoretical and empirical understanding of the influence of rights on individual behavior.</AbstractNarration>

However, this increase in political engagement occurred only in areas with weak local institutions (such as courts and police), that could not adequately protect property rights. In areas with strong institutions that effectively guaranteed rights, land titling had either no effect or lead to a decrease in political participation.

The interviews uncovered that former legal titles were highly significant for peasant farmers, and that the importance of the title was not dependent on the strength of local institutions, a farmer&rsquo;s trust in the government, or expectations that the state could actually protect property rights. Rather, titles have an important symbolic effect for peasant farmers, particularly those that had little or no access to the formal legal system or state institutions. This symbolic impact, I argue, incentivizes beneficiaries of land titling to engage more in politics because they feel more legitimate in making claims toward the state when they have a formal right. However, this change in behavior is only limited to areas of weak state institutions because those are precisely the areas that these new, formal property rights are most under threat.

It shows that property rights are important not only because they can increase tenure security, but because they potentially empower citizens to make more claims against the state and engage more actively in politics.

This research also shows that programs altering the legal rights of citizens, such as land titling can have impacts that are counterintuitive, by provoking the greatest response in areas where the state is least present.
