<AbstractNarration>This project develops a high-capacity, high-performing storage system closely matched to the identified needs of climate science, but also of interest to a wide range of research and engineering fields such as brain and behavior research, high-energy physics, renewable energy, genomics, bioinformatics, computational chemistry, and the study of dark matter.  The two-tiered design of the storage system is consistent with best practices and would maximize research capacity and utilization.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The effort would create a distributed, shareable and parallel cluster running the BeeGFS file system (a European development), delivering about 1.8 PB (usable) storage and capable of up to 5GB/sec of streaming performance.  The project would support twelve science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) projects in a broad range of disciplines; co-investigators in mechanical, environmental, civil and aerospace engineering, computer science, and biology are participating.  The results would improve input-output operations associated with a number of research and engineering computation bottlenecks: parallel sequential writing during distributed-parallel geochemical, computational fluid dynamics, and structural mechanics simulations; new file creation during real-time data acquisition; and random read operations during post-processing and visualization.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This NSF CC* Storage award has provided those San Diego State University (SDSU) faculty and students who are engaged in computational science and engineering, with sufficient storage capacity for long-term data archival, and a resource for implementing parallel I/O in distributed-parallel numerical simulations on HPC clusters. Since the award date of June 1, 2017, this CC* Storage award has facilitated the publication of thirteen peer-reviewed journal and conference papers; nine invited talks, sessions, workshops, and panels; two published datasets for training machine-learning architectures; and two journal articles currently under review. Moreover, this CC* Storage award has fostered research and training opportunities for the PI and the doctoral, masters, and undergraduate students of the PI and Co-PIs. The PI has been awarded three consecutive 10-week summer research fellowships at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) in 2019, 2020, and again in 2021. During the summer of 2019, the PI brought four students, two undergraduate computer engineering students from an underrepresented group, one doctoral student, and another doctoral student of a Co-PI, also from an underrepresented group, to work in the LBNL Applied Numerical Algorithms Group. During this experience, the team worked together on the LBNL <em>Chombo</em> framework for solving solute mass and energy transport phenomena, and the LBNL <em>CrunchFlow</em> framework for modeling multicomponent reactive flow. Software development for this research effort is taking place on SDSU HPC systems that use the storage cluster funded through this award for both data archival and parallel I/O during MPI-based computation. This CC* Storage award has also enabled transformational and collaborative research that promotes health equity and well-being for underrepresented communities. NIH funded pilot projects through SDSU&rsquo;s HealthLINK Center for Transdisciplinary Health Disparities Research promote a transdisciplinary approach to minority health and health disparities research. Selected pilot projects are utilizing the storage cluster for dataset generation through numerical simulation, dataset postprocessing, and long-term archival. In addition, researchers are using the storage cluster to maintain electronic protected health information (ePHI), protected under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) Security Rule. The HealthLINK Center is part of the national Research Centers in Minority Institution (RCMI) Program and was funded by a 5-year, $19.9 million grant from the National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities (NIMHD), part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). The storage cluster resource funded through this award has supported numerous additional awarded proposals. In particular, the storage cluster is currently providing storage support for projects recently awarded by the Office of Naval Research (ONR), the Department of Transportation (DoT), Department of Energy (DoE), and NSF Office of Advanced Cyberinfrastructure (OAC) through CC* Compute award 2019194. The DoT award will involve storing real-time near-collision video segments captured from cameras deployed at traffic intersections in the City of Chula Vista, California.</p> <p>The storage cluster acquired under this award has been used to improve the runtime of climate science drivers that simulate geologic carbon storage, coastal ocean, and atmospheric modeling.

By deploying BeeGFS on the cluster and linking with the PnetCDF and MPI-IO libraries, we have significantly decreased time spent saving data to disk during parallel-distributed numerical simulations.  Predicting physical processes that mitigate greenhouse gas emissions through numerical simulation achieves a greater societal goal of managing climate change.  SDSU is leading efforts in the study of simulating subsurface CO2 injection, geologic CO2 sequestration, and greenhouse gas flux measurement.  Geologic CO2 sequestration in deep subsurface reservoirs is a promising technique to reduce the impact of anthropogenic CO2 production on the climate.  Funding of this award will ultimately benefit society and contribute to the societal outcome of understanding, predicting, and moderating atmospheric greenhouse gas concentration.  This CC* Storage award has led to an increase in campus-wide partnerships between computational scientists, mechanical engineers, mathematicians, geological scientists, and biologists by providing a centralized, shared, 2.4PB capacity, data storage resource that several independent Linux clusters can mount for high performance I/O and scientific data archival.  Scientific discovery has been advanced while promoting teaching, training, and learning by involving graduate students from underrepresented groups in the development of science drivers that make use of I/O parallelism provided by the BeeGFS file system.
