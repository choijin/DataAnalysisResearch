<AbstractNarration>This research project aims at developing methods to help integrate clean energy into the electric power grid.  We are at the cusp of a historic transformation of our energy system into a more sustainable form in the coming decades.  One of the key technical challenges is balancing supply and demand at all times at all points of grid. Traditionally, supply-demand balance is maintained by adapting generation to fluctuating demand.  This will become ineffective in the future because sources of renewable generation of electricity such as wind and solar power are random and uncontrollable. On the other hand, there will be more and more distributed energy resources such as electric vehicles, smart buildings, smart appliances, storage devices, and other power electronic controllers that not only consume, but may also sense, compute, communicate and actuate.  We will design methods for ubiquitous, continuous load-side frequency regulation to supplement the current generation-side control, prove the stability and optimality of these methods in a large network of distributed energy resources, and study their interaction with generator-side control.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A cyberphysical network such as a smart grid consists of a physical network governed by its own laws of physics and a cyber-network that senses, communicates, computes, and actuates on the physical network.  Our starting point is the observation that the topology of the cyber-network may be different from that of the physical network.  For instance, not every node in the physical network may have sensors or controllers, and this constrains the topology of the cyber-network.  On the other hand, two nodes that are not directly connected in the physical network may be able to communicate, e.g., through a wireless channel, and this provides an extra degree of freedom for the design of the cyber-network.  We will develop a theory to clarify the impact of the cyber-network on the stability and optimality of the physical network, design effective cyber-networks and frequency regulation algorithms based on the theoretical insights, and validate these designs through simulations.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In a cyber-physical network such as a power grid, the dynamics of the physical network has an inherent decentralized structure.  Moreover the topology of the cyber network, which determines how control information is communicated and how actuation is executed, can be different from the physical topology.  In this project, we study the closed-loop interaction between the cyber network and the physical network where the dynamics of the physical network is driven by laws of physics and by control inputs that are computed on the cyber network.  The cyber topology will determine both the information available for control and the ability to influence the dynamics of the physical network.  Intellectual merit.  In this project, we have developed a new approach to design and evaluate distributed frequency control for future power networks.  The key features of our approach are:  Formalizes control objectives and constraints for as an optimization problem. Derive distributed control algorithms as primal-dual like solutions for the optimization problem of 1, with the key insight that part of the primal-dual algorithms will be automatically carried out by the dynamics of the physical network grid and the other part will be implemented as active control at generators and/or loads. To evaluate the performance of an algorithm designed using this approach, prove that a point is an equilibrium point of the closed-loop system of 2 if and only if it is an optimal solution of the optimization problem of 1.  The design is optimal in this sense. To evaluate the stability of the algorithm, prove that the closed-loop system is asymptotically stable, so that the controller will drive the power grid to its equilibrium point, solving the optimization problem and achieving our goal.   We have used this approach to develop distributed frequency regulation algorithms in various scenarios, e.g., when the power imbalance is time-varying, random, and with unknown disturbance models as would be the case with high penetration of renewable generations.   Even though these algorithms have been developed based on simplifying modeling assumptions, their stability and optimality properties have been evaluated through extensive simulations that do not rely on these simplifying assumptions.  These set of theoretical results anddistributed algorithms confirms the merit and practicality of the new approach to frequency regulation developed in this project.  Broader impacts:  The impact of climate change on society is becoming more devastating by the year, with record fires/droughts/hurricanes/snowstorms every few years if not every year.  Energy use was responsible for 84% of total greenhouse gas emission in 2017 in the US.  Of this, electricity generation consumed 38% of US primary energy and emited 28% of greenhouse gases.  This project contributes directly towards the transformation of our energy system into one that is 100% renewable and clean.  Some of the research results obtained in this project have been incorporated into an advance Power Systems Analysis course the PI has been teaching in the last few years.  Main project outcomes:  Using the new approach, we have developed a set of unified distributed frequency regulation algorithms that integrate primary control, secondary control, and congestion management.  The key advantage of this class of unified control is that it enforces line limits in real time, at the timescale of secondary frequency control.  This automatically, and continguously, incorporates corrective actions in response to frequency disturbances and power imbalance.  It leads to significant economic savings by relaxing some of the security constraints in security-constrained economic dispatch (DC OPF).    We have also obtained structural results on the impact of cyber topology on the controllability and observability. Specifically, we have proved that the controllability/observability of the swing dynamics of a power grid is characterized by (i) the structure of the system graph, and (ii) a new notion of ``algebraic coverage'' of each bus i that measures the strength at which bus i can influence other buses.  The algebraic coverage can be verified using the eigenvectors of the graph Laplacian matrix.   We have also characterized the impact of cyber topology on the speed of convergence of secondary frequency control. In particular, we need to separate low-damping and high-damping regimes in order to understand the impact of adding cyber connectivity (more communication channels between controllers on different buses). In a high-damping regime, adding cyber connectivity always speeds up convergence of the closed-loop system. In the low-damping regime, however, the opposite can hold and the relation between cyber connectivity and speed of convergence depends in an intricate manner on the Laplacian eigenvalues.  Finally, we have derive a relationship between the spanning tree structure of a power network and propagation of line outages in the DC power flow model.  This has implications on the localizability of single or multiple line outages, and suggests new ways to mitigate cascading failures.  We are actively pursuing research along this line.
