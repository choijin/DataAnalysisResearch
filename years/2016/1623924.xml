<AbstractNarration>The goal of this project is to provide travel support for the IEEE International Conference on Pervasive Computing and Communications to be held in March 2016 in Sydney, Australia.  Louis. The conference includes papers on many technologies that are fundamental to Cyber-Physical Systems specifically, including sensor systems and Internet of Things, as well as the computer and information sciences more broadly. This project will fund 20 students to attend the conference, and a selection committee and process will be used to choose from potential invitees. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference will organize a PhD Forum for students and will provide important networking opportunities for the students. The attendance and participation in conference activities including the PhD Forum and student sessions will have strong impact on the education of the next generation of pervasive computing and cyber-physical system experts.</AbstractNarration>
