<AbstractNarration>To facilitate greater intellectual collaboration among the existing set of socio-legal scholars at Tulane University, this project will support a postdoctoral fellow in law and society whose research takes an interdisciplinary approach to legal studies. The postdoctoral fellow would be embedded within the research and scholarly community at Tulane University. The postdoctoral fellow will receive mentoring from senior faculty, participate in an interdisciplinary community, and mentor undergraduate student research assistants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will nurture a scholar in legal studies by fostering close research, mentoring, and networking interactions. Interdisciplinary scholarship in law and society takes place within several disciplines, including law, sociology, political science, psychology, and anthropology. Thus, this project will facilitate the intellectual development of the law and society community at Tulane University by expanding the university's capacity, with a goal of drawing scholars, policy makers, and the legal community to its base in New Orleans.</AbstractNarration>
