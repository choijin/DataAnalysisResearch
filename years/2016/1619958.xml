<AbstractNarration>1619958&lt;br/&gt;MacDonald Gibson&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 2014 Ebola epidemic highlighted a critical need to evaluate infectious disease risks to sewer repair crews and wastewater treatment plant operators who could come into contact with pathogen-containing sewage. Prior research indicates that domestic wastewater contains a wide range of pathogens, from noroviruses to hepatitis A. Wastewater workers are at increased risk of infectious illnesses compared to the general population. This proposed workshop would engage scientists, wastewater utility operators and managers, and government regulators in assessing available evidence to decide how to protect wastewater and sewer workers from occupational exposure to pathogens.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Increased risk of infectious illnesses among sewer and wastewater workers is well established, but little scientific evidence exists on the effectiveness of alternative measures for reducing these risks. In order to develop evidence-based solutions, information on job tasks that may lead to infectious disease exposure, potential wastewater exposure volumes for each task, current occupational safety practices among this workforce, and the potential for alternative safety practices to reduce risks, is essential. This workshop will help fill these critical information needs. The workshop will lead to four products: 1. Workshop report describing potential tasks during which wastewater and sewer workers could be exposed to pathogens, estimated exposure volumes for each task, current practices for protecting these workers from pathogens, gaps between current practices and recommended practices, and research needed to fill knowledge gaps; 2. Bayesian belief network risk model for predicting infectious disease risks under alternative risk management scenarios and for diagnosing the likelihood that an infectious illness in a wastewater or sewer worker arose from occupational exposure; 3. Peer-reviewed journal article assessing the magnitude of infectious disease risks to wastewater and sewer workers, describing current infectious disease prevention practices among these workers, analyzing the gaps between current and best practices, and outlining research needed to improve the ability to protect this population; 4 Poster of job tasks illustrating recommended personal protective equipment for each wastewater and sewer job task in order to prevent exposure to pathogens. This project will strengthen the evidence available for protecting the health of the approximately 136,000 wastewater and sewer workers in the United States. In turn, because wastewater treatment plants are one of the main barriers to infectious disease transmission, protecting the health of the wastewater and sewer workforce will contribute to ensuring public health in U.S. communities.</AbstractNarration>

Prior research has shown that domestic wastewater can contain a wide range of pathogens, from noroviruses to hepatitis A, and that wastewater workers are at increased risk of infectious illnesses compared to the general population. This project characterized infectious disease risks to wastewater workers and risk mitigation strategies to prevent these risks.  Intellectual merit outcomes included the development of the first artificial intelligence&ndash;based model for quantifying infectious disease risks to wastewater workers, using Ebola as a prototype.  The model showed that under a worst-case scenario, wastewater workers could have a 3% chance of infection when untreated liquid waste from a single Ebola patient is discharged into a sanitary sewer but that disinfecting the patient?s waste prior to flushing could decrease risks to less 0.003%.  Broader impacts included the development of the first wastewater industry guidelines for personal protective equipment use by wastewater workers.   Scientists with relevant expertise, wastewater utilities, and government regulators from multiple agencies were engaged in developing these guidelines during a two-day workshop.  The guidelines recommend, among other practices, wearing gloves for all activities and face masks, respiratory protection, and/or whole body protection for subsets of job tasks.  Another broader impact was the development of guidelines and associated educational materials for hospitals for the pretreatment of liquid wastes generated by patients infected with Ebola virus or infectious diseases of comparable virulence.  Overall, the results of this work will help protect the health of the more than 136,000 U.S. workers involved in operating one of the nation?s most critical infrastructure systems.
