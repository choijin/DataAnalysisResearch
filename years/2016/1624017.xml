<AbstractNarration>The Introductory Physics for Life Science (IPLS) Portal will enhance the education of hundreds of thousands of life science students each year by providing engaging and effective IPLS instructional materials and helping IPLS instructors use these materials. This collaborative effort of the American Association of Physics Teachers and eight colleges and universities, including a community college and a Hispanic-serving institution, will create an open-source, peer-reviewed, and innovatively structured environment for IPLS content. Initially containing materials from multiple NSF-funded research and development projects, the Portal will become a development platform for IPLS curricula. The site will serve as both an archive and a dissemination tool, including a course-building interface for faculty. Instructors will be supported in creating innovative and individualized courses, mixing and matching from multiple sources tuned to their needs, offering a flexible and low-cost alternative to traditional textbooks.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many of the objectives and features of the project are innovative.  Hence, the project also includes research components of four critical and interacting elements: IPLS content, IPLS pedagogy, the organizational structure of the site, including tagging and taxonomy of all elements for appropriate selection to meet the needs of individual users, and the user interface. Three overlapping research teams will carry out this work: the User-Centered Design team, the Instructional Content Design team, and the Community-Building and Professional-Development team. This project focuses on engaging and expanding three communities: (1) physics and biology education researchers, (2) IPLS contributors, and (3) IPLS adopters wanting to use and adapt existing IPLS materials.  Merging and expanding the efforts of these communities will occur through a combination of workshops, online support communities, and research to advance the understanding of faculty professional development for IPLS education. The IPLS-Portal infrastructure, once developed, could be used to provide a community-sourcing environment for other STEM disciplines.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[     Large populations of life science students are often underserved in physics departments, who pay more attention to the courses for physicists and engineers. These service courses have the potential to be dramatically improved, as a result of instructors using high-quality teaching materials and getting support in using these materials through the community activities of the Living Physics Portal.  The Living Physics Portal resources that are now available for teaching introductory physics for the life sciences will help improve the teaching of physics to biology and biochemistry majors and pre-health students, in terms of content, affect and pedagogical methods. Students majoring in the life sciences and in pre-health programs are one of the largest groups of students learning physics, so to improve their education is a substantial impact.      By improving the physical science knowledge and skills of students in the life science and pre-health fields, we are improving the education of the next generation of researchers and professionals in these fields. Further, by following an extensive user-centered process of research and design, in order to learn about instructors needs and contexts, we created an online portal is extremely usable and relevant. We anticipate the resulting portal can serve as a model for sharing materials and building community around curricular materials in other disciplines as well.
