<AbstractNarration>Morgan State University will investigate the impact of a concept mapping strategy in introductory biology courses on the retention and academic success of underrepresented students. The researchers hypothesize students experiencing greater success in introductory biology by constructing concept maps and using them as an active learning tool will more likely be retained as a STEM major. The impact of concept mapping will be measured by investigating the correlations among course grades in two biology courses, mapping skill, ability to think big, motivation, and retention rates. The conceptual framework for the proposed project incorporates theories that support the efficacy of purposely creating an active learning environment that centers on the use of concept learning maps. The research has the potential to transform the biology learning environment from teacher-centered to student-centered with a focus on meaningful learning thereby increasing retention. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The researchers will use a mixed-methods approach involving four classes and 30-40 faculty to answer two research questions: (1) What are the measurable impacts of using concept maps on metacognition and motivation among underrepresented students in introductory biology courses. (2) What are the correlations among course grades, mapping skill, metacognition, and motivation as well as retention and completion rates in upper-level biology courses?  They will collect quantitative data using two survey instruments and qualitative data using classroom observations of concept mapping and semi-structured interviews with faculty. The research findings are expected to yield insights to reverse the attrition in introductory gatekeeper biology courses for STEM majors and, ultimately, provide an alternative model for improving overall student success. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is supported by the Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP) Broadening Participation Research in Education track. This program track supports ideas to create and study new models and innovations in STEM teaching and learning, investigate the underlying issues affecting the differential participation and success rates of students from underrepresented groups, and produce knowledge to inform STEM education practices and interventions.</AbstractNarration>

We investigated the affect of concept mapping on metacognition (learning and thinking about how to learn), self-efficacy (confidence in doing well), and course grades. A total of 219 biology students used concept mapping to understand the course material, and 175 biology students used their usual approaches. Methods to collect data included a survey, interviews, and an analysis of concept maps.&nbsp;</p> <p class="Default">The research was initiated because no published literature on the effectiveness of concept mapping for improving metacognition or self-efficacy in STEM among underrepresented students in higher education existed. Joseph Novak created concept mapping back in the 1970s and, amazingly, 50 years later, the technique is still used at a wide range of educational levels in K-20. In the book, Scientific Teaching, by Handelsman, Miller, and Pfund (2007), five big ideas from the last 25 years are mentioned but concept mapping is not included (although it is described and encouraged). The hierarchical-style of concept mapping that is unique to Novak (see figure 1) supports what cognitive scientists tell us about how people organize information in their brain for long-term retention and later recall. Nesbitt (2006) seems to reinforce this notion when he states; In comparison with activities such as reading text passages, attending lectures, and participating in class discussions,&nbsp;concept mapping<strong>&nbsp;</strong>activities are more effective for attaining knowledge retention and transfer (p. 2).</p> <p>We created a survey specifically to focus on metacognition and self-efficacy rather than just motivation as originally planned. We used variables from two other published surveys and combined them into our&nbsp;<strong>Self-Efficacy And Learning Survey (SEALS).&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>The SEALS measured&nbsp;<em>Self-Efficacy, Elaboration, Organization, Metacognitive Self-Regulation, Peer Learning, Critical Thinking</em>, and<em>&nbsp;Metacognitive Responsiveness</em>.&nbsp;</p> <p>Our findings showed that students in the concept mapping group&nbsp;<em>significantly&nbsp;</em>improved their understanding of the value of&nbsp;<em>Peer Learning</em>.&nbsp;&nbsp;Students collaborated with their peers to clarify course information and to reach insights that may not have been attained individually. Also, students perceptions of&nbsp;<em>Metacognitive Self-Regulation</em>&nbsp;showed a&nbsp;<em>statistically significant</em>&nbsp;improvement for the concept mapping group. For both groups of students,&nbsp;<em>Self-Efficacy</em>&nbsp;took a precipitous drop by the end of the semester. Unfortunately, concept mapping did not help students maintain their initial, high-level of confidence in biology.&nbsp;</p> <p>Thirty-three students who regularly concept mapped were interviewed. The greatest&nbsp;<em>challenge&nbsp;</em>for students was thinking of appropriate linking words for the arrows that connect concepts.&nbsp;&nbsp;For Professors, their greatest challenge was getting students to consistently use the hierarchical-style. See figure 2. The most frequently stated&nbsp;<em>strength</em>&nbsp;of concept mapping was to resolve confusion over various concepts.&nbsp;</p> <p>When final course grades were compared, the average grade for both groups was similar.&nbsp; For concept mappers, their average grade was 2.60 and for those who did not concept map, it was 2.47&nbsp;<span>(about</span>&nbsp;a C<sup>+)</sup>.&nbsp;&nbsp;See figure 3.</p> <p>The project clearly addressed three of the NSF Broadening Participation Research priorities: (1) faculty professional development, (2) innovation in instruction and curriculum, and, (3) increased research capacity of STEM faculty. In summary, five biology faculty members became experts in the concept mapping strategy, three education graduate students contributed to the research and made conference presentations, two undergraduate biology students were hired to do data analysis, two high school students interned for the summer and assisted with data analysis, and about 50 faculty in the School of Computer, Mathematical, and Natural Sciences (SCMNS) received training on concept mapping. Additionally, 20 Graduate Teaching Assistants across several different disciplines participated in training. The&nbsp;<strong><em>broader impact</em></strong>&nbsp;of implementing concept mapping into courses went beyond the SCMNS.&nbsp;<em>All&nbsp;</em>Schools and Colleges across the Morgan campus had faculty receive training.&nbsp;&nbsp;Approximately 150 faculty members participated in a concept mapping workshop sometime during or after the project. Lastly, researchers at other institutions can use the rubric (see figure 4) to evaluate concept maps of their students. The knowledge generated from this project clearly demonstrated the ability to scale-up and for transferability to all STEM disciplines and to non-STEM subjects and, thus, its&nbsp;<strong><em>intellectual merit</em></strong>.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 12/10/2020<br>      Modified by: Catherine&nbsp;S&nbsp;Martin-Dunlop</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1623215/1623215_10452914_1607579902020_Figure1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1623215/1623215_10452914_1607579902020_Figure1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 1"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1623215/1623215_10452914_1607579902020_Figure1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 1"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Concept map of a concept map</div> <div class="imageCredit">public domain</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Public Domain</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Catherine&nbsp;S&nbsp;Martin-Dunlop</div> <div class="imageTitle">Figure 1</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1623215/1623215_10452914_1607580047419_Figure2--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1623215/1623215_10452914_1607580047419_Figure2--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 2"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1623215/1623215_10452914_1607580047419_Figure2--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 2"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Student's concept map of DNA not in hierarchical style.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Morgan State University</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyright owner is an institution with an existing agreement allowing use by NSF</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Catherine&nbsp;S&nbsp;Martin-Dunlop</div> <div class="imageTitle">Figure 2</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1623215/1623215_10452914_1607580184284_Figure3--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1623215/1623215_10452914_1607580184284_Figure3--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 3"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1623215/1623215_10452914_1607580184284_Figure3--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 3"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Distribution of average final grade across the two groups of undergraduate biology students.
