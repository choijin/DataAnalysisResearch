<AbstractNarration>Specialized pores (called stomata) in the leaves of plants open and close to regulate the uptake into plants of carbon dioxide from the air, and the loss of water (as vapor) from plant tissues out into the air. The opening and closing of stomata is regulated by signals that include the concentration of carbon dioxide in the air, but knowledge of how this is achieved is incomplete. This project will define the genes, proteins and networks of control involved in the regulation of stomata by carbon dioxide, and develop the knowledge necessary for the breeding of plants with improved growth properties and water use efficiency. The ability to manipulate these properties of plants is important for unfavorable weather conditions, climate changes, droughts becoming more frequent in some locations, and as carbon dioxide levels in the air increase. The investigators will pursue an outreach program involving research internships, professional preparation and mentoring with the public Preuss School for disadvantaged high school students in San Diego County as well as engaging with summer research interns from Howard University. Project personnel will be active within the San Diego Science Festival, a large annual event that brings science and innovation close to the public.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some components (including carbonic anhydrase, anion channels and protein kinases) of the carbon dioxide signaling network that regulates stomatal aperture are known. However, the manner in which diverse signals, genes and proteins (a number of which are still to be uncovered) are integrated by guard cells into the network that controls stomatal aperture is not known. This project will use a combination of systems biology, biochemical, genetic and mathematical modeling approaches to identify additional critical molecular components of the signaling network and gain insight into the manner in which this network operates in guard cells to regulate stomatal aperture and how plants can improve their water use efficiency and drought resilience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is supported jointly by the Cellular Dynamics and Function program in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences and by the Physics of Living Systems program in the Division of Physics.</AbstractNarration>

A network of signal transduction mechanisms sense and transduce [CO2] changes to regulate stomatal apertures for optimization of CO2 influx, water loss and plant growth under diverse conditions.

We further developed a new forward genetics screening platform, that is now enabling screening of overlapping homologous gene functions on a genome-wide scale. We are using this platform and have made it available to the wider scientific research community through the Arabidopsis Biological Resource stock Center (ABRC).

In summary, this research has provided models, genes, mechanisms and working hypotheses for future elucidation of the signaling network by which the presently continuing increase in atmospheric CO2 concentration will affect plant gas exchange between plants and the environment.     Broader Impacts:  Elucidation of the molecular mechanisms and network by which CO2 modulates stomatal conductance is fundamental to understanding the regulation of gas exchange between plants and the atmosphere, will help predict effects of atmospheric CO2 elevation on plants and can also contribute to future engineering of leaf heat stress avoidance and enhanced water use efficiency in selected crop plants and plant carbon sinks in the face of the continuing [CO2] rise and weather variability.
