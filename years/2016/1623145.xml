<AbstractNarration>Researchers at Tennessee State University will examine the impact of a career development intervention that was revised based on lessons learned from prior research. The project will focus on STEM career persistence by investigating career decision making difficulties, stages of change in career development, growth mindset, and academic satisfaction. Participants will develop a ten-year plan for matriculating through undergraduate education to graduate school and beyond, receive information about the importance of academic support activities, and develop skills in planning and managing their career paths. These goals will be achieved through the implementation of a research-based series of workshops designed to increase students' understanding about how to align their career aspirations with job market trends and how to manage their career plan. The expected outcome is that students will have an increased commitment to their major field of study, self-efficacy for career-related tasks, and greater confidence in their potential for success. The research findings will contribute to the vocational psychology and STEM persistence literature by integrating theory related to career development with research on an effective intervention with African American STEM students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project is a mixed-methods research design to investigate several research questions: (1) In what ways will the intervention increase career planning and management skills of African American students' (2) In what ways will the intervention reduce students' career decision-making and planning difficulties? (3) What will be the effect of the intervention on African American students' commitment to and interest, performance, and retention in STEM? and (4) What effect will the intervention have on African American students' participation in professional opportunities? Quantitative data will be gathered using a quasi-experimental pre-/post-test control group longitudinal design. Variables will include measures of career decision-making difficulties, change processes, growth mindset, and productive persistence. Qualitative data will be gathered using focus groups and individual interviews from different STEM academic departments. Data analysis will be conducted using MANOVA/MANCOVA. Additional analyses will examine for the impact of gender, race/ethnicity, first-generation status, and STEM major. Documentation of the effectiveness of the intervention will support the replication of the model at other HBCUs focusing on increasing the diversity of the STEM workforce.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is supported by the Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP) Broadening Participation Research in Education track. This program track supports ideas to create and study new models and innovations in STEM teaching and learning, investigate the underlying issues affecting the differential participation and success rates of students from underrepresented groups, and produce knowledge to inform STEM education practices and interventions.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[Project Outcomes Report for:  Broadening  Participation in STEM:  Career Commitment and Retention in STEM:   Building the next generation STEM Workforce (Award #1623145)   The  goal of this 3-year longitudinal, mixed methods project was to revise  and examine the impact of an abbreviated version of the  culturally-appropriate STEM career management intervention (NSF Award  #1238778). The revised career management intervention for African  American STEM students is grounded in recent meta-analytic research  documenting the most effective, evidence-based career intervention  components to enhance career development (Brown &amp; Krane, 2000; Brown  &amp; Rector, 2008), in culturally-appropriate career development  models (Bingham &amp; Fouad, 1995), social cognitive career theory  (Brown &amp; Lent, 1996), change processes (Barclay, Stoltz, &amp;  Chung, 2011; Hammond, 2014), growth mindset (Dweck, 2012), and  productive persistence (Yeager &amp; Walton, 2011). This project is  unique in attempting to examine the overlapping effects of these  different variables on the outcomes of interventions with African  American STEM students.  Data was gathered from over 600 STEM students  across the grant period, including students from agricultural sciences,  biology, chemistry, computer sciences, engineering, mathematics, and  psychology.  Preliminary analysis of the data suggests that the  intervention had an immediate impact on students perceptions of their  career path through their degree.  In contrast, participants in the  control group members did not change in career management skills,  knowledge, or actions across the intervention period.  Furthermore, the  largest impact of the intervention was assisting STEM students in  recognizing the available supports, becoming familiar with some of the  barriers to persistence in STEM, and recognizing how to use the former  to cope with the latter in order to persist in reaching their STEM  goals.  In a comparison of Agricultural Science and Biological Science  students, the results suggest that, while the focus of study may be  similar, students in these two majors differ significantly in goals,  self-efficacy, interest in technology, and coping skills.  These  differences may arise due to differences in career trajectory and access  to careers post- bachelor's degree completion versus after completion  of a doctoral degree.  Also, this project addressed a lacuna in the  methodological literature by analyzing the procedures used for data  linking in longitudinal research and identified best practices to  increase the accuracy and completeness of data linking between complex  datasets.   The broader impacts  of this project have manifested in a number of ways.  As TSU faculty  members and student services personnel have become aware of the work  that we are doing, there has been an increase in programmatic activity  focused on supporting TSU's STEM students.  This includes both funded  and non-funded efforts to provide scholarships, mentoring, research  experience, and improve advising efforts.  Second, one department is  already working to incorporate the modules into their curriculum. Third,  our efforts to use evidence-based methods to improve data management  for this study has resulted in the publication of a "best practices"  guide for research in education, psychology, and other fields that  conduct longitudinal studies with humans, as the literature had  preiviously provided little guidance in this area.
