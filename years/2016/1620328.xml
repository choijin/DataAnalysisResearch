<AbstractNarration>The research objective of this award is to study a new form of autonomous material that senses the presence of damage and use stimulus to not only heal the material but to toughen it against the propagation of damage.  This objective will be accomplished through the synthesis of light activated shape memory polymers that incorporate cinnamic moieties, which are able to undergo efficient photoreversible cycloaddition reactions when exposed to alternating wavelengths of light.  This reversible reaction will be used to actively cleave and reform covalent crosslinks to mitigate the propagation of damage though local modulus changes at the crack tip, achieve shape recovery for crack closure and to ultimately reform crosslinks across the crack face to recover the strength of the material. A fiber optic network will be employed to detect and signal the presence of damage while providing a mechanism to deliver stimulus directly to the crack tip.  The shape memory effect will provide a means to recover the plastic strain induced at the crack front thus returning the material to its original geometry, relaxing built up stresses and bringing the crack faces into intimate contact to allow healing of the damage. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this award focus on the bridging of structural health monitoring and autonomous systems that can react to heal damage in a controlled and repeatable manner.  This includes the design of sensor systems and signal conditioning hardware in coordination with the host structure rather than the ad hoc deployment currently used.  Furthermore, this research will impact the current state in photoresponsive polymers allowing their integration into a range of new applications.  The goal of the education component is to use the concept of biologically inspired systems and smart materials to demonstrate the multidisciplinary character of modern engineering and to stimulate the educational growth of students.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Structural health monitoring (SHM) has seen significant growth over the past few years due to the safety and performance enhancing benefits as well as the potential life saving capabilities offered by the technology.  Current advances in SHM systems have lead to a variety of techniques capable of identifying damage; however, few strategies exist for using this information to quickly react to the environmental or material conditions to repair or protect the system.  Instead, this information is usually provided to a central processor or human operator, who then decides on a course of action such as altering the mission or scheduling a repair operation.  Unlike these modern SHM systems, biological systems can not only detect the presence of damage but react to heal it through stimulus responsive behavior.  The foremost goal for the development of future adaptive structures is to provide the material itself with the ability to mimic biological systems and autonomously adapt to impede the progression of damage and subsequently heal the damaged region.  This grant has studied a new form of autonomous material that senses the presence of damage and use stimulus to not only heal the material but to toughen it against the propagation of damage.  The work has focused on the synthesis of light activated shape memory polymers that incorporate Diels Alder linages which can undergo reversible crosslinking when subjected to thermal energy. This reversible reaction has been used to actively cleave and reform covalent crosslinks to mitigate the propagation of damage though local modulus changes at the crack tip, achieve shape recovery for crack closure and to ultimately reform crosslinks across the crack face to recover the strength of the material.  A fiber optic network was employed to detect and signal the presence of damage while providing a mechanism to deliver stimulus directly to the crack tip.  The shape memory effect will provide a means to recover the plastic strain induced at the crack front thus returning the material to its original geometry, relaxing built up stresses and bringing the crack faces into intimate contact to allow healing of the damage.  The broader impacts of this award focus on the bridging of structural health monitoring and autonomous systems that can react to heal damage in a controlled and repeatable manner.  This includes the design of sensor systems and signal conditioning hardware in coordination with the host structure rather than the ad hoc deployment currently used.  Furthermore, this research has impacted the current state in photoresponsive polymers allowing their integration into a range of new applications.
