<AbstractNarration>This National Robotics Initiative project will develop a robotic learning environment for middle school geometry students where students who are novices in geometry will learn new concepts by tutoring a humanoid robot to manipulate its gestures and spoken prompts in response to student utterances and problem-solving actions.  The project is based on the principle that the act of tutoring can lead to motivational benefits such as student engagement, positive attitudes toward the subject being studied, and increased confidence.  In this application, the robot is simultaneously a tool that students can program and a social actor that intelligently responds.  This research project will engage a broadly diverse population and is aimed at increasing the participation and retention of underrepresented groups in fields of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). There are three components to the broader impacts of this project: 1) Scientific understanding of how robotic learning companions affect STEM attitudes and confidence, 2) Learning among students from traditionally underrepresented groups in the research process, and 3) Creation of a human-robot interaction platform for education and experimentation. The principles discovered through this project are expected to promote increased  participation of women and other underrepresented populations in STEM educational activities and STEM-related careers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goals of this research are to link robot behaviors to mediating motivational factors and STEM outcomes with the ultimate goal of understanding how to manipulate robot behaviors to improve a learning interaction. The proposed research will make contributions to understanding of how robotic learning environments can be designed to have a transformative impact on STEM learning.  The research is guided by two questions:  1) How do robot behaviors influence students' mediating motivational factors and affect STEM skills and attitudes?  And 2) What is the impact of adapting robot behaviors to student behaviors on mediating variables and STEM skills and outcomes?  To find answers to these questions, the project will undertake three initiatives: 1) Further development of NaoTAG (Nao Tangible Activities for Geometry) to serve as a platform for experimenting with how different aspects of robot behaviors influence student-robot interactions within the teachable agent context; 2) Understand how student and robot behaviors influence the mediating factors that have identified, and STEM skills and outcomes; and 3) Modeling student-robot interactions.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  In this project, we explore how a humanoid robot should manipulate its gestures and spoken prompts in response to students? spoken utterances and problem-solving actions to improve STEM learning outcomes. Our robot, named Nico, is a teachable robot: this means that middle school students who are new learners in a domain learn by talking to Nico to explain ratio problems and answer Nico?s questions. This type of learning by teaching activity tends to be beneficial for novices in a domain because they attend more to the problem, reflect on their knowledge, and elaborate on their knowledge as they construct explanation.  This project addresses two goals through a series of experiments: 1) Understand how learning by teaching behaviors within the teachable robot environment (e.g., dialogue and speech patterns) are influenced by and impact STEM outcomes, including math learning, self-efficacy, and positive attitudes, 2) Understand how robot behaviors, such as errors made and prompts given, can create positive STEM outcomes. The contributions of this work are an improved understanding of how a learning companion robot can adapt its behaviors to improve its impact on STEM outcomes in a learning by teaching context. The two key types of behaviors on which this project focuses are acoustic-prosodic entrainment (a social phenomenon where a person adapts their speech to their conversation partner?s) and social dialogue (utterances that communicate social connection to a conversation partner). This project makes three types of contributions:   Our robot is one of the first of its kind to implement entrainment as a feature of its language and behavior, and we have explored and compared multiple types of entrainment, extracting their advantages and disadvantages.   We build on the theory of entrainment and rapport demonstrating that even simple models of entrainment implemented in a teachable robot context can positively influence feelings of rapport and enhance interaction with the robot. We also find that introducing a social behavior such as entrainment into a robot?s behavioral characteristics can have positive effects on learning of mathematics for middle-school students.   Throughout our analysis, we explore how gender, prior knowledge, self-efficacy, and other individual differences uniquely influences an individual?s response to the robot.
