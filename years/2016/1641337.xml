<AbstractNarration>The 2016 IEEE SEC Conference (Symposium on Edge Computing) will be held in Washington, D.C. on Oct. 27-28, 2016. This preeminent technical conference is the primary venue for presenting new research results in the area of "edge computing", a new paradigm in which the resources of a small data center are placed at the edge of the Internet, in close proximity to mobile devices, sensors, and end users, and the emerging Internet of Things. Participants will have the opportunity to present their work, attend panel and keynote sessions, and interact with many people conducting leading-edge research in the field.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To help build student participation, this award will support 15 students.  Participation in conferences is a valuable and important part of the graduate school experience providing students exposure to senior researchers and leading edge work in the field.</AbstractNarration>

IEEE SEC is a new conference and the primary venue for presenting research results in the area of edge computing. SEC 2016 was attended by more than 120 researchers and practitioners in the field.

The project PI applied for student travel grant from NSF and set up web page for travel grant. The student travel grant committee collected applications and selected awardees. The PI also made sure all awardees completes CITI training before they can be issued a check for reimbursement.  Students who were selected to receive the grant were very grateful for this award. Many of them expressed that they would not be able to attend without this grant. They were excited to learn about this new research direction and to be part of this newly formed community.
