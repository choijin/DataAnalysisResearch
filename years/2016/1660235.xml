<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is that the proposed system will enhance the ability of the 1.3 million people currently living in the United States with a lower limb amputation to walk in unconstrained environments.  The proposed Quasi-Active Prosthetic Ankle System (QPAS) addresses the RH6: Human Assistive Technologies area.  QPAS will be lightweight, have a long battery life, and optimize the passive dynamics of amputee gait in unconstrained environments by using battery energy to tune its physical system properties, ankle equilibrium angle and torsional stiffness.  The device provides a unique set of features that do not currently exist in the market, strengthening its value proposition.  The amputee population is growing; 2,000 new lower limb amputation are performed each week.  Therefore, QPAS will have strong market potential and the significant societal impact of improving health by supporting a more active lifestyle for lower limb amputees.  This will also lead to more community and family involvement.  Additionally, because of the many possibilities to control QPAS, gait researchers will be able to study amputee compensation preferences.  A better understanding of the kinematic and kinetic preferences could lead to improvements in the design of purely passive ankle prostheses.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project addresses the needs of lower limb amputees. Lower limb amputees suffer from reduced self-selected walking speed, increased metabolic cost, increased reaction loads on the sound limb, poor gait symmetry, and reduced stability with increased risk of falling.  Passive prosthetic feet are only tuned for level ground walking at one speed.  QPAS will utilize a patented compliant actuator to achieve a unique set of features: passive energy storage with an articulating ankle joint, adaptable ankle angle for slope gait, low electrical energy usage, a large range of ankle motion, adaptable stiffness to optimize variable cadence level ground and slope gait, and controlled energy delivery to ensure energy builds naturally and smoothly.  In this phase 2 SBIR, an intuitive and autonomous controller will be built for the QPAS and human subject evaluations will assist in refining the device towards commercialization. QPAS will become a successful product by focusing on improved amputee gait performance in unconstrained environments, and being simple to fit and adjust, reliable and affordable.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ People with a lower limb amputation suffer from reduced self-selected walking speed, increased metabolic cost, increased reaction loads on the sound limb, poor gait symmetry, and reduced stability with increased risk of falling. Passive prosthetic feet are only tuned for level ground walking at one speed.  The Quasi-Active Prosthetic Ankle System (QPAS) was developed to deliver a unique set of features, not currently available for lower limb amputees: passive energy storage with an articulating ankle joint, adaptable ankle angle for slope gait, low electrical energy usage, a large range of ankle motion, and adaptable stiffness to optimize variable cadence over level ground and slope walking.  The broader impacts of such research are improving the lives of people with lower limb amputation by making it easier for them to increase their activity level.  This is accomplished by improving walking stability and comfort in unconstrained environments.    Major accomplishments towards these goals include:  Design and analysis of a prosthetic joint mechanism that provides a different non-linear stiffness profile for different unloaded ankle orientations     Custom mechanism analysis and synthesis programs were developed in Matlab and Simulink Engineering design, fabrication and construction of the Quasi-Active Prosthetic Ankle System, weighing less than 1.5 kg Development of a base-level activity detection approach to distinguish between slopes and level ground walking Simulation and development of a control system reference pattern for variable speed walking Testing and evaluation of the QPAS prototype on an amputee subject   Demonstrated improved walking stability over level ground, improved loading symmetry at seat-off for sit-to-stand activities, and gained insights into the drivers of stability  improvements for walking up slopes         Summary and Conclusions  Minimizing the weight and size of advanced ankle prostheses is just as important as improving the functionality. This is especially true for an ankle prosthesis where the weight is located furthest from the body’s center of mass. Improving functionality while keeping the prosthesis weight below 1.5 kg provided the opportunity for SpringActive’s engineering team to advance their knowledge in several key areas: composite manufacturing, modeling and analysis; programming mechanism synthesis models; simulation of non-linear systems in Matlab and Simulink; and analysis and design of machines with a multitude of interconnected linkages.   Ultimately, these intensive efforts allowed for the successful evaluation of the device at Arizona State University.  Human Subject testing has shown that a non-linear and adaptive prosthetic ankle joint mechanism can be developed that improves walking dynamic stability and improved sit-to-stand loading symmetry at seat-off.  In addition, insights were gained as to the drivers of improved walking stability up slopes.  Improving prosthetic ankle range of motion will result in a different and more comfortable gait strategy when walking up steep slopes.  However, this change in strategy did not improve dynamic stability.  Our research suggests that the primary driver of improved walking stability up steep slopes may be the addition of a properly timed powered push-off and an adaptive control system.      This Phase II SBIR also highlighted the engineering challenges for commercialization efforts.  For example, the multitude of interconnected linkages cause challenges with tolerance stack up and despite the numerous finite elements analysis techniques deployed, the forces on the joints were underestimated.  This led to the redesign of multiple components during the project and a prototype that is heavier than the final product needs to be.  However, based on the potential of this technology to improved walking stability and sit-to-stand loading symmetry for people with a lower limb amputation, these engineering challenges should not limit the enthusiasm for the eventual product.
