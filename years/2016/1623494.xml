<AbstractNarration>This project leverages Making to develop and test its role in improving the effectiveness of informal learning pathways for increasing retention and broadening participation in Science, Technology, Engineering, Art, and Mathematics or STEAM through the context of a deployable makerspace with a particular emphasis on additive manufacturing (AM). Mobile makerspaces have been shown to excite local communities and this research investigates how this initial fascination can impact learning and engagement with STEAM disciplines. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project investigates how deployable makerspace provides a more comprehensive spectrum of concepts related to material extrusion additive manufacturing called a "material-to-form" model with particular depth in design and material science important to making. Also, the impact on broadening participation through the experiential component of making by adapting makerspaces will be explored.The question of whether interaction with a deployable makerspace will improve participants knowledge of Additive Manufacturing and the material and design considerations associated with it.  This research brings together important technological innovations that are transforming how we conceptualize STEAM education: digital fabrication, makerspace culture, and mobility. Finally this research will explore what possibilities for engagement and curriculum development when the Makerspace goes to the student.  This project is a part of NSF's Maker Dear Colleague Letter (DCL) portfolio (NSF 15-086), a collaborative investment of Directorates for Computer &amp; Information Science &amp; Engineering (CISE), Education and Human Resources (EHR) and Engineering (ENG).</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Our grant focused on combining the excitement from the maker movement and the novel creation of deployable makerspaces to enable more dynamic forms of informal learning using techniques in additive manufacturing (AM) or in particular 3D printing (3DP). Digital fabrication technologies, such as those associated with AM, have played an integral part in the growth of makerspaces as democratization of manufacturing continues to evolve impacting design and creative practices. 3DP has also shown potential in enabling the successful amalgamation of art (A) with science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) disciplines, giving new possibilities to STEAM subjects and their implementation.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>To pursue this potential, we iteratively developed the Mobile Atelier for Kinesthetic Education (MAKE) 3D throughout the duration of our award. MAKE 3D is a mobile makerspace platform that can be deployed anywhere there is electricity to create a <em>curricular spectacle</em> of interdisciplinary uses of digital fabrication technologies with a particular focus on 3DP processes. Curricular spectacle is any pedagogical approach involving activities, resources, and instruction common to curricular endeavors that maximizes visibility through highly innovative approaches and nuanced presentations of content. Our project combines this notion of curricular spectacle and a mobile makerspace platform, to develop strategies in how to meet the novice user almost anywhere and to entice them into a series of hands-on activities that would give them a range of knowledge and aptitude for additive techniques in digital fabrication as well as increase their awareness of how these processes are used in a broad array of disciplines. Our goal is to identify more effective means of informal education to broaden participation and increase engagement with STEAM subjects through the context of a makerspace that focuses on 3DP.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>In addition to the design of the mobile makerspace platform, our team developed the Material to Form curriculum to explore thematic connections between the maker movement and STEAM disciplines; design thinking and kinesthetic learning; and place-based education and the mobile platform. The curriculum has six modules including designing form, modeling form, workflow in AM, capturing form, extrusion methods, and filament materials and processes. Each module contains teaching resources including a lesson plan, one-page prompt, a slideshow, and two case studies highlighting art and engineering relevant to the learning objectives of the module. The modularity of the Material to Form curriculum integrates separate stations presenting opportunities for self-directed learning through various stages of design, material use, and manufacturing associated with AM while offering contexts for understanding both in art and engineering.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The makerspace was deployed at six Penn State University campuses including Abington, Beaver, Greater Allegheny, Mont Alto, New Kensington, and University Park impacting hundreds of undergraduate students in either scheduled hour-long sessions targeting Arts and Engineering students or voluntary walk-in sessions that were hosted in hi-traffic zones on the campus such as the student center, commuter parking lot, or central quad. Mixed method data collection from the participants through self-reported surveys and researcher observations was analyzed and compared to evaluate the effectiveness of the mobile makerspace for participant attitudes and engagement. The analysis indicates that the designed curriculum shows similar attitude improvements in the participants from both Arts and Engineering majors, as well as at different campus locations, irrespective of their initial differences. Observations also show a difference in engagement between prearranged sessions and walk-in sessions, which indicates that different session formats may promote specific engagement with different participant types.&nbsp; Ultimately, this research demonstrates how the flexibility of 3DP technology can be used with novel deployment platforms to engage students with design and making across traditional disciplinary boundaries.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>In addition to informal learning opportunities explored through a university setting, the MAKE 3D platform proved adaptable to many different contexts with a broad age range of participants including deployment at the Schlow Centre Region Public Library; the Palmer Museum of Art; and the Arts Festival all in State College, PA.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Our dissemination activities included presentations at various conferences including 2017 Solid Freeform Fabrication Symposium in Austin, TX; International Society of Education
