<AbstractNarration>This project is motivated by the growing demand for a middle-skill advanced manufacturing technician workforce in the region, and will focus on developing flexible career pathways with a particular emphasis on women and other rural students. The project team will work to modularize existing curricula as well as develop a core curriculum that will be used by advanced manufacturing technician tracks. The Northeast Iowa Community College NICC and a number of industry members and northeast Iowa secondary schools will collaborate closely in completing the project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study will examine the skills and body of knowledge required across advanced manufacturing technician occupations. Project activities will include 1) an analysis of common curricula in multiple technician programs, 2) training opportunities for secondary school teachers and College faculty to better align curriculum along the K-14 experience, 3) development of distance learning options to expand access, 4) a study of the efficacy of an open lab model that enables high school, college, career pathway students, and industry professionals to work simultaneously, 5) development of work experience options for technician students including apprenticeships. The results of this project will build on a body of evidence documenting the benefits of open lab structure, competency-based education, and co-operative education. Project activities will align the efforts of secondary educators, community college faculty, and industry needs.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Northeast Iowa Advanced Manufacturing Technicians is a project funded by the National Science Foundation's Advanced Technological Education program. Housed under the Program Development and Improvement track, the overarching goal of the project is to achieve excellent in technician education through the development of flexible career pathways with a particular emphasis on women and other rural students.  The Northeast Iowa Advanced Manufacturing Technicians project made significant progress during the NSF funding period. Highlights include the following outcomes that demonstrate intellectual merit and broader impact.  Intellectual Merit:  The development of competency-based education courses in Industrial Maintenance and Welding.  College-wide collaboration to develop competency-based practices, policies and student on-boarding and retention strategies. Sharing of Industrial Maintenance and Welding competency-based assessment practices and experiences strengthening the overall College assessment strategies.   Student internships and project-based learning have contributed to students acquiring the skills and knowledge required to have an entrepreneurial mindset. Development of Career Academies to support students pathways from high school to college in advanced manufacturing programs.  Development of the online Computer Aided Design (CAD) certificate.   Broader Impact:  Development of an effective advanced manufacturing talent pipeline from secondary school to associate’s degree to bachelor’s degree. Expansion of work-based learning opportunities for residents and local employers. Adoption of the Business and Industry Leadership Teams. Faculty and administration have embraced this model, which is more effective than traditional advisory committees. The model is being expanded to other programs at the college.  Improved retention rates of Advanced Manufacturing students.  Creating new recruitment materials and publications that feature the women in advanced manufacturing programs.
