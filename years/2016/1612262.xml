<AbstractNarration>This action funds an NSF National Plant Genome Initiative Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology for FY 2016. The fellowship supports a research and training plan and also presents a plan to broaden participation in biology. The title of the research and training plan for this fellowship to Dr. Alice MacQueen is "Genomics of yield variation and physiology of genotype-by-environment interactions in common bean." The host institution for the fellowship is the University of Texas at Austin and the sponsoring scientist is Dr. Tom Juenger.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) is the most consumed source of plant protein worldwide and is a particularly important source of protein in the developing world. A question of pressing importance is how important crop traits, such as protein or yield, were influenced by interaction of genes with the environment, so called GXE interactions. Common bean was domesticated to grow in a wide variety of environments and is thus an excellent candidate to explore how crop traits are determined by GXE interactions. An extensive dataset of over 500 common bean varieties grown at 36 locations across the United States over 34 years links bean traits in different environments. This research project leverages these historical datasets and will document genetic variation in common bean, thus providing an exciting opportunity to connect the traits to their genetic drivers. Undergraduate students will be trained in cutting edge genomic analysis and the public will learn about plant genomics through outreach activities with the Lady Bird Johnson Wildflower Center.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project combines experiments and computational analyses to determine the interactions of GXE on yield variation and other traits of common bean. New association mapping populations will be produced, and these will be directly connected to historically robust datasets containing phenotype and yield data for common bean. The genetics of yield variation will be determined through genome-wide association approaches, both for regions with genomic variation between varieties and genomic regions fixed by local adaptation between bean races. The project will test for differential expression and physiology between varieties with and without GxE in response to specific climate drivers.</AbstractNarration>

This project aimed to find the genetic variants that increase common bean yield across many different types of North American bean production environments.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>In this research project, I used an extensive dataset of over 500 common bean varieties in the United States and Canada known as the Cooperative Dry Bean Nursery (CDBN) dataset. Bean breeders have been collecting yield and other descriptions of bean traits for 20 to 50 bean varieties a year, at 10 to 20 locations, for the past 70 years (see the CDBN image). This includes environments as diverse as California, Nebraska, New York, and Saskatchewan. I obtained seed from 348 entries in the CDBN grown between 1981 and 2018. I then used genotyping-by-sequencing technology to obtain information on 1.2 million positions in the genome with two different DNA base pairs present in different CDBN individuals ? a.k.a., they had a single nucleotide polymorphism, or SNP, at those 1.2 million positions. I then linked this SNP data to the trait data in the CDBN using genome-wide association methods.

I found genetic variation that affects bean yields differently in environments that experience heavy rainfall events early in the growing season, compared to environments that do not.
