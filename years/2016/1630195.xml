<AbstractNarration>Discoveries from this project could lead to new applications of biosensors in marine and environmental science and potentially to new insights into the environmental cycling of trace chemicals. Mercury is one of the most toxic contaminants in the environment and is of global concern. Developing methods for measuring the distribution mercury in the field is needed to better understand the source and fate of mercury.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is to develop ultrasensitive and specific graphene-based immunosensors for in-situ detection of trace Hg2+ concentrations in aquatic ecosystems. Developing ultrasensitive, specific, and robust methods for quantifying the distribution and speciation of ultra-low level mercury, especially for in-situ measurements in the field, is a fundamental requirement to better understand the source, fate, transformation and bioaccumulation of Mercury, as well as for assessing environmental pollution and possible remediation. The proposed technique is potentially transformative, and will promote further design and optimization of novel sensors, instrumentation, and analytical schemes for trace targets important in practical biological, chemical and environmental monitoring. This project will be incorporated as undergraduate and graduate educational and research tools, and provide opportunities for students at all levels, diverse ethnic backgrounds and nationalities, underrepresented minorities and persons with disabilities.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Mercury is one of the most toxic contaminants in the environment, and is of global concern because of its high mobility and extreme persistence. Depending on environmental conditions, inorganic Hg0, Hg+, Hg2+ can convert to organic CH3Hg+, the form which has the highest toxic effect in humans. Developing ultra-sensitive, specific, and robust methods for quantifying the distribution of ultra-low level mercury is a fundamental requirement to better understand the source, fate, transformation and bioaccumulation of mercury, as well as for assessing environmental pollution and possible remediation.  For this project, we utilized the extreme charge sensitivity of graphene nanomaterials, selective molecular recognition of antibody-antigen immunoreactions, and ligand-mercury chelate reactions to develop graphene-based electrochemical sensors. SiO2 substrate-supported graphene sensing chips (with sensor window few &mu;m x &mu;m) were developed and functionalized with a Hg2+ selective chemical ligand. By combining with a micro-flow cell and different flow modes, an ultrasensitive label-free graphene sensor was developed to selectively determine Hg2+ in aquatic samples with sensitivity less than 0.01 ppb Hg2+. The sensing activity of the graphene chip can be reconstituted by using EDTA solution, and the sensor can be used repeatedly for Hg2+ measurements. The sensor response approach for the novel graphene Hg2+ chemical sensor was based on the field effect transistor structure of graphene, which was designed as a "common sensing approach".  It can be converted to a graphene-based immunosensor by using antibody (instead of Hg2+ ligand) to functionalize the graphene sensing chip.  Based on this principle, a novel graphene-based immunosensor for specific response to vitamin B12 (a micronutrient for phytoplankton in ocean) was also developed by using vitamin B12 antibody to functionalize the graphene sensing chip.          The sensing approach of the label-free graphene immunosensor and selective ligand sensor developed in this project can be utilized in a simple handheld device, and represent significant steps in analytical capability for both laboratory and in situ platforms. The principles involved in the graphene immunosensor can be applied to the study of not only Hg2+, but also multiple additional target analytes which are important in practical biogeochemical and environmental monitoring based on antigen-antibody reactions and/or metal-ligand chelate reactions. The techniques developed in this project could promote further design and optimization of novel biosensors, instrumentation and analytical schemes for biological, marine and environmental sciences.
