<AbstractNarration>In this project the National Center for Science and Civic Engagement (NCSCE) is continuing to catalyze and sustain pedagogical and curricular transformation on a large scale through its Science Education for New Civic Engagements and Responsibilities (SENCER) Program.  It is building on prior results and accomplishments in empowering educators to help students in American colleges employ focused and connected learning in the science, mathematics, engineering, and technology (STEM) disciplines to engage with important issues facing our democracy.  A key goal of this project is to expand SENCER's community of practice to achieve a transformative "tipping point" in undergraduate STEM instruction and learning.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SENCER models apply an "outside - in" approach from the science of learning to the learning of science, framing STEM learning within compelling civic challenges. The intellectual merit of this effort consists in empowering educators to help students in American colleges employ focused learning in the STEM disciplines to engage with great issues facing our democracy. The broader impacts of this project include strengthening our democracy by enhancing the scientific and technological literacy of the American people supporting civic engagement, and sustaining a program that helps achieve these important goals.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Five goals define the reach of this 4-year project:   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Expand participation in the SENCER Program to reach transformative scale by involving faculty teams from more than 20% of US colleges and universities in national and regional programs in new course and program design, active learning pedagogies, and civic engagement.&lt;br/&gt;2. Increase the intensity and scope of follow-up activities to institutionalize reforms by organizing intensive implementation webinars, linked-in discussion groups, and deploying leadership fellow "co-mentors" to strengthen implementation outcomes.&lt;br/&gt;3. Disseminate scholarship, materials, and other resources to strengthen connections with the wider education community by mounting a "models to materials" initiative to populate the SENCER digital library collection with easy-to-adapt and use collections of course materials, labs, assessments, civic engagement projects, and related resources.&lt;br/&gt;4. Broaden assessment to measure and promote enduring understandings by collaborating with the College Board to enable targeted assessment (connected to the disciplines in which SENCER courses are taught) that measures learning of unifying scientific concepts, science practices, and issues involving science, technology and society. &lt;br/&gt;5. Engage in formal planning to assure sustainability, leadership succession, and growth by designing and implementing a multi-phased sustainability plan. The plan includes strategies and mechanisms for program development, finance, governance, leadership succession, and acquisition of intramural and extramural support to grow a robust community of reformers well after NSF funding has ceased.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[Science Education for New Civic Engagements and Responsibilities (SENCER) connects science learning to the most important issues facing our society at the personal, community, local, regional, national, and international level. This work advances NSF?s goal to increase the public understanding of science. SENCER has been recognized as a national Community of Transformation that provides educators and administrators the opportunity, means, and confidence to implement pedagogies that engage students and improve their understanding of course content.    Over the past five years, participation in the project has expanded to reach 20% of United States colleges and universities. In addition to formal educators and administrators, the community has expanded to include collaborations with informal educators, community-based representatives, and K-12 teachers. SENCER has provided professional development through symposia, webinars, and a substantial collection of resources available at www.sencer.net. Three thousand participants enrolled in regional and national symposia during the project period. New national meetings, including the Values-Based Academic Leadership Retreat and Science and Engineering for Social Good, complement the established quality programming provided by the annual SENCER Summer Institute and Washington Symposium. Assessment results indicate that methods learned at these meetings and involvement in the community has impacted over 200,000 students, 9,000 educators and administrators, and 2,600 courses and labs. Evidence indicates that involvement in SENCER changes faculty practice, meaning that the project will have exponential positive impacts as educators continue to apply research supported methods in their future course offerings.   SENCER contributed to the STEM education knowledge base by publishing peer-reviewed materials, including fourteen model courses, two backgrounder papers, and ten issues of Science Education and Civic Engagement &ndash; An International Journal. Additional publications and examples of course adaptations have emerged from the seventy-three small grants issued to educators to support course creation and improvement, learning research, and campus-specific professional development.    Intellectual Merit: As a Community of Transformation, SENCER has a wide reaching impact on improving educator practice within the STEM disciplines and through the interdisciplinary projects community members have launched. The SENCER approach builds student confidence and interest in STEM, and empowers students to use evidence to analyze civic issues and complex challenges in all areas.    Broader Impacts: By improving their confidence and interest in STEM, students are able to transfer the skills they gain in class and recognize the relevance of their coursework to issues in their personal lives and communities. Students are empowered to apply their knowledge to civic issues and carry that confidence through life.   As courses for pre-service teachers influence the way future educators will approach teaching students, it is especially important to improve the confidence and interest these individuals have in introducing STEM to elementary students. Providing positive STEM experiences for pre-service teachers has exponential impacts on the way future elementary students will react to STEM. By modeling course design based on research on how people learn, educators provide an example for the pre-service teachers of effective and engaging learning.
