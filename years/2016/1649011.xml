<AbstractNarration>This project is to support the Reinvention Center's 2016 National Conference, to be held November 14-15. Periodic national conferences hosted by the Reinvention Center are used to showcase a number of undergraduate STEM education advances and also provide a convenient venue for networking officials working to improve the quality of undergraduate STEM education in their universities. The 2016 conference goals are to highlight research on the impact of diversity, culture, and identity on: &lt;br/&gt;1. Undergraduate learning, degree completion, and gaps in patterns of student success across different sub-populations; &lt;br/&gt;2. Possibilities for vertical integration of discovery and learning activities involving faculty, post-docs, graduate students, undergraduates; and &lt;br/&gt;3. Possibilities for horizontal integration of discovery and learning across different administrative divisions in research universities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Viewed as part of the national picture for improving undergraduate STEM education, this project is a highly useful complement to ongoing efforts by the Association of American Universities, the Association of Public and Land Grant Universities, the Association of American Colleges and Universities, and a growing number of regional and national networks of institutions with focused improvement efforts for undergraduate STEM education, such as the Center for the Integration of Research, Teaching and Learning (with 46 members), the University Innovation Alliance (11 public university members), and the Bayview Alliance (with 6 US and 3 Canadian university members).  It contributes to the IUSE: EHR objective of supporting Community Transformation.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Reinvention Center (renamed the Reinvention Collaborative effective at the 2016 national conference) was created to pursue the recommendations in the Boyer Commission?s 1998 Report &ndash; Reinventing Undergraduate Education: A Blueprint for America?s Research Universities.   Since its founding at Stony Brook University in 2000, the Reinvention Collaborative &ndash; currently housed at Colorado State University &ndash; has grown into a member-funded consortium of 65-70 research universities dedicated to advancing undergraduate education (see http://reinventioncollaborative.colostate.edu/).  The National Science Foundation has provided critical backing for the consortium?s initiatives by providing support for the eight biennial national conferences the Reinvention Center has held between 2002 and 2016.  The grant referenced in this report supported the November 2016 conference held in Arlington, Virginia.  The 2016 conference theme was Diversity, Culture, &amp; Identity in America?s Research Universities: Research-Based Initiatives that Promote Shared Discovery and Learning by Students, Faculty, and Staff. The theme was selected to follow-up on a topic that emerged at the 2014 national conference that has become increasingly critical in higher education: the effects of diversity, culture, and identity on discovery, learning, and persistence to graduation at research institutions. In this context, discovery not only includes substantive research discoveries that emerge out of sustained inquiry and serendipitous "eureka" moments, but also individual and institutional self-discovery.  Individual self-discovery is a central part of students? intellectual and personal maturation and their post-graduation personal and professional success. Institutional self-discovery is critical to successful innovation in universities; perhaps nowhere more centrally so than in areas that touch on the effects of diversity, culture, and identity.  The conference opened with a discussion of what we know about the multiple intersections between culture, identity, learning, and discovery in research universities across academic and student affairs. We purposefully placed the focus of the initial discussion on what the research shows and what our experiences as administrators and educators suggest about the individual-level, lived experiences of students, faculty, and staff. The second and third plenary sessions then examined the interplay of these questions across the student lifecycle &ndash; from programs designed to build a more diverse and accomplished pipeline through degree completion and preparation for meaningful careers and life-long learning. The fourth, and concluding, plenary shifted the focus to macro-level institutional characteristics and posed the central administrative question: What would an institution that does these things well look like?   The conference also included meetings of the specialized networks within the consortium that were launched at the 2014 national meeting: Curricular/Co-curricular Engagement and Integrative Learning; Science of Learning and Pedagogical Innovation; Student success and Learning Analytics, and an additional network that was launched in 2015 on advising and academic guidance.  Over 175 attended the national conference and specialized network meetings.          Last Modified: 02/06/2018       Submitted by: Alan Lamborn]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
