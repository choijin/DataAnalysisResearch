<AbstractNarration>The primary focus of this exploratory research study is to investigate the work-life balance policies at North Carolina A&amp;T State University, as well as other minority serving institutions of higher education, to promote the success of STEM women faculty of color. The project will: 1) expand the NCA&amp;T STEM gender equity focus to include an emphasis on work-life equilibrium for STEM women faculty of color and 2) develop a rubric, appropriate to the HBCU context, to support the institutionalization of an HBCU Institutional Policy Matrix. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a collaborative effort between the North Carolina A&amp;T University ADVANCE Program and the recently NSF-funded Gender Values project, which has as its focus to implement widespread use of a mechanism for collecting and cataloguing institutional family friendly policies and practices as a function of levels of institutionalization and consideration for inclusivity. This collaboration represents an effort to provide institutions of higher education with a practical and tactical blueprint for promoting flexible workplace policies and practices for STEM women faculty of color at the level of precision required for dramatic change and sustained impact. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project will contribute significantly to advancing the national discussion and discourse on matters related to achieving gender friendly climates in the academy, particularly as they relate to the STEM fields.  A major outcome will be the HBCU Institutional Policy Matrix that can potentially serve as a featured contribution to the NSF Career Life Balance website, providing guidance to researchers and evaluators about the assessment of the integrity of existing institutional policies and their potential to support STEM women faculty of color.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ PROJECT OBJECTIVES:  The primary focus of this exploratory research study is to investigate the work-life balance policies at HBCUs through the development of a broad-based matrix that can aid NCA&amp;T, in conducting critical assessments of their institutional policies toward promoting the success of STEM women faculty of color. The proposed project will: 1) expand the NCA&amp;T STEM gender equity focus to include an emphasis on work-life equilibrium for STEM women faculty of color and 2) develop a rubric, appropriate to the HBCU context, to support the institutionalization of an HBCU Institutional Policy Matrix.  These goals will be accomplished through the following objectives:  Objective i:    Categorize effective family-friendly policies into a rubric that is culturally responsive to the HBCU context;  Objective ii:   Disseminate the HBCU Institutional Policy Matrix to key institutional and federal agency stakeholders;  Objective iii:  Evaluate the impact of the HBCU Institutional Policy Matrix at North Carolina A&amp;T University.  PROJECT OUTCOMES:  To address the project objectives, the research team designed and implemented a workshop to evaluate the rubric and codify work-life balance policies at NCA&amp;T and partner HBCUs.  The research team, in consultation with the external evaluator, developed an overall design for a faculty/administrator workshop that served as the platform for assessing the efficacy of the Gender Values tool within the HBCU context. The overarching goal of this workshop was to investigate the utility of the Gender Values Analytic Tool for assessing institutional policies, practices, and culture around work-life balance in HBCUs.  Herein, the listening groups held during the workshop sought to contribute to the understanding of the lived experiences of faculty members and investigate the alignment of work-life and family-friendly policies with faculty needs and realities.   Participants: We convened a group of faculty from ten universities. Of these institutions, six were public, and the remaining four were private. According to the Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education, eight of the colleges and universities were considered to be medium-sized; of the remaining two, one is small, and the other is very small. In addition, two HBCUs are classified as baccalaureate colleges, five are master's colleges &amp; universities, and one is a doctoral university with higher research activity, and two are doctoral universities with moderate research activity.
