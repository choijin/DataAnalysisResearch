<AbstractNarration>This award provides travel support for student participation in the Symposium on Undergraduate Research to be held at the Laser Science XXXII Conference. This conference is of great importance to the vitality of atomic, molecular, and optical physics in the United States because almost all work in this area involves lasers in some way. The support of students through this award makes a substantial contribution to the education and training of future scientists. Students who graduate with a background in atomic, molecular, and optical physics acquire a broad range of knowledge and skills that enable them to contribute to progress in many areas of science and technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Laser Science XXXII Conference, which this award supports, is a joint meeting of the American Physical Society's Division of Laser Science and the Optical Society of America's annual meeting to be held in Rochester, NY in October, 2016. This Conference offers an opportunity for students to present their research results and to interact with senior scientists primarily from the United States, but also the broader international community. Support is provided only for US students (students enrolled in US universities).</AbstractNarration>
