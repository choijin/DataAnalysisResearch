<AbstractNarration>Peter Rossky from the University of Texas at Austin is supported by the Chemical Theory, Models and Computational Methods Program in research focused on understanding, at the level of atoms, the molecular arrangements and time-dependent processes that occur when chemical changes take place in liquid solutions or in unstructured solid materials. These include the changes that occur in biological materials, in semiconductor materials, and in plastics.  Although computational modeling is increasingly able to describe these processes, serious challenges remain.  For example, it is very important to be able to understand what happens to the energy that is deposited in molecules through the absorption of light.  Such knowledge is a critical element for our understanding of the degradation of materials, of the functioning of solar cells, and of biological processes such as photosynthesis. The specific objective of the present studies is the development of new, generally applicable, theoretical and computational models and methods that can fully describe chemistry involving very light atoms and electrons, where quantum mechanics must be invoked. The algorithms being developed can be directly applied as computational tools for the design of advanced materials, pharmaceutical discovery, and nanoscale engineering.  They can also impact critical practical issues, including affordable solar energy capture for sustainable energy and a sustainable climate. Outreach activities stemming from this work contribute to the future stability of the scientific workforce, as well as to the public's ability to participate in science policy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research efforts are developing new simulation algorithms for the quantum mechanical description of nuclear motion that go beyond presently available practical methods in key respects. The novel method is based on the dynamics of Wigner transform variables and is a rather direct generalization of an earlier linearized path integral ("classical Wigner") approach. The new approach retains the ability to directly evaluate the dynamics of non-linear operators (e.g., in inelastic X-ray scattering) and describes vibrational dynamics without unphysical components associated with the simulation algorithm. Further, since the new method directly propagates the phase space points (in contrast to path-integral based approaches), there is good reason to believe that it can be integrated into a non-adiabatic electronic dynamics protocol. Applications to relatively well-characterized molecular systems are being used to test the capability of new methods. The molecular-scale insight needed to guide us to new materials with desired functions or insight into Nature's solutions will follow from the implementation of advanced computational science, coordinated with revealing experimental probes. The resulting capabilities form the basis for what may be the routine modeling methods of the future, just as the basic research of the last 50 years routinely provides for today's experimental researcher. Project efforts enhance education at all levels, including the professional development of graduate and postdoctoral students as researchers and educators with timely skills in the computational solution of physical problems.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The primary goal of this project has been to push forward in the development and useful computational implementation of methods that can simulate the time-dependent behavior of those materials where an explicit description of the electrons, and other light particles like hydrogen atoms, is critical to the material?s useful function.  This is typical of leading edge electronic, optical, and nano- materials. To correctly describe such materials requires a quantum mechanical approach.  However, to do this for a material like a sample of polymer, a cluster of molecules, or a liquid solution, requires that the method make approximations. Hence, part of our work involves comparing calculations with experiment to test these methods.  With these goals, we have primarily worked on two types of systems. The first class of system, water molecule clusters, has been the subject of very detailed and long-term experimental studies and involve hydrogen atoms as part of strongly interacting molecules. Such experiments provide a benchmark to test theory, while the theory can provide a more detailed view of the structure and mechanism that underlies measured behaviors.  Clusters of 10?s to 100?s of water molecules also readily carry an extra electron, making the negatively charged cluster a more complicated system involving both light atom and electronic aspects. Interestingly, even in this latter ?simple? system, there remain ongoing questions regarding how the electron influences the structure of the cluster.  The second class of systems is that of semiconducting polymers.  These polymers are candidate materials for the production of inexpensive plastic film solar cells. However, the polymer structures in such films and the detailed connection of those molecular structures to key properties, such as the efficiency of conversion of light to electricity, remains poorly understood.  Our molecular- and electronic-level studies have focused most on understanding the relationship between the actual structure and those properties that can be measured in a lab, so that future experiments can become more informative.   We have also pursued some applications that do not lie in the two categories above but are being studied experimentally and are of broad scientific interest.  Specifically, first, we have studied the effect of molecular coatings on a graphene sheet; graphene is a promising and intensely studied two-dimensional sheet of carbon with exceptional electronic and mechanical properties.  We explored the mechanism by which adsorbing a layer of molecules onto graphene can counteract undesirable effects of certain defects in a real sample of graphene.  We have also studied the mechanism behind the function of a fluorescent protein found to emit light differently when attached as a tag to a neuron that is participating in a signal (voltage change).
