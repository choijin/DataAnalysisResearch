<AbstractNarration>The Louis Stokes Alliances for Minority Participation (LSAMP) program assists universities and colleges in diversifying the STEM workforce through their efforts at significantly increasing the numbers of students successfully completing high quality degree programs in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) disciplines. Particular emphasis is placed on transforming STEM education through innovative recruitment and retention strategies and experiences in support of groups historically under-represented in STEM disciplines: African-Americans, Alaskan Natives, American Indians, Hispanic Americans, Native Hawaiians, and Native Pacific Islanders. The Bridge to the Doctorate (BD) Activity provides support for postbaccalaureate studies in STEM programs leading to the STEM doctoral degree. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The University of Delaware (UD), within a National Science Foundation (NSF) designated Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR), is the host site for the 2016-2018 BD program for the Greater Philadelphia Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation under the leadership of Drexel University. The program supports a graduate student cohort of 12 underrepresented minority (URM) STEM Ph.D. students from LSAMP campuses across the nation. The BD Activity provides extensive training in specific STEM disciplines as well as professional development and guidance that promote peer mentoring and leadership in the scientific community. Students receive rigorous academic and research training experiences that support completion of the Ph.D. and the transition to a competitive career in academia and industry. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Over the duration of the project and beyond, the BD program at UD serves to increase the number and quality of students from underrepresented groups completing STEM Ph.D. degrees and entering the professoriate. Evaluation research from the project's implementation has the potential to address the following questions:  (1) Beyond Bridge to the Doctorate funded program activities, what are the different methods being used by specific graduate STEM departments and why are certain ones more effective than others in increasing the capacity of specific graduate STEM departments to produce more readily well-qualified underrepresented minority doctoral STEM degree recipients? (2) How will engaging the faculty research advisors of the fellows as a collective group on a regular basis to review scholarly productivity of the individual fellows have an impact on the mentoring experience of the participants and their progression to doctoral completion?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The long-term impact of the BD activity is reflected in America's STEM workforce, both in academia and in industrial research and development. By nurturing the future professoriate, as well as the scientific workforce, the value added is seen in the visibility of minorities in science and engineering, increasing representation and providing role models and motivation for the next generation.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Drexel University, as a representative of the Greater Philadelphia Region Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (Philadelphia AMP), was awarded Bridge to the Doctorate (BTD) funding for a two-year period for a Cohort XIV project to expand and intensify the consortium's on-going efforts to substantially increase the number of qualified African American, Hispanic, and Native American (hereafter referred to as "minority") students who enter graduate study in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM), attain doctoral degrees, and move into the professoriate.  The Philadelphia AMP represents a diverse alliance of nine institutions consisting of public and private, 2- and 4-year research and non-research, Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and majority institutions.    University of Delaware (UD) was selected to host the BTD Cohort XIV activities because of: 1) the key role it has played in the successful development and implementation of the Alliance?s BTD Cohort I-XII projects, 2) the institutional changes which have occurred in support of STEM diversity at UD in hosting its previous Cohort IX project, 3)  its continued efforts to leverage the relationship between Majority Institutions and HBCUs as the candidacy pool for the Ph.D. granting institutions, 4) its institution-wide commitment to increase diversity in STEM at both the undergraduate and graduate levels, and 5) its capacity to engage students in cutting-edge research activities.  The goals of the BTD Cohort XIV project were to: (1) recruit twelve students into Master's or Ph.D. degree programs at the UD; (2) retain these students through the completion of the Master's or Ph.D. program, providing the Master's students with full qualifications for admission into a highly regarded Ph.D. program in their chosen STEM specialty with full financial support; (3) enable the Master's students' admission and smooth transition into a Ph.D. program; and (4) monitor all student progress through Ph.D. completion into the professoriate and beyond.   A total of thirteen (13) BTD fellows were recruited to participate in the BTD Cohort XIV project, nine (9) of which were from Philadelphia AMP and/or national LSAMP HBCU institutions: Cheyney University (2 fellows), Delaware State University (2 fellows), Lincoln University (4 fellows), and Howard University (1 fellow); the remaining four (4) fellows were from the University of Delaware. The project assisted BTD fellows with the development of laboratory instrumentation skills, research presentation techniques, scientific / technical expertise, and interpersonal skills needed to successfully navigate graduate STEM education, as well as industry and academic positions. Professional development programming was utilized as a medium in which to discuss markers of success and the resources available to grow and achieve in these areas, e.g. research productivity, publication, networking to identify collaborative opportunities, conference/meeting participation to increase awareness of the students? work in their disciplinary area and also to add breadth and depth of knowledge, etc.   Through their program participation, BTD fellows contributed nationally and internationally to the advancement of scientific knowledge as they conducted cutting-edge research under the supervision of research faculty. As a result of the latter, BTD fellows continued their development as committed and thoughtful learners who were actively engaged in the process of becoming leaders within the scientific community.   All thirteen (13) fellows are/were enrolled in Master?s programs, and ten (10) have graduated as of the September 2019. It is anticipated that the three (3) additional BTD fellows will receive their Master?s degree by the end of December 2019. One hundred percent (100%) of the BTD fellows have also attained a cumulative GPA of 3.0 or better, and fifteen percent (15%) have a cumulative GPA of 3.5 or above. In addition, when compared to their peers, BTD Cohort XIV project participants, on average, performed slightly higher than their peers -- given incoming academic credentials which were lower (from a statistical significance perspective in reference to their slightly lower GRE scores), on average, than their peers.  To date, three (3) fellows have also been admitted to Ph.D. programs; two (2) fellows at the University of Delaware in Animal and Food Sciences, and Electrical and Computer Engineering, respectively, and one (1) fellow at the University of Maryland Baltimore County in Biochemical Engineering. Of the total thirteen (13) BTD fellows, ten (10) fellows have made a commitment to continue the pursuit of their PhD degree.  Broader Impacts include: (1) increasing the number and quality of students from underrepresented minority groups at AMP institutions entering and being retained in STEM M.S. and Ph.D. degree programs; (2) advancing knowledge in STEM disciplines through the promotion of research activity; (3) influencing changes in attitudes and perceptions of STEM faculty and administrators regarding the viability of underrepresented minority students having the capacity to succeed in advanced technological curricula; (4) disseminating information about best practices used to promote the retention of students from underrepresented groups; and (5) enhancing the infrastructure for research and education through the development of support networks and partnerships.
