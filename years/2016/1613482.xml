<AbstractNarration>Humans can survive for weeks without food, but only days without water, and modern human populations have found creative and culturally-transmitted solutions for living in dry areas of the world. However, little is known about the evolutionary origins of water-seeking and selection behaviors. This doctoral dissertation project aims to understand adaptations to water scarcity in primates that experience highly seasonal conditions, including how they locate and navigate to water sources, why they select certain water sources over others, and what impact these decisions have on their health and survival. The results of this project will contribute to understanding factors that influenced human and primate evolution in water-scarce habitats, and could inform future interventions for humans and primates living in drought areas. The project will also support graduate student training and international collaborations, and the student co-PI will share data on water quality with communities around the study site. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will test the hypotheses that water distribution and water quality influence ranging patterns and water preference, and that these behaviors have downstream effects on parasite infection. The project will study a population of habituated, wild red-fronted lemurs (Eulemur rufifrons) at Kirindy Forest in western Madagascar that is remarkable for surviving an annual 9-month dry season in which no rain typically falls. These lemurs subsist on standing waterholes that vary in color, clarity, and distance from lemur groups' home ranges. This combined observational and experimental project will employ high-resolution GPS collars, experimentally manipulated water availability and quality. Gastrointestinal parasite infection dynamics will also be analyzed. Through this research, the PIs will contribute to a new theoretical framework focused on water and water-borne disease as a selective pressure on primate behavior, and on the trade-offs that primates face when living in or expanding into dry habitats.</AbstractNarration>

Most previous research in this area has studied food resources, while water resources have received substantially less attention for their potential to impact primate behavior. This is surprising because water is essential to the survival and health of all animals, especially of species that live in seasonally arid or drought conditions. Given that rainfall (and subsequent water availability) is predicted to be increasingly variable in the future, understanding how water influences primate behavior in water-scarce environments represents a high priority for conservation of threatened species. Lemurs are a group of mammals at high risk of extinction, and many species of lemurs live in seasonally dry areas that are especially vulnerable to droughts.

We also examined how the risk of disease transmission at water sources influenced lemurs? selection of them. Finally, we addressed how risk of encountering predators affected lemurs? drinking behavior.   Our main scientific findings can be summarized as follows:   1. The location of water resources determined where lemurs spend time in the forest. Using GPS collars, we tracked the movements of the lemurs and quantified their use of different areas of the forest. We compared how much time lemurs spent in areas of the forest near natural water sources before and after these water sources dried up. We found that lemurs were much less likely to spend time in these areas after they dried, which indicates that the presence of water caused the lemurs to use this area of the habitat. In addition, we conducted an experiment in which we introduced water into the habitat using buckets to create "artificial waterholes." The lemurs spent more time near the artificial waterholes when they contained water, and subsequently spent less time when the water was removed. Together, these concurrent observational and experimental results support the conclusion that water is a major factor driving lemurs? use of their habitat. They also indicate that lemurs are flexible in their patterns of habitat use in response to drastic changes in water availability.   2. Lemurs preferred to avoid disease risk at water sources. In this water-scarce environment, water sources are areas of high risk of disease transmission because they are shared by many animals that congregate and deposit feces around them. In an experiment with the artificial waterholes, we determined that lemurs preferred to drink clean water rather than water that was contaminated with lemur feces (but disinfected, to reduce any risk of disease transmission). We used motion-activated cameras to track lemurs? use of natural water sources and surveyed the degree of fecal contamination of the areas surrounding the water sources.

But lemurs were more likely to return to waterholes that had lower levels of fecal contamination, suggesting that when possible, the lemurs reduced their exposure to fecally transmitted diseases. However, this preference for clean water was secondary to lemurs? preference for waterholes that were nearby.   3. Lemurs used water sources at times of day that predators were unlikely to be present. Using motion-activated cameras, we characterized the patterns of water use by lemurs and their two major predators, fossa and harrier hawks. We found that lemurs commonly drank in the morning and evening, at times of day when their predators were not commonly observed at the water sources.    Together, these results help us to understand how water influences various aspects of red-fronted lemur ecology, including lemurs? interactions with their environment, predators, and parasites. From a conservation perspective, increased water scarcity in future dry seasons is likely to influence these interactions, and may increase the risk of predation and disease transmission.
