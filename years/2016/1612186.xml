<AbstractNarration>Project i-NATURE (Indigenous iNtegration of Aquatic sciences and Traditional-Ecological-Knowledge for Undergraduate culturally Responsive Education) will incorporate Traditional Ecological Knowledge into existing models of STEM instruction and provide insights into environmental issues that impact American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) communities. It will build an interconnected STEM program that fosters a culturally sensitive approach to teaching the natural sciences and resource conservation. AI/AN students have the lowest college enrollment and graduation rates of any student cohort at mainstream U.S. colleges and universities, and are significantly underrepresented in the STEM fields. This project seeks to understand and address this enrollment deficit, and prepare students for their futures through culturally relevant partnerships, research, and an experiential, learner-centered curriculum. i-NATURE will develop a collaborative network between academia and tribal natural resource programs in the Pacific Northwest, and produce an interconnected academic STEM program that fosters and builds on an existing cultural gravitation of AI/AN students toward the natural sciences and resource conservation. It will serve as model for other underrepresented groups and regions nationwide, as well as those interested in environmental issues.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of i-NATURE is to develop a new, culturally responsive, place-based STEM curriculum that provides a seamless transition from high school and into the STEM workforce for American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) students. i-NATURE will develop this model using multiple partnerships among academic institutions (including Tribal Colleges) and tribal natural resource programs in the Pacific Northwest. The program will be tailored to meet the needs of AI/AN students in a culturally responsive manner while helping students acquire the skills and knowledge most critical for success in STEM fields. It will also prepare students for the 21st century workforce. The components of this model include: (i) an experiential project-based learning model with an emphasis on data analysis and communication, (ii) intergenerational mentoring, (iii) summer internships, and (iv) regional partnership development to create programs uniquely tailored for AI/AN success in STEM. It will generate new evidence regarding the student-level impacts on learning, success, and affect as a result of a community-driven, Traditional Ecological Knowledge approach to STEM education.</AbstractNarration>

The program also seeks to explore and develop best practices for incorporating Traditional Ecological Knowledge into STEM education. Here we tested whether this inclusive pedagogical model leads to improved persistence and learning outcomes. We saw a statistically significant improvement in annual retention and mean course grade point average (GPA) in the Environmental Science and Studies Programs pre- and post- implementation of the i-NATURE curriculum. We also saw an increase in participating students interested in and/or applying to graduate school or working for their tribe (100%) and 50% of recent graduates have already been accepted into graduate programs. This study indicates that culturally-relevant academic and research experiences in STEM programming, such as the i-NATURE model, can improve student success and interest in entering STEM fields.</p> <p><strong>Project Background, Significance, and Outcomes</strong></p> <p>Native Americans are the most underrepresented group in the STEM fields, likely because students encounter serious challenges in the culture of the mainstream academic community (Levy, 1992; Falc&oacute;n and Jacob, 2011). In 2009, of the 17% American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) nationwide who held bachelor&rsquo;s degrees, only 3% were in STEM careers (USDCESA, 2011). The low representation of minorities in STEM fields is especially concerning for Tribal Departments of Natural Resources, as they are in unique positions of land and natural resource management under sovereign governance. With this recognized need for more Native representation in STEM, and Natural Resources in particular, many questions remain as to what factors contribute to low retention, how to improve learning outcomes, and ways to increase participation and perseverance.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>We developed the <strong>i-NATURE</strong>(<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">I</span>ndigenous i<span style="text-decoration: underline;">N</span>tegration of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">A</span>quatic sciences and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">T</span>raditional-Ecological-Knowledge for <span style="text-decoration: underline;">U</span>ndergraduate culturally <span style="text-decoration: underline;">R</span>esponsive <span style="text-decoration: underline;">E</span>ducation) </strong>program to address the issues outlined above from an asset, rather than a deficit model by incorporating the strengths and unique insights of Native culture into STEM curriculum. The components of this model included: (i) an experiential, place-based learning model with an emphasis on understanding, analysis, and communication of local environmental issues, (ii) intergenerational mentoring, and (iii) indigenous research internships. The program&rsquo;s inclusive pedagogy was created to meet the needs of AI/AN Biology and Environmental Science and Studies students through experiential learning, computing and data analysis, intergenerational mentoring, and research internships while addressing a critical community need (water and fisheries resource issues).</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>We used Kirkness &amp; Barnhard&rsquo;s &ldquo;Four R&rsquo;s&rdquo; [i. Respect - increase the acceptance, respect, and representation of Indigenous cultural values and traditions in domains of knowledge;&nbsp; ii. Relevance - legitimize Indigenous knowledge and skills through inclusive pedagogies; iii. Reciprocal relationships - Allow for teaching and learning to be a reciprocal process, whereas instructors are not the sole distributors of knowledge; iv. Responsibility through participation - examine university culture and power structures and work with Indigenous communities to adjust policy to meet the needs of students and communities] to examine the socialization and enculturation of student experiences within an aquatic and fisheries science program under a culturally-relevant and place-based model. We measured persistence by retention before and after the program. We measured student success by grade point average (GPA) scores before and after the program. We saw statistically significant increases in both retention and GPA scores for AI/AN students after implementation of the i-NATURE program.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>This study indicates that culturally-relevant academic and research experiences in STEM programming, such as the i-NATURE model outlined here, can assist students in meeting these broader goals. They are in alignment with Kirkness &amp; Barnhard&rsquo;s (2001) recommendations for institutions of higher learning to implement the &ldquo;Four R&rsquo;s&rdquo; in curricular and administrative capacities. These include respecting the cultural values and traditions in domains of knowledge, providing relevance through legitimizing indigenous knowledge through inclusive pedagogies, reciprocal sharing of knowledge, and the responsibility of examining power structures between the university culture and Indigenous stakeholders and adjusting to meet the needs of students and communities. By acknowledging student and community goals toward education&rsquo;s role in self-determination and respecting the cultural values that represent the values, traditions, and domains of knowledge, students are not as pressured to cross wide cultural borders on purely western institutional values. Incorporating traditional ecological knowledge, place-based learning opportunities, and issues pertinent to local and regional tribal communities helps to situate learning in a way that is not only meaningful for students, but prepares them to use their weapons in battle in the STEM workforce.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 10/22/2019<br>      Modified by: Alexander&nbsp;Alexiades</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1612186/1612186_10460401_1571697455274_iNATURE_GPA_improvement--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1612186/1612186_10460401_1571697455274_iNATURE_GPA_improvement--rgov-800width.jpg" title="i-NATURE significantly increased mean GPA for AI/AN students"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1612186/1612186_10460401_1571697455274_iNATURE_GPA_improvement--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="i-NATURE significantly increased mean GPA for AI/AN students"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Average GPA in piloted courses pre and post i-NATURE curriculum changes.(T-test, df = 3, p = 0.04, t = 2.5)</div> <div class="imageCredit">Alexander Alexiades</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Public Domain</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Alexander&nbsp;Alexiades</div> <div class="imageTitle">i-NATURE significantly increased mean GPA for AI/AN students</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1612186/1612186_10460401_1571697368684_iNATURE_recruitment--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1612186/1612186_10460401_1571697368684_iNATURE_recruitment--rgov-800width.jpg" title="i-NATURE significantly increased retention for AI/AN students"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1612186/1612186_10460401_1571697368684_iNATURE_recruitment--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="i-NATURE significantly increased retention for AI/AN students"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Annual retention in the Environmental Science and Studies Programs (ESS) pre- and post- implementation of the i-NATURE curriculum (4-sample test for equality of proportions, (4-sample test for equality of proportions, &#935;2= 24.96, df = 3, p = 0.0001).</div> <div class="imageCredit">Alexander Alexiades</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Public Domain</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Alexander&nbsp;Alexiades</div> <div class="imageTitle">i-NATURE significantly increased retention for AI/AN students</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1612186/1612186_10460401_1571697672290_IMG_4676--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1612186/1612186_10460401_1571697672290_IMG_4676--rgov-800width.jpg" title="i-NATURE Indigenous Research Intern presenting his research"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1612186/1612186_10460401_1571697672290_IMG_4676--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="i-NATURE Indigenous Research Intern presenting his research"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">AISES 2017 National Conference, Denver Colorado</div> <div class="imageCredit">Alexander Alexiades</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Public Domain</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Alexander&nbsp;Alexiades</div> <div class="imageTitle">i-NATURE Indigenous Research Intern presenting his research</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1612186/1612186_10460401_1571697883139_HUfishcounting101318-0367--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1612186/1612186_10460401_1571697883139_HUfishcounting101318-0367--rgov-800width.jpg" title="PI Alexiades teaching students in a lab class on the Yakama Indian Reservation"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1612186/1612186_10460401_1571697883139_HUfishcounting101318-0367--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="PI Alexiades teaching students in a lab class on the Yakama Indian Reservation"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Electrofishing lab to estimate population dynamics in Toppenish Creek at one of two long-term monitoring sites on the Yakama Reservation.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Gordon King Photography</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Public Domain</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Alexander&nbsp;Alexiades</div> <div class="imageTitle">PI Alexiades teaching students in a lab class on the Yakama Indian Reservation</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
