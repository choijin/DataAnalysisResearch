<AbstractNarration>Abstract &lt;br/&gt;Nontechnical: &lt;br/&gt;In this collaborative research effort, the PIs will combine their work on perovskite solar cells and marketable silicon solar cells, to produce a high efficiency tandem device with the potential to be available commercially. The multidisciplinary research team couples expertise in the design of electronic and photonic materials and processes for advanced applications and the design, synthesis and characterization of inorganic functional materials, with expertise in the research, development and manufacturing of high-efficiency, low-cost crystalline silicon cells. The research initiative will lead to the next generation photovoltaic that will allow for the robust fabrication of perovskite-silicon monolithic tandem solar cells, applicable for use in widespread industrial-scale manufacturing of energy harvesting modules. It is expected that the materials and fabrication protocols associated with the tandem photovoltaic devices will help enable widespread implementation of the technologies. Thus, this research will have substantial influence on the energy sector and achieve the goal of bringing the potential benefits of nanotechnology to society in general, as well as the everyday energy consumer. Overall, the results of this research will make a significant contribution to the scientific community and provide an intellectual and experimental framework for future investigations into tandem devices for the widespread application of innovations in nanotechnology. Low-cost, ubiquitous, environmentally sustainable, high-efficiency, tandem solar cells are expected to be transformational for industries ranging from healthcare, environmental quality, energy and security. In addition to providing access to sustainable, high-efficiency, energy harvesting devices, the current project provides opportunities for the integration of research and education in technologies of societal significance. Participants will benefit from the multidisciplinary, collaborative nature of the program; all will be cross-trained in multiple areas to further expand their knowledge and experience through relevant additional collaborations. Students will grow in an environment that promotes an understanding of all aspects of the project necessary for success. The investigators maintain strong and long-running commitments to broadened participation in science and engineering, and to serving the community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical: &lt;br/&gt;This research effort aims to develop the next generation perovskite-silicon tandem solar cells with efficiencies exceeding 30%. Exploratory research will focus on two critical aspects: i) fabrication of high efficiency, semi-transparent top metal-halide perovskite solar cells and bottom silicon solar cells; and ii) engineering of highly effective interconnecting layers between sub-cells to achieve monolithic tandems with efficiencies greater than 30%. Integration of metal-halide perovskites in tandem with commercially available solar cells, such as silicon, provides opportunities to significantly upgrade device and module performance. Further, the solution processability of metal-halide perovskites offers a cost effective option for upgrades to existing manufactured units. Through this collaboration, the most critical issues associated with AMX3 lead based perovskite-silicon monolithic tandem solar cells which prevent their achieving theoretically predicted efficiencies will be addressed. Specifically, this research will i) develop the materials and processes that will allow deposition of transparent conducting electrodes on perovskite thin film solar cells while maintaining high efficiencies and ii) engineer a transparent interconnecting electrical connection between the sub cells. The research team will identify transformative, practical materials engineering approaches to resolve both these key problems. The materials and fabrication protocols developed here will enable integration of perovskites with existing silicon solar cell technologies and facilitate the widespread commercialization and implementation of perovskite-silicon tandem solar cell technologies.</AbstractNarration>
