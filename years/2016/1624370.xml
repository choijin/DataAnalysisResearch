<AbstractNarration>General Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project elucidates factors influencing inclusion of women in government in established democracies like the United States, where women have high levels of education and employment yet continue to hold fewer elected and appointed positions than men.  Previous studies have sought to explain differences in representation of women among countries based on electoral institution design, economic development, and culture, but those factors leave much of the variance unexplained.  This study collects and interprets new data utilizing a carefully designed experiment to assess perception of women's suitability for specific types of political posts and in different policy areas.  The research design also allows findings to be assessed by established theories from psychology explaining attitudes individuals have of political candidates because of existing stereotypes of gender, similarity to oneself, or lack of attributes considered necessary to lead.  The study is conducted in eight countries, differing in electoral institutions, national priorities, and prior inclusion of women in government.  This set of countries enables comparisons of numerous factors such as candidate's political party and candidate gender, type of post and policy area, prior inclusion of women in key government posts, and voter attributes such as sex, socio-economic status, political ideology, and gender-role attitudes.  This study will provide knowledge needed to strengthen democracy throughout the world by enhancing understanding of the challenges for inclusion in government of historically under-represented groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project conducts an experiment to collect comparable cross-national data about societal attitudes about the capacity of women, compared to men to govern in varying levels of posts and policy areas.  The experiment, which has already been carried out in Costa Rica and Israel, will be replicated in Canada, Chile, England, Sweden, the United States, and Uruguay.  These countries are all established democracies, but they vary in inclusion of women in government, institutional rules, and in the centrality of social welfare vs. defense issues on the government's policy agenda.  The experiment uses a candidate speech of about 500 words, plus a brief candidate biography as the treatment.  In this context the sex of the candidate as well as the party she/he represent are introduced as experimental treatments.  We use the effect of the party affiliation of the candidate as means to gauge the magnitude of the impact of gender on candidate evaluations.  In each country, the experiment participants will be randomly assigned to a treatment group.  After reading the speech, participants complete a questionnaire that ask them to evaluate the candidate for various posts and in diverse policy areas.  The questionnaire also contains items about the background of the participant for conducting post hoc analysis to explore whether people from different demographic or ideological backgrounds exhibit different attitudes about the capacity of women and men to be leaders in government.  Finally there is a battery of questions for conducting a sex role analysis, also for use in post hoc analysis and cross-national comparison.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Women remain under-represented in governments globally and many questions are still unanswered about institutional and societal barriers to women's inclusion in government.  This research investigated factors influencing attitudes of young adults regarding the ability of women vs. men to govern, via parallel experiments in 8 countries [Canada (Alberta and Quebec), Chile, Costa Rica, England, Israel, Sweden, Uruguay, and the U.S.A. (California and Texas)].  It is the first cross-national experiment-based study on attitudes regarding the capacity of women vs. men to govern.  In total, 6,847 mostly urban young adults participated in a controlled setting within university, vocational, and final-year high school classrooms.  All 8 countries were long-established democracies with high levels of education and workforce participation for both women and men, but they differed in ways theorized to create different attitudes about women serving in government.  Notably, the countries varied markedly in their history of women leaders in national government, which researchers predict to favor acceptance of women by voters.  Countries also differed in the extent of government policy focus on social welfare vs. defense/security.  Prior studies predicted people would consider men more capable in defense than in social welfare policy areas, due to gender stereotypes, and thus more likely than women to be elected or appointed in countries where defense or security issues dominate national policy.  The study also measured differences in political preferences of male and female candidates based on participants' characteristics such as sex, traditional gendered attitudes, position on a left-right political spectrum, political party preference, family educational level, and socio-economic status.   The randomized experiment conducted enabled direct comparisons between the magnitude of differences between participant preferences for political candidates based on gender, as opposed to those attributable to political party, or partisan policies. These contrasts provide insight to whether any gender effects detected were of sufficient magnitude to be politically important.  Partisan effects, which were always detected, also provided a measure of experimental sensitivity, ensuring that the absence of the detection of a gender effect was not due to insensitivity of the experiment or inattentiveness of the participants, but rather to the fact that an important gender preference simply was not present.  Interactive effects of candidate gender and policy area on voter approval were examined as well, in order to evaluate participant opinions regarding women vs. men candidates' competence in stereotypically feminine vs. masculine policy areas.                Across countries, the most consistent result was statistically robust detection of partisan effects on participant attitudes, as would be predicted, but coupled to relatively weaker gender effects, in a number of cases favoring women rather than men, and often strongly favoring women over men within stereotypically feminine policy domains such as women's rights or child care.  Thus, the fundamental overall results indicated the experiment worked well to provide a politically realistic context against which to evaluate candidate gender effects as well as the interactive effects of country specific political history, candidate gender, candidate party and policy statements, and a wide range of voter attributes in the countries examined.     Findings from the study supported the prediction that the national policy agenda can influence the extent to which people hold traditional leadership ideas or mental templates wherein "leaders are men", versus the view that both women and men have equal capability as leaders.  The contrast between Israel (where the army is of foremost importance) and Costa Rica (which has no army) is particularly noteworthy.  By comparison, the prediction that increased exposure to women in politics increases acceptance of women candidates was not strongly supported.  Shared party preference by participant and candidate was associated with more favorable evaluations for both male and female candidates.  However, common sex of candidate and participant was not typically associated with better candidate evaluations -- rather, male and female participants usually appraised male and female candidates similarly.  The findings indicate that at least with respect to young, urban adults in these 8 countries, it may be unstrategic for parties to hesitate in nominating or appointing women for top posts from fear that voters would view women as less capable than male candidates, or incongruent with their mental templates of a leader.  Additional important relationships influencing voter preferences in relation to gender are evident in the full dataset from this study.  This grant has produced a dataset with candidate evaluations on 18 dimensions for 6,847 participants across 8 countries.  The dataset will be submitted at the end of the embargo period to the ICPSR data archive.  We are also preparing an edited book, to be published by a university press, presenting detailed findings for each country, and findings from a meta-analysis of the combined data exploring factors that only vary at the national level.
