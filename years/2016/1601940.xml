<AbstractNarration>This project concerns several problems at the interface of algebraic geometry and number theory.  There is a rich interplay between these two fields which are at the center of many of the most important past and current developments in mathematics. A number of important problems in number theory, such as questions about the number of solutions of Diophantine equations, can be reinterpreted in geometric terms allowing for the use of powerful tools from algebraic geometry. Conversely, many important geometric questions are motivated by arithmetic applications; for example, questions about the geometry of so-called moduli spaces. The proposed work has connections to other parts of mathematics, such as representation theory, combinatorics, and mathematical physics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More specifically, the project explores four principal areas related to this interplay between arithmetic and geometry.  In collaboration with other experts form this field, the PI will investigate the arithmetic of algebraic varieties and its relationship with derived categories of coherent sheaves, building on earlier work on K3 surfaces.  The PI will study the main components of moduli spaces, and various generalizations of log geometry.  A third part of the project is aimed at understanding the motivic nature of sheaves on algebraic varieties over finite fields, and various invariants thereof.  In the fourth part, which is more foundational in nature, the PI will work with collaborators on a new approach to the development of a six operations formalism for l-adic sheaves on stacks.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project concerns fundamental questions in algebraic geometry.  This is the part of mathematics concerned with the spaces, or algebraic varieties, that arise as solution sets of multivariate polynomials.  Such spaces are fundamental in many parts of mathematics, such as number theory, representation theory, and combinatorics, in addition to algebraic geometry itself. The main outcomes of the project are new results about invariants of algebraic varieties, such as derived categories, algebraic fundamental groups, and the associated Zariski topological spaces.  In addition, the work introduced new techniques and ideas which will be used in future work.  More specifically, the main outcomes of the project break into the following categories:  1. New results concerning the question of when derived equivalent algebraic varieties are birational.  2. New results about fundamental groups including results about local fundamental groups of singularities and about fundamental groups of logarithmic schemes and their variation in families.  3. New results about p-adic Hodge theory for fundamental groups and related arithmetic aspects.  4.  A construction of a theory of Hochschild homology for log schemes using the theory of algebraic stacks.  5. New results about classification of algebraic varieties using their Zariski topological spaces.  The principal broader impact activities pertaining to the grant is in support of training of graduate students.  Throughout the project PhD students were involved and their participation is an important component of their training to become independent research mathematicians.
