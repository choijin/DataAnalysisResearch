<AbstractNarration>This award supports work to understand neutrinos: the smallest but most common massive particle in the universe. Although there are a billion neutrinos for every more well-known electron or proton, neutrinos interact only via the so-called "weak" force: so they rarely bump into anything, even the detectors designed to study them. That means they are also the least well understood of the fundamental particles.  One of the big mysteries in neutrino science is how they change (or ?oscillate?) from one type to another. Neutrino oscillation experiments explore possible explanations for the difference between matter and anti-matter in the Universe. This project will improve the computational tools for simulating and estimating neutrino fluxes for existing and future neutrino oscillation experiments.  These tools are necessary for efficient and cost-effective design of the neutrino beams and detectors used in high-energy particle physics.  &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The best available data on hadron production cross sections and other experimental inputs will be incorporated into existing beam-line simulations, and improved tools for rapid iteration of studies for novel beam-line designs will be created. This effort will both produce improved simulations of the NuMI beamline at Fermilab, leading to improved measurements of neutrino cross sections in the MINERvA experiment, and inform the design and optimization of the future DUNE/LBNF long baseline neutrino oscillation experiment.   The methods used in this program are also broadly applicable to the optimization of beam-line and detector systems for physics research. Graduate and undergraduate students will be exposed to modern simulation and computing techniques. Previous students from this group have gone on to highly successful careers both in the private sector and in High Energy Physics.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ A long-term goal of the US high energy physics program  is precision measurements of the CP violating phase delta and the neutrino mass ordering  in a long baseline neutrino oscillation experiment.     Neutrino oscillations are only evident when a) a neutrino is produced as a mixture of two mass eigenstates and b)  the slightly different masses of the two neutrino species cause their wave functions to beat against each other. This beating can be detected by measuring the ratio of the detection rates for the two neutrino species at two distances from the neutrino source, with the maximum beat effect happening when the mass difference squared between the two species has specific values of the proportional the distance over the energy.  Thus, for a given separation distance, there is an ideal energy to maximize the oscillation effect.      The proposed Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) experiment will take a very high intensity neutrino beam from Fermilab and direct it towards a multi-kiloton neutrino detector located in the Sanford Underground Research Facility (SURF) in South Dakota.  The distance between Fermilab and SURF of 1300 km corresponds to an optimal oscillation maximum at an energy of  around 3.0 GeV. The LBNF (Long Baseline Neutrino Facility) neutrino beamline design is an evolution of the successful NuMI beamline  used in the MINOS, MINERvA, ArgoNeut and NOvA experiments but is necessarily new as the baseline and flux requirements for DUNE require a new beam direction and higher beam power.  The need for a new beamline created an opportunity to use existing experience with the NuMI line to create an improved and optimized system.     Neutrino beamlines consist of a proton source, such as the Fermilab Main Injector (MI), a target system to create pions and kaons, electromagnetic  horns to sign-select and focus the mesons, a decay volume, a beam dump to remove residual hadrons, shielding and a near detector to detect unoscillated neutrinos. The DUNE/LBNF Conceptual Design Report\cite{CDR} included  a preliminary  design for the LBNF beamline based largely on the existing NuMi systems.      In this project, graduate student Amit Bashyal enhanced a neutrino beam flux simulation originally developed for the NuMI beam line for the LBNF beam line   He, and Fermilab physicists, adapted the program  g4numi to create g4lbne, a beamline simulation that does full ray tracing and interaction modeling for the chain of particle interactions that leads from an incident proton hitting the target through a chain of interactions to a final meson decaying to produce a neutrino.      This project extended the beamline simulation  to make full use of our evolving knowledge of hadronic interaction rates using a technique, Particle Production for Cross Sections (ppfx), originally developed by Leonidas Aliaga and Michael Kordosky at William and Mary.  In the ppfx method, the simulation produces output which includes the location of every high energy particle interaction in the chain of interactions leading to neutrino production.  Those interactions can then be reweighted to reflect improvements in our knowledge of hadron interaction rates and to estimate the effects of uncertainties in those interaction rates on the neutrino flux prediction.      Bashyal improved  the algorithms and usability of the g4lbne and pptx packages to allow rapid iteration during the engineering design phase of the LBNF beamline. The ability to perform rapid iteration of design parameters due to Bashyal?s work allowed the optimization work to proceed quickly. In the end, the optimized beamline design produced neutrino fluxes 30% higher than the original design.       Bashyal then backported the improvements in the techniques and flux estimates to the NuMI beamline simulations for use in the MINERvA neutrino cross section experiment which ran from 2010-2019. The MINERvA experiment's main goal is the precision measurement of neutrino cross sections in support of CP violation experiments. The uncertainty on these measurements has been dominated by our lack of understanding of the incoming neutrino flux.   Improved neutrino flux estimates, using the hadron constraints and improved beam simulations resulting from Bashyal?s work, have reduced the neutrino flux uncertainties on MINERvA measurements from 8-9% to 4-5%. Bashyal?s doctoral dissertation, which describes both the DUNE simulation work and novel high precision neutrino cross section measurements using his improved MINERvA flux estimates should be complete by November 2020.
