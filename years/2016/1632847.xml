<AbstractNarration>The STEM Equity Achievement (SEA Change) workshop project will bring together teams from six to eight public and private higher education institutions to develop and launch a pilot program to recognize U.S. institutions higher education that have demonstrated commitments to promoting an equitable environment for underrepresented groups in STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics).  The American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) is a partner on this pilot project with the institutions of higher education.  The model to be developed will be informed by the successful Athena SWAN model developed in the United Kingdom (UK).  Athena SWAN evolved from work between the Athena Project and the Scientific Women's Academic Network (SWAN) which were earlier efforts to advance the representation of women in science, technology, engineering, medicine and mathematics in the UK.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The SEA Change workshop supported with this grant is expected to result in a rating model that the participating institutions will implement and test as a pilot.  This pilot work will develop and refine a process and structure for a rating system that may be effective in the United States.  Based on the success in the UK, this type of rating system could result in institutions of higher education voluntarily seeking ratings from the system.</AbstractNarration>

In February 2019 it is expected that the first Bronze Awards (the first stage of mapping directions for institutional change) will be announced at the Annual AAAS Meetings at a session led by Dr. Shirley Malcom, AAAS.
