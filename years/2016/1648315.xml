<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to develop novel software technologies to assess cellular metabolism, which is critical for optimizing cell-based manufacturing of biochemicals, drugs, and foods. The same technology also may be used for drug discovery and therapeutic applications to treat metabolic diseases such as cancer or diabetes. By providing critical information about cellular metabolic rates, the proposed technology will enable commercial investigators to identify slow pathways that limit production or wasteful pathways that divert energy and raw materials away from the product, thus allowing for quick and rational engineering to improve cells for biomanufacturing. It is anticipated that the expanded use of these metabolic analysis tools will have a widespread impact on the US economy through enabling faster product and process development in the biotechnology and pharmaceuticals industries. It also will enable the establishment of a more scalable and repeatable business strategy by productizing these analysis services. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop software tools and modular assays that will enable commercial investigators to fully integrate 13C flux analysis into their metabolic engineering toolbox. This technology provides direct readouts of metabolic pathway activities inside of living cells, which are otherwise impossible to directly measure. However, the majority of 13C flux studies to date have been performed in academic labs and have received limited attention in industrial settings. This is largely due to the lack of combined experimental and computational expertise to effectively perform 13C flux studies in industry. This research is innovative because it marks an important step in moving 13C flux analysis outside of the academic lab space and into the commercial space. The overall objective of this proposal will be accomplished by pursuing the following specific aims:  1) Develop flux analysis software consistent with current standards of commercial research software, and 2) develop standardized, high-throughput, modular flux assays for quantifying the metabolism of industrial cell factories. The key outcomes of this research will be significant, as it will produce an integrated platform capable of accelerating the experimental, analytical, and computational workflows necessary to expand the application of 13C flux analysis to industrial research.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Metabolic Flux Analysis (MFA) is a technology for analyzing how cells convert incoming compounds (food, etc.) into other products.  These metabolic pathways are critical for all aspects of life.  In biomanufacturing and biotechnology, understanding how these pathways function and more importantly how fast they function is vital to maximizing production of products we use everyday.  Products such as the enzymes in our laundry detergent to the complex pharmacuetical (biologics) etc. are produced in these living systems.  Having better tools to understand these mechanisms and better yet, visualizing how these products are produced will help us design more efficient cellular factories. As a result of this project, we've been able to create CoreMFA(TM) which gives us the tools to create and use MFA models with a number of companies and research institutions.  Using these models helps identify roadbloks or inefficiencies in production. Once the roadblock or ineffciency is indentified then we can determine how to remove the roadblock.  As with any complex manufacturing process, after one roadblock is removed, we will monitor the process to find the next roadblock to remove.   CoreMFA consits of wrapping the core technical software, INCA (licensed from Vanderbilt University by Metalytics), with software tools to facilitate import of informaiton to create the MFA model, visualize the model (Figure 2), and subsequently export and visualize the results (Figure 1).     Figure 1.  High level schematic of CoreMFA.       Figure 2.  Sample metabolic pathway model that includes glycolysis, TCA cycle, and various supporting metabolic pathways.  The objectives of this proposal were accomplished and/or exceeded.  We?ve successfully created and validated a server-based application, CoreMFATM, for calculating metabolic flux rates (Specific Aim 1) and in developing protocols for standardized applications of Metabolic Flux Analysis or MFA (Specific Aim 2).  Using CoreMFA, Metalytics is now generating revenue from several customers, some of which were identified and interviewed as part of our Bootcamp experience.  Metalytics will continue to enhance the aesthetics of the graphical output and develop customized result reports as we progress to further integrate MFA applications into biomanufacturing as part of our upcoming Phase 2 SBIR application.  We successfully completed all of the tasks of the phase 1 SBIR in addition to adding significantly more capability in creating models and visualizing results with graphical interfaces.  This results in modular flux assays that are much easier to develop in addition to streamlining the computational and experimental workflows for determining fluxes within key metabolic pathways of interest to our customers.  Metalytics has successfully engaged with customers ranging from small industrial microbiology companies to large pharma to enhance production of their biomanufactured products. For example, one project is designed to help identify potential points for genetic modification of a microorganism to enhance protein production while another is to identify changes in central carbon metabolism due to genetic modifications in a CHO (Chinese hamster ovary) cells used in production of a pharmaceutical product.   As a result of this project, we have just completed our Phase II SBIR application and are developing RealtimeMFA, a specific vertical market based application for realtime control and monitoring of biomanufacturing processes.
