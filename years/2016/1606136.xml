<AbstractNarration>1606136 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proficiency of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) in defining target areas for treatment makes it a powerful tool for pre-operation planning in surgical interventions. However MRI faces unique challenges when interventional devices are involved. Most devices are invisible or difficult to visualize with MRI. This project will develop a novel susceptibility mapping technology to achieve rapid contrast MRI of brachytherapy seeds for prostate cancer treatment. Longer term this technology will enable deep brain stimulation (DBS) in neurosurgery. These outcomes will be integrated in outreach and educational activities to stimulate interest in biomedical imaging among a diverse group of students. The project will promote biomedical imaging research among local high-school students and female students through an annual workshop and laboratory studies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A key insight is that it is possible to turn the magnetic susceptibility of the small interventional devices from being a nuisance into useful information. The PI uses the magnetic susceptibility inherent in each device for positive-contrast imaging which is a novel concept in interventional MRI. This project will a) develop a fast 3D pulse sequence for susceptibility mapping that is robust in regards to image distortion; b) integrate the fast sequence, compressive sensing and parallel imaging with a wearable pelvic diaper coil to accelerate data acquisition; and c) validate this technique on a 4.7 Tesla animal scanner and on a 3 Tesla whole-body scanner using a realistic tissue-mimicking pelvic phantom. The project will be built on the preliminary work of a team of multidisciplinary investigators with complementary expertise in MR physics, imaging systems, and medical research.</AbstractNarration>
