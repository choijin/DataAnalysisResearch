<AbstractNarration>This project involves the preparation of a documentary film about mathematician Yitang Zhang for national broadcast on public television via American Public Television syndication (APT) in May, June of 2017. Counting from Infinity: Yitang Zhang and the Twin Prime Conjecture premiered theatrically in January 2016. It tells the story of Yitang Zhang, who made an important breakthrough towards solving the Twin Prime Conjecture in 2013. In the film, the story of Zhang's quiet perseverance amidst adversity, and his preference for thinking and working in solitude, is interwoven with a history of the Twin Prime Conjecture as told by several mathematicians, many of whom have wrestled with this enormously challenging problem in Number Theory - Daniel Goldston, Kannan Soundararajan, Andrew Granville, Peter Sarnak, Enrico Bombieri, James Maynard, Nicholas Katz, David Eisenbud, Ken Ribet, and Terry Tao. The film was produced and directed by George Csicsery, and has proven highly effective at conveying mathematical ideas to the general public through the human stories of the mathematicians behind the ideas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Modification of the film in preparation for public television broadcast involves editing, adding required modules, closed captioning, and other technical work, as well as promotional efforts aimed at individual station programmers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[This project is a part of an overall effort by the Mathematical Sciences Research Institute (MSRI) to increase the public understanding and appreciation of the power, beauty, and fun of mathematics.   The goal was to prepare the 2016 documentary film by George Csicsery "Counting from Infinity: Yitang Zhang and the Twin Prime Conjecture" for public television broadcast by way of syndication through American Public Television (APT), and to promote the broadcasts to increase viewership.   The completed film and a 30-second trailer were delivered to APT, which launched it in early April 2017. A station relations representative promoted the film to individual programmers at the stations in the public broadcasting system.   The story of Counting from Infinity: Yitang Zhang and the Twin Prime Conjecture (2015) centers on a very exciting string of mathematical discoveries that occurred during 2013. It started when Yitang Zhang, a virtually unknown mathematician working as adjunct professor at the University of New Hampshire, submitted a paper to the Annals of Mathematics in April 2013. Small Gaps Between Primes was immediately recognized as an important breakthrough, and Yitang, or Tom, became an instant celebrity&mdash;a role he was very much unprepared for.   The film conveys information about an important breakthrough in mathematics in the framework of a dramatic story providing the general public and lay viewers in particular a chance to engage with an important mathematical achievement and the individuals who brought it about.   Public television broadcasts of this exciting story have substantially increased public awareness of not only this single problem in mathematics, but about how mathematical research is conducted, and about the culture of mathematicians.   Between April and October 2017, the film was broadcast 797 times over 230 channels covering 68.06% of the population of the United States.
