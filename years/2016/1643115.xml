<AbstractNarration>The commercial potential of this I-Corps project will be that it will further develop a sensor to detect lung cancer without a bioposy and to give more specific diagnostics for this cancer thus enabling targeted drug therapy.  This will decrease the cost for treating cancer, improving survival rates of lung cancer, and provide less invasive and more accurate diagnostics. The technology is a platform technology to enable low cost effective tests for all diseases that cause the body to release neoantigens, anti-bodies, or DNA mutations. The developed sensor is more sensitive than existing sensors and will be able to detect the type of cancer in the blood of patients that have cancer.  This will potentially allow doctors to prescribe targeted drug therapy and will be able to detect cancer earlier, target a patient's cancer without needing a biopsy, and potentially lead to a higher survival rate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project will explore the commercial potential of a nanowire biosensor platform that is more sensitive than existing sensors and will be able to detect a type of lung cancer in the blood of patients. The nanowire biosensor platform is able to measure DNA at high sensitivities because it uses nanowires that have a very high surface area and are sensitive to the atmosphere around them. The proposed platform technology utilizes arrays of vertically aligned nanowires.  Using this device design, sensors with over a million nanowires per sensor have been developed by the team. The biosensor has been used for prostate specific antigen (PSA) detection and have positive preliminary results. This new method of detection enables sensors with nanowire arrays versus a single nanowire, resulting in higher sensitivity devices.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ For this project, we did customer discovery to better understand the market and needs of the market for biosensors.  We quickly realized that we had to learn a lot..  During the discovery process, we had many unexpected findings including learning that potential users of our biosensor often didn?t need higher sensitivity, but were very excited about having a quantitative measurement and having access to the ability to do many tests at once.  We also learned that just focusing on cancer detection wasn?t specific enough.  We had to choose which type of cancer and at which part of the process we will market our sensors.  In other words, would we be targeting a point of care diagnostic for screening for cancer, a test for those that are at high risk, a test for those diagnosed with cancer but not yet treated, monitoring those patients being treated for cancer, or monitoring patients that have completed treatment to ensure that the cancer does not reoccur.  In the area of targeted treatment and in particular targeted treatment for lung cancer, we learned of a particular pain point that our product could help with.   No one wants cancer, but if someone has cancer and is diagnosed with a particular type of cancer for which there is targeted treatment available, their prognosis is quite good.  The problem comes when that cancer mutates and the new mutation is no longer responsive to the treatment.  Often, the doctors do not know a mutation has occurred until, after treatment, the patient?s health continues to degrade.  The patient then needs to undergo a second biopsy and secondary treatment.  Regular monitoring of the progress of the treatment is not typically done because monitoring requires expensive, invasive, and time-consuming tests.  A low-cost, less invasive, and quantitative test would enable doctors to monitor biomarkers in a patient to determine if the cancer is responding to the treatment and ensure no mutations have occurred.  If the cancer has mutated or if the tumor is not responding to treatment, the doctor can then dynamically alter the treatment plan.  Liquid biopsies hold promise for monitoring the treatment plan for cancer. Protein biomarkers and cancerous DNA has been shown to reflect the type of cancer and the size of the tumor. Thus, liquid biopsies could in theory monitor the effectiveness of treatment.  Unfortunately, the amount of circulating cancerous DNA is minimal and the detection, let alone the quantification, is difficult. Techniques that can test for low quantities of DNA in the blood are expensive and take too long to get results.  Today, the progress of targeted lung cancer treatment is not tracked.  If the cancer mutates during treatment, the patient will have to undergo a second round of treatment and possibly a second lung biopsy.  This adds health care costs and reduces patient success.  Our sensor could provide a low-cost technique to quantify the progress of targeted lung cancer treatment.  Since learning about this market need, we have partnered with several lung oncologists who are now advising us to make sure we develop a sensor that fills a market need.  Monitoring targeted treatment for lung cancer is one of the markets we are focused on for our product development.       Last Modified: 04/01/2018       Submitted by: Fatima Toor]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
