<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the provision of a scientifically-based, gender-specific, home-based, mobile health secondary prevention (SP) program for women with heart disease with greater access at a lower cost than current center-based SP programs. This application will overcome barriers to currently available center-based programs. The innovation will provide a solution to the healthcare triple aim of 1) improving quality of care; 2) improving population health; and 3) reducing per capita cost. The application is a timely business opportunity starting with a recurring software subscription model that will provide better service, at a lower cost to women with heart disease.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project will translate the core modules of center-based secondary prevention (SP) into a comprehensive, patient-centered, gender-specific mobile health program for cardiovascular risk reduction including emotional and physical assessment, training videos, symptom monitoring, coaching and communication with a healthcare provider, and outcome evaluation. The intellectual merit of this project is evident in that the mobile innovation will incorporate theory-based behavior change techniques known to drive changes in health behaviors, demonstrate the intended behavior, tailored to women with heart disease versus apparently healthy individuals, and will undergo evaluation in a randomized clinical trial. The application incorporates self-monitoring, user selection of priority goals, motivational strategies and will requires less patient and staff time.</AbstractNarration>

During customer interviews, healthcare executives reported that the government has proposed new models of Medicare payments as part of the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 (MACRA) by paying healthcare systems for the value and quality of care they provide. This will involve a new bundled payment model for cardiac care to improve treatment of cardiac disease. By structuring payments around the cardiac patient&rsquo;s care in and out of hospital, bundled payments are intended to support better care coordination and better patient health outcomes. Healthcare systems will be paid a fixed amount for each cardiac care episode from hospitalization to 90 days after, with those that deliver higher quality of care receiving a higher amount. Healthcare system executives revealed that they, not the health insurance companies, will now bear more risk of monetary losses due to rehospitalizations and they are determined to improve their infrastructures with innovations that keep patients healthy and out of the hospital. We discovered that the timing for mHealth innovations could not be better. Our product can provide secondary prevention to women who would otherwise receive nothing and who would burden hospitals and clinics because of the lack of behavior change interventions, which our technology can provide.
