<AbstractNarration>As our closest star, the Sun provides an important laboratory to study the processes that govern stars in our Galaxy.  The Sun is also the primary driver for the space weather that impacts human life on Earth.   The Sun emits electromagnetic radiation from radio to X-ray wavelengths.  This proposal will support both the science and operations of a dedicated solar facility the Expanded Owens Valley Solar Array (EOVSA) that will observe the Sun at radio wavelengths.  The EOVSA will provide a valuable resource to the solar physics community making important contributions to the science of the solar atmosphere, the 3-dimensional (3D) structure of solar active regions, and the drivers of space weather.  The proposal will also support the education and training of the next generation of solar scientists with the involvement of students on levels ranging from high school to graduate students to postdoctoral researchers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal will support the science and operations of the Expanded Owens Valley Solar Array (EOVSA) as a community facility.  EOVSA is a solar-dedicated radio interferometer array, located at Owens Valley Radio Observatory (OVRO), in Owens Valley, CA.  The science that will be accomplished with the facility includes:  (1) locating the acceleration site in solar flares, elucidating the acceleration mechanism(s) for high-energy electrons, and understanding the initiation and evolution of the electron energy distribution; (2) determining the magnetic field strength, direction, temperature, and density as a function of height in the solar atmosphere, including routine mapping of the coronal magnetic field up to several times per day, in order to understand the 3D structure of the solar atmosphere and the initiation mechanisms of solar activity; (3) obtaining daily full-disk images of the F10.7 brightness temperature and eruptive events in order to study the physical mechanisms of magnetically and radiatively dominated processes that impact the Earth and near-Earth space environment; (4) detecting, cataloging, and studying the spectral and temporal evolution of radio flares from flare stars and other nighttime transient sources.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project involved the completion of construction and commissioning of a major new ground-based radio facility dedicated to observing the Sun--the Expanded Owens Valley Solar Array, followed by routine operations of the instrument to obtain daily observations.  The instrument is the only one of its kind that images radio emission from the Sun in a wide range of frequency (1-18 GHz) at high frequency and time resolution.  As a result, it has obtained unique and powerful information about solar flares as well as active and quiet regions.  In particular, its data provide the only way to measure magnetic fields as they evolve on 1-s timescale in solar flares.  The magnetic fields on the Sun are the source of stored energy that can be suddenly released to power the most explosive events in the solar system, but exactly how and where that energy is released has been a mystery.  New results from the array, published in 2020, have been a breakthrough in our understanding of the process, especially by pinpointing the location as the "cusp-region" of flaring loops.  The project is the main focus for much of the educational and public outreach activities of the radio group within the Center for Solar-Terrestrial Research at New Jersey Insittute of Technology (NJIT).  As a result, it has been the focus of several Ph.D. theses as well as a hands-on experience in the education of at least 10 graduate students at NJIT and elsewhere.  Outcomes of the award include a database of daily observations of the Sun encompassing more than 1200 days from 2017-2020, which are provided to U.S. scientists, others world-wide, and the general public.  A pipeline processing system automatically generates multi-frequeny full-Sun images available at http://ovsa.njit.edu/browser. The results of our own studies with the data have been disseminated through high-ranking scientific journals and have been the subject of news stories. The analysis tools we have created for analyzing the data have also been disseminated widely in both publications and by code-sharing sites such as Github.
