<AbstractNarration>Benedict College will examine the impact of a Connected Learning Community Model on undergraduate student retention, academic success, and self-efficacy. The model, based on Bandura's Social Cognitive Theory, features student research experiences coupled with peer-to-peer and faculty mentoring and provides an engaging and supportive interactive learning environment to influence student outcomes.  The model incorporates several factors: the influence of peers with similar sociocultural backgrounds, the influence of an academic mentor in fostering effective study skills, the influence of acquiring a responsible work ethic, and the influence of a better understanding of the benefits of STEM education. The project is expected to positively impact the pathway of underrepresented minorities in the STEM workforce by producing an evidence-based intervention that could be adapted for similar institutions, including community colleges.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The researchers will implement a mixed-methods design to investigate whether a connected learning community impacts the academic performance, retention, and self-efficacy of underrepresented minority STEM students.  Multiple regression models will be used to explain the variation of academic success, retention, and self-efficacy with covariates such as age, socioeconomic status, gender, family education history, and marital status using the quantitative data. Qualitative data will be collected and analyzed for causative factors to support the quantitative effects observed during the study. Pre- and post-project interviews will be used to assess students' satisfaction with their academic experience, perceived benefit of membership in the learning community, interest in STEM careers, and commitment to persist in STEM. The study can potentially produce a novel paradigm for undergraduate STEM education targeting underrepresented students.    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is supported by the Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP) Broadening Participation Research in Education track. This program track supports ideas to create and study new models and innovations in STEM teaching and learning, investigate the underlying issues affecting the differential participation and success rates of students from underrepresented groups, and produce knowledge to inform STEM education practices and interventions.</AbstractNarration>

Based on our observations, we make the following conclusions:</p> <p>The GPAs of the Scientific Village (SV) cohort (Group A) were compared with those of their non-SV peers (Group B) to determine the effect of participation in the program. GPA comparisons of participants and corresponding STEM groups at the College are shown in Table 1 for spring 2017 to spring 2019 semesters and graduates. Two-sided t-tests after checking equality of variances with F-tests are presented. From the table, it can be seen that all of the p-values of equality of variances tests are greater than 5% significance level. Thus, based on the sample data, we fail to reject the null hypothesis that H<sub>o</sub>: &sigma;<sub>A</sub><sup>2</sup>= &sigma;<sub>B</sub><sup>2</sup>. Pooled t-tests are then used to test if H<sub>o</sub>: ?<sub>A</sub>=?<sub>B</sub>. From right-tailed p-values, we can reject the null hypothesis of equal means for spring 2017, fall 2017, fall 2018, and spring 2018 as one-sided values are half of the values reported in the table. For spring 2017, p-values are both 0.13 where there is some evidence that the mean GPAs of Scientific Village students are higher than the compared STEM groups. Note that SV GPAs are 0.40 and 0.38 higher than the compared group, for spring 2017 and 2019 semesters, respectively. The test result for the graduates fail to reject the null hypothesis with p-value of 0.53 (one sided 0.27 and GPA difference 0.14). Figure 1 shows the positive differences of GPAs for all semesters. SV students showed on average GPA between 16 to 26% improvement over the control group.</p> <p>Paired-t test results of CURE surveys from SV and all other students are shown in Table 2. From the table, p-values for post graduate plans and post-attitude about science results were fail to reject the null of same mean values. Other test results are all higher than the compared CURE surveys conducted in other programs nationally. Overall, our program?s survey results are at least met that of mean value of surveys conducted in other programs.</p> <p>Student outcomes were recorded for participants' college experience and post-college experience. College-level outcomes are shown in Table 3a. At the time of this report, 13 out of 25 students (52%) have graduated from Benedict with STEM degrees, none have graduated with a non-STEM degree, 2 (8%) have transferred, 4 (16%) are still pursuing their degrees, and 6 (24%) have dropped out of college.</p> <p>We made a vigorous attempt to record post-college outcomes for the 21 students who have not yet graduated. To the best of our knowledge, 1 student (5%) is enrolled in graduate school, 1 is applying to nursing school, 2 (10%) are employed in a professional STEM job, 1 is employed in a professional non-STEM job, 2 have joined the military, and 1 is currently seeking professional employment.
