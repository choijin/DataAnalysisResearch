<AbstractNarration>This award provides funding to help defray the travel expenses of participants in the conference "Quantum Symmetries: Subfactors and Planar Algebras Conference 2017" that will be held from July 17-21, 2017 in Maui, HI. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This conference will use planar algebras and the theory of subfactors to study quantum symmetry. The conference will be unique among recent subfactor conferences. Whereas many such conferences have dealt with relationship of subfactors with physics or conformal field theory, this conference will focus on the planar algebra descriptions of subfactor standard invariants. The conference will bring together leading experts for a concentrated look at this specific area. The award funds will be primarily directed to support graduate student and postdoc participation. This will provide an important opportunity for these junior researchers to learn of the state-of-the-art of the field, interact with leading researchers in the field, and develop contacts for future collaboration.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The conference was a huge opportunity for interaction between people in   several diverse but related areas including subfactors, tensor categories, topological quantum field theory, C^* algebras  and conformal field theory. Participants included two Fields medallists,several women and students who were given the chance to speak on their work with experts. Perhaps the most exciting new result mention was in the last talk by Andrew Shcopieray.   A quantum subgroup of a Lie group is a tensor category of bimodules over the hyperfinite type II or type III factor that is obtained by contracting somehow the representation theory of a closed subgroup of a compact Lie group in much the same way that the Wess-Zumino-Witten model contracts the representation theory of the compact group itself.  Ocneanu had announced a bound on the number of possible quantum subgroups for the unitary groups but that remained rather mysterious since he never published a proof of his result, nor were the bounds good enough to be effective in actual calclulation. Schopieray announced a result of joint work with Ostrik in which a general bound is obtained that works for all groups! It was still not effective but Terry Gannon was in the audience and they have since gone on to produce an effective bound so that the classification of ALL quantum subgroups is now in sight! This would represent an extraordinary completion of a project in conformal field theory begun by French physicist Jean-Bernard Zuber.
