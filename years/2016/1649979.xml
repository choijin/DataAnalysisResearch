<AbstractNarration>The research in mathematics discourse has examined important issues in the characterization of effective teaching ranging from teacher goal setting to supporting student thinking. Much of this research has focused on describing the elements of discourse that investigators have posited as contributing to teaching and learning. This research study systematically expands on the characteristics of mathematical discourse and examines and specifies relationships between these descriptive elements across multiple content foci in mathematics and across a range of teachers at the middle grade levels. The principal investigator is conducting a microgenetic study based on examination of video data from multiple routine classroom settings with teachers who demonstrate varying levels of discourse across three curricular topics in mathematics. A review of the research literature on classroom discourse, with a focus in mathematics, supports the development of an analytic framework to characterize the discourse of both teachers and students in the classrooms. The discourse patterns from teachers at grades 5, 6 and 7 provide a comparison of the discourse across upper elementary and middle grade classrooms. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The use of the analytic framework supports the development of metrics that can reliably measure critical aspects of mathematical discourse. These metrics examine both the function of the discourse in the classroom and the mathematical intellectual work that the discourse supports. The researcher builds on the analytic framework and resulting metrics to redesign courses offered to pre-service and practicing teachers in the university teacher education program. The resulting framework and redesigned teacher education courses will provide models on which other teacher education programs might build. The redesign of the pre-service and in-service courses effectively integrates the research into education.</AbstractNarration>

Videorecordings and transcripts were coded using analytic frameworks developed by the research team; specifically, we coded mathematics classroom discourse for responsiveness to students' mathematical thinking and authority relations. Analysis yielded the 7 following findings organized by broad category.  Analytic Frameworks   1. Two analytic frameworks were developed for this study. We developed a framework for mathematically responsive interactions [MRI Framework] that integrated student thinking, teacher responses, and student responses both in-the-moment and beyond-the-moment and which allowed us to document and describe qualitatively different types of responsiveness within and across lessons. We also developed a framework for authority relations in mathematics classrooms [AAA Framework] that accounts for three broad categories of mathematical activity: authorship of mathematical ideas, animation (public presentation of ideas) of mathematical ideas, and assessment of mathematical ideas.  Responsiveness to Students' Mathematical Thinking   2. We documented varied enactments of mathematically responsive interactions across participating classrooms. Lessons and classrooms were not uniform. Moreover, the more variation in mathematically responsive interactions (as indicated by different combinations of codes for students' mathematical contributions and teacher responses), the more responsive, overall, both individual lessons and classrooms tended to be.  3. We found positive associations between various components of responsiveness in our MRI framework. (For example, a positive relationship between teacher responses that engaged other students and the presence of beyond-the-moment responsivenss.) But these indicators were not entirely predictive of each other at the classroom level. In fact, depending on which component one selected, the same classroom could appear to be more or less responsive.  4. We view student-to-student and beyond-the-moment responsiveness as essential rarities in that we have observed them to have a profound impact on classroom discussions though they may appear infrequently in some lessons or classrooms. This finding speaks to the importance of developing classroom norms and expectations that support students to (a) spontaneously reference, engage with, and challenge their peers' mathematical thinking, and (b) make connections across ideas over time, encourage reflection on previous topics, and foster a coherent conception of mathematics.  5. We identified a set of key discursive indicators of responsiveness that can serve as productive targets for teachers who wish to increase the responsiveness of their interactions: increasing the proportion of interactions (a) that Engage Others, (b) in which students engage in Substantive Mathematical Reasoning, (c) contain Spontaneous Student-to-student Responsiveness, (d) contain Across-segments Teacher Responsiveness, (e) contain Across-lessons Teacher Resposniveness, (f) increasing the average number of compound codes per lesson, and (f) increasing the proportion of time in particular combinations of codes (i.e., what we term the 'Gray Box').   Mathematical Authority Relations   6. Authorship of mathematical ideas, oral communication of those ideas (Animation via  speaking), written symbolic inscriptions (Animation via scribing), and opportunities to assess mathematical ideas are key markers of authority in mathematics classrooms that differentiate authority relations in important ways.  7. Authority is shared with students less frequently for some mathematical activities (scribing and assessing) than others (speaking) and authorship. Supporting students to take on more authority for authorship alone is not sufficient.             Last Modified: 10/10/2020       Submitted by: Jessica Bishop]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
