<AbstractNarration>Kansas State University, Northeastern University, and the Missouri University of Science and Technology plan to form a new Industry University Cooperative Research Center (IUCRC), called Center for On-the-Move Energy Technologies (COMET).  The primary goal of COMET is to create a framework for engineers, scientists, and graduate students to find innovative solutions for the challenges that on-the-move industries face.  On-the-move energy systems include a broad range of applications from small portable electronic devices to air, sea, and ground transportation systems, which impact all aspects of modern life.  Despite their wide range of power ratings and diverse applications, on-the-move energy systems share a number of challenging design and technical requirements. The long-term impact of this center is to make on-the-move energy systems more efficient, more reliable, and more affordable.  Consequently, it promotes a safer and cleaner environment.  Also, it gives the U.S. a technological and economical competitive advantage in the global market.  The proposed research activities are strongly intertwined with comprehensive educational activities which will expose students at all levels to discovery-based and industry-focused skills.  &lt;br/&gt;On-the-move systems and devices typically operate off the grid with minimal (e.g. charging, etc.) interaction with the grid.  COMET's projects are designed to solve fundamental challenges and real-world engineering problems that will advance and create new technologies for the relevant industries.  COMET's main focus areas are (1) mobility and agility advancement, (2) fault-tolerance and reliability improvement, (3) prolonging operational time, and (4) power density enhancement.  To achieve these goals, six critical approaches are considered as (i) alternative materials, (ii) alternative energy harvesting, (iii) contactless charging, (iv) smart designs for harsh environment, (v) real-time condition monitoring, and (vi) real-time corrective actions. The proposed center advances the research and design methodologies for these energy systems while taking into consideration specific challenges of each application.  The team of researchers at Missouri S&amp;T has research experience in energy and power management for on-the-move systems.  Also, they have considerable expertise in increasing the power density of such systems while maintain their cost competitive.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The planning meeting of the Center for On-the-Move Energy Technologies (COMET) was held on February 22-23 of 2018 in Kansas City.  About 60 individuals attended the meeting including 24 industry representatives from 18 companies (Bell Helicopter, Ameren, Rogers, John Deere, Doe Run, Caterpillar, ICE/Ultra Electronics, two divisions of Black &amp; Veatch, CSS, Infineon, ANSYS, Solar Prime, Power Film, ERDC-CERL, Brewer Science, and two national labs: ORNL, and NREL), 14 faculty members, and 15 graduate students and postdocs.  In addition, two department heads, one associate dean of research, one associate vice president for research and three representatives from University Technology Transfer and Corporate and Foundation Relations offices were among the attendees.     Besides the general information provided to the audience about the NSF I/UCRC centers, as well as COMET’s focus areas, faculty members and research facilities, 9 sample research projects (multi-campus and multi-investigator) were presented to prospective industry members.  At the end of each presentation, prospective industry members were encouraged to fill out the LIFE-form.  Also, a 60-minute Industry Workshop was held where prospective industry members provided feedback about their research areas of interest as well as their future research trends.  The graduate students also presented 16 posters at the end of the first day.  The overall feedback of the prospective industry members on the mission and vision of COMET was very positive.  From the NSF session with the industry representatives, we were told that 4-5 companies expressed their commitments in joining COMET, and a majority of the industry members expressed that the main theme of the center is a timely issue and of their great interest. Later two prospective members, Brewer Science and Solar Prime did not find the center aligned with their interest and consequently dropped out.     Several topics, including high power density converters for powertrains, modular and universal converters, reduction of energy storage required in mobile systems, battery degradation modeling, autonomous control, and magnetic materials received strong positive support.  The leadership team of COMET has decided to expand on these projects and make them multi-phase and multi-campus projects.  Based on the feedback received, COMET does not intend to make major changes in its mission, vision, and identified thrust areas.  However, based on the LIFE-form and Industry Workshop feedback, some projects will be modified to address lifetime, cost, and reliability assessment in their deliverables.  Also, three new projects with focuses on the fast charging of electric heavy-duty vehicles, mobile microgrids, and wireless chargers will be defined, while the center will continue seeking feedback from the industry members to refine the research projects.
