<AbstractNarration>A request is made to fund additional and back-up instrumentation for the R/V Blue Heron, an 86 foot Coastal Vessel owned by the University of Minnesota and operated by the Large Lakes Observatory as part of the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS) research fleet. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Large Lakes Observatory operates the largest university-owned research vessel on the Great Lakes, the R/V Blue Heron. Built in 1985 for fishing on the Grand Banks, the Blue Heron was purchased by the University of Minnesota in 1997, sailed from Portland, Maine, up the St. Lawrence Seaway to Duluth, and converted into a Limnologic research vessel during the winter of 1997-98. She is outfitted with state-of-the-art research equipment, has berthing for 11 crew and scientists, and can operate 24 hours per day for up to 21 days in between port calls. The Blue Heron is part of the University National Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS), and is available for charter by research scientists on any of the Great Lakes. In 2015, the vessel completed 40 funded days where 6 (15%) were for NSF. In 2016, Blue Heron is currently scheduled for 61 days, 23 of these (38%) will be for NSF.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Shipboard Scientific Support Equipment requested in this proposal includes:&lt;br/&gt;   &lt;br/&gt;New Crane Installation $153,101&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts &lt;br/&gt;The principal impact of the present proposal is under Merit Review Criterion 2 of the Proposal Guidelines (NSF 13-589). It provides infrastructure support for scientists to use the vessel and its shared-use instrumentation in support of their NSF-funded oceanographic research projects (which individually undergo separate review by the relevant research program of NSF).  The acquisition,  maintenance and operation of shared-use instrumentation allows NSF-funded researchers from any US university or lab access to working, calibrated instruments for their research, reducing the cost of that research, and expanding the base of potential researchers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The University of Minnesota Duluth purchased a new deck crane for the research vessel Blue Heron using funds provided by the National Science Foundation award OCE#1623799 "University of Minnesota Duluth R/V Blue Heron SSSE 2016". Additional funds from this award were used to purchase two new life rafts for the vessel, purchase additional scientific flotation buoys for the extensive scientific mooring operations the vessel undertakes, and to modify the vessel’s acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP) sea chest to accommodate the vessel’s new 150kHz ADCP.  All of this equipment will improve operations on board the vessel.     The new deck crane replaced our original crane that had been on the vessel for twenty-one years and was a rebuilt crane when we purchased it in 1997.  The crane was the subject of multiple problems during our biannual inspections including the fact that it was slow, had some free play in the swing gearing and pedestal bearing, tended to creep from a hold position, and had limited overall reach.  Ultimately, the inspectors advised replacement.  Additionally, the inspectors advised us that our older life rafts did not have a large enough capacity and advised us to purchase life rafts with increased capacity.  Also, per our ADCP manufacturer’s advice we modified our ADCP sea chest before installing a new ADCP.     All of the equipment is available to all users of the R/V Blue Heron, including the three National Science Foundation funded projects that will use the vessel in 2020.  Besides the NSF funded projects, we are supporting several other science projects in 2020: two Great Lakes Observing System (NOAA) cruises, a State of Minnesota Department of Natural Resources cruise, and multiple research and educational cruises funded by the University of Minnesota.  Regarding the educational cruises, the University of Minnesota is funding cruises in 2020, which will give an opportunity for undergraduates to observe and participate in scientific research on the Great Lakes.
