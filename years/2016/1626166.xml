<AbstractNarration>An award is made to St. Lawrence University (SLU) to acquire a confocal microscopy system. Many modern cellular and molecular biology techniques use natural fluorescence, fluorescently tagged molecules, or fluorescent dyes to label specific cellular components. A confocal microscope is an instrument that uses lasers to produce high resolution images of cellular and subcellular components within living and fixed cells that have been labeled with one or more fluorescent molecules. In addition, 3D reconstructions of these fluorescent structures can be created using a series of images collected by the confocal microscope as it focuses down through a specimen. Consequently, this instrument has the resolving power to address many types of biological problems including identifying cell types, cellular localization of specific molecules, determining gene expression, and examining cell differentiation. The research faculty involved in this project require the enhanced flexibility of use and special capabilities (e.g., UV laser, spectral detector, and environmental chamber) of this confocal system to obtain quality images of their work for their contributions to their scientific fields, including publications, national and international meeting presentations, student training, and other applications. Thus, this award will broaden research, training, and teaching opportunities both at SLU and the Associated Colleges of the St. Lawrence Valley Consortium.  Acquisition of this instrument will expand the existing partnership between SLU and Clarkson University (CU), especially increasing summer fellowship projects for CSTEP and McNair Scholars; two programs that support students from populations underrepresented in STEM. In addition, the new microscope will fuel outreach activities for dozens of K-12 teachers, students, and community members in our economically disadvantaged, rural region of northern New York.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Nikon C2+ spectral imaging confocal microscope system with wide field camera and environmental chamber systems and specialized capabilities will support and expand current and future research, teaching, and undergraduate training activities of STEM faculty and students at the Associated Colleges of the St. Lawrence Valley (SLU, Clarkson, SUNY  Potsdam, and SUNY Canton), a higher education consortium in upstate New York. The new instrument will augment the research and scholarly contributions of research faculty and enhance teaching and training activities of eleven faculty and science professionals in cell and developmental biology and ecology and evolution, including the PI and Co-PIs' projects, which focus on the theme of subcellular trafficking and tissue localization of specific molecules during development. The acquisition of this confocal microscope will provide the flexibility important for all users to achieve successful imaging with their respective biological systems of study, while also being easy to use and having a relatively low cost infrastructure. In particular, this system will allow research faculty to explore the biological effects of cerium oxide nanoparticles; gene expression in cheilostome bryozoans; and the essential role of the evolutionarily conserved IME4 mRNA methyltransferase in metazoan development. High-resolution imaging is required to publish in high profile cell and molecular biology journals, and confocal microscopy is now the expected minimal standard for publishing microscopy-based research using fluorescence.  Specifically, this instrument will positively impact the relatively new field of cerium oxide nanoparticles, as the new system will enable Drs. Erlichman and Estevez to characterize how the chemistry of cerium oxide nanoparticles influences their cellular trafficking and whether cellular localization influences pro-oxidant vs antioxidant effects. Body axes are determined multiple times during the bryozoan life cycle (embryogenesis, metamorphosis, and asexual budding). Using the proposed instrument, Dr. Temkin will acquire data on Hox gene expression during two different patterns of asexual budding. These data will provide a foundation to examine Hox gene expression at other points in the bryozoan life cycle. Lastly, a fundamental question in developmental biology is how cell fates are determined. To answer this, Dr. Hongay will employ the new microscope to perform high resolution confocal analyses to determine how a highly evolutionarily conserved RNA-modifying enzyme dictates cell fates and cell differentiation in Drosophila spermatogenesis.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The acquisition and installation of the Nikon C2+ spectral imaging confocal microscope through NSF-MRI has strengthened the research and educational infrastructure of St. Lawrence dramatically by providing access to fundamental research-grade scientific equipment; strengthening existing research programs; expanding resources for individual and collaborative research; and facilitating new avenues of research.  In addition, each of our science faculty incorporate their research directly into their teaching, so the confocal microscope significantly enhanced the quality and scope of research and professional development we provide to students at our undergraduate liberal arts university.   Curricular Development Associated with the Instrument  The instrument is central to two courses dedicated to the training and use of the confocal microscope. This attracts students from a variety of majors including geology, biology and neuroscience.  The number of students annually involved in coursework related to the microscopy instrumentation was approximately 40 per year. This number excludes the number of students utilizing this instrumentation for research or lab purposes. Given the intensive nature of the training and the time required for imaging, the instrument runs virtually non-stop during the academic year  Research Projects Utilizing the Instrumentation  Neuroscience faculty and students have used the new instrumentation to characterize the extent to which nanoparticles accumulate in tumorigenic cells and normal healthy cells. In addition to cellular trafficking, the influence of cellular deposition of nanomaterials and its effects on pro-oxidant vs antioxidant effects were studied in multiple in vitro test beds.  Faculty and students from the Associated Colleges Consortium used confocal analyses to determine how a evolutionarily conserved RNA-modifying enzyme dictates cell fates and cell differentiation during spermatogenesis in the model organism Drosophila melanogaster.  Biology faculty and students studied how body axes are determined during the bryozoan life cycle and how Hox gene expression differs in species with two different patterns of asexual budding.   A faculty member from Modern Languages has used this microscope to study the interface of ethnobotany and religious practice. From the biological perspective, this is the first documentation of autofluorescent tripertinoids in botanical specimens that are important elements to shamanic practice. From the cultural perspective, the microscopic findings verify and support the importance of these plants and how they differ from other botanical specimens that hold no shamanic importance to the South American peoples.  Intellectual Merit  St. Lawrence University faculty are committed equally to undergraduate teaching and maintaining active research programs.  Acquisition of the Nikon C2+ spectral imaging confocal microscope was critical for helping the project PI, CoPIs, and Faculty Associates maintain that delicate balance between excellence in teaching/mentoring and advancing knowledge in their respective disciplines.  Over the past decade, St. Lawrence has introduced major curricular changes, accompanied by a large-scale science facilities improvement initiatives and strategic equipment acquisitions, to ensure that we provide our students with the knowledge and training they need to pursue scientific careers in this era of globalization, collaboration, and intense technological innovation.  Thus, the intellectual merit represented in this NSF-MRI funding was central to the individual research programs of our project faculty and their dedicated efforts to strengthen and sustain a research rich undergraduate curricula &ndash; work that hinges on having modern and advanced laboratory equipment and instrumentation available to our campus community.   Broader Impacts  Against the backdrop of the weakening U.S. science and mathematics pipeline, it is critical that St. Lawrence continues and strengthens what is already working: as a liberal arts college, we graduate a disproportionately higher number of STEM majors who go on to advanced study and STEM careers.  Our science division graduates considerable numbers of women and minorities who are underrepresented in the sciences.  Garnering support from the NSF-MRI initiative has played a direct role in the fundamental mission of our college, where small class sizes, low student-faculty ratios, one-on-one mentoring opportunities, and hands-on research experiences enrich the science education we offer and produce positive outcomes with diverse student backgrounds.   The funding for this microscope continues to expand our opportunities for research, teaching, and undergraduate training activities of STEM faculty and students at the Associated Colleges of the St. Lawrence Valley (SLU, Clarkson, SUNY Potsdam, and SUNY Canton), a higher education consortium in upstate New York. To date, this new instrument has supported the research, teaching, and training activities of eleven faculty and science professionals.  As demonstrated through their research programs, SLU science faculty contribute to new knowledge in critical scientific areas.  As teachers, they also play a strategic role in addressing the shortage of highly qualified science and mathematics students in our nation by providing intensive research training and inquiry-based, experiential science education.  NSF-MRI funding has enabled our faculty to produce scholarship that has been shared broadly through articles in peer-reviewed journals and presentations at conferences and national and regional meetings and, as an integral part of the process, to actively include our undergraduates as research collaborators, co-authors, and co-presenters.
