<AbstractNarration>This award provides funding for two years for the Midwest Dynamical Systems Conference. The 2016 version of this conference will be held at Indiana University/Purdue University-Indianapolis   from October 21-23, 2016. The site and date of the 2017 conference has not been made; it will be decided upon by the conference's Scientific Advisory board in 2016.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference focuses on recent developments in Analysis, especially in the subfield of dynamical systems.  A number of important topics will be covered, including  but not restricted to parabolic dynamics, symbolic dynamics, rigidity phenomena and the like.  A number of distinguished mathematicians have agreed to attend and speak at this conference. The award gives early career researchers, researchers who are members of underrepresented groups, researchers not funded by NSF a chance to attend and participate in this conference.  The organizing committee will strive to make this funding opportunity known to target groups through a number of different activities.  More information will be made available at:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;http://sites.math.northwestern.edu/mwds/</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This grant provided financial support for four mathematical conferences from the long-running and influential Midwest Dynamical Systems conference series. Dynamical Systems is one of the most active areas of mathematical research and has interactions with almost every other area of mathematics, as well as with physics, biology, chemistry, astronomy, meteorology, medicine, and other sciences.   Each meeting was held at a different location: Indiana UniversityPurdue University Indianapolis in 2016, Northwestern University in 2017, University of Minnesota in 2018, and Ohio State University in 2019.  By hosting the Midwest Dynamical Systems conferences at many different universities this grant brought the conferences close to a wide audience, including students and early career researchers who may otherwise not be able to attend.   Each of the conferences brought together researchers from all areas of dynamical systems and emphasized the importance of interactions between these areas and with other areas of mathematics and science.  Moreover they provided opportunities for PhD students and recent PhD's to present their work, both by giving hour long talks and by presenting at poster sessions.  This provided a mechanism for attracting students to the field, thus helping to ensure its vibrancy in the future.  Participation of women and minorities was encouraged in each of the conferences.  Between all four conferences, there were approximately 260 participants, with approximately 60% of them early-career mathematicians (graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and untenured professors).  Each conference had participants from 20-30 different universities.             Last Modified: 11/24/2019       Submitted by: Roland K Roeder]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
