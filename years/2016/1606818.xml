<AbstractNarration>The Directorate of Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences offers postdoctoral research fellowships to provide opportunities for recent doctoral graduates to obtain additional training, to gain research experience under the sponsorship of established scientists, and to broaden their scientific horizons beyond their undergraduate and graduate training. Postdoctoral fellowships are further designed to assist new scientists to direct their research efforts across traditional disciplinary lines and to avail themselves of unique research resources, sites, and facilities, including at foreign locations. This postdoctoral fellowship award supports the training and research of a young scholar who studies the effects of racial identity in African American adolescents and college students. These populations are often academically and psychologically vulnerable when they experience racial discrimination in their daily contexts. This project explore the ways in which they cope successfully with negative race-related experiences and remain resilient academically and psychologically. The Fellow is affiliated with the Center for the Study of Black Youth in Context (CSBYC) where she has the opportunity to mentor high school and college students of color who are affiliated with the CSBYC and developing skills for careers in STEM fields. Specifically, she serves as a mentor to African American high school students who work on independent projects as part of the center's Undergraduate Research Opportunity Program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project contributes to the theory and research seeking to understand African American adolescents' and college students' racial discrimination experiences and the ways their racial identity beliefs interact with discrimination experiences to influence academic engagement and psychological health. This work contributes to the larger research literature in several ways. For instance, it will examine whether there are negative race-related experiences that African American college students experience that are not captured in traditional quantitative measures used to assess racial discrimination. This work examines the ways college students perceive their racial identity beliefs as influencing their academic engagement and motivation and psychological well-being after they have experienced racial discrimination. Additionally, the incorporation of information from data collected using a daily diary method can add complexity in the ways in which relations between discrimination, racial identity, and outcomes have traditionally been studied among African American adolescents. This project has potentially very high broader impacts for society in general and STEM education is particular.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The funding provided by the National Science Foundation (NSF) Social, Behavioral, and Economic Sciences (SBE) Postdoctoral Research Fellowship provided Dr. Bridget Richardson with the opportunity to expand on her training and research after graduate school. Dr. Richardson collaborated with senior-level faculty mentors at the University of Michigan where she gained training in conducting qualitative and quantitative research. Dr. Richardson's research sought to fulfill NSF's mission of intellectual merit by contributing understandings to research and theory on African American students' race-related experiences and resilience within students' immediate academic and social contexts. Furthermore, the research incorporated novel methodological and statistical techniques to examine the research questions. Studies aimed to expand current understanding of the ways African American students' racial identity beliefs and other external racial resources aided in their navigation of challenging racial experiences. Additionally, the messages parents gave to youth about their race was examined as a daily promotive and protective factor that influenced students'&nbsp; psychological emotions. This project fulfilled NSF's mission of influencing broader impacts through its contributions to knowledge of ways African American college students and adolescents remain academically and psychologically resilient in educational contexts. The postdoctoral fellowship also allowed Dr. Richardson to mentor and advise undergraduate and graduate students of color in research. Finally, it provided Dr. Richardson the opportunity to advance her career in science and research through the additional research training, mentorship, and publications she received. This contributed to her obtaining an Assistant Professor position which helps to fulfill NSF's mission of increasing the number of women of color in the professoriate in the United States.</p> <p>One study of the research project examined 30 (9 men, 21 women) Black college students' race-related experiences while attending predominately White public institutions. Secondary data analysis was conducted using verbatim transcripts from a larger study on educational pathways of Black college students. The funded study integrated a content and thematic analytic approach to explore two research questions: 1) What racial challenges do Black college students describe encountering? and 2) In what ways do Black college students draw on race and ethnicity to benefit them academically, psychologically, or socially? A coding team determined that 45 content codes answered the research questions and were applied based on students' narratives.</p> <p>Results showed that the content codes were applied 1,285 times across the 30 interview transcripts. From this data, three prominent themes represented racial challenges: 1) Interpersonal microaggressions, 2) Race and gender microaggressions, and 3) Institutional contextual perceptions. These themes showed the range of race-related challenges students described experiencing personally and those they perceived to impact them through their institution of higher education. Three prominent themes represented racial-related resilience factors: 1) Resist and defy, 2) African American sources of support, and 3) Valuing diversity in learning. These themes described the ways students drew on race and ethnicity to benefit them academically, psychologically, or socially and remain resilient despite race-related challenges.</p> <p>A second study employed a daily diary approach and examined 67 adolescents' reports of their daily racial experiences for 21 days. There was variation in the types of racial discrimination events adolescents reported and the discrimination event types were consistent with previous research within daily racial hassles, racial microaggressions, and racial discrimination literatures. For instance, "being treated unfairly because you are Black" and "being called a racist name by someone of a different race" were among the most frequently reported types of racial discrimination reported by youth in this study. The study also found that daily racial discrimination was significantly related to daily psychological negative affect (i.e., negative emotions experienced during the same day), such that on days in which adolescents reported experiencing racial discrimination, they also reported more negative emotions on the same day.
