<AbstractNarration>A goal of the Tribal Colleges and Universities Program (TCUP) is to increase the science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) instructional and research capacities of specific institutions of higher education that serve the Nation's indigenous students. Expanding the research capacity at these institutions expands the opportunities for students to pursue challenging, rewarding careers in STEM fields, provides for research studies in areas that may be locally relevant, and encourages a faculty community to look beyond the traditional classroom for intellectual and professional growth. This project aligns directly with that goal, and moreover will increase the body of knowledge on the efficacy of novel devices that may improve the detection of seizure onset.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dine' College will analyze datasets in order to validate a novel tripolar Laplacian electroencephalogram (tEEG) based seizure onset detection methodology using automatically detected high-frequency oscillations (HFOs) with better sensitivity (correct detection rate), selectivity (false positive detections per hour), and detection delay compared to the recent results of others obtained on large scalp encephalogram (EEG) datasets will constitute a positive output. This project will contribute to advancing quality postsecondary student learning and development through the inter-disciplinary Mathematics for Engineering Applications (MEA) research laboratory to be established at Diné College led by the PI of and funded by this proposal. Four undergraduate research assistant positions will be created in the MEA lab providing Diné College students with valuable cutting edge research experience. Moreover, talks and presentations by the MEA lab members and invited speakers collaborating with the lab will help further involve students into mathematics and engineering disciplines.</AbstractNarration>

Toward this goal feasibility of automatic detection of high-frequency oscillations with accuracy up to 100% has been demonstrated in human Laplacian electroencephalogram via tripolar concentric ring electrodes using exponentially embedded family. This result combines successful application of a cutting edge detector (hypothesis testing with integration of multiple electrodes using an exponentially embedded family) to a novel biomarker of epileptogenicity and epileptogenesis (high-frequency oscillations) that is very difficult to detect in conventional electroencephalogram signal via disc electrodes but can be detected in Laplacian electroencephalogram signal via noninvasive concentric ring electrodes.
