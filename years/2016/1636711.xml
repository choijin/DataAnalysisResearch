<AbstractNarration>This project is a follow up to a previous project "Climate Change&lt;br/&gt;Adaption in High Latitude Rural Development Planning."  The funding will enable the researcher to use&lt;br/&gt;the successful methodology developed during the 2011 research season to. The original&lt;br/&gt;project funded the survey of over 80 municipalities in Sweden, Finland, and Norway&lt;br/&gt;using a mixed method of face to face interviews and web-based survey. However, the&lt;br/&gt;web-based survey response was much lower than anticipated and the face to face&lt;br/&gt;survey interviews were more productive than anticipated. This award will allow the PI to&lt;br/&gt;increase the response rate and the data gathered by completing an additional 40&lt;br/&gt;interviews face-to-face from the originally planned web-based survey.</AbstractNarration>
