<AbstractNarration>Formal methods have made significant advances during the last decade, and now form the backbone of formal assurance across hardware and software industries. Underlying many of these techniques is the capability to effectively reason about system properties, often by describing the properties as constraint satisfaction problems and delegating the reasoning to a constraint solver. Due to their practical effectiveness and robust scalability, the most common constraint reasoning engines in use today are satisfiability (modulo theories) solvers (SAT and SMT). This award will provide travel grants for US-based students to attend the SAT/SMT summer school to be held in Lisbon, Portugal, June 22-25 2016, preceding the 8th International Joint Conference on Automated Reasoning (IJCAR 2016).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The SAT/SMT Summer School allows students to learn about the techniques underlying modern SAT and SMT solvers, and gives them a broad view of the field with many practical applications. Since the school is a separate event, in a less formal setting, the students have the opportunity to discuss the school topics (with lab assignments), discuss their own research ideas, and interact closely both with their peers and the leaders in the field. The summer school ignites the transfer and dissemination of knowledge that will lead to superior technology, better users, and exciting and far-reaching applications.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[Attending a conference or a summer school can be a transformative experience for a young researcher.  It exposes them to cutting-edge research and can help them make connections to other students and senior researchers in the area. Hence, encouraging attendance at conferences and summer schools is critical for promoting the development of students and post docs, especially those that need to find jobs and enter the work force soon after the conference.   This award was originally designed for the SAT/SMT/AR Summer School that took place on June 22-25, 2016 in Lisbon, Portugal, in the week before the IJCAR conference in Coimbra (27 June - 2 July), which in turn is followed by the SAT conference in Bordeaux (July 5 - 8).   Satisfiability (SAT), Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT), and Automated Reasoning (AR) continue to make rapid advances and find novel uses in a wide variety of applications, both in computer science and beyond.  The SAT/SMT/AR Summer School aims to bring a select group of students up to speed quickly in this exciting research area. The school is the first SAT/SMT/AR Summer School, but continues the successful line of SAT/SMT Summer Schools, which have taken place annually since 2011.   This grant sponsored seven students from US universities to attend the summer school, including also some undergraduate students. Due to the generous award amount and a relatively low number of applicants, we accepted all legitimate applications.   Having a significant amount of money left on the grant, we also supported student travel to the VMCAI 2018 conference. VMCAI provides a forum for researchers from the communities of Verification, Model Checking, and Abstract Interpretation, facilitating interaction, cross-fertilization, and advancement of hybrid methods that combine these and related areas. VMCAI 2018 was be the 19th edition in the series. VMCAI 2018 took place January 7 - 9, 2018 in Los Angeles, CA, USA.  Together with Isil Dilig, the conference organizer, again we accepted all the legitimate US students who applied for the VMCAI travel grant. This was all together five students. The reason for a relatively low number of applicants was that, in addition to this grant, there were various other industry sponsors providing a financial support for the students attending the POPL conference.   Still having a significant amount of money left on the grant, we also sponsored two female students attending the FMCAD 2019. FMCAD 2019 was the nineteenth in a series of conferences on the theory and applications of formal methods in hardware and system verification. FMCAD provides a leading forum to researchers in academia and industry for presenting and discussing groundbreaking methods, technologies, theoretical results, and tools for reasoning formally about computing systems. FMCAD covers formal aspects of computer-aided system design including verification, specification, synthesis, and testing. FMCAD 2019 was held Oct 22 - 25, 2019, in San Jose, California, USA.  In collaboration with Clark Barrett, the conference organizer, we selected two female students and they were fully reimbursed from this grant.   Moreover, we used this grant to support a travel to POPL 2017 of a Yale undergraduate student. POPL 2017 was held in Paris, France. The student had a poster accepted at the POPL Undergraduate Student Research Competition, but since he was only an undergraduate at that time, he did not receive any funding to attend the conference, so we used this grant. This was very beneficial for the student who is now enrolled into graduate studies in computer science and is a PhD student at UPenn.   Finally, having only a small portion of money left, we used this award to complete the reimbursements for some other conference. For example, for CAV 2019, held in New York. The students received the lump sum for other sources, but their travel cost were higher, so we used this grant to fully reimburse them. Note that these were relatively small amounts, usually only a couple of hundreds of dollars.   After each conference or summer school, we asked students to submit a small report on how this grant help them. All their comments are given in the final report, submitted to NSF. In general, we can see that all of the students said that this grant was significantly beneficial for their development as a researcher.   This award was always publicly advertised on the respective conferences and summer school's web sites. In addition, we put a call for participation to various mailing lists. Moreover, to increase visibility we contacted leading researchers in the field and informed them about this travel award, asking them to advertise it further.   All the costs were reimbursed through Yale's Faculty Research Management services (FRMS), and in accordance with NSF cost reimbursement policies.
