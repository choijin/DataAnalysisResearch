<AbstractNarration>Most animals survive in turbulent air or water environments and are living proof that it is possible to quantify odor signals in complex turbulent flow conditions to track and find sources of odors (such as food, mates, etc.). However, our engineering knowledge is still incapable of formulating simple and effective measurements that will enable man-made systems to predict, navigate and utilize properties of this turbulent flow to locate sources of chemical release. This project builds on recent exciting computational modeling of the neurobiology of organisms by the proposers, which predict that lobsters are capable of estimating not only the concentration of odors but also the time since the last odor was encountered. Lobsters accomplish this by using ensemble competition across a population of olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs), called "bursting ORNs". Bursting ORNs function to compute the time since last encounter of an odor that, along with concentration, can provide a measure of the distance to the odor source. This research will seek to increase understanding of how ORNs perceive odor concentration and intermittency measured within an odor plume, and how this information is integrated within the lobster?s brain. An additional goal is to develop new neurobiology-based theories in the search for odor sources that can be implemented within human-engineered autonomous underwater vehicles that have the ability to navigate in turbulent chemical plumes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader implications of this work stem from the large potential market for defense and civilian applications of a new generation of electronic noses for tracking chemicals in natural or man-initiated disasters. Through this project, there are also excellent resources and outreach opportunities for integrated education and training of students at the intersection of fluid dynamics, neuroscience, computer engineering and information processing. Outreach will be coordinated through the Center of Innovative Brain Machine Interfaces at the University of Florida and will provide opportunities for undergraduate and graduate research, promote neurotechnology innovations, and foster entrepreneurship activities in order to create potential future start-up companies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will include laboratory experiments of chemical plume mixing and ORN responses to odor encounters by lobsters, theoretical analysis of search optimization, as well as numerical simulations and novel system architecture for electronic noses. This research brings together a multidisciplinary and complementary team of experts, including a fluid dynamicist, a neurobiologist, and an electrical engineer with the very clear goal of understanding and exploiting olfactory scene analysis in turbulent flow. In this new light, neurobiologists will understand new sensing strategies for olfaction, and engineers can improve the quantification of turbulent mixing and replicate these sensory strategies to propose novel bio-inspired sensors capable of quantifying the dispersion of chemical plumes and improve the search for the source.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Background: Most animals survive in environments characterized by turbulent flow.  As a result, they are living proof that it is possible to quantify chemical signals (odors) in complex turbulent flow environments in order to track and find sources of odors such as food and mates.  However, our neurobiology and engineering knowledge is still incapable of formulating simple and effective measurements that will enable man-made systems to do this, i.e., to predict, navigate, and utilize properties of turbulent flow to locate sources of odors.       Summary: The project addressed this problem by building on exciting neural computational modeling evidence that predicted that the olfactory system of animals has the potential to estimate the time since the last odor encounter by ensemble competition across a novel population of rhythmically active or ?bursting? olfactory receptor neurons (bORNs).  The primary goal was to better understand how such bORN-derived input is analyzed at the first olfactory relay in the brain, and then in collaboration with a multidisciplinary team of experts, seek a better understanding of turbulent plume dynamics to develop a new neurobiology-based theory as to how to search for odor sources.

All three findings collectively attest to the potential importance of this information channel to odor navigation in animals.     Integrative value:  The project was part of a multidisciplinary effort involving the collaboration of a complementary team of three experts, including a fluid dynamics engineer, a neurobiologist, and an electrical engineer.     Transformative potential:  The idea being explored was that time is important for the disambiguation of the chemical space, i.e., that animals are able to ?smell time?. This hypothesis has transformative potential because chemical sensing in biology and engineering has followed mostly a static approach.  Understand this new sensing strategy for olfaction will allow engineers to replicate this sensory strategy to propose novel bio-inspired sensors capable of quantifying the dispersal characteristics of chemical plumes and improve the ability to search for the source of such plumes.  In terms of its value to basic science, the idea being explored provides a novel conceptual substrate for understanding olfactory scene analysis informed by neurobiology, which is still in its infancy compared with the much better understanding of visual and auditory scene analysis.     Broader impact: This research addresses the needs of a large potential market for defense and civilian applications of a new generation of electronic noses that are capable of not only identifying but also tracking chemical signals in natural or man-initiated disasters.
