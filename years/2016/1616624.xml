<AbstractNarration>The MEarth Observatories are made up of two robotic telescope arrays that are designed to find Earth-like planets around smaller stars. Each array has 8 identical telescopes that are 40 cm wide and equipped with cameras. MEarth-North is located at Mt. Hopkins, Arizona, and MEarth-South is located at the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory, Chile. This project consists of a 3-year survey using the MEarth arrays that will discover small exoplanets. The investigators expect to discover 6 planets with sizes close to the Earth's size and temperatures ranging from 300-600K. The investigators anticipate finding at least one of these planets located at a distance from its star where life similar to the Earth's life could survive. A second science goal of MEarth is to aid the study of stellar astrophysics with the large amount of data the project will collect. This project serves the national interest by promoting our discovery and knowledge of planets beyond our Solar System that could harbor life. Undergraduate and graduate students, and post-doctorate scientists, will be part of the MEarth science project. The principal investigator also works with Harvard's Future Faculty Leaders program and the Banneker Institute.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project aims to improve our understanding of small exoplanets by identifying the optimal transiting examples of these exoplanets through a 3-year, all-sky survey of the closest low-mass stars using the dedicated MEarth Observatories. The MEarth Observatories consists of two robotic telescope arrays, each array having 8 40-cm charge-coupled device detector-equipped telescopes. MEarth-North is located at Mt. Hopkins, Arizona, and MEarth-South is located at the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory, Chile. Owing to the planets' proximities to their host stars, and their small sizes, the investigators will be able to obtain precise limits on the densities of these exoplanets. They will also study the exoplanets' atmospheres through spectroscopy of the starlight that the atmospheres transmit. Six planets are predicted to be discovered during this 3-year survey, with radii between 1.0-2.5x Earth's radius and temperatures from 300-600K, with the expectation of at least one planet in the habitable zone. The secondary science goal of MEarth is to advance the study of stellar astrophysics. Undergraduate and graduate students, and post-doctorate scientists, will participate in the MEarth science project. The principal investigator also participates in Harvard's Future Faculty Leaders program and the Banneker Institute.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The MEarth Project uses two arrays of eight telescopes each, one located in southern Arizona, and the other in Chile, to survey the closest and smallest stars in search of orbiting planets. MEarth identifies these worlds through the small eclipses, known to astronomers as transits, that they make as they pass in front of their parent stars. Using MEarth, student astronomers have discovered several planets that are terrestrial, meaning they are made of rock and iron similar to the rocky planets of the Solar system. These worlds span a wide range of temperatures, but one in particular, LHS1140b, has a temperature similar to the Earth and falls within the so-called habitable zone, which means it could support liquid water on its surface. These worlds are prime targets for follow-up studies with large ground-based telescopes, as well as future projects such as the NASA James Webb Space Telescope. These facilities may be able to determine if these planets have atmospheres, and if the compositions of these atmospheres are similar to that of the Earth. In addition to discovering planets, the MEarth Project has discovered a number of eclipsing binary stars: two stars that orbit each other, allowing precise determinations of the masses and radii of each. MEarth has also determined the rate at which these stars emit very energetic flares, as well as the time it takes for many of its target stars to spin on their axes: While the younger stars spin very quickly, completing one spin in less than a day, the oldest stars spin very slowly, spinning only once every 130 days, many times more slowly than that of the Sun. Through its novel instrumentation and data analysis methods, MEarth provides professional training opportunities for numerous students and junior scientists. All of the data gathered by MEarth are released annually to the public, so that everyone can join the search for planets orbiting other stars.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 05/25/2020<br>      Modified by: David&nbsp;Charbonneau</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1616624/1616624_10437955_1590446404686_MEarth-at-night--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1616624/1616624_10437955_1590446404686_MEarth-at-night--rgov-800width.jpg" title="The MEarth Observatory Observing the Night Sky"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1616624/1616624_10437955_1590446404686_MEarth-at-night--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="The MEarth Observatory Observing the Night Sky"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Each night, the MEarth Observatory uses it arrays of telescopes to survey the closest and smallest stars for orbiting planets.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Jonathan M.
