<AbstractNarration>This EArly-concept Grant for Exploratory Research (EAGER) project will help develop the underlying scientific and engineering foundation necessary to spawn the new technologies and systems necessary to make cities and communities more sustainable.  Three to four blocks in downtown Palo Alto, California, will be instrumented to form a living lab for the collection of high-resolution data on building, energy and transportation infrastructure systems and the underlying human systems of the community. By engaging the City of Palo Alto in a close partnership, this project will have broad impacts in both the academic and civic communities. Results will be readily accessible and disseminated to Palo Alto municipal officials to empower municipal officials to make data-informed design, management and policy decisions.  This work will include making study data and findings available to public as part of Palo Alto's Open Data Initiative thereby helping to promote a more engaged population and overall citizen well-being.  This project will also help train an advanced scientific workforce capable of designing and managing our future cities and communities through pedagogical integration of the "living lab" into MS and PhD course offerings at Stanford University and a Massive Online Open Course (MOOC) initiative.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project addresses the enormous pressure rapid urbanization is exerting on the myriad of complex and interdependent urban systems (e.g., energy, transportation, environmental, buildings).  Changes in one system can have substantial impacts on others making it difficult to discern and predict the effects of urban design, management and policy decisions. This work aims to develop and employ a radically new data-driven micro-experimentation framework to characterize and quantify the coupled interactions and dynamics between urban infrastructure and human systems. Three to four blocks in downtown Palo Alto, California, will be outfitted with sensors to form a living lab for the collection of high-resolution data on building, energy and transportation infrastructure systems and the underlying human systems of the community.  A multi-dimensional network model will be developed to simultaneously analyze multiple incoming urban data streams. Utilizing the results of the network data analysis, empirical micro-experiments will be conducted in this living lab to understand how changes in one urban system impact other systems. Ultimately, this project will contribute a novel micro-experimental framework for studying the coupled dynamics of urban systems that represents a radical shift away from viewing urban systems as purely technical, and integrates concepts from social policy to study urban systems from a socio-technical perspective.</AbstractNarration>

Specifically, we explored the interdependencies between buildings, energy and transportation systems through our partnerships with the City of Palo Alto and Silicon Valley Clean Energy. As a result, this project yielded several novel computational frameworks to model, characterize and provide insights to inform policy-making to manage such interdependencies:  1.     Urban Data Integration (UDI) framework - framework to integrate multiple heterogeneous urban data streams through proximity relationship learning; enables computationally efficient querying and exploration of urban data spanning multiple systems (e.g., buildings, energy green space, transport).  2.     Data-driven Urban Energy Simulation (DUE-S) framework - framework for integrating engineering simulation and machine learning methods in a multi-scale urban energy modeling workflow; enables urban scale modeling of building energy dynamics that is a precursor to analyzing interdependencies with other systems.  3.     Context-aware Urban Energy Analytics (CUE-A) framework - framework to empirically extract and quantify the relationships between building energy use and the spatial proximity of multiple surrounding urban systems; enables analysis of interactions between energy, building and transport systems to inform energy-aware urban design and land-use planning.  4.     SynCity: framework for creating synthetic city of hourly building energy estimates - a critical challenge in the analysis of interdependent urban systems is the availability of high-fidelity data streams, this framework overcomes this challenge by combining open data sets with physics-based simulation models to produce synthetic hourly load curve estimates for every building within a city; enables synergistic planning of interdependent urban systems (e.g., distributed energy resources, building consumption, electric vehicles)  Each of these computational frameworks and the underlying open datasets have been made available through our lab?s website and/or Github repository (https://www.uil.stanford.edu/data-code) in order to catalyze further research in the area of data-driven urban systems.
