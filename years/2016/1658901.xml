<AbstractNarration>The "Coastal Research in Environmental Science and Technology (CREST)" Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) program at the University of Massachusetts Boston (UMass Boston) is a ten-week immersive research experience serving eight undergraduates per year. The program allows students to develop independent research projects and to participate in professional development activities. Research projects will focus on cutting edge, integrative, coastal environmental science research. The goal of the CREST REU is to introduce students who are early in their academic career to the diverse approaches used in coastal environmental research, which necessitates crossing disciplinary boundaries. Scholars will develop a peer network from diverse backgrounds and disciplines. They will foster an understanding of coastal ocean research and will acquire experience in all aspects of the scientific method and environmental problem solving. Students will also participate in a variety of professional development activities to gain practical experience in the communication of their research, responsible conduct in research, and activities designed to integrate students into the University community. The program will support the national goal of developing a scientific workforce with interdisciplinary training. &lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;The student research experiences address high need areas in the chemistry, geology and earth science, ecology and molecular ecology, and social, behavioral, economics, and sustainability sciences fields. Coastal ecosystems are considered to disproportionally produce more services to humans than any other ecosystems. However, anthropogenic drivers of habitat loss, habitat degradation and over-exploitation of coastal resources are threatening coastal ecosystem services. Student research will contribute to the understanding of how coastal ecosystems respond to anthropogenic drivers and will support the integration of data from natural science and social science research into the decision-making process for coastal management. This program will offer a total of twenty-four young scholars an opportunity to conduct socially-relevant research and to advance into scientific careers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Throughout the 2017-2020 program, CREST REU Scholars developed a scientific peer network from diverse backgrounds and disciplines, fostered an understanding of coastal ocean research and created strong personal and professional relationships, and acquired experience in all aspects of the scientific method and environmental problem solving, motivating them toward and positioning them for a coastal ocean sciences STEM career.  Seventy percent of participating scholars stated that the REU program was important or very important in helping them go to graduate school and start a career in ocean or environmental sciences.  Intellectual Merit: The 2017-2020 CREST REU research projects evolved from existing projects or were developed by the scholars and mentors to fill a unique gap. Scholars tasted the successes and frustrations of authentic, cutting-edge research and gained hands-on experience with instrumentation, field experiences, and training in data collection. Because of the transdisciplinary approaches of the mentors and the inherent diversity of disciplines represented in the coastal environmental sciences, scholars gained necessary skills in working across disciplines.  Many of the scholars were involved in cutting edge ocean science research and had the opportunity to present their novel findings at international meetings.  Scholars across the program cohorts, specifically stated that our program activities were effective or very effective in preparing them for presenting their science at scientific meetings or through informal education.  Over the course of the program, approximately 30% of our scholars presented at a national or international science conference.  In addition, 15% of our scholars are co-authors on forthcoming publications.  Therefore, our program was highly effective at advancing and communicating ocean science.  Broader impacts: Coastal environments face problems that require basic and applied transdisciplinary problem solving. CREST addressed this need through recruitment and training of practitioners in the transdisciplinary coastal environmental sciences.  We specifically recruited students from a variety of academic ranks and CREST was committed to diversity of perspective, specifically seeking applicants from underrepresented groups (67% of scholars), first generation (28% of scholars), disabled (16% of scholars), and students attending institutions where exposure to research (61% of scholars), particularly coastal environmental research (around 80%), is limited. These combined experiences resulted in students who were more comfortable crossing disciplinary boundaries, better prepared for advanced study, and who ultimately planned to contribute to the diversification of the scientific workforce.
