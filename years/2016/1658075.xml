<AbstractNarration>The proposed research will improve theoretical understanding of trust in risk communication by integrating considerations of attitude strength into the conceptualization and measurement of trust. While authorities managing environmental risk seek to earn trust from the public, they also want such trust to be strong. That is, they want trust bestowed upon them to last over time, endure bad news cycles, and positively influence people's thinking and behavior. Research in risk communication, however, rarely has focused on how these strength-related qualities of trust are gained or lost. Little is known about how these qualities can be measured and tested in statistical models. The lack of attention in this area is likely due to how the field has conceptualized trust, usually as a construct that inherently takes minimal cognitive effort, allowing people to make decisions about environmental risk without having to engage in complex calculations. The current project synthesizes theories and findings from multiple disciplines to take an alternative approach. The literature of attitude strength suggests that attitudes crystallized through rich knowledge and elaboration will exhibit consequences indicative of strong attitudes: they will persist over time, resist counter-persuasive messages, and strongly affect further information processing and behavior. To argue that trust is inherently based on effortless processing implies that trust cannot exhibit these strength-related consequences. Instead of dismissing the possibility of trust based on cognitively effortful processes, this research examines how communication processes can increase knowledge and elaboration about risk managers which, in turn, can yield stronger forms of trust. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This new research propose a theoretical model to study attitude strength attributes of trust in risk communication. According to this model, two attitude-strength attributes (knowledge, elaboration) mediate the relationship between three communication process antecedents (direct interaction, media usage, and discussion with others) and four attitude strength consequences (persistence, resistance, impact on information processing, impact on behavior). To empirically test this alternative model of trust, the projects develops a two-wave online survey using a sample from a local community where there is a salient risk management issue and the three communicative processes can be reasonably observed. Residents within the area to be affected by an environmentally hazardous project will be invited to the online survey via post mail. Respondents will report their communication experiences with, and amount of knowledge and elaboration about a local environmental agency making decisions about the project. They will also rate their level of trust toward the agency in both waves of the survey, allowing measurement of the persistence of trust.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Hwanseok Song completed his dissertation "Toward deeper and broader understanding of social judgments in risk communication: The role of attitude strength and perceived standing" supported by the NSF Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement Grant. During his funding period, he conducted interviews and a two-wave survey with residents in a local area embroiled in a dispute over a proposed gas storage to be sited by a scenic lake in Upstate New York (see Figure 1).&nbsp;</p> <p>When measuring how much authorities managing the risks in our daily lives are trusted (e.g., state officials granting permit to hazardous facilities), a typical practice is to simply ask people whether they trust or distrust the authority. The current study argues that this approach is too simplistic. Even when we judge others in our daily interactions, a positive impression of someone on one's first date is fundamentally different from a positive judgment of someone in a deep friendship over many years. The latter kind of friendship is more likely to last and become the relationship one relies on in difficult times. Likewise, a good understanding of trust judgments in authorities managing our risks--health, safety, environment--should consider qualities such as how certain people are about their trust, with how much knowledge about authorities they hold their trust, and how much thinking they invested to develop their trust. The goal of this project was to study whether capturing these dimensions of strength indeed help better explain when trust is durable and impactful.&nbsp;</p> <p>Thus, in addition to judgments of trust, this study measured these strength-related attributes of trust (i.e., certainty, knowledge, elaboration) and tested what communication activities predict these strength-related attributes and what what effect these attributes have on important outcomes (e.g., intentions to cooperate with the authority). A conceptual model of these relationships is attached as Figure 2. Overall, results of this project yielded strong evidence that, as predicted, direct communication with risk managers, use of local news media, and interpersonal discussion of the issue all helped build knowledge, elaboration, and certainty in trust toward the judgment targets. In turn, these strength-related attributes predicted consequences indicative of strong trust (i.e., persistence, resistance, impact on information processing and behavioral intentions). These strength-related attributes improved predictions of these outcomes by 29% on average, relative to models using trust alone, suggesting that measuring and considering these attributes in addition to trust is likely to be a worthwhile endeavor.</p> <p>Another line of inquiry that emerged during the preliminary interview phase of this project concerned the way people say how others derserve or not deserve representation at the decision-making table to influence the issue. For example, whereas supporters of the gas storage project rhetorically ostracized environmentalists coming from farther communities as "outsiders," opponents refered to the Texas-based company applying for the construction permit at this Upstate New York lake in a similar way. In this study, we call these judgments of other parties' deservingness to have representation in the decision-making process <em>perceived standing</em>, and explored where these judgments come from, drawing on concepts that have been studied in previous research.</p> <p>Findings of the study show that, as expected, variables representing strategic interests to have more alllies and fewer foes to influence the decision (i.e., project support, perceived risk, perceived benefit) were key motivators in judgments of perceived standing. However, other motivators that have little to do with strategic interests were also important. These variables included similarity with the target whose perceived standing is being judged, emotional attachment to places such as a lake or a larger region, and one's feeling that oneself is sufficiently represented in the issue (see Figure 3). In sum, when people claim that another party does or does not deserve a voice in a contested decision about a local environmental issue, it is not merely out of strategic interests to influence the decision in one's favor. It also has to do with a host of other cognitive and emotional factors that define people's relationship with their physical environment and others in the society.</p> <p>Hwanseok Song's final work is deposited in Cornell University's eCommons online collection of dissertations (<a href="https://doi.org/10.7298/X45X274K">https://doi.org/10.7298/X45X274K</a>).
