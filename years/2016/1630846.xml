<AbstractNarration>Ocean-atmosphere scientists have for many years been studying how bubbles in ocean whitecaps influence the exchange of gases across the air-sea interface. Bubbles provide greater contact surface area between air and water, and the over-pressure of gases in submerged bubbles forces their dissolution. Sea spray droplets likewise increase the effective surface area of the atmosphere-ocean interface, yet little is known of their role in air-sea gas exchange, or their effectiveness compared to bubbles. Understanding the exchange of atmospheric green-house gases such as CO2 into the global ocean is important to global warming and ocean acidification. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study will use a microphysical model and knowledge of the rate at which spray droplets are produced to evaluate the role of sea spray in enhancing air-sea gas exchange, and compare this to other sea-air gas exchange rates, and mechanisms.</AbstractNarration>

The approach involved enhancing a physical droplet evolution model with thermodynamic components that could account for the changes in solubility and fugacity of gases as the droplet evolves. The project focused on the inert gases He, Ne and Ar and the less reactive, low solubility gases N2 and O2. Droplet evolution is a two-step process wherein the droplet, once injected in air, cools or warms to reach an initial thermal equilibrium within a few seconds followed by an evaporation, which is a function of the surrounding relative humidity, to reach a final radial equilibrium. The initial step depends on the temperature difference of the air and water. Often an injected spray droplet experiences an initial cooling when injected into the air which can lead to a short term invasion of gases from air to water. This slight cooling of the droplet is followed by evaporation of the droplet and "salting out" of dissolved gases, releasing gas into the atmosphere. However, spray droplets which are colder than the air by &gt;1.1-2.4&deg; (depending on the dissolved gas) will warm in the first step, releasing gas rather than accumulating it and therefore these spray drops are sources to the atmosphere across all stages of droplet evolution.
