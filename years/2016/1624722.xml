<AbstractNarration>Support for the 2016 International Quantum Cascade Laser School and Workshop &lt;br/&gt;Nontechnical description: This grant provides funding support to young scientists (postdocs and graduate students) from US institutions with the top-ranked accepted presentation to attend the 2016 International Quantum Cascade Laser School and Workshop (IQCLSW). The IQCLSW conference is held every 2 years since 2004. It serves as a premier venue for all the groups working in the field of quantum cascade lasers for discussing the latest developments in the field and generating new research directions. Quantum cascade lasers are semiconductor lasers operating in mid-infrared and terahertz range of electromagnetic spectrum which have numerous important applications in the fields of chemical and biological sensing, free-space optical communications, defensive infrared countermeasures, securing screening, and remote detection of dangerous substances. The 2016 IQCLSW conference will be held in Cambridge, United Kingdom on September 4-9, 2016. An important component is the 2-day school portion, in which hour-long tutorial presentations are aimed at graduate students and young scientists to rapidly acquaint them with the fundamentals of this rapidly developing technology and thus provide education and training of the new generation of scientists. The 2016 IQCLSW conference will have a significant applications focus and will include and engage mid-infrared and terahertz photonics industry. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical description: The 2016 IQCLSW meeting starts with the two-day School section, with 9 hour-long tutorial presentations by top scientists and engineers in the field aimed at students, postdocs, and young scientists.  Tutorial presentations are designed to teach the fundamentals of the rapidly evolving field of mid-infrared and terahertz quantum cascade lasers and mid-infrared and terahertz photonics applications. The 3-day Workshop follows the School and will have 4 keynote, 10-15 invited and 45-55 contributed talks, as well as poster sessions, focused on the most recent developments in quantum cascade lasers and their applications. Applications that will be discussed include: high-resolution spectroscopy, microscopy, chemical and biomedical sensing, coherent detection, imaging, security screening, and infrared countermeasures.</AbstractNarration>
