<AbstractNarration>The proposed project seeks financial support for organizing a Workshop on the status and challenges of a broad class of semiconductors with bandgaps larger than 3.4 eV, i.e., larger than the bandgap of GaN. Representative materials are AlGaN (including the binary endpoint AlN), diamond, Ga2O3, and their heterostructures. The Workshop will be held April 25-26, 2016 at the Basic Research Innovation and Collaboration Center (BRICC) in Arlington VA. The Workshop will foster advances in the leading research of extreme (ultra) wide-bandgap (UWBG) semiconductors by gathering a diverse group of experts. Topics to be addressed include among other bulk and epitaxial growth, electronic transport at low and high fields, device architectures, heterostructure designs, fundamental limits to device performance, device fabrication and processing techniques, The workshop will include 7 invited talks, 10 contributed presentations and is expected to be attended by 70 attendees from industry, academia, and government. The organizing committee will select topic leads to assist with selection of attendees. The report prepared on the Workshop will summarize the outcome of the discussions and will be available to all the workshop attendees, as well as other members of the scientific community.</AbstractNarration>
