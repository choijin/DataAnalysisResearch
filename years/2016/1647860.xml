<AbstractNarration>In the era of big data, across numerous application domains, large amounts of data are being collected, integrated, and analyzed to support rich application semantics and enable data-driven science discovery. While having the access to more data leads to more opportunities for analytics, mining, learning, and knowledge discovery, at the same time, it also increases the chance of security breach and privacy infringement. In essence, adversaries are able to gain more insights into an application or system, and equipped with more background knowledge, when more (relevant) data are made available to him/her. This award supports the organization of a workshop to bring together researchers and practitioners from different sub-fields of data science and security/privacy to discuss the vision, challenges, and opportunities for the protection of security and privacy in big data management and mining.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The agenda of the workshop has broader impacts on the scientific communities and the society at large by identifying the challenges for data science research related to security and privacy, and foster the vision for secure and privacy-aware data management and mining through an interdisciplinary data science approach. More specifically, the workshop increases the interactions among several related communities, including cryptography, database and data management, mining and learning, systems, social and behavior sciences, and applied security.</AbstractNarration>

In essence, adversaries are able to gain more insights into an application or system, and equipped with more background knowledge, when more (relevant) data are made available to him/her.  A fundamental and important challenge towards realizing the promise of big data is to deliver secure and privacy-aware data management and mining. Given the rich and wide topics covered by data management and data mining applications, the strong needs for deep analytics, mining, and learning, and the constant interactions between human and system, data science research plays an important role to achieve this objective. Often time, a holistic view or approach is needed, i.e., we need to apply techniques from multiple sub-fields in computer science, such as cryptography, systems, mining and learning, HCI (human-computer interaction), and SBS (social-behavioral science), in order to properly address the needs for building applications that systems are secure and privacy-aware.  However, existing studies and research in the literature on relevant topics often are driven by efforts from a single, isolated sub-field, rather than taking a holistic approach as argued above. In light of such limitations, the NSF sponsored workshop on the topics of "Data Science for Secure and Privacy Aware Big Data Management and Mining", or the DSSP workshop in short, was organized. The objective of the DSSP workshop was to bring together researchers and practitioners from different sub-fields of data science who have strong interest at stake, in relationship to the protection of security and privacy in big data management and mining based on various data science techniques and research.  The DSSP workshop offered a forum where these folks can engage in active discussions and exchange of ideas, in order to find the limitations of existing results, identify the challenges for data science research, and foster the vision for secure and privacy-aware data management and mining through an interdisciplinary data science approach.  The workshop was by-invitation only, and 42 attendees from different areas of security and privacy attended the workshop.

The workshop achieved its goal of promoting inter-disciplinary research and collaboration for addressing critical security and privacy challenges. A number of recommendations, as a result of the discussions that took place during the workshop, were also made to the NSF which were included in the final report of this workshop submitted to the NSF.
