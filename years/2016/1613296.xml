<AbstractNarration>This award will fund research on the use of mathematical tools from probability theory to address long-standing questions in the physics of phase transitions, in an area known as statistical physics. Mathematical versions of the concepts of phase transitions, threshold behavior, critical phenomena, and scaling limits have value which is now well recognized in areas which at first sight might have seemed far from the statistical physics where these concepts originated.   Mathematical studies of such topics have led to fundamental developments in modern probability theory.  In turn, rigorous analysis has  provided useful feedback on our understanding of the relevant physics.  Examples of the latter are found in the disorder effects on phase transitions in two and three dimensional classical and quantum systems systems (such as the so-called Imry-Ma phenomenon), and in the spectral and dynamical effects of disorder in the context of random quantum operators. The PI was instrumental in past works of this type, including recently, in which he contributed key results which helped uncover new classical and quantum physical phenomena thanks to studies in probability theory.  The projected research will both continue and redirect the PI's efforts, and will necessarily continue be interdisciplinary in nature. Beyond its use of probability theory and mathematical analysis on physics questions, the results of the research could potentially bring broader impacts to other areas where modern probability theory is helping elucidate new phenomena, such as computer science and engineering, and data science.  Of particular note with this project's other broader impacts is the potential for outcomes of the highest caliber in training the next generation of US scientists. Based on the PI's past and recent supervision of extraordinarily talented graduate students and postdocs under NSF support, the project will certainly allow the PI to offer research experience of the highest level for such future trainees at Princeton University. Some of the research will be carried out in collaboration with top researchers from other institutions, providing valuable networking opportunities for the trainees.    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI's attention will be redirected towards critical phenomena in a number of instructive models below their upper critical dimension, a concept whose understanding was firmly advanced by PI's previous work on percolation, Ising spin systems and phi^4 field theory.   It was recently noted that the techniques by which the PI has previously established the Gaussian (bosonic) nature of the Ising model's scaling limits in dimensions greater than four yield also simple proofs of the fermionic nature of certain correlation functions in the planar case.   Some of these relations have been known through exact solution of the two dimensional model, but the new argument suggests a path towards explanation of "universal" emergent planarity in a class of critical non-planar and non-solvable two dimensional models.   Related questions concerning critical phenomena will be explored for the three-dimensional case, which is neither trivial nor solvable yet of obvious interest.  Work will also continue on classical and quantum effects of disorder on the spectral and dynamical properties  of random operators, and on the structure of Gibbs equilibrium states of systems with quenched disorder.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Preamble:  Modern probability theory is a thriving field.  To a considerable extent this has been due to its continuously refreshing dialog with different areas of science, in particular physics.  Essential role is played by the continuing tension between the need to develop mathematical insight and structures, and the drive to maintain relevance.  Such a dual perspective has been kept in mind in charting the present research project.  The project reported here centered on topics motivated by statistical and quantum physics, for which an identifiable probabilistic scaffolding can be found in a mathematical model of random configurations of geometric objects, random clusters, random loops, or random currents.    Specific results:  Accomplishments include a number of results some of which realize long-sought goals:  1) Marginal triviality of the scaling limits of critical Ising and Phi^4 models in d=4 dimensions.  The statement concerns the nature of fluctuations of the local magnetization field in critical states, at which the fluctuations? correlation length diverges.  The main results is the proof that unlike what is known for two dimensions, and expected of three, in four dimensions the spin fluctuations in the indicatd models, at their critical points, are Gaussian in the scaling limit (infinite volume, vanishing lattice spacing).  This assertion covers scaling limits of functional integrals which have been of considerable interest in the constructive field theory program.       The proofs make use of the systems' random current representation in which the deviation from Gaussian behavior (more specifically from Wick's law) are expressed in terms of intersection probabilities of random currents with prescribed sources.  This correspondence was previously utilized for the proof of similar statement for high dimensions, d&gt;4. Their extension to the marginal dimension has required to address logarithmically divergent corrections in the relevant estimates. This was accomplished through a multiscale analysis of the random currents' intersections.    (Joint work with Hugo Duminil-Copin, currently being reviewed at the Annals of Mathematics.)  2 ) Quantum Phase Transitions and the F-K Random Cluster Models:  Unlike classical antiferromagnets, quantum antiferromagnetic interactions involve frustration, which may lead to interesting effects on the systems? ground states.  In particular, under certain conditions this may lead to symmetry breaking, expressed in in spacial oscillations of local energy, possibly occurring even in one dimensional systems.  In another family of spin models translation symmetry breaking may be manifested in the Ne?l long range order, i.e. ground states of oscillatory mean magnetization.    We studied these phenomena in two different extensions of the Heisenberg spin antiferromagnetic model to spins of magnitude S.  The two classes of quantum spin chains turn to be related, and somewhat surprisingly their relation is mediated by the classical Q-state random cluster model, at Q=(2S+1)^2.  Exploiting these relations we arrived at a structural explanation and a proof that the parameter values Q=4, and S=1/2, are the thresholds for i) the discontinuity in the random cluster model?s transition, ii) the onset of dimerization in one of the quantum spin models, and ii) the onset of Ne?l order in another.  Thus we find that a number of very different phenomena are best understood by considering simultaneously three different projections of a common probabilistic model: one is the classical F-K random cluster model, and two others are different quantum spin chains.       The results were presented in the joint work:  Michael Aizenman, Hugo Duminil-Copin, Simone Warzel ``Dimerization and Ne&#769;el Order in Different Quantum Spin Chains Through a Shared Loop Representation'', Annales Henri Poincare&#769; , v. 21, 2737-2774 (2020).  3) Random Field Ising model:  Decay rate for correlations under quenched disorder:  It has been previously known that in low dimensional statistic-mechanical systems first order phase transitions are generically rounded off under even weak (but extensive) disorder. The follow up question which has attracted discussion concerned the nature of the decay of correlations in the local ``magnetization?? under decorrelated disorder. It has been known that at high quenched disorder equilibrium states are locally determined by the frozen parameters.  A question of interest has been whether at weak disorder such systems transition to a regime at which the local structure is affected to a significant extent by distant boundary conditions.   For the simplest model of this phenomenology, the Random Field Ising Model, existence of such a transition was ruled out by the result presented in:  Aizenman, M., Harel, M. &amp; Peled, R. Exponential Decay of Correlations in the 2D Random Field Ising Model. J Stat Phys 180, 304-331 (2020)  Participants: Work on this project has involved a diverse and international set of collaborators, including a graduate student and a post-doctoral fellow, supported by other means, and also some upcoming and actually leading experts in related fields.     Dissemination: The results of this project were  presented and discussed in forums,  including seminars, international webinars, workshops, and will be discussed at the Harvard forthcoming lectures  ``Current Developments in Mathematics''.
