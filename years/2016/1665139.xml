<AbstractNarration>In this RUI project funded by the Chemical Synthesis Program, Professor Carolyn Anderson of the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at Calvin College creates new methods for the synthesis of complex organic heterocycles.  These are substances which contain nitrogen in a ring. New synthetic routes are primarily based on reactions catalyzed by gold (III). Challenging synthetic targets include indolizine and isoquinoline alkaloids, heterocyclic compounds which possess potential medicinal properties. In addition, this award supports 8-10 week summer visitations to Calvin College by senior graduate students from major research institutions. These visitations provide training for future careers as a PUI faculty member.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research expands the suite of chiral and achiral methods for preparing highly functionalized trisubstituted indolizine and N-alkyl 2-pyridone structures. This new chemistry makes these species, and their analogues, available to the broader chemical community. Basic knowledge related to mechanistic and asymmetric gold(III) catalysis is an important product of this research. Successful development of these methodologies and targets impacts the synthetic community as well as those involved in the development of organic materials, medicinal leads, and asymmetric transformations. This research provides hands-on laboratory training for undergraduate research collaborators and pre-college students, especially those from historically underrepresented groups. In addition, this award enables senior graduate students, who intend to pursue academic careers at primarily undergraduate institutions, to spend time during a summer as a member of the PI's laboratory. In this role, the visiting graduate students gain essential experience in running a productive undergraduate research group, while being mentored directly by the PI.</AbstractNarration>
