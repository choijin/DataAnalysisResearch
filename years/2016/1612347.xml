<AbstractNarration>The University of South Florida will serve as the 2016-2018 Bridge to the Doctorate (BD) institutional site for the NSF Florida-Georgia Louis Stokes Alliances for Minority Participation (FGLSAMP) Project with the goal of increasing the number of underrepresented students in STEM who will become the next generation of scientists, engineers, research innovators, entrepreneurs, and faculty role models. USF's FGLSAMP BD Project will provide the unique academic setting and multiple opportunities to facilitate the professional advancement of LSAMP graduates committed to both achieving outstanding careers in engineering, computational, mathematics, and scientific disciplines (physical, biological, geosciences), and shaping the nation's 21st century STEM research agenda. The new FGLSAMP BD Activity will boldly build upon the overwhelming success of six previous FGLSAMP USF BD awards (94% of students are expected to earn an advanced STEM degree) by institutionalizing the best practices initiated with the 2004 BD Project to all USF STEM majors. The project also embodies proven organizational and operational principles by extending the successful LSAMP model of empowering minority undergraduates toward achieving academic and social integration and professionalization in the sciences into graduate STEM programs.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By around 2020, more than half of the nation's children are expected to come from minority or ethnic groups according to the U.S. Census Bureau. In response to these changing demographics, both the National Academies and the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST) have documented the need to increase the participation of individuals from historically underrepresented groups in S&amp;E to help maintain the nation's competitiveness in technology and research innovation. As such, an expected benefit of this university-wide, unified, institutionally integrated FGLSAMP BD project will be to help revitalize the national talent pool of domestic PhD trained scientists and engineers. Another benefit of the FGLSAMP BD activity will be to help address the critical shortfall of individuals from underrepresented groups who become STEM faculty. Through evidence-based practices (e.g., proposal writing preparation, peer-to-peer mentoring, minority scientist role model interactions, engagement with undergraduates and K-12 students, etc.), this FGLSAMP BD activity will seek to encourage a greater number of URM students to pursue both academic careers and nontraditional STEM career pathways (entrepreneurship, governmental research, industry, etc.) The five measurable objectives for the project are as follows: 1) Recruit twelve (12) minority students as NSF FGLSAMP BD fellows by fall 2016 into all USF STEM Colleges, 2) Initiate professional development activities to prepare FGLSAMP BD fellows and FGLSAMP scholars across the Alliance for competitive NSF GRFP applications and other fellowship programs, 3) Support the transition of all USF FGLSAMP BD fellows into STEM PhD programs, 4) Prepare FGLSAMP BD fellows to become globally engaged researchers through cutting-edge research projects and interactions with international scientists; and 5) Implement new graduate student mentoring and outreach initiatives that will both encourage students to pursue academic careers and also help to broaden the national participation of URM students in STEM.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The 2016-2018 Florida-Georgia Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (FGLSAMP) Bridge to the Doctorate Activity, was a two-year, $1 million National Science Foundation (NSF) grant from 2016-2019 (the award received a one-year no cost extension).  The underlying premise of the project is that innovation requires diverse perspectives and for the US to maintain its global technological leadership, individuals from all backgrounds should be fully engaged in the scientific enterprise.  The Florida Georgia Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (FGLSAMP) is a funded program that helps ensure students from historically underserved backgrounds contribute their ideas and talents ito become the next generation of scientists, engineers, mentors and role models, research innovators, and knowledge creators.   Toward this objective, the FGLSAMP BD goal was to recruit, retain, and provide 12 former LSAMP scholars with world-class graduate research training in STEM and professional development activities to support their transition into PhD programs and the global workforce.  LSAMP alumni admitted into STEM doctoral programs in the College of Engineering, College of Marine Science, College of Arts and Sciences or Morsani College of Medicine were connected to a range of academic development and research opportunities. The Bridge to the Doctorate program provided a $32,000 annual stipend, as well as full tuition/fees and health insurance, for two years. To help students transition into their graduate programs, they were provided coaching in graduate school expectations and transferrable skills, including proposal writing. Fellows awere actively encouraged to participate in peer to-peer and undergraduate mentoring.   Intellectual Merit: This FGLSAMP BD project explored new paradigms in minority graduate education (recruitment, retention, student mentoring, and professional development).  The new BD Project continued the overwhelming success of six previous BD with 100 percent of the fellows being retained toward completing an advanced STEM degree (MS or PhD).  It also institutionalized the best practices in preparing graduate students for submitting competitive NSF GRFP applications with parallel STEM Professional Development courses being offered by the College of Marine Science and the APS Physics Bridge programs. Additionally, a new emphasis on assisting students with NSF GRFP applications was launched by the USF Office of Graduate Studies and USF National Office of Scholarships. A unique aspect of the program was the leveraging of non-LSAMP funds from USF and other sources to support nearly 30 BD student presentations at scientific meetings and faciliate 13 journal publications/conference proceedings, and patent applications in less than three years.   Broader Impact:  This project  supported 15 URM studens (3 additional USF funded fellows were funded to enhance the cohort) from ten diverse disciplines (Applied Physics, Biomedical Engineering, Chemistry, Computer Science and Engineering, Electrical Enginereing, Environmental Engineering, Molecular Biology, Geophysics, Geological Oceanography, Biological Oceanography) to advance the knowledge base and broaden particpation in cross-cutting areas of science and engineering.  Apart from the economic benefits and societal value in preparing a highly skilled domestic workforce in areas of national need, this NSF LSAMP BD project offered a multiplier effect with both senior-level and graduate student scientists from underserved backgrounds serving as role models and mentors through K-12 STEM outreach, community college STEM preview events, on-campus seminars and career talks, and undergraduate research activities (academic year and summer).  The FGLSAMP BD Leadership team and faculty mentors anticipate that these innovative research and student training activities will be transformative throughout the STEM ecosystem and serve as a national model for NSF.
