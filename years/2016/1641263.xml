<AbstractNarration>Cell therapies, such as cancer immunotherapy and stem cell therapy, represent a new paradigm of medical treatment using cells as "living drugs."  However, one major bottleneck faced by both research institutions and companies in the cell therapy space is in cell separation and purification.  Traditional cell separation tools including magnetic assisted cell separation (MACS) and fluorescence assisted cell separation (FACS aka flow cytometry) suffer from several limitations which affect cell separation quality and increase costs for the cell therapy industry.  Specifically, FACS and MACS cannot individually procure both highly pure and high yield cell separations.  This requires multiple rounds of MACS and FACS separation to be performed on each sample, thereby increasing processing cost and decreasing throughput.  This I-Corps team has developed a magnetic based cell separation technology which can address this gap providing a tool that can provide both high purity and high yield separations.  If commercialized, the system can reduce cell separation costs by approximately 10x and extend new capabilities to researchers which will accelerate cell therapy development.  The team has already developed and tested a prototype instrument with multiple cell samples, including clinical blood draws, and has developed several key collaborations with cell therapy researchers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The activities of this project will be on customer discovery using the business model canvas to test and validate/disprove hypotheses about the cellular therapy market. The team first plans to generate hypothesis of its target customer segments and value propositions and then perform customer interviews to validate/disprove those hypotheses. In the span of eight weeks the team plans to interview at least 100 potential customers with the goal of proving/disproving its hypotheses. Responses and data analysis will be transcribed, aggregated, and uploaded to the Launchpad central web application. The final deliverable will be a completed business model canvas and a go/no go decision on future commercialization efforts.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[Through the NSF I CORPS  program in the June 2016 Cohort, Coleman Murray  (PI) Edward Pao, and Tim Tiemann performed 228 customer discovery interviews  concerning cell purification techniques and products.  The conclusion was that the low throughput  of current cell purification technologies represents a significant pain point  for manufactures of cell based therapies (I.E. immunotherapy &amp; regenerative  medicine therapies) in scaling manfacturing.   After reviewing customer interview  data, we observed several key points. In general production of cell therapies involves four steps: purification of target cells from a patient/donor sample, genetic modification (transduction), expansion of therapeutic cellso quality control/release assays. Purification of target cells from donors/patient samples is a costly manufacturing bottleneck. Current technologies have low throughput (~10^5 cells/s) which is a significant pain point for sscaling cell therapy manufacturers.  Additionally integration of functional assays (antitumor activity or cytokine secretion) were of interest but were dificult to implement in a cGMP setting and with rapid turover.  Our findings indicated that cell therapy customers may be segmented into 2 major groups with respect to intent: (A) Research/Preclinical Users and (B) Commercial Users.  We found that research users are primarily interested in well-controlled and defined experimental parameters, typically at a small scale, in discovery phase.  This user base is largely found in academic and government research settings, although large and mid-size pharmaceutical companies also maintain research groups with similar interests and motivations. Commercial users are typically more interested in reproducibly creating the same preferred conditions over time which result in a well-defined component according to a protocol reviewed and accepted by a regulatory body, typically for a human therapeutic.  Beyond performance, this group is more interested in consistency and control over product performance over time, typically by compliance to cGMP and other Quality System Regulations.   Key unmet needs for cell filtration technologies:    Higher throughput filtrations to maximize production. Efficient separations of rare cell types (Ex. stem cells). High purity enrichment for producing potent therapies. Sterile operation to meet regulatory compliance.           Last Modified: 11/15/2017       Submitted by: Coleman Murray]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
