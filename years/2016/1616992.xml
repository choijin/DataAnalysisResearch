<AbstractNarration>Dust grains in cold interstellar gas clouds provide sites for chemical reactions of simple atoms and molecules.  Reactions on dust grains can produce molecules such as water, which is one of nature's most important compounds, and is essential to life as we currently know it.  This research project will use advanced experimental techniques to study how water forms on cold surfaces similar to those of dust grains in space.  Results from the study will help astronomers understand how processes on interstellar dust grains can produce water in space.  Understanding these processes could also allow astronomers to understand the origins of Earth's water.  The project, conducted at an undergraduate institution with a largely Hispanic student body, will train students in methods of advanced scientific research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The principal investigator will undertake laboratory studies of water formation on cold surfaces to: (1) understand the predominant formation pathways of water on dust grains in cold molecular clouds and protoplanetary disks; and (2) explain the anomalously high 16-oxygen abundance in the Sun relative to the terrestrial planets.  Specifically, the studies will gauge the relative importance of two water formation pathways --- H + oxygen and H + ozone --- by depositing H atoms and oxygen or ozone molecules on a cold surface and then analyzing the isotopic composition of the water molecules produced.  This will be done using a cavity-ringdown spectrometer calibrated for isotopic analysis, allowing a direct measurement of the branching ratios of the reactions to within 1%.  The investigator will conduct this project at an undergraduate institution with a predominantly Hispanic student body.  This will allow him to provide training in laboratory astrophysics to students from diverse backgrounds.</AbstractNarration>
