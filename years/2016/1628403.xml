<AbstractNarration>In frontier regions worldwide, natural resource extraction often displaces and resettles rural communities. Because the institutional state may be distant from these territories, claims to sovereignty and the right to exert regulatory power often get worked out locally. These evolving relationships raise important questions about the nature of government in the contemporary world and the capacities of communities to establish and evaluate political legitimacy. The research funded by this award addresses these questions by taking advantage of an interesting natural experiment in a coal-mining region in northeastern Colombia. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Vanderbilt University doctoral student Emma Banks, under the supervision of Dr. Lesley Gill, will undertake the research in a frontier region of Colombia that, for over two decades, has been home to a major open pit coalmine.  The mine has displaced communities from their communal rural territories and resettled them in peri-urban villages. Usefully for research purposes, these communities contrast with each other along two significant axes: how recently they have been displaced and whether they are ethnically Afro-descendant or indigenous Indians. Taking advantage of these contrasts, Banks will gather data in four communities that contrast along those lines: two communities resettled earlier, one of each ethnicity; and two resettled more recently, again, once of each ethnicity. This will allow her to see how local political processes evolve over time and how this evolution is affected by the resources accessible by people in different social positions.  Banks will compare the legal resources, ethnic identity politics, and alliance networks used by each community to legitimize authority, make the impacts of resettlement visible, and influence resettlement outcomes.  To find and compare evidence of legitimacy building, she will conduct participant observation at roundtable meetings between the mine and communities, and interview mine officials, state officials, and community members.  To contextualize these findings, she will also carry out archival research and conduct in-depth life history interviews with community members.  These data will allow her to better understand a phenomenon found worldwide, including in the United States: how communities and natural resource corporations, away from the direct government control, negotiate legitimacy and influence each other. Findings from this research will inform social science theory of how local politics functions at the local level in the contemporary world. Findings will also be of use to policy makers who seek to devise ways to support resource extraction without disadvantaging citizens and communities.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This research explores how indigenous and Afro-descendant peoples use periods of economic rupture to renegotiate their relationship to powerful actors.  The Co-PI, Emma Banks, conducted research in La Guajira, Colombia where since the early 1990s, the Cerrej&oacute;n Coal Company has displaced and forcibly resettled Afro-descendant and indigenous communities to make room for its mining operations.  This dissertations compares how the indigenous Way&uacute;u community of Tamaquito II and the three Afro-descendent communities of Chancleta, Patilla, and Roche formed new community organizations to negotiate the conditions of resettlement and post-resettlement support with the corporation.   During 12 months of research, the Co-PI collected data on the legal resources, social networks, and identity politics that each community used to organize themselves and to negotiate resettlement with Cerrej&oacute;n. Her research and writing was supervised by the PI, Dr. Lesley Gill.  The dissertation analyzes how leaders found ways to make resettlement beneficial to their communities.  Indigenous and Afro-descendant communities are guaranteed special rights as protected minorities by the Colombian state. Communities have drawn on and strengthened these identities to demand participation in resettlement planning and to draw attention to their dispossession at the hands of the company. The Co-PI collected 278 field notes from participant observation, 28 recorded and transcribed interviews with key subjects, and collected over 5000 pages of original documentation.  The Co-PI had produced one published journal article and is currently writing a dissertation.  She will also submit two more journal articles for publication using this data.  She will turn her dissertation into a book manuscript starting in 2019.  This research has generated a novel interpretation of the negotiation of power between natural resource extraction corporations, and ethnically and racially marginalized groups.  The Co-PI developed a theoretical framework called "indigenizing the social relations of capital" to conceptualize how indigenous and Afro-descendant people use their identity to adapt to extractive capitalism.  Broadly, this research contributes to current debates on the social responsibility and legal liability of corporations by examining how resettlement gives corporations political and social power. This projects also enhances the historical and ethnographic literature of the understudied La Guajira region of Colombia. The Co-PI is using the findings to generate policy recommendations for better forced resettlement practices.         Last Modified: 10/08/2018       Submitted by: Emma L Banks]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
