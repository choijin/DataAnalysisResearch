<AbstractNarration>As a means to provide centralized services for students in undergraduate mathematics courses, many institutions of higher education house units sometimes known as "mathematics support centers". Examples of the valuable services provided by such centers include tutoring, advising, and peer mentoring. To provide a forum for directors of such centers to share best practices and ideas for maximally effective impact, this project will host two annual working meetings for 20-30 directors of such centers and facilitate continued discussions during the year in between the meetings. Participants in the meetings will identify challenges faced by the centers and solutions implemented successfully. This project will provide the foundation for these professionals to engage in a continuous improvement model, learning from the structures and services determined through practice and assessment to be highly effective.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The working meetings will adapt a workshop model used successfully by the American Institute of Mathematics (AIM), adopting the AIM goal of "organize groups of people to set in motion activity that will lead to large-scale advances in the subject". The overall goal of this project's working meetings is to lay the foundation for collaborations between directors of mathematics support centers and researchers in mathematics education. To this end, the workshops will result in an annotated list of priority topic areas and a possible education research agenda.</AbstractNarration>

Identify the issues related to mathematics learning centers that need to be addressed by research and create a research agenda  4. Form working groups to design research studies related to mathematics learning centers   Through the workshops and RUME working groups, we have established a network of math center directors and math education researchers. We have a google group mailing list and arrange weekly online meetings through zoom. These meeting have been going on since February 2017. We have broken into several working groups to tackle different research questions associated with math tutoring. These groups have generated conference proceedings papers, journal articles, and NSF grant proposals.  Specific Objectives:- Survey the current landscape of math centers in the USA. Members of our logistics working group created a survey about the daily operations of math centers and distributed it to math center directors at universities across the nation. We had 75 respondents, and the results of the survey have been submitted to a journal. The paper is currently under review. - Generate hypotheses about how structural changes in math centers can affect student learning outcomes. Several members of the group have submitted their usage and grade data for students enrolled in lower division classes, as well as a profile about their centers. This data will be analyzed to generate hypotheses about how certain organizational structures impact student outcomes.  - Document and analyze the tutor-student interaction. Another working group is collecting observational data of tutoring sessions paired with tutors? reflections on their tutoring sessions. This data will give insight into the social interaction of the tutoring session, with an emphasis on the tutors? perspective. This working group has submitted several conference proceedings papers and an NSF grant proposal to scale up their work.- Generate and distribute quality mathematics-specific tutor training materials. We have a shared google drive in which we share tutor training resources, but an objective of our group is to develop customizable tutor training materials and disseminate those to math center directors across the nation. We will be writing an NSF grant to fund a train-the-trainer workshop to disseminate these materials.    Broader Impacts:  Many of the members of our group are the sole person in charge of the math center at their university, so just creating a network and meeting weekly to discuss day-to-day operations has been an opportunity to grow and become more efficient and thoughtful in our work. We have been reading research articles together and discussing how we can implement the results of research into our centers, and generating research questions that we can explore with the rich data sets that our centers generate.      Membership into our group happened initially through word of mouth, but since our group had exposure as a working group at the national Research in Undergraduate Mathematics Education conference, we are getting more publicity and more members are joining. Members of our group have attended other conferences like the CRLA conference, the Northeast Consortium for Quantitative Literacy, and the STEM Support Conference, and we have gained members in that way.
