<AbstractNarration>This is a collaborative project involving Carroll Community College (Award DUE-1600748) and Howard Community College (Award DUE-1600754) in Maryland, and it builds on a previous Advanced Technological Education (ATE) project (Award DUE-0802311) at Lone Star College-Montgomery in Texas. Audio Visual Systems (AVS) specialists are needed to support the specialized communication and presentation needs of businesses and other organizations. AVS specialists are employed in universities, K-12 schools, scientific research centers, conference centers, hotels, theaters, and other venues that have integrated, high-tech communication systems. These technicians require advanced training in industry-specific technologies that support a multitude of presentation venues, which in turn support educational, conference, corporate, entertainment, and other events. The two collaborating colleges will jointly create an innovative AVS program to prepare students for this growing, interdisciplinary field, in which the technology continues to advance and to require deeper knowledge of concepts in science, mathematics, and engineering. The new program will provide a pathway for students, offering certificates, an associate degree, and the option of transferring to a four-year program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The AAS degree program in Audio Visual Technology Systems (AVTS) will partner with local businesses and other organizations to offer on-the-job training, as well as potential post-graduation employment. Students will receive hands-on instruction in the application of electrical, lighting, and acoustical theories and designs. The program will be led by faculty who have substantial industry experience. Specific objectives of the project are to develop courses and curricula; recruit students into certificate and degree programs; develop and strengthen industry relationships; ensure smooth transitions for students from high schools to the two-year program, and from the two-year program to four-year programs; and disseminate the curriculum and other resources to other community colleges.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Starting in Fall 2017, Howard Community College (HCC), in Columbia, MD, began a collaborative project to address the need for innovative education of audiovisual specialists.  Collaborating with neighboring Carroll Community College in the creation of this program, HCC has developed and refined Audio Video Technology Systems (AVTS) certificate and Associate of Applied Sciences (AAS) curriculum, which have received approval from the Maryland Higher Education Commission (MHEC).  The curriculum was created through discipline and field research as well as with the direct input of an advisory board of industry representatives from companies and organizations which support all public presentations, including universities, conferences, symposiums, speakers, and entertainment evets.  NSF grant funding was used to support the development of the program and equipment needed for instruction.  HCC?s AVTS program was carefully designed to ensure that curriculum aligns with industry needs.  A feature of this program is the large amount of hands-on training which includes at least 12 out of 60 credits of hands-on cooperative education experiences and capstone projects.  Students completing the program are qualified for work within the field, and many of the program?s industry partners are eager to find placement for AVTS graduates.  The program was also reviewed by 2 program consultants in fall 2018 and spring 2019 ? the first from a similar program in Orlando, FL, and the second from a national company that supports live event needs.  Based on recommendations from these consultants, modifications were made to the curriculum; adjustments to curriculum to include developments in industry equipment and practices, capstone projects were focused on internal projects for better supervision and mentorship, and a new course option was added for AVTS majors in discipline-specific drafting.  Much work has supported creating awareness for the program and the discipline by visiting high schools, attending open houses, providing meetings and tours, and sharing program information through affiliated groups.  HCC?s AVTS program is still within its fledging years, but it continues to make modest growths.  As of January 2020, 40 HCC students had indicated AVTS as their major, and the program has awarded 1 certificate and 2 AAS degrees.  The awareness of this discipline and this program continues to grow.  Audio visual technicians are needed to support the specialized communication needs for businesses and organizations.  HCC?s creative an innovative AVTS program fulfills this unmet need with comprehensive and transformative training that is pedagogically engineered to prepare students for this exciting and growing field.  These multimedia specialists require advanced training in industry-specific technology that supports a multitude of presenting venues that in-turn support educational conference, corporate, and entertainment events AVTS specials are employed at universities, school districts, science research centers, conference centers, hotels, and other venues with integrated, high-technology communication needs.  Fulfilling the outcomes of the project HCC has developed AVTS curriculum and courses, recruited students into AVTS AAS and certificate programs, and developed industry relationships.  HCC has worked towards easy transitions from high school to the AVTS 2-year program and from the AVTS 2-year program to 4-year programs.  Lastly, Howard Community College serves as a resource for other schools who also wish to implement an AVTS major.  Research on program curriculum and innovations has been presented at state, regional, and national conferences, and HCC continues to seek more opportunities to share what has been learned.
