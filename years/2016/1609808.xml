<AbstractNarration>Title: Two New Laser Pulse-Measurement Techniques for Fiber Optics:  Measuring Ultraweak Ultrashort Pulses and Spatio-Temporally Complex Multi-Spatial-Mode Pulses&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Non-Technical Description: This project will involve developing two laser pulse-measurement techniques to solve two important unsolved problems in fiber optics and fiber lasers. The first will solve the long-standing problem of the development of an ultrasensitive pulse-measurement technique for very low-energy and relatively long laser pulses-pulses with very low intensities. Such pulses occur in essentially all telecommunications environments, but also in many other fields.  The second measurement technique is for the fiber-mode-dispersion problem:  different spatial modes propagate at different velocities in a fiber and so require a complete spatiotemporal light-measurement technique. The proposed technique simultaneously generates many different-color holograms on a single camera frame and will also be simple, fast, and convenient.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Description: Current pulse-measurement techniques must use a thin nonlinear-optical crystal, whose output scales as the square of the intensity and crystal thickness and so yields a weak output beam. The first proposed technique will instead use a very thick nonlinear-optical crystal, much longer than is possible in other techniques, in a novel manner to yield much higher efficiency. This crystal also simultaneously spectrally resolves the generated pulse. Collinear, orthogonally polarized beams and a Type II crystal will also be required. The second proposed technique generates multiple holograms simultaneously, one for each wavelength in the pulse. Because a hologram using single-wavelength light can yield the complete spatial electric field of a beam, generating many holograms, one for each wavelength, coupled with a complete measurement of the reference pulse, yields the complete spatio-spectral and spatio-temporal electric field of even complex multi-mode light. Even better, it can do so using only a single camera frame. Additional frames using additional delays between the unknown and reference pulses can extend the range to arbitrarily large delays and numbers of modes. Both techniques will be very inexpensive, compact, experimentally simple to build and use, and easily constructed from off-the-shelf components.</AbstractNarration>

It was difficult to plot the resulting four-dimensional information on a two-dimensional page, so we also developed display software that generates 3D movies of completely measured pulses, such as these, and such movies are posted in talks on our web site.  In any case, this laser system is so complex that it will take some time to sort out the causes of the various distortions and to fix them. But we have initiated this process, which would otherwise not be possible. Another unsolved problem is that many pulse-measurement techniques, when averaging over many pulses (as is usually necessary), yield an erroneously short pulse when the pulses have different pulse shapes. This erroneous result is called the coherent artifact, and, due to a lack of feedback, the user is usually unaware that his measurement is wrong. Fortunately, the frequency-resolved optical gating (FROG) technique alerts the user to this problem by a discrepancy between the measured trace and the trace retrieved by FROG’s pulse-retrieval algorithm.  Unfortunately, FROG’s algorithm often failed to converge and so yielded such a discrepancy for this reason instead.  Fortunately, during this project, we discovered a highly reliable FROG pulse-retrieval algorithm, which always converges and so completely solves this problem. This was the ultimate goal in pulse-retrieval algorithm development, and we are very excited to have made it during this project. In addition, working with Pam Bowlan at LANL, we helped to demonstrate a FROG technique for measuring UV and potentially even shorter-wavelength pulses by making measurements in the IR.  This will vastly simplify such measurements in the future by allowing simple inexpensive silicon cameras to be used as detectors, rather than complex photo-electron detection apparatuses. The results of the above research are having a broader impact already.  For example, we have placed the RANA code on our web site, available to everyone to download, and it has already proved important for several research groups.   In addition, for the broadest possible impact, we have made additional progress on our award-winning course materials for optics, modern physics, nonlinear optics, and ultrafast optics, all available on the internet for all to use at no cost.  With the ongoing pandemic, the need for free online teaching materials is more important than ever.  We have been developing these entire-course lectures for twenty years, and they have now achieved a high level of organization, elegance, and clarity.
