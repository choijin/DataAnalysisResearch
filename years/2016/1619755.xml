<AbstractNarration>This project will investigate theoretical properties, computational methods, and applications for a particular method of graph partitioning. Generally speaking, graph partitioning is the mathematical problem of subdividing a set into smaller components with desirable properties. This problem has diverse applications in image analysis (medical, satellite, and material), surveillance, social network analysis, and topic modeling, among many others. The results of this project could significantly impact these areas and due to the multidisciplinary nature of this activity, all involved parties will gain awareness and literacy outside their own respective fields. The project provides opportunities for the principal investigator to continue advising and mentoring students. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will prove fundamental theoretical results and develop computational methods for the Dirichlet graph partitioning problem, formulated as minimizing the sum of the principle Laplace-Dirichlet eigenvalues for each partition component. This graph partitioning problem has rich and exploitable mathematical structure: it is motivated by a geometric problem and has both a variational characterization and an associated stochastic process. The project will have three goals. The first goal is to prove, via Gamma convergence with a suitable metric, the consistency result that Dirichlet partitions of geometric graphs, obtained by sampling from a probability space, converge to Dirichlet partitions of that probability space as the number of sampled points tends to infinity. This result will yield a better understanding of the relationship between the graph and continuum partitioning problems as well as possibly suggest subsampling strategies for extremely large datasets. The second goal addresses important computational aspects of the Dirichlet graph partitioning problem. Although two different relaxations of this problem have been identified, computational methods based on these relaxations necessarily have increased computational complexity. The PI will seek provably convergent new methods that combine variational arguments with ideas from geometry, partial differential equations, and Markov processes in order to extend and overcome these shortcomings. The third goal is to address concrete, real-world problems and to engage the developed algorithms in practical applications.</AbstractNarration>

For the cube, we found as local minima the rhombic dodecahedral honeycomb, the Weaire-Phelan honeycomb, and Kelvin?s tessellation by truncated octahedra.

For example, when the field takes values in the orthogonal matrices, we described how a free interface can develop that is not only driven by mean curvature (as in the original Allen-Cahn equation), but also by surface diffusion. As an example application for this work, we considered the inverse problem of denoising an image where each point (pixel) is an element of the target set, which we refer to as a target-valued image. We established several theoretical results for the inverse problem, including well-posedness and the stability and convergence of the numerical method. In a supporting image, we illustrate how these methods can be used to denoise a fingerprint image.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 08/18/2020<br>      Modified by: Braxton&nbsp;R&nbsp;Osting</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1619755/1619755_10438462_1597340576007_ConsistencyPartitioningProblem--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1619755/1619755_10438462_1597340576007_ConsistencyPartitioningProblem--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Consistency of geometric graph partitions"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1619755/1619755_10438462_1597340576007_ConsistencyPartitioningProblem--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Consistency of geometric graph partitions"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">We consider a data collection process where a geometric graph, G, is constructed by sampling points from a set, U.
