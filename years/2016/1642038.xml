<AbstractNarration>Threats to scientific instruments and data that are accessible via the Internet are ubiquitous.  The SouthEast SciEntific Cybersecurity for University REsearch (SECURE) project helps protect the National Science Foundation's investments in scientific research while providing scientists with tools to safeguard intellectual property and ensure data integrity. The project team provides education, training, and selected cybersecurity services to NSF-funded researchers across the Southeast.  The team is multidisciplinary, comprised of cybersecurity experts (both research and practitioner), scientists, and experts in communication.  Team members are located in South Carolina, Alabama and Mississippi, with strong representation from Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU).  This program raises investigators' awareness of their essential role in creating a secure and trustworthy cyberspace and offers concrete assistance in risk assessment, vulnerability testing, and mitigation tailored to NSF-funded scientists' workflow and program size.  Through past collaborations, the team is well positioned to leverage both national and regional cybersecurity organizations and programs to effectively reach the target audience.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;SouthEast SECURE impacts the region by raising cybersecurity awareness; providing concise training, assessment, tools and one-on-one help; and assisting in preparation of select cybersecurity metrics.  Student interns are conducting many of these activities by means of practicum-based deployment and support, thus developing capabilities in the next generation of cyber professionals.  An online survey of NSF-funded investigators in the region will be conducted to learn about their primary cybersecurity challenges and concerns.  Training is then tailored to provide concrete and practical assistance in how to do right-sized risk assessment and mitigation.  A "toolkit" is provided to test and validate local cybersecurity, and measures of cybersecurity are created and field-tested.  The team's approach facilitates communication between research faculty and university IT/Data Security staff.  A long-term goal is building communities with common interests in cybersecurity and a commitment to helping others; and building connections with other regions and with national centers and programs.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In the endeavor to create a variant portable penetration testing device, the Raspberry Pi Zero was the hardware of choice.  Amidst the creation process, it was discovered that although the pi zero is a very good device for portability and stealth its limited processing power does not make it suitable for intensive penetration testing on site.  The benefits of the Raspberry Pi zero itself as a light reconnaissance device for data and information gathering is suitable as well as its use for remote testing and analysis, or its ability to coordinate fewer intensive attacks with a command and control server makes it an extremely valuable tool to have in your penetration testing library.   Finding software intended for the Raspberry Pi zero as a penetration testing device was surprisingly little trouble as efforts have been put forth to create a custom operating system specifically for the platform with the benefit of allowing the device to run headless or with a 2.5-inch LCD touchscreen. The operating system of choice for this effort was to utilize Sticky Fingers Kali Pi, by Re4son.  Sticky Fingers Kali Pi offered a lighter OS than kali?s normal full operating system while having the benefit of modification and addition of programs through the terminal, having a graphical user interface tailored to the small frame of the 2.5-inch screen was ideal, this allowed the device to be extremely portable and usable while active in the field.  With the screen removed the device proved to be quite stealthily for utilizing a reverse connection.  All it takes is just to call to the main home device and connect to the command and control servers to await orders or have the device auto execute pre-configured instructions based on the information collected or even, with the appropriate sensors and interfaces connected, which include all external inputs.
