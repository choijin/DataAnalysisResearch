<AbstractNarration>Jason Curtis is awarded an NSF Astronomy and Astrophysics Postdoctoral Fellowship to carry out a program of research and education at Columbia University. Using observations from ground- and space-based telescopes, Curtis will study the relationship between magnetic activity and rotation of stars and how this relationship changes with age. Because stars change very little over most of their lifetimes, determining their ages is challenging, but it is essential for understanding planets around other stars. Curtis will also  conduct an annual data science workshop in basic computing, statistical, and data analysis methods for the participants of a program that prepares underrepresented minority students for graduate school; and he will serve as research mentor to one student from this program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research will address stellar ages with a two-pronged observational program: (1) Curtis will analyze rotation data for 3 GYr stars down to 0.39 Solar masses from his ongoing survey of Ruprecht 147 with the Kepler space telescope, to calibrate gyrochronology relations at low mass at older ages. The Kepler survey also will yield asteroseismic measurements for dwarfs in this benchmark star cluster. Comparison of the red giant asteroseismic masses and FGK dwarf rotation sequences between the similarly aged NGC 6819 and R147 will demonstrate the precision and relative accuracy of each method; and (2) Curtis has initiated a large chromospheric activity survey of middle-aged star clusters with the Multi Mirror Telescope (MMT) to establish an activity-age relationship that is applicable to K dwarfs. As part of his education plan, Curtis will be integrated into Columbia University's Bridge to the Ph.D Program to (1) conduct an annual data science workshop series that will instruct Bridge Participants in basic computing, statistical methods, and data analysis with Python (materials from the workshop will be incorporated in a Data Science Primer for Astronomers); and (2) supervise one Bridge Participant's research, which will focus on measuring 3 GYr M dwarf rotation.</AbstractNarration>

This process forms a tightly correlated relationship between stellar mass and spin rate, and this convergence underlies the "gyrochronology" age-dating technique.

The best benchmarks are the Sun and star clusters. Dr. Curtis measured stellar rotation for 171 low-mass stars in the 1-billion-year-old cluster NGC 6811 with Kepler data (Curtis et al. 2019a) and for 34 stars in the 3-billion-year-old cluster Ruprecht 147 with K2 data (Curtis et al. 2020, submitted). Surprisingly, these data demonstrate that stars do not spin down continuously, but instead temporarily stall after converging on the slow sequence (this is illustrated in the figure included with this report).

(2019), they claimed an age of 1 billion years for the stream.
