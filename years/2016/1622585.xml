<AbstractNarration>This grant provides financial support for the workshop entitled "Recent Advances in Computational Methods for Nanoscale Phenomena" to be held on the campus of the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, Michigan, August 29-31, 2016. This workshop will bring together researchers from a variety of disciplines (including theoretical and computational mechanics, applied mathematics, materials science and physics) to discuss recent advances in computational methods to elucidate nanoscale mechanics, nanoscale transport and material behavior at the nanoscale, along with its influence on macroscopic material properties. The grant will support junior scientific participants to prepare the next generation of scientific leaders in this field. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Due to the small time and length scales involved, predicting mechanics and physics at the nanoscale is extremely challenging, particularly as relevant experiments are often not available. This workshop is a step towards developing reliable, efficient, accurate and predictive computational techniques across the relevant time and length scales. The development of such techniques will enable researchers not only to understand and predict the behavior of currently-available materials but also drive the development and creation of novel materials through bottom-up design strategies, aligning well with the Materials Genome Initiative and the grand challenge of materials by design. The workshop will consist of 36 oral presentations, poster presentations, and time for discussions and individual interactions.</AbstractNarration>
