<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be to trigger a major shift toward mobile content across the marketing industry - broadening the market and generating larger economic impact. Massive amounts of media dollars are poised to shift toward mobile video, but will not flow freely until ads can be delivered on the right content (engaging and safe) to the right people (targeted consumer segments) at the right time (when consumers are actively engaged). This SBIR Phase I project will radically advance the scientific and technological understanding needed for marketers to deliver ads this way, thereby enabling them to build their brands with sight, sound, and motion content delivered surgically through the most personal and engaging channel available - mobile. With the project facilitating this transition: 1) brands will be able to advertise more efficiently across TV and mobile media; 2) content producers, now able to extract fair market value for their efforts, will be motivated to create more and better content; and 3) audiences will benefit from improved content quality, selection and accessibility.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is designed to enable brands and agencies to quickly and efficiently extend TV media plans into the rapidly growing mobile video space. While marketers have sophisticated TV planning tools at their disposal, they currently lack the ability to integrate TV/mobile video advertising in a way that optimizes their audience engagement and media spend. The research objective of this SBIR Phase I project is to develop social media-based recommendation technology to help marketers plan mobile video ad campaigns that seamlessly integrate with their traditional TV campaigns. The proposed project will 1) validate the technical and commercial feasibility of this approach and 2) produce an alpha version of the technology. Anticipated technical results include: building and testing a video content discovery engine; validating and implementing a planning system; initiating UI testing and user studies.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   The NSF SBIR Phase I award supported research and development at Diesel Labs to build a machine learning-based recommender system for translating traditional TV advertising plans into integrated mobile video plans using data mined from social and video platforms. Over the past 15 months, the Diesel Labs team has addressed each of the research objectives outlined in the project proposal: Data Coverage: There is sufficient data to be mined from social and video platforms about video content to support the proposed application.  Data Sparsity: Data mined from social and video platforms can power the advanced algorithms used in our approach.  Recommendation Quality: The Diesel recommender system produces high-quality recommendations for video content. Recommendation Impact: Marquee pilot clients (including TV networks and media agencies) have provided initial confirmation that the results are valuable and are driving measureable impact. During Phase I supported research and development, Diesel Labs has validated the ability of our technology to generate market-ready, high-quality mobile video recommendations based on a traditional TV media plan. In addition, learnings from the data coverage / data sparsity phases of the work indicate that the recommendation system can work on broader inputs outside of a traditional TV media plan, such as a consumer lifestyles and brand engagers. This expansion enables the Diesel Labs platform to produce mobile video plans based on the custom needs of individual marketers, broadening the potential market impact that the innovation will have in the coming years.
