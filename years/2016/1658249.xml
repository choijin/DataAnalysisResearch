<AbstractNarration>Despite a renewed interest in addressing violence against women (VAW) in the United States and across the globe, questions about how to end VAW remain unanswered.  This research will compare alternative program models that seek to empower women; specifically, economic programs aimed at economic empowerment compared to programs that focus on leadership building to change the lives of community-based leaders and community women.  In doing so, the project looks at how grassroots women work against gender inequality through their everyday interventions against VAW.  Focusing on domestic violence, the project will advance our understanding of agency, independent decision-making, and awareness of one's own rights as tools that women use to fight against social conditions that produce gender inequality.  The project will contribute a nuanced theoretical and empirical understanding of how empowerment programs transform the lives of ordinary women into community actors who combat violence against women (VAW).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will analyze a diverse set of interviews collected from women using the life history calendar method that helps interviewees recall key events in their lives leading to their transformation and emergence as community leaders.  The respondents will also be asked about building agency in others, imparting agency to survivors, changing community attitudes towards women, and pushing boundaries of gendered norms over time. Specifically, the project will investigate how former participants from various empowerment programs take their leadership training back to their communities and help women survivors of domestic violence achieve justice. As not all participants are trained to intervene against domestic violence, the women often develop independent innovative strategies to navigate the complicated local patriarchal caste and religious structures that support such abuse.  The research will be conducted in Gujarat, a state in India where violence against women remains high, but it is also a region that has a reputation for pioneering women's organizations.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The aims of the project &ldquo;Building Agency, Resisting Patriarchy&rdquo; were to understand how women from grassroots communities, who are former participants of empowerment programs, transfer these lessons to towards improving the lives of others. While the goal of the empowerment programs may vary-economic or socio-cultural, the participants were trained in community leadership roles. The project focused on domestic violence intervention by the women leaders as an area where the impact of empowerment on ending gender inequality can be studied. The study involved 200 women participants and identified how these women assert their agency, make independent decisions, strategize against caste and religious norms that legitimize gender inequality, and fight against domestic violence in the community. Findings from the study helped PI develop a nuanced understanding of the meaning of empowerment and agency in the everyday lives of women, and how violence against women and global gender inequality can be stopped.</p> <p>The summary will first present findings on how the women leaders were able to help survivors of domestic violence and the impact of the empowerment training in their lives. A goal of these empowerment programs is to build leadership skills for a variety of purposes, including intervention against domestic violence, encouraging participation in trade unions, and developing semi-skilled workers&rsquo; collective bargaining skills. Findings suggest that although most survivors had displayed some agency in independently resisting violence, their efforts are effective when coupled with a support network and access to resources. With the intervention of leaders, the survivors were able to better negotiate for justice with a renewed sense of agency. For the leaders, participation in programs gave them an identity independent from their status within the family. They promoted change by developing independent innovative intervention strategies that worked despite the tight structural constraints of gendered norms.</p> <p>Findings also point out to how <em>structural change</em> (here structure represented through societal norms dictated by culture and/or religion) is possible through demonstration of what the PI calls <em>empowered agency</em> (as seen in women&rsquo;s decisions to make life livable by resisting norms). Agency refers to a choice and having agency does not imply empowerment. Women in patriarchal societies often make decisions in an effort to create tolerable conditions for themselves by managing the abuse. For example, women often silently tolerated abuse to protect their loved ones. However, these demonstrations of agency do not resist the patriarchal structure; rather they are an example of what has been described in the literature as <em>bargaining with patriarchy</em>, which maintains men&rsquo;s privileged status. Empowered agency takes place when women make conscious decisions to resist the structure by taking actions that push the normative boundaries in the institutions of family and marriage. Such actions have the potential to increase gender equality in the long run. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>For the former participants in empowerment programs, the study found that the new identity as a leader brought about noticeable changes in the lives of women, who were otherwise &ldquo;ordinary wives.&rdquo; From taking pride in their choice of clothing to being treated respectfully by family members and people in the community, these women discovered their public speaking skills before the police and magistrates. Findings thus demonstrate demonstrates how empowerment works in the lives of ordinary women. This is evident through leaders&rsquo; development of an independent identity, increased physical mobility, confidence in holding leadership positions, and direct confrontations with authorities. The effects on the leaders are especially highlighted in their innovative, self-directed intervention strategies and the unique status that many of them held in their communities.&nbsp;</p> <p>There was another important finding from the study, one that was not anticipated by the PI: the importance of sustained continuous funding for decades to support efforts to decrease gender inequality, and stop violence against women. Social and cultural changes require generations of support, as progress in these areas is slower compared to the achievement of economic goals. These programs are often dependent on donor funds, and the impact of empowerment is often not fully realized before funding runs out. There is a decrease in available funding for these programs, as donors often prioritize economic programs as they promise tangible results.</p> <p>The research was unique because it used comparative models of empowerment to study its impact.&nbsp; It also collected a large amount of qualitative data. Because of the unique features of the research, the project provided the opportunity to train several graduate students to carry qualitative research that draws on multiple theories and that is designed to be relevant to stopping gender inequality.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong><em>&nbsp;</em></p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 08/22/2019<br>      Modified by: Soma&nbsp;Chaudhuri</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1658249/1658249_10486496_1566326891425_NSFphoto--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1658249/1658249_10486496_1566326891425_NSFphoto--rgov-800width.jpg" title="A vegetable vendor"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1658249/1658249_10486496_1566326891425_NSFphoto--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="A vegetable vendor"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">An urban woman leader</div> <div class="imageCredit">Soma Chaudhuri</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Soma&nbsp;Chaudhuri</div> <div class="imageTitle">A vegetable vendor</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1658249/1658249_10486496_1566326950252_NSFphoto2--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1658249/1658249_10486496_1566326950252_NSFphoto2--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Rural women"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1658249/1658249_10486496_1566326950252_NSFphoto2--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Rural women"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Rural women leaders</div> <div class="imageCredit">Soma Chaudhuri</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Soma&nbsp;Chaudhuri</div> <div class="imageTitle">Rural women</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
