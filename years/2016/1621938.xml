<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to enhance the ability of forensic scientists to capture, analyze, and search fingerprint impression evidence in the field. Additionally, a contactless device will eliminate the potential for alteration, loss of detail, or destruction of the fingerprint impression. This system will also have a positive impact on law enforcement agencies by accelerating fingerprint recovery, improving the quality of fingerprint impression evidence collected at crime scenes, reducing training requirements, and accelerating investigations. Furthermore, this project will address numerous concerns and recommendations regarding fingerprints and forensics published in the National Research Council's (NRC) 2009 Report, Strengthening Forensic Science in the United States: A Path Forward.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a novel device capable of digitally acquiring the various types of fingerprint impressions found at crime scenes - latent, patent, and plastic. Fingerprints represent one of the most important and fragile types of evidence. However, manually processing crime scenes for fingerprint impressions requires trained technicians, a variety of supplies, and a significant amount of time. Once visualized and processed, fingerprint impressions must undergo a multitude of steps in order to be digitized for searching against databases of exemplar fingerprint records. The goal of Phase I is to determine the technical and commercial feasibility of utilizing a contactless, three-dimensional (3D) scanning device to acquire different types of fingerprint impressions deposited on a variety of surfaces and convert them into two-dimensional (2D) fingerprints that are consistent and compatible with existing fingerprint databases and matching algorithms. To achieve these goals, the research team will build a prototype 3D scanner, develop new unrolling and segmentation algorithms, and test the ability to match recovered fingerprints against a database of exemplar fingerprint records.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[The attempt to improve the quality of recovered fingerprint impressions from various surfaces is a continuous process.  Various methods for fingerprint impression processing and recovery have significantly advanced and are continuously progressing due to ongoing research, publications, and information sharing.  However, many of these methods require a significant amount of time, effort, manpower, and supplies.  Even with the advancement of techniques, the recovery of fingerprint impressions from difficult surfaces continues to be an arduous process, especially when dealing with various environmental factors, time constraints, lack of personnel, minimal training, and budget limitations. For forensic examiners in law enforcement, criminal justice agencies, and the military, recovering fingerprint impressions at crime scenes is often a manual, slow, and labor-intensive process.  The collection process has inherent challenges.  It can often introduce inaccuracies, alter or destroy the original sample, or simply be difficult to obtain due to nature the of the evidence, the surface on which it is deposited, or the environmental conditions. The development of a contactless, three dimensional (3D) fingerprint scanner capable of digitally capturing fingerprint impressions from various surfaces holds significant promise for streamlining the process of fingerprint impression capture in various forensic investigations and increasing the speed of identifications.  It could potentially revolutionize fingerprint impression processing and recovery by significantly decreasing the amount of steps involved in fingerprint development, preservation, and recording for future analysis and possible use in court as evidence.  It could significantly reduce the amount of resources&mdash;time, supplies, cost, and personnel&mdash;that it takes to process and record forensic-quality fingerprint impressions. The contactless, 3D fingerprint scanner could potentially assist with identifying suspects, persons of interest, missing persons, and human remains.  It would allow for immediate, real-time viewing and analysis of data on scene, as opposed to the laboratory.  Additionally, it would allow for the rapid collection of large numbers of fingerprint impressions for remote transmission, analysis, and storage.  It would improve and accelerate the transfer, sharing, and collaboration of evidence and analysis between the crime scene and the laboratory or between various agencies and examiners, regardless of location.  It would also eliminate the need for the removal, transportation, and cross-contamination of fingerprint records that may be potentially contaminated by chemical, biological or radiological agents and where, under such circumstances, traditional manual fingerprint processing techniques are not possible or appropriate.  It would eliminate the need for flatbed scanning and physical storage of manually acquired and potentially contaminated fingerprint evidence, as well as allow for improved preservation of evidence by digitizing data.  Finally, it would reduce the need for decontamination of devices since they will not be in physical contact with the target surface. The purpose of this project was to evaluate the potential for using a contactless, three-dimensional (3D) scanner for the capture of fingerprint impressions from various types of surfaces in order to facilitate rapid evidence collection and identification of unknown fingerprints.  During this project, the project team presented a contactless, 3D scanner which used a structured light imaging technique to acquire latent, plastic and patent fingerprints off of various types of surfaces.  The goals of the project were not necessarily to replace current fingerprint processing tools and techniques, but rather to enhance and accelerate the existing process of collection and the subsequent examination of various fingerprint impressions.  The project team was able to show that the 3D fingerprint data collected by the 3D scanner was backward compatible with existing two-dimensional (2D) legacy fingerprints by performing matching experiments with a commercially available fingerprint matching algorithm.  In addition to matching algorithms, the acquired fingerprints were able to be matched against a database of 2D fingerprints that were acquired using conventional fingerprint processing techniques used by forensic examiners.  Furthermore, experimental results demonstrated that fingerprints from the scanner compared favorably in terms of quality with fingerprints acquired using conventional crime scene photography techniques.  The results of this project found that when compared to the traditional fingerprint recovery technique of digital single lens reflex (DSLR) photography, the contactless 3D scanner technique had significant promise to yield similar high-quality fingerprints when capturing latent, patent, and plastic fingerprint impressions from various surfaces.  However, more research must be performed in order to perform a more accurate assessment of the contactless 3D scanner technique.  Potential future research should involve prototype systems with a smaller footprint and handheld design, software improvements to enhance unrolling and segmentation capabilities, and additional research into the use of custom fluorescent powders to improve system capabilities.
