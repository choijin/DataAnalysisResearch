<AbstractNarration>The Quality Education for Minorities (QEM) Network will conduct a proposal development workshop aimed at increasing the development and awareness of grantsmanship opportunities related to the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program at Minority Serving Institutions (MSIs). The workshop will include two-person faculty teams from 20 MSIs interested in developing a competitive Noyce proposal. Participants will also engage in a series of post-workshop individualized sessions that will provide additional proposal guidance. The QEM workshop and post-workshop interactions will provide participants feedback on their required project summaries to assist them in developing their ideas into competitive Noyce proposals. MSIs are uniquely qualified to address the issue of recruiting, retaining, and developing STEM teachers for high-need schools. As such, the project's workshops will help develop stronger MSIs, in general, and teacher preparation programs, specifically, to meet the nation's needs for a more productive science and technology workforce.</AbstractNarration>
