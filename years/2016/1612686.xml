<AbstractNarration>Researchers at Georgia Tech and staff at the Center for Puppetry Arts in Atlanta will address the following problem: The growth of computing calls for increased teaching of basic hardware skills, but engaging students beyond those who are already interested in STEM fields is difficult. Emphasizing cultural context through personal expression has shown to attract new audiences such as women and minorities; however, balancing accessibility and educational effectiveness remains problematic. Current educational tools often use "black boxing" to simplify access, to protect the underlying functionality, and/or to stay commercially competitive.  Innovations are needed where the basic skills of design and making, along with new educational models, can support students' exploration of everyday electronics and critical thinking.  The team will test an after-school model that could be applied in cultural institutions and other venues that would provide students in 4 - 8 grades with multiple computer/electronics-driven puppet design and building workshops.  These workshops will provide opportunities for basic hardware and electronics prototyping, personal cultural expression, and performance.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The exploratory research and development method involves three steps: the students develop a story-line (narrative) that will incorporate puppets; they learn and apply basic electronics and mechanical crafts to design, build and test their puppets; and they perform their shows to other participants and their families.  Over the course of the project, there will be five workshops: two pilot tests (to test feasibility and design), one mid-project evaluation workshop (to evaluate and re-iterate), and two final workshops conducted by educators, where the research team only observes (to test for transferability). Data collection throughout this development cycle will include video and sound recording, still photography, field notes, pre- and post-questionnaires, and the production of puppet "artifacts" during the workshops.  In addition to the data collected in the workshops, the project will produce design documents and educational guidelines, as well as other media (such as instructional video clips), which will be disseminated to educators and researchers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work is funded by the Advancing Informal STEM Learning (AISL) program, which seeks to advance new approaches to, and evidence-based understanding of, the design and development of STEM learning in informal environments.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The project followed an interdisciplinary approach to combine approaches from performance, craft practices, and basic prototyping. The goal was to counter the practice of "black boxing" technology in STEM education by hiding basic functionality in pre-fabricated components and to engage diverse students, including those who do not self-identify as interested in STEM topics. The target audience were students in informal settings but on the level of late elementary school students. To achieve this, we created designs that supported making as well as artistic practices to teach basic prototyping skills, built an educational framework to teach them, and evaluated the results.   In collaboration with the Center for Puppetry Arts, Atlanta, we developed a workshop design to teach students how to build puppets that include simple circuits and perform with them. They serve as the educational frame for a STEM learning approach that puts equal emphasis on crafting/ making, performing/ self-expression, and technical implementation. Each workshop includes  - a technical introduction, in which students learn how to incorporate basic circuits into simple hand puppets based on the designs developed for this project;  - a story building phase, in which students develop shared stories;   - a puppet making phase, in which students build the puppets, props, and stage components needed for their shared story and apply the designs taught in the first phase;  - a rehearsal and performance phase, in which students use their puppets to act out their story, validating the technical achievement as well as the performative design.  The sample puppet designs focused on the crafting of simple functional puppets with integrated basic circuitry to teach students fundamental components of electronics and prototyping modeled after the NGSS as well as Georgia Learning Standards. We designed and tested multiple puppet designs, designed and tested the educational framing of the workshops, developed documentation for teachers and students, and tested this material in teacher-led final workshops.  The project evaluated its designs on multiple levels throughout: from the assessment of the original puppet designs by expert puppeteers and educators to the final evaluation of the complete workshops as taught by educators in afterschool settings. Dissemination of the results happened in formal publications and presentations, but also during multiple student and teacher workshops throughout the project?s duration. All educational materials and instructions were made available on the project web site.   The results support a high engagement of students across different interest fields. Both, artistically inclined and more technology-inclined student groups reported high engagement and did collaborate well. Likewise, feedback from educators was positive regarding the design as well as the documentation.   Two effects observed during the evaluation that invite future work were the high levels of ownership that students developed toward their puppets and the opportunity for peer tutoring. We adjusted our designs to support both but see more opportunity for future research here.  The project did not target a product release but has attracted adaptation by educators through its web site and public workshops. It has been adapted for STEM activities in informal as well as formal learning events, from public STEM days at schools, to museum workshops, to workshops for underserved student populations.
