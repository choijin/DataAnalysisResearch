<AbstractNarration>1644884&lt;br/&gt;Jacobs&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Colorado River has often been called the lifeblood of the Southwestern United States. The river provides a partial water supply for nearly 40 million people in the seven Basin States and Mexico. It is a source of irrigation water for 5.5 million acres, and its dams generate hydroelectric power that supports the economy of the Southwest. One study estimated that the river is responsible for $1.4 trillion/year of economic activity. Yet the Colorado is imperiled by a range of stresses, including increasing demand, over allocation of water rights, and climate variability. The water levels in its major reservoirs are now at an all-time low since the time they were first filled. The combined loss of surface and groundwater reserves creates great uncertainty and risk for water managers and users. This workshop will be held in Tucson, AX, Jan-May 2017.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Largely due to this looming management crisis, the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, in conjunction with the 7 Colorado River Basin states, completed a detailed review of basin conditions in 2012. The Colorado River Basin Water Supply and Demand Study, showed persistent shortages, through the duration of the study period to 2060, of up to almost 7 million acre-feet (MAF)/year. Despite the heroic efforts of the participants in this important study, a number of shortcomings have been identified by experts, including the need to consider: (1) the full range of plausible future flow reductions; (2) groundwater impacts; (3) flood management; (4) accuracy/relevance of water demand forecasts; (5) ecological impacts; (6) water quality; and, (7) climate vulnerability across coupled human-environmental systems. The scientific challenges at the intersection of hydrology, ecology, and human-environmental systems are daunting. One of the primary reasons that the original Basin Study did not address all of the critical topics listed above is because of the complexity of the scientific issues and the stakeholder-driven context within which it was conducted. The approach to this workshop focuses exclusively on identifying where existing knowledge can support better management of the river, and where additional scientific investments are required. Improving the scientific basis for managing a river that supports 40 million people is critical to a healthy economy in the Southwestern US and Mexico. The management challenges that are currently faced by the Bureau of Reclamation and other resource management agencies in the context of rapid growth and climate variability are unprecedented. It is imperative that the best scientific and engineering be brought together to understand how science can support solutions that provide a sustainable supply of water to ecosystems and to people, taking the full range of risks and opportunities into account rather than narrowing the topics to those that are politically palatable. This workshop will be the scientific foundation for further conversations that include all of the affected decision-makers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  Colorado River: Building a Science Agenda  University of Arizona, Tucson  October 10-12, 2017  Section I  Executive Summary  The Colorado River has often been called the lifeblood of the Southwestern United States. The river provides a partial water supply for nearly 40 million people in the seven Basin States and Mexico. It is a highly managed system that has been transformed by engineering and increasingly through climate change. With storage levels in its two largest reservoirs, Lakes Mead and Powell, at levels that threaten to trigger shortages in the Lower Basin, and recurring droughts in tributaries throughout the Upper Basin and in the Southwest, sustainability of resources &ndash; hydrological, ecological, and environmental &ndash; is threatened.   A workshop, "Colorado River: Building a Science Agenda," was held at the University of Arizona October 10-12 2017. The purpose was to gather leading physical and social scientists from multiple disciplines whose work touches on various aspects of the Colorado River in order to assess the state of scientific knowledge in several issue areas that had not been fully addressed previously, and identify the future research necessary to close the most salient and decision-relevant gaps in scientific knowledge.  The workshop was designed to encourage a truly interdisciplinary conversation to inform the development of a science agenda that is much broader and more comprehensive than those of previous studies, especially at the intersection of social and physical science issues. The evolution of basin-wide research is described in Section II.   The overall objective was to evaluate the river from a systems perspective that acknowledges the interconnected nature of resources and processes throughout the physical basin and service area.  Participants engaged in a series of panel discussions, plenary sessions, and small group breakout sessions and identified where existing knowledge could support better management of the river, and where additional scientific investments are required. Content of these sessions is summarized in Section III.     In breakout sessions on the final day of the workshop, participants distilled a list of topics that had emerged over the previous two days into four overarching themes for further research:  Building an Integrated Approach to Basic Science Research in the Colorado Basin  Anticipating Future Colorado River Challenges: Science of Crises and Tipping Points Holistic Management of Integrated Systems at Landscape Scales  Creating Adaptive, Resilient and Just Institutions   These themes had significant support within the group of workshop participants as a whole, and are elucidated in the Conclusions section of this report, Section IV, where priority topics within each theme are also identified.               Section II  Workshop Background  The Colorado River provides a partial water supply for nearly 40 million people in the seven Basin States and Mexico.  It is a source of irrigation water for 5.5 million acres, and its dams generate hydroelectric power that supports the economy of the Southwest.  The river, and the basin it drains, is also a tremendous environmental and cultural asset, featuring seven National Wildlife Refuges, four National Recreation Areas, and eleven National Parks.  One study estimated that the river is responsible for $1.4 trillion/year of economic activity (James et al., 2014). Yet the Colorado is imperiled by a range of stresses, including increasing demand, over-allocation of water rights, and climate change.  The water levels in its major reservoirs are now at an all-time low since the time they were first filled. The combined loss of surface and groundwater reserves creates great uncertainty and risk for water managers and users.     Largely due to the potential for a management crisis, and consistent with the SECURE Water Act, the U.S. Department of the Interior?s Bureau of Reclamation, in conjunction with the seven Colorado River Basin states, completed a detailed review of basin conditions in 2012.  The Colorado River Basin Water Supply and Demand Study (hereafter "Basin Study") showed persistent shortages in 2060 of millions of acre-feet per year.  Our workshop, entitled "Colorado River: Building a Science Agenda," acknowledges this report and builds upon that outstanding effort and its follow-on activities.  We seek to identify priority areas for interdisciplinary science research in the Colorado Basin and to form a strategic research agenda supporting integrated management of water and a wide range of water-related issues throughout the Basin.    Participants were urged to consider the state of knowledge in a variety of areas and identify science priorities for filling knowledge gaps.  This required addressing many topics that go beyond what was addressed in the Basin Study, including the full range of plausible future flow reductions, groundwater impacts, flood management, ecological impacts, water quality, potential changes to governance processes, and climate change vulnerability across coupled human-environmental systems.
