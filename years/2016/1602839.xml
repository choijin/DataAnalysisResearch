<AbstractNarration>SES-1602839&lt;br/&gt;Carla Goar&lt;br/&gt;Bobbie Reidinger&lt;br/&gt;Kent State University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research examines the impact of body weight in task-oriented groups by testing whether weight behaves as a status characteristic; specifically, whether it serves as a differentiating characteristic that becomes activated, organizes performance expectations, and impacts task behaviors.  Using a standard experimental setting, the impact of weight on social processes is measured through an examination of influence.  In these experiments, differently weighted participants will work with their partner, dependent on the experimental condition, to complete two tasks. After considering their partner?s responses, each participant will submit a final group report in addition to their individual answers.  How often a participant accepts or rejects their partner?s answers allows for a measure of influence. It is hypothesized that the weight of the partner will directly impact measures of influence regardless of the weight of the participant.  &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The emerging field of fat studies suggests that fatness has negative social implications within American society which transcend racial, gender, and class categories; however, weight has not been explored as a status characteristic in the sociological social psychological literature. An examination of weight as a diffuse status characteristic will expand the sociological social psychological literature, specifically expectation states and status characteristic theories, as well as the emerging field of fat studies.  Greater theoretical understanding will enhance research on weight-based discrimination and group interactions. As reliance on groups grows, increased understanding of characteristics which influence group interactions is necessary. Results from the proposed study may lead to the creation and implementation of social interventions to reduce weight-based discrimination within diverse groups.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Research has shown that inequality is recursively reproduced through social interaction (see: Entwisle and Webster 1974; Ridgeway 1991; Goar and Sell 2005). Despite this large body of work, there is room for theoretical expansion to better explain the impact of weight on interaction. U.S. culture is focused on fatness which manifests itself through social welfare campaigns such as Michelle Obama?s Let?s Move!, the NFL?s Play 60, public health promotions such as the Center for Disease Control?s ongoing press releases regarding the "obesity epidemic," and cultural productions such as HBO?s Weight of the Nation and NBC?s The Biggest Loser. This focus on weight simultaneously creates and reinforces negative stereotypes about fat individuals including a lack self-control, laziness, and disability (Ernsberger 2009; Vartanian and Silverstein 2013). Despite examination of status and social interaction, status characteristics and expectation states theories provide no discussion of weight as a distinct status characteristic. Preliminary data by Vartanian and Silverstein (2013) demonstrate that despite other status cues, such as gender and occupation, individuals of higher weight are considered to be lower status.     This project uses experimental methods to examine the impact of weight on social interactions. In order to examine weight as a distinct diffuse status characteristic, it is necessary to control for beauty. Webster and Driskell (1983) found that individuals who possess beauty are evaluated more positively than non-beautiful people, regardless of other characteristics.  However, it is argued here that the social framing of weight, simultaneously as a disease and a result of personal failure, it not the same as the social framing of beauty.  Therefore, it is necessary to examine weight as a distinct characteristic within social interactions.  By using experimental methods, one is able to separate beauty and weight through experimental controls.      As the experiment utilized a photograph to represent a subject?s partner, an image that is neither beautiful nor non-beautiful was required.  This photograph was obtained through a series of photograph rankings. The ranking iterations determined if an assessment regarding weight influenced evaluations of beauty and general ability.  This is essential to demonstrate whether the thin and fat women in the photographs can be matched based on attractiveness therefore exercising control within the experimental setting.  This control allows for the explicit examination of weight within interactions.  Based on photographic rankings, photographs were selected of one thin woman and one fat woman which had equivalent attractiveness scores.      Following these rankings, differently weighted subjects were recruited for the experimental portion of the project and randomly assigned to one of three conditions: thin, fat, or control.  The subjects are informed that interactions will occur using photographs of themselves and their partner. Participants then complete two tasks independently and after being presented with task responses from a partner, are responsible for considering their partner?s responses and submitting a final group response.  The difference between their individual and group reports demonstrate the level of influence given to partner responses.  Results indicate that when interacting with a fat partner, subjects are less likely to alter their responses when compared to interactions with a thin partner.     The study is an empirical test of weight within the theoretical frame of status characteristics theory.  An examination of weight as a diffuse status characteristic expands the sociological social psychological literature, specifically expectation states and status characteristic theories, and the emerging sociological field of fat studies.  Greater theoretical understanding will enhance research on weight-based discrimination and group interactions. Results from the proposed study may lead to the creation and implementation of social interventions to reduce weight-based discrimination.  Additionally, various disciplines, such as communications and psychology, draw upon status characteristics research to help explain various issues within in their fields by collapsing weight and beauty into one category.  As this project has demonstrated the need to separate weight and focus on it as a distinct classification of discrimination, other disciplines may be motivated to examine their own work by making similar distinctions. Lastly, the rise in body positivity and fat acceptance movements continues to grow within American culture.  Despite its growth, many heavily weighted individuals still experience negative side effects from weight-based discrimination.  By empirically demonstrating that weight-based discrimination impacts power and opportunity for group involvement, these findings lend further support to the social movements aimed at eliminating weight-based discrimination.
