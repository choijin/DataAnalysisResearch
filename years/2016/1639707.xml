<AbstractNarration>The study of hazards and renewable energy are paramount for the development and sustainability of society. Similarly, the emergence of new climatic patterns pose new challenges for future societal planning.  Geospatial data are being generated at unprecedented rate exceeding our analysis capabilities and leading towards a data-rich but knowledge-poor environment.  The use of advanced computing tools and techniques are playing an increasingly important role in contributing to solutions to problems of societal importance. This project will create specialized computational tools that will enhance the ability of scientists to effectively and efficiently study natural hazards and renewable energy. The use of these tools will support novel methods and the use of powerful computing resources in ways that are not currently possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many scientific applications in the geosciences are increasingly reliant on "ensemble-based" methods to make scientific progress.  This is true for applications that are both net producers of data, as well as aggregate consumers of data.   In response to the growing importance and pervasiveness of ensemble-based applications and analysis, and to address the challenges of scale, simplicity and flexibility, the research team will develop the Ensemble Toolkit for Earth Sciences.  The Ensemble Toolkit will provide an important addition to the set of capabilities and tools that will enable the geosciences community to use high-performance computing resources more efficiently, effectively and in an extensible fashion. This project represents the co-design of Ensemble Toolkit for Earth Sciences and is a collective effort of an interdisciplinary team of cyberinfrastructure and domain scientists. It will also support the integration of the Ensemble Toolkit with a range of science applications, as well as its use in solving scientific problems of significant societal impact that are currently unable to utilize the collective capacity of supercomputers, campus clusters and clouds</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  Many scientific problems require multiple distinct computational tasks to be executed in order to achieve a desired solution. The primary objective of this project is the co-design and development of the  Ensemble-Toolkit (EnTK) for Earth Sciences, so as to advance a range of scientific problems that require the scalable execution of ensemble-based applications.  EnTK was designed to address the challenges of scale, diversity, and reliability that many ensembles at scale require.    This project: (i) analyzed and iteratively, improved multiple possible design and implementation choice of EnTK; (ii) characterized its performance and integrated it with two distinct exemplar use cases: seismic inversion and adaptive analog ensembles.  This led to an understanding of EnTK overheads, strong and weak scalability, and the performance of two use case implementations, at scale and on production infrastructures.    We applied these engineering advances in EnTK to the following specification: (i) implementing dedicated abstractions to support the description and execution of ensemble applications; (ii) support for execution on heterogeneous computing infrastructures; (iii) efficient scalability up to ten-thousand tasks; and (iv) fault tolerance.  This project enabled EnTK to be classified as an important addition to the suite of tools in support of production scientific computing.   Analog Ensemble (AnEn) has been shown [1] to be a highly scalable solution as an ensemble forecasting technique. The fact that it searches for historical weather analogs independently at each model simulation grid enables its efficient parallelization. AnEn is able to handle the increasing resolutions in recent Numerical Weather Prediction models (NWP) and to generate forecasts with high spatial and temporal resolution due to its effectiveness in computation.   During this project, an efficient implementation of the AnEn technique [2] has been developed with OpenMPI/OpenMP and EnTK on Cheyenne.
