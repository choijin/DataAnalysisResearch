<AbstractNarration>The Chemical Synthesis Program of the Division of Chemistry supports Prof. Peter T. Wolczanski, Chemistry Department, Cornell University, for research into imparting properties associated 2nd transition elements to 1st transition series elements. Many important commercial applications of transition metals use expensive, heavier elements that often pose significant health risks. This proposal seeks replacement compounds that contain earth abundant, less toxic, base- metals, hence first row transition metal complexes are the general focus. A significant product of this research is the human element; the generation of independent, versatile PhDs capable of adapting to a challenging market, which encompasses academic, industrial, government, and entrepreneurial occupations. The work will be disseminated through the scientific literature, in professional meetings, in the patent literature should the situation arise, and via other appropriate public forums. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Iron is targeted specifically for utilization in olefin metathesis, and "redox non-innocent" (RNI) organic ligands are also featured, due to their ability to enhance chemical reactivity by giving or taking electrons from the metal. Special emphasis is given to compounds and transformations that pertain to future catalytic and environmentally friendly applications. A fundamental understanding of ionic vs. covalent character is naturally addressed via the studies of RNI, and comparisons of transition metal reactivity. The scientific product of the research is the expansion of general knowledge regarding first row transition metal electronic structure, and concomitant reactivity. A desktop methodology for determining chemical stability, which provides insight into differences between first row transition metals and their heavier congeners, is under development, thus providing an additional pedagogical product.</AbstractNarration>

A tutorial featuring 12+ years of NSF sponsored work in addressing the activation of carbon-hydrogen bonds via the 1,2-RH-addition to high oxidation state, early metal YnM=NR complexes was published in Organometallics. A final publication on tungsten imido chemistry featured anionic derivatives prepared via the reaction of alkyllithiums and (tBu3SiN=)2(tBu3SiNH)WH.       2. Fe(IV) Imide Dialkyl Insertion. A number of Fe(II) dialkyls LnFeR2 (Ln = tmeda, R = neoPe, 1; Ln = Me2IPr, R =  neoPe, 2a, 1-nor, 2b) were prepared for attempts to generate Fe(IV)=Y, with the rationale that three coordination was favorable for conversion to a pseudo-Td species. Exposure of Fe(II) dialkyls 2a,b to adamantyl azide (AdN3) afforded a transiently stable imidos, (Me2IPr)Fe=NAd(R)2 (R = 3a, b).

Masked Fe Alkylidenes. The concept of masking an iron alkylidenewas tested via the synthesis of several (PNP)FeXY species, where the N of the PNP ligand can be used to "trap" a CR2 fragment as a zwitterion. Attempts to install the CR2 functionality failed, and comments regarding difficulties in preparing an Fe(IV) alkylidene were expressed.       4. Metrics of dadi2- and dadi4-, and Cyclopropanation. Dadi, a diamide/diimine ligand capable of at least five redox states, was evaluated via titanium chemistry. Adducts [(dadi)TiX/L]n (n = -1 (6-XM), X = Me, neoPe, Vy, C2Ph, H/D, N3, OiPr, Cl; n = 0 (6-L), L = THF, N2CPh2) were prepared and  metric data were consistent with a tetraamide, whereas data  obtained from (dadi)Ti=NAd (7=NAd), and (dadi)Ti=O (7=O) defined the chelate dianionic form (dadi2-). A low lying NCCN pi*-orbital is occupied by 2e- in the former and empty in the latter. When THF adduct (dadi)Ti(THF) (6-THF) was treated with PhHCN2, cyclopropanation of the dadi backbone occurred, and calculations suggest that many "carbene transfers" are likely to be Lewis acid activations of diazoalkanes.       5. Oxidative Addition at (dadi)4-. Depending on its redox state, (dadi)n can function as an ene-amide (n = 4-), a radical (n =3-) or a diimine (n = 2-). Treatment of 6-THF with RX (R = Me, Bn; X = Cl, Br) afforded alkylations at dadi akin to SN2 processes, like textbook RX additions to d8 Ir(I). Radical processes were eliminated when radical clocks, such as cPrCH2Br, failed to rearrange.Oxidations at the metal incurred rearranged products as the (dadi)2- was subject to internal Nu: attack. When imido (dadi)Ti=NAd (7=NAd) was treated with PhMe2PO, it rearranged to benzdiamide (bida)Ti=NAd-(OPMe2Ph) (14=NAd(OP)).
