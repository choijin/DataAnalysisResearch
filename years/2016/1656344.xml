<AbstractNarration>This EAGER project will compare  gene expression patterns in the planktonic communities under ice covers that form in coastal embayment's in the Antarctic Peninsula.  Previous efforts taking advantage of unique ice conditions in November and December of 2015 allowed researchers to conduct an experiment to examine the role of sea ice cover on microbial carbon and energy transfer during the winter-spring transition. The EAGER effort will enable the researchers to conduct the "omics" analyses of the phytoplankton to determine predominant means by which energy is acquired and used in these settings.   This EAGER effort will apply new expertise to fill an existing gap in ecological observations along the West Antarctic Peninsula. The principle product of the proposed work will be a novel dataset to be analyzed and by an early career researcher from an underserved community (veteran).   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The critical baseline data contained in this dataset enable a comparison of eukaryotic and prokaryotic gene expression patterns to establish the relative importance of chemoautotrophy, heterotrophy, mixotrophy, and phototrophy during the experiments.  this information and data will be made immediately available to the broader scientific community, and will enable the development of further hypotheses on ecosystem change as sea ice cover changes in the region. Very little gene expression data is currently available for the Antarctic marine environment, and no gene expression data is available during the ecologically critical winter to spring transition.  Moreover, ice cover in bays is common along the West Antarctic Peninsula yet the opportunity to study cryptophyte phytoplankton physiology beneath such ice conditions in coastal embayments is rare.</AbstractNarration>

We identified gene expression (metatranscriptome) patterns between treatments with a novel, publicly available bioinformatics pipeline (https://github.com/bowmanjeffs/paprica).  The 76 metatranscriptomes (publicly available through the NCBI SRA as BioProject PRJNA494856) represent an exceptionally detailed look at the physiology and biochemistry of the marine microbial community during this critical winter-spring seasonal transition.  Our results suggest that a mixed diatom assemblage responds quickly when light becomes available.  Specific physiological responses &ndash; as interpreted through gene expression patterns &ndash; varied between different diatoms, however, some consistent responses were observed.  These included the upregulation of gene coding for enzymes involved in lipid catabolism, which we interpret as an indication that lipid stores are rapidly utilized in response to light.  This may provide the cells with the energy and material required to "retool" for photosynthetic growth and initiate cell division.  Marine phytoplankton are attractive model photosynthetic eukaryotes due to their rapid growth rates and clonal nature.  The development of a systems-level understanding of phytoplankton physiology is, however, in its infancy, and we anticipate that this comprehensive gene expression dataset will facilitate a wealth of follow-on studies with further implications for ecological modeling and the biofuels industry.
