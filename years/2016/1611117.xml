<AbstractNarration>This award will provide support for the PACIFIC 2016 Symposium. The name PACIFIC, "Particle Astrophysics and Cosmology Including Fundamental InteraCtions" reflects the scope of the conference, which will target the rapidly developing field at the interface of particle physics, astrophysics, and cosmology and on their ramifications for understanding fundamental interactions. Thanks to the ample new data and a plethora of theoretical ideas, the field of astro-particle physics has become the source of excitement and discoveries. There will be sessions devoted to Astroparticle experiment/observations, Particle Theory, High-energy Astrophysics (theory and observations) and Cosmology.  The symposium will bringing together researchers from the United States, Asia, Australia, South America, and Europe.  It will be held September 14-20, 2016 at the University of California Richard B. Gump South Pacific Research Station, located on the island of Moorea in French Polynesia. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The symposium has a particular focus on early career scientists and graduate students, as it will provide participant travel support for them to be able to participate in the symposium. There will also be a continuing dialogue with the local residents about science.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   The symposium Particle Astrophyiscs and Cosmology Including Fundamental Interactions (PACIFIC-2016) was hosted by the University of California Richard B. Gump Research Station, which made its facilities and housing available to the conference participants at favorable rates. The venue location, which is central for Pacific ocean region, is convenient for travel and can be reached by direct flights from Los Angeles, Tokyo, Sydney, etc., helping ensure a broad international participation.     Astroparticle physics is an exciting discipline at the boundaries of elementary particle physics, astrophysics and cosmology.  The abundance of new astrophysical data and new ideas about the fundamental properties of our universe make this a very exciting field.   The symposium has brought together experimentalists and theorists working in a variety of areas of astroparticle physics, cosmology, and particle physics.  The conference series, organized annually starting in 2011, has produced a number of breakthroughs in the past, and the researchers have cited the PACIFIC conference as the origin of new ideas and new collaborations.       The PACIFIC 2016 conference program included invited presentations, which were accompanied by lively discussions.   The invited speakers included both senior and junior researchers from a broad international community of astroparticle physicists.   The conference website archives a collection of presentations, which proves useful for both the participants and the community at large.
