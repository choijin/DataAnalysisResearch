<AbstractNarration>This project lies at the interface of geometric measure theory and partial differential equations, and it will utilize techniques from harmonic analysis. In geometric measure theory, one studies geometric properties of sets via the behavior of some measure on them (the concept of "measure" generalizes the notions of length, area, and volume). In this project, the sort of set under consideration is typically the boundary (i.e., the enclosing perimeter) of some region in space, and for this a specific measure -- namely, "harmonic measure"-- plays a central role.  Harmonic measure and its generalizations may be used to construct solutions in some region, with prescribed boundary values, to partial differential equations of so-called "elliptic" type.  Such equations govern various steady-state phenomena in the real world, including electrostatics and steady-state temperature distributions.   For example, harmonic measure may be used to determine the steady-state temperature distribution within some region, given a known temperature distribution on the perimeter of the region. Unsurprisingly, the geometry of the region and its boundary greatly affect one's ability to carry out such a program in practice.  A principal goal of this project is to quantify, in a natural sense, the connection between geometry and the behavior of harmonic measure and its generalizations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project has two main areas of focus. First, the principal investigator plans to find an intrinsically geometric characterization of quantitative absolute continuity of harmonic measure with respect to surface measure, on the boundary of an open set in d-dimensional Euclidean space.   He expects that such a characterization should comprise two parts: a quantitative rectifiablity property of the boundary, plus scale invariant nontangential accessibility to ample portions of the boundary.   Related to this work, the principal investigator also plans to investigate the analogous question concerning quantitative absolute continuity of elliptic-harmonic measure associated to a more general second-order elliptic operator.  Second, the principal investigator will study the solvability of other boundary value problems for elliptic equations, in several different settings.  More precisely, he intends to work toward an improved understanding of the Neumann problem in domains more general than Lipschitz domains and for nonsymmetric divergence form operators. As a first step, he plans to consider a certain family of transmission problems, for which the Neumann problem is an endpoint case. He also plans to treat boundary-value problems for certain higher-order divergence-form elliptic operators.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    The primary goal of this project was to better understand the relationship between certain phenomena of a "steady-state" nature, and the geometry of the region in space (the "domain") in which those phenomena occur.   For the sake of clarifying the exposition, let us focus on steady-state heat conduction as a model case. In this context, a typical problem is to deter- mine the temperature at all points inside the domain, given that one knows the temperature at all (or at least "most") points on the perimeter (aka the "boundary") of the domain. As a practical matter, except in very special domains (e.g., in the shape of a rectangular slab, or of a ball), one cannot expect to do this via a precise formula: rather, one would hope to show that in some appropriate metric, the interior temperatures are bounded quantitatively by the boundary temperatures, and that the former converge to the latter along appropriate paths to the boundary. If one can indeed carry out such a program, one is said to have "solved the Dirichlet problem".   A fundamental question is: for which domains can the Dirichlet problem be solved? It is intuitively clear that the answer depends upon the geometry of the domain (and of its boundary): heat will conduct more readily from a portion of the boundary (let us call this portion "A" for convenience of reference) to a point P in the interior of the domain (or vice versa), if the point P is connected to the boundary portion A in an unobstructed way; if on the other hand, the boundary twists around in such a way that some other part of the boundary (call it B) lies between A and the point P, then B will trap heat, blocking its conduction between A and P.   In the case that the boundary temperatures vary in a continuous manner, there is a classical necessary and sufficient criterion that characterizes the domains for which the Dirichlet problem is solvable. This result, while deep and important, had left open the analogous question in the case that the boundary data is allowed to be singular, i.e., to have infinite temperature spikes at some small enough set of boundary points (this entails using metrics which may remain finite even when the temperature becomes infinite at some points). Of course, in a real world heat conduction problem, infinite temperature spikes do not actually occur. Nonetheless, for quantitative purposes, it is desirable to allow such singularities mathematically, as this enables sharper quantitative bounds that do not depend on the magnitude of any particular large finite spike.   The most important result of this project is precisely such a geometric characterization of the domains for which the Dirchlet problem is solvable, with singular boundary data.      In addition, during the course of the project, the PI has supervised 5 Ph.D. students, 3 of whom are currently enrolled, and 2 of whom have now graduated.
