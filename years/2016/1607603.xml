<AbstractNarration>The four fundamental forces of the physical universe are gravitational, electromagnetic, weak (responsible for radioactive decay of particles), and strong (the binding force that holds the nuclei of atoms together). A great deal about these forces has been learned over the years, and a theoretical model that unifies and summarizes our understanding of three of these forces (electromagnetic, weak, and strong), known as the Standard Model, has been extremely precise in many of its predictions. There still persist, however, several very important open questions that cannot be explained within the Standard Model, or which fall outside the energy range in which the Standard Model is expected to be valid (such as conditions that existed during the very early stages of the universe). One of these is the existence and properties of dark matter: matter within our universe that we know exists (because of the slowing expansion of the universe), but which does not interact with regular matter in the universe through any means that we have been able to detect. Another is the possible existence of particles that are so massive that they have not yet been generated or observed at the large high-energy particle accelerators (such as the Large Hadron Collider in Switzerland).  Yet a third area in which to search for physics beyond the Standard Model is to look for the indirect influence of the proposed extensions on extremely precise measurements of weak optical transitions in atoms.  This is the focus of this research effort, which can help guide the answers to these fundamental questions about the universe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The principal investigator and his team will carry out new, higher-precision measurements of weak-force-induced transition amplitudes in atomic cesium. This atom was the focus of prior measurements by the group of Carl Wieman in Boulder in the 1990's, and these measurements of the parity violating amplitude are still the most precise reported for any element.  There exists, however, a need to carry out atomic parity violation measurements at an even higher precision.  Such a measurement will allow a more precise determination of the weak charge of the nucleus, and from that, an improved determination of the electroweak mixing angle at low momentum transfer.  The energy dependence (or "running", as it is called) of this mixing angle, as measured through scattering measurements at various energies, places important constraints on conjectured massive bosons in theories that extend the standard model.  These measurements also guide searches for dark matter candidates.  Atomic parity violation measurements can also be used to determine the anapole moment of the atomic nucleus.  This moment, resulting from weak interactions within the nucleus, provides the leading contribution to the nuclear spin dependence of the parity violating amplitude.  To date, the Boulder group's measurement of the anapole moment of cesium is the only successful measurement in any element.  Since this result is about twice as large as expected, and its magnitude is still not understood, there is a need for a new measurement to either verify or refute its magnitude.  The goal of the present project is to return to cesium for a set of new, high-precision measurements that will address these goals. The principal investigator will apply a two-pathway coherent control technique to these measurements.  One set of measurements are centered on the 6s - 7s transition, visited previously by Wieman, while a second set will examine similar effects in the ground state transition between hyperfine components.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Atomic parity violation (APV) measurements employ precision laser techniques that have been developed for measuring laser-atom interactions to study the weak force interaction between nucleons and electrons in atoms.  These measurements can provide important tests of the standard model, a physical model of elementary particles that unifies our understanding of electromagnetic, weak, and strong forces.  As successful as the standard model has been, there are critical observations that the standard model cannot explain, such as the existence of dark matter and dark energy, and the imbalance in our universe between matter and anti-matter.  Any small departure between the results of precision APV measurements and the standard model predictions can help shed light on possible ?beyond standard model? physics.  The weak force interaction, which is responsible for such processes as beta decay (the decay of a neutron into a proton and an electron), is very weak, and its influence in atoms is extremely small.  Under the right conditions, however, it can be measured precisely, in large part because the weak force obeys different parity rules than those obeyed by electric and magnetic interactions. The effect of this is that optical transitions between atomic states that would be strictly forbidden in the absence of the weak force are weakly allowed, and measurement of the strengths for these weak transitions allows us to determine the strength of the weak force between electrons and nucleons.  In the technique that we are developing to measure the weak charge QW, a parameter that describes the strength of the weak force, we apply the principles of coherent control.  Similar to all past and on-going measurements of QW, coherent control takes advantage of an interference between the amplitudes for different types of optical interactions.  When the interaction amplitudes add in phase with one another, the excitation rate is slightly enhanced, but when they are out of phase with one another, the excitation rate is slightly diminished.  The idea then is to detect the difference between these in-phase and out-of-phase excitation rates, and from this to determine the weak charge QW.   In the coherent control technique, we introduce an additional set of coherent laser beams that can also drive the weak transition, but through a two-photon interaction.  This gives us the ability to vary the relative phase between the different amplitudes using an optical device external to the vacuum chamber, and affords us greater control over the interaction.  Our initial analysis shows that the systematic errors due to stray, uncontrolled static electric fields, magnetic fields, or imperfect alignment of the various laser polarizations with the static fields, are much more manageable in our experimental geometry.  In the NSF-funded project that is now completed, our primary intellectual merit outcomes were to develop the instrumentation necessary to apply this coherent control technique to an APV measurement between hyperfine components of the ground state of cesium, and to carry out precision measurements of electric dipole transition matrix elements for the cesium atom.  For the former, we designed and constructed a novel, parallel-plate radio frequency (rf) open cavity structure for application of a well-controlled rf field at 9.2 GHz to drive the transition, and we have started work to characterize the field components. For the latter, we have carried out precise measurements of the strengths of transitions between many of the lowest levels of atomic cesium.  These measurements, combined with previous measurements from other groups, have allowed determination of electric dipole matrix elements for all of the most critical transitions to a precision of 0.16% or better.  Using these matrix elements, we have recalculated the scalar polarizability for the 6s-7s transition to a precision of 0.11%, which allows us to determine the vector polarizability for this transition as well.  (The scalar and vector polarizabilities are parameters that describe the strength of the atomic transition upon application of a dc electric field.)  The new value for the vector polarizability is of higher precision than the previous value, but disagrees by ~0.67% from that previous value.  This is a critical difference, and we are setting up new measurements to resolve this difference.   The broader impact of this work is in the training and education of undergraduate and graduate students in Physics and Engineering.  During this program, two PhD students have completed their degrees and moved on to new positions; one as a post-doctoral researcher at the University of Maryland working on developing advanced techniques for quantum computations based on trapped ions, the other as an rf engineer employed by Boulder Environmental Sciences and Technology.  In addition, we have provided projects for a large number of undergraduate students in our laboratory, several of which resulted in journal papers.  Each of these students has gained important technical expertise, which complements their classroom studies.           Last Modified: 12/04/2019       Submitted by: Daniel S Elliott]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
