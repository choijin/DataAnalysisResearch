<AbstractNarration>PI: Quarles, Greg&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: 1638444 &lt;br/&gt;Title: OSA BIOMEDICAL CONGRESSS&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The high level of technical development in biomedical optics, biophotonics, and the brain is drawing new researchers into the field from diverse disciplines ranging from chemistry and genetics, to laser optics and neurosurgery. OSA has identified the urgent need for a forum where these researchers can come together and discuss these areas at many levels. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This meeting will provide a forum for presentation of new research results and will stimulate new ideas and collaborations that will provide visionary direction for future projects. In addition this meeting will provide an opportunity for students, trainees and young investigators to present their work, and to hear and network with internationally-renowned invited speakers</AbstractNarration>
