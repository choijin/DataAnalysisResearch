<AbstractNarration>Expanding on the encouraging outcomes of an NSF-funded conference, this three-year project led by the National Center for Science and Civic Engagement at Harrisburg University of Science and Technology, in collaboration with the Koshland Science Museum of the National Academy of Sciences, will explore and evaluate ways to support new collaborations between professionals in institutions of higher education and informal STEM education around areas of common interest.  The primary goal is to develop the educational infrastructure to grow and efficiently sustain multiple cross-organizational partnership activities at the intersection of learning about science, society and civic engagement around such possible topics as energy, environment, genetics, earth resources, computers and ethics, nanotechnology, etc. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The initiative is: 1) creating a joint organizing "secretariat" to provide communications and support through low-cost shared services for at least six partnerships around the country; 2) providing partnership support and technical assistance to seed the six national partnerships, and 3) sharing evaluation and analysis services across all the partnerships.  The outcomes of the work pertain to improvements in professional knowledge and practice in higher education and informal science education, as well as the improvement of learning by undergraduates and by the general public.</AbstractNarration>

Involving students in the design of museum exhibits, having students interact with adult volunteers (citizen science projects) and gatekeeper audiences, and acting as facilitators for parent workshops on early children learn (Head Start, for example) were offered as examples of positive findings from the projects.  Broader Impact At this stage, the concept behind SENCER-ISE has proven itself to be feasible and fruitful in meeting NSF?s goal of a STEM learning community of 1) mutual appreciation and collaboration and 2) connecting the "audiences of these two realms. Partners report positively on the experience of learning from each other and from students involved in the projects. Although partnerships can be fragile (personnel leave, funding is sometimes not easily available), there is an acknowledgment that some basic support, interacting across the sectors, and being part of a larger network such as NCSCE, can create a foundation for further work to benefit the audiences served.  SENCER-ISE Through the SENCER-ISE (Science Education for New Civic Engagements and Responsibilities: Informal Science Education) initiative funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF), the National Center for Science and Civic Engagement (NCSCE) created six cross sector civic engagement partnerships between informal science and higher education institutions. The Noyce Foundation provided funds for four more projects.  SENCER-ISE began as an exploration into the possibilities of informal science education and higher education institutions collaborating around issues of civic importance as a way to enhance learning experiences for students in formal education and visitors to museums, science centers, and organizations. The second phase of SENCER-ISE, which can be viewed as a pilot project, created an infrastructure to support the development of cross-sector partnerships. Support included seed money, project planning assistance, evaluation training, and connection to a larger network of educators through the National Center for Science and Civic Engagement (NCSCE). Providing this infrastructure, focusing on civic issues, and engaging students in project development was a relatively uncharted approach in science education.  In connecting both the professionals and audiences of both two sectors, we found that the benefits of cross sector civic engagement partnerships for professionals include:  Deepened understanding of the structure and constraints of each      other's professional practices and organizations,  Increased respect for the unique skills of professionals from      each sector, Expanded access to new audiences, and Improved learning through connections to real-world contexts.    We also found that the factors influencing partnership development positively include:  Having the appropriate levels of decision-making authority and      organizational support to make the partnership work (including a      memorandum of understanding),   Identifying and sharing common goals, Allocating and devoting adequate time to build the      partnership and project, Developing and updating long-term action and evaluation plans,  Leveraging the strengths of each partner through clearly      articulated roles and responsibilities, and  Maintaining regular communication.   Eight of the ten original partnerships continued through the grant and the partners plan on continuing to collaborate with each other. The partnerships and their project titles include:  Partnerships and Project Titles - funded by the National Science Foundation   Connecticut Science Center/University of      Connecticut - "Genome Ambassadors" National Park Service Gateway Unit/Brooklyn      College- "Sentinels of Shoreline Change" New Mexico Museum of Natural History and      Science/University of New Mexico (EPSCoR) - "New Mexico Informal Science/Current Research Network" Lindsay Wildlife Experience/Saint Mary?s College      of California - "Facing the Future: Sharing Habitats with Wildlife"   Partnerships and Project Titles - funded by the Noyce Foundation     Science Center/Cornell University - "Engaging Researchers, Undergraduates and a Science Museum to Reach Early Learners and and Set the Stage for STEM Learning" The Wild Center/Paul Smith?s College - "Interpreting Climate Science" Wildlife Conservation Society/Fordham University - "Project "True: Teens  Research Urban Ecology"      For more information about the partnership activities, see sencer-ise.net.
