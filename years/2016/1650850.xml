<AbstractNarration>There is substantial evidence that social factors can affect physiological well-being and evolutionary fitness, but the molecular mechanisms underlying these relationships are not well understood. This dissertation project examines patterns of change in gene expression as they are distributed through the social networks of free-ranging rhesus monkeys, to understand how chronic social isolation might translate into physiological effects. The project will result in comparative data on sociality and epigenetic change that can inform research on human well-being and social isolation. Findings from the project will be made accessible to the global scientific community, and the project will support undergraduate and graduate student training in STEM research, as well as public science outreach activities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although we know much about the health and fitness benefits of investing in social bonds, we know little about the molecular mechanisms that actually translate these effects. This project will test the hypothesis that DNA methylation is a coordinated response to the social environment, by comparing methylation patterns for those in chronic social isolation and those heavily involved in a group's social life, and assessing methylation patterns in genetic pathways of known consequence for physiological well-being. The investigators will use a multi-year, multi-group behavioral data set to quantify the social networks of 80 monkeys (M. mulatta) of the Cayo Santiago colony using the tool-kit of Social Network Analysis (SNA). Reduced Representation Bisulfite Sequencing with whole blood DNA will be used to calculate genome-wide methylation levels and  The investigators will also determine if there is over-representation of DNA methylation in a behaviorally- and health-implicated serotonergic system. Past and pilot research indicates that serotonergic genetics might be differentially adaptive based on variance in the social environment, and this study will provide empirical data to better understand the role of the serotonergic system signaling pathway in phenotypic plasticity.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Sam Larson completed dissertation research on genetic and epigenetic contributions of the serotonergic system on measures of stress, health, and social engagement in a free-ranging population of rhesus macaques (<em>M. mulatta</em>). Through the tool-kit of social network analysis, we were able to characterize social positioning for more the 650 animals across 6 social groups. We were able to genotype <em>ca.</em> 890 animals for two genes of the system (SERT and TPH2). We collected several measures of stress and health, including conspicuous behavioral signals of stress, body composition, mortality and fertility.</p> <p>In terms of genetic sequence variation, we found some evidence to suggest that certain polymorphisms impacted stress, and that these effects showed sex-specific patterning. For example, we found a significant main effect for SERT on the incidence of self-directed behaviors, a well-versed indicator of stress (Figure 1). What's more, both SERT and TPH2 interacted with sex so that females in possession of the minor alleles either showed attenuated (SERT) or reversed (TPH2) effects. Further endorsing these results, estimated life-expectancies showed that females in possession of the so-thought deleterious SERT allele lived longer than females that did not, while the opposite pattern was observed in males (Figure 2).</p> <p>We also examined epigenetic variation (methylation) with the serotonin transporter. We developed and tested 3 sets of primers which successfully interrogated 600+ bp of a promoter region of the serotonin transporter. Unfortunately, out attempts at examining methylation with these primers were marred by several issues. First, we were challenged to control contamination within the lab. Our attempts at ameliorating this issue involved: (1) performing all wet-work in a cleanroom, and (2) at one time replacing all materials. While the latter worked for a time, cross-contamination eventually reappeared. Second, we were challenged by the persistence of secondary products from the PCR amplification. To assuage this issue, we tried manipulation of all aspects of the amplification procedure, including the amount of DNA, amount of primer, annealing temperature, and number of cycles, to no avail. Despite these products, we conducted multiple attempts at pyrosequencing, but doing so did not reveal interpretable results of the region.</p> <p>This necessitated our switching techniques. We employed COBRA assays, which use an enzyme digest that cuts DNA at various CpG sites depending on whether they show methylation. Since this was a less traversed approach with this region, we tested 7 different digests (TaqI, FauI, Hhal, BsiEI, BsaXI, Hphl, and HpyCH4IV). We had minimal successes with BsaXI, which was able to interrogate three CpG sites in conjunction with one of our primer sets: it revealed no usable variation between individuals in methylation marks in this region.</p> <p>The body of research on the contributions of serotonergic genetics to health, especially in conjunction with early-life stress, has been characterized by publication bias and false positives. This endorses a caution in interpreting the results of this and any study. Here we found evidence, mirroring that in humans, that so-thought "deleterious" serotonergic alleles impact individuals in a sex specific way. While certainly more research is needed to explore this idea, it is the hope of PI-Larson that the impact of sequence variation visible here endorses the utility of contextualizing familiar humans results in the evolutionary context of free-ranging nonhuman primates.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 03/02/2019<br>      Modified by: Sam&nbsp;Larson</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1650850/1650850_10475054_1551567151211_Figure1.Theinteractionbetweenserotonergicgeneticsandsexontherateofself-directedbehaviors--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1650850/1650850_10475054_1551567151211_Figure1.Theinteractionbetweenserotonergicgeneticsandsexontherateofself-directedbehaviors--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 1.
