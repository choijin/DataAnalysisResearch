<AbstractNarration>This award supports a gathering of faculty and student representatives from 11 institutions that participate in the Undergraduates Phenotyping Arabidopsis Knockouts (unPAK). Representatives from research universities, liberal arts colleges, community colleges, and historically minority-serving institutions, will attend the meeting in Austin, Texas in June 2016. The meeting will give students the opportunity to organize and participate in a professional gathering and faculty the opportunity to strategize on the directions the unPAK network will take in the future. Students will plan and work with faculty in the development of workshops that will address current issues with unPAK as well as potential future collaborative directions. These workshops are expected to include development of new techniques for research, comparison of data collection and analysis techniques between institutions, discussion of ways to integrate unPAK research into classroom settings, and improvement of dissemination strategies of unPAK data to the scientific community. The meeting will aid in expanding knowledge of plant genetics in support of developing better agricultural strategies for economically-critical crops while providing the next generation of scientists with networking and presentation skills necessary to launch their careers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Founded in 2010 (NSF award #1052262) and expanded in 2014 (NSF award #1355106), the Undergraduates Phenotyping Arabidopsis Knockouts (unPAK) project has sought to provide undergraduates with the opportunity to engage in authentic and collaborative research using Arabidopsis thaliana as a model system. This meeting is designed to support the long-term development and sustainability of unPAK, by bringing student and faculty representatives of all unPAK institutions together in Austin, TX from June 15-17, 2016 in conjunction with the Evolution 2016 meeting. Faculty will participate in both their own planning sessions as well as sessions with students. A major focus of the meeting will be on promoting student interactions to support their development as scientists. The meeting will provide a venue for in-person interaction that excites and inspires students to pursue careers in scientific research, and will improve unPAK's ability to efficiently deliver A. thaliana deletion line genotypic and phenotypic data by sharing best practices among all students and faculty in the unPAK network. By bringing together students from a wide range of institutional types, this meeting will also expose participating students and faculty to the many ways in which unPAK is engaging undergraduates in the advancement of scientific knowledge about plant genetics.</AbstractNarration>

In order to gather representatives of all unPAK institutions to share their scientific progress as well as strategize for future unPAK initiatives, we received support from the NSF (Award #1620512) to have a meeting in Austin, Texas between June 15 and 17, 2016, in conjunction with the Evolution meeting being held in Austin immediately afterwards.  Each unPAK Principal Investigator came to Austin and brought two undegraduate students who had been actively working on unPAK-related projects.  In total, approximately 40 people attended the event.   Over the course of the meeting, representatives from all 11 unPAK institutions led brief discussions centered on the unPAK initiatives taking place on their home campuses.  A student poster session allowed all undergraduate participants in the meeting the chance to present their work to the group at large. Additional sessions focused on the development of unPAK's online presence, the use of unPAK materials in course-based undergraduate research experiences (CUREs), the building of unPAK-based student collaborations between institutions, and the planning of a strategy for producing unPAK-related publications.  The whole group participated in sessions considering the best ways to disseminate unPAK data to the scientific community via unPAK's website as well as a workshop focused on using comparative genomics as a tool in data analysis.  Researchers affiliated with unPAK that are focused on studying the social aspects of the collaboration utilized the meeting to conduct individual and group interviews with several students and faculty.  The meeting concluded by generating an action plan for future unPAK initiatives and collaborations.   The provided several undergraduate students their first professional scientific meeting experience.  For some of these students, the unPAK meeting allowed them to practice presenting their research posters prior to doing a presentation at the international Evolution meeting immediately afterwards.  The undergraduate participants received invaluable professional meeting experience that will serve them will as they develop the interpersonal and communications skills necessary for success in the sciences or elsewhere.  From the unPAK network perspective, the meeting provided an invaluable opportunity for all stakeholders in the project to discuss their progress and to strategize on the best ways to disseminate data, publish results, and sustain the project in the years to come.
