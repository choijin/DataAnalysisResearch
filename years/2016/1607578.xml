<AbstractNarration>The University of Notre Dame High Energy Physics Group is committed to the exploration of the energy frontier in particle physics with accelerator-based experiments. The group is engaged in several related projects using the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) experiment at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at the CERN Laboratory, Geneva, Switzerland, the highest energy accelerator in the world.  The group is also active in future critical upgrades of the CMS detector and and Education and Outreach through QuarkNet and many other public-facing initiatives.  Together these activities place the group at the forefront of both particle physics experimentation and outreach. This award will facilitate further developments in the search for new physics beyond the Standard Model, one of the highest priority quests in physics for the 21st century.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The CMS experiment has recently begun the first physics run at 13 TeV center of mass energy, accumulating initial data from an LHC dataset that should exceed 100 fb-1 over the next few years. This dataset represents an unprecedented opportunity for physics studies at the electroweak scale and opens a potentially dramatic era in the search for new physics.  For its analytical contributions, the Notre Dame group has taken a leading role in several analyses at the forefront of the Higgs discovery and searches for new phenomena.   This award will continue this group's broad technical contributions, including: electromagnetic calorimeter operations and management of the U.S. contributions; leadership in High Level Trigger monitoring; leadership in the CMS Simulation effort and in Data Preservation; research and development for experimental upgrades of CMS calorimetry for improved performance at high luminosity; and in Computing, the group holds a U.S. CMS management position related to university-based computing facilities. The centerpiece of the group's outreach efforts is QuarkNet, now in its eighteenth year. Notre Dame is one of three institutions leading this national project and is the managing institution.  QuarkNet currently consists of 50 Centers in 25 States and Puerto Rico and has been expanded to include eleven different experimental programs at seven national and foreign laboratories.  Through such efforts as QuarkNet, the particle physics field is creating a suite of outreach materials and demonstration projects that bring the excitement of particle physics, the "buzz" about the LHC, to the public on a number of levels, from real physics analysis on LHC Higgs data in the classroom to particle detectors on display in museums such as the National Air and Space Museum in Washington DC.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goal of particle physics is to understand nature at its most fundamental level.  In our experiments, we study the basic constituents of matter - the particles -  as well as the forces that govern their behavior.  All of the experimental results over the past few decades are well described by our "Standard Model" of particle physics, including the recent discovery at CERN of the Higgs Boson.  But we know that the Standard Model is incomplete, and that there must be new particles and perhaps new forces not yet discovered.  Intellectual Merit:  This grant supported the research of the University of Notre Dame group working at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at the CERN laboratory, Geneva, Switzerland.  Notre Dame is a member of the CMS collaboration, one of two large multi-purpose experiments studying particle collisions at the world's highest energies.  The group supported during this period included five faculty; two research faculty; three postdoctoral researchers; 21 graduate students, 5 of whom earned their doctorate; and a large number of undergraduate physics majors.  During this period, the Notre Dame group made a number of significant contributions to CMS, including physics analysis, software development, computing, detector operations, and research and development for future CMS upgrades.  Faculty and students played a key role in the Higgs discovery, specifically in the analysis of the Higgs boson decaying to two photons.  Since then there has been a great deal of effort to determine if this particle's properties are consistent Standard Model predictions, and our group has been heavily involved in this work, in three domains. First is the continued precision study of the Higgs boson to two photons. Second is the measurement of the Higgs decays to fermions. This includes decays to two tau leptons, and a determination of the Higgs coupling to top quarks via the measurement of the associated production of Higgs bosons with top quark pairs. Third is the search for exotic or unexpected decays of the Higgs Boson. Our group led the search for lepton flavor violating decays to taus plus an electron or muon. Additionally, our group has expanded its efforts into searches for new physics in the production of top quark pairs with electroweak bosons within the context of effective field theories. Our efforts in searching for supersymmetric particles in final states involving photons and missing transverse energy have become much more sensitive with the large data set at 13 TeV. Our group has leadership roles in CMS software and computing. We have led efforts to evolve and improve the software CMS uses to manage central data processing, including R&amp;D for data processing in the HL-LHC era.  We have also led the effort to provide a detailed, accurate simulation of the CMS detector.  Emphasis has been on simulating the effects of event pileup that will occur at the higher beam luminosities planned for future LHC running.  The Notre Dame group has worked with the university's Center for Research Computing (CRC) to develop and maintain a Tier 3 computer cluster on campus that is one of the largest in the CMS experiment.  This cluster provides our group's computing needs and excess capacity is used by the broader CMS community. Through partnerships with the CRC and computer science faculty, our group has developed an innovative suite of software to enable opportunistic use of spare CRC processors, leveraging up to ten times more processing than is typically available in our dedicated Tier 3 resources.  To optimize the detector for future running at higher energies and higher intensities, CMS has worked on a two-phase upgrade program.  The Phase I upgrade is complete and the Notre Dame group had important responsibilities and management roles for key parts of that project.  We are now making significant contributions to the Phase II upgrade of CMS for operations at High Luminosity (the HL-LHC).  We are leading electronics development for central calorimetry, photosensor development for Endcap Hadron Calorimetry and the Barrel Timing Layer (BTL), and are contributing to the optical design of the BTL and to the design and construction of the track trigger upgrade.  Broader Impacts:  During this past grant period, Notre Dame faculty served as co-PIs of the national QuarkNet program that has brought particle physics to thousands of high school teachers and students over the past 19 years.  There are currently more than 50 QuarkNet centers across the United States and Puerto Rico.  We also serve as mentors for our own active local QuarkNet center.  Notre Dame faculty helped to lead the effort to make a subset of LHC data available to the public, and now analysis of that data is one of the activities offered to QuarkNet teachers and students.  The group has worked with the LHC experiments to extend the reach of particle physics "masterclasses" to locations in Latin America, Africa and Asia.
