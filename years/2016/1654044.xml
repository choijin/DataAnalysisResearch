<AbstractNarration>This award would continue the operations of the Magnetometer Array for Cusp and Cleft &lt;br/&gt;Studies (MACCS) network combined with the dissemination of its data and the scientific &lt;br/&gt;analysis of MACCS data in collaboration with other ground-based and space-based research &lt;br/&gt;teams. MACCS is a longitudinal array of high latitude fluxgate magnetometers covering the &lt;br/&gt;Eastern Canadian Arctic at high latitudes(75-85N), providing continuity of spatial &lt;br/&gt;coverage between existing Canadian and Greenland arrays. MACCS has contributed to the &lt;br/&gt;study of ULF waves and transients at these extreme latitudes as well as large &lt;br/&gt;cooperative studies of magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling, ionospheric convection, &lt;br/&gt;and magnetic storm and substorm processes. The combination of the location of several &lt;br/&gt;MACCS stations under the field of view of the SuperDARN / PolarDARN radar network, &lt;br/&gt;their proximity to the field of view of the AMISR radar system at Resolute Bay, Canada, &lt;br/&gt;and the nominal "conjugacy" of four MACCS stations with U. S. Antarctic stations &lt;br/&gt;as well as the recent addition of dual high-sampling-rate GPS TEC receivers makes possible &lt;br/&gt;additional comparative studies that would be quite rich in possible transformative &lt;br/&gt;outcomes. Each MACCS site transmits data in near real time (two through Iridium, six through &lt;br/&gt;the local wireless internet. The MACCS array has provided ground-based magnetic field &lt;br/&gt;observations that will continue to play a fundamental role in magnetospheric and ionospheric &lt;br/&gt;research and will continue to provide critical data for studies of various geospace &lt;br/&gt;phenomena including solar wind-magnetosphere and magnetosphere-ionosphere interactions, &lt;br/&gt;the dynamics of the high latitude polar cap regions of the magnetosphere, and &lt;br/&gt;geomagnetic storms and substorms. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The scientific analysis of MACCS data would focus on the topics such as the detailed studies of &lt;br/&gt;high-latitude ULF waves, using multi-instrument ground-based and satellite data from the &lt;br/&gt;Van Allen Probes and SWARM and studies of the role of ULF waves in energizing or depleting &lt;br/&gt;radiation belt electrons during magnetic storms. Theoretical studies and modeling &lt;br/&gt;studies (using the Space Weather Modeling Framework) of the excitation and propagation &lt;br/&gt;of ULF waves through the global magnetosphere-ionosphere system, and exploring the &lt;br/&gt;physical mechanisms involved would be particular aspects of the science issues covered &lt;br/&gt;in this award.</AbstractNarration>
