<AbstractNarration>The main objective of this summer research is to study how soft clays are able to gain strength by the injection of high temperatures. This newly developed concept is called thermal consolidation. The researcher will work under the supervision of Dr. Chang-Young Yune at the Gangneung-Wonju National University in South Korea and Dr. Guney Olgun from Virginia Tech in the USA. Dr. Yune is a world-renown expert in soft clay engineering and has developed a consolidation chamber to study the compression of soft clays. This is a one-of-a-kind experimental setup that will allow the researcher to inject a range of high temperatures into a variety of clayey soils to assess how this increase in temperature affects the strength of the soil. The improvement of soft soils is of paramount importance because it will enable the construction of heavy structures on soft soils.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The thermal consolidation will be conducted by circulating hot fluid in a piping system that goes down and up through a borehole contained in a consolidation chamber. Clay particles increase in volume due to thermo-elastic expansion, which causes a reduction in pore volume between the clay particles, and a subsequent increase in strength. This experimental study will allow the researcher to understand the behavioral mechanisms of pore pressure development, drainage, and strength gain during the thermal improvement. The thermal improvement of soft clays represents a major scientific and engineering breakthrough to improve in-situ conditions of soft clay deposits for the construction of buildings with heavy structural loads. The expected findings will also positively impact the engineering practice by reducing the costs associated with in-situ ground improvement of soft clay deposits. The summer research will lay the foundations for more detailed experimental and analytical studies to further investigate the thermo-mechanical phenomenon related to thermal improvement of soft clays. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award under the East Asia and Pacific Summer Institutes program supports summer research by a U.S. graduate student and is jointly funded by NSF and the National Research Foundation of Korea.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p><strong>Research Objectives</strong></p> <p>The main objective of this summer research was to investigate the effects on soil properties and total settlement when increasing the temperature of a kaolin clay soil specimen. During the summer research we studied how much of the total consolidation settlement was attributed to the effects of heat injection. To achieve this, we first consolidated one specimen at a constant load without heat injection, on the same specimen we then increased the temperature to 80&deg;C and kept the same vertical load.</p> <p>The long term objective is to implement a soil improvement method by using vertical drains in conjunction with heating devices at sites with soft soil deposits. Figure&nbsp;1 presents the proposed technique as it would be used in engineering practice.</p> <p><strong>Test Results </strong></p> <p>Figure 2 presents the settlement as a function of time for two stages of the 100 kPa consolidation portion of the test. Stage no. 1 for consolidation with heat injection and no.2 without heat injection. The blue curve, for stage no.1, shows a typical settlement behavior for clay, where settlement increases with time. It is expected that this particular curve will have a horizontal portion as time increases past the 2,000 minutes. Exactly at the 3,210 minutes the consolidation was considered to be completed, as it reached 95% degree of consolidation.</p> <p>The second portion of the test was to record the settlement caused by the heat injection. This settlement is represented by the red curve in Figure 2. From Figure 2 we can see that the settlement due to heating is significantly smaller than the settlement without heat injection. This major difference is a consequence of the specimen reaching full consolidation before the heat injection stage was initiated. The settlement due to heat injection is attributed to the fact that the pore water pressures were dissipated by the increased temperature, even though the specimen was consolidated before applying heat, the pore water pressure increase from 0 to 20 kPa during the hours that were necessary to reach the desired temperature for heat injection. During this waiting time the drainage valve was closed and vertical displacement was assumed to have stopped. This particular settlement due to heating can be considered as a secondary compression in the soil, where the specimen continues to settle at a constant vertical stress after the soil was consolidated past 95%.</p> <p>The maximum recorded settlements were 10 mm and 12 mm for the consolidation without heat and with heat injection, respectively. The recorded temperature during the application of 200 kPa pressure increased from 43.4&deg;C, at the beginning of the test, to a maximum temperature of 45&deg;C at test completion. The average temperature was 43.97&deg;C. The maximum expected test temperature was 40&deg;C, but it was necessary to increase and set the maximum heating temperature to 80&deg;C. This was necessary to reach the testing temperature of 40&deg;C because of the cooler soil specimen being inside a closed metal chamber, where the initial temperature was approximately 23&deg;C.</p> <p>After analyzing the results from the 100 kPa consolidation tests, we concluded that the maximum settlements were not as expected when compared to previous tests performed by Dr. Yune. It was concluded that this portion of the test experienced some sample disturbance. It is expected that the 200 kPa tests will provide more reliable results because of no disturbance during this portion of the test.</p> <p>The test results from the consolidation at a constant&nbsp;vertical pressure of 200 kPa, as presented in Figure 3,&nbsp;show a&nbsp;better representation of the expected laboratory behavior for consolidation vs. temperature effects. Figure 3.a shows that the consolidation with heat injection presents a greater vertical displacement, as expected. Thus, we can conclude that in fact heat injection does increase the settlement of a normally consolidated soft soil layer.</p> <p>In addition to observing the effects that heat injection has on the consolidated settlement of soils, we can also conclude that the soft soil specimen gains strength at the end of the thermal consolidation process. This gain in strength is evidenced by comparing the shear strength that was estimated for the soil layer at the beginning of the test versus the strength at test completion and sample extraction. Figure 4 shows a the locations where shear strength was measured within the sample. Before consolidating the specimen, the shear strength was calculated to be approximately 200 psf. The measured shear strength at the end of the thermal consolidation demonstrated to have a ten-fold increase in the initial strength.</p> <p>This finding is of significance importance for the geotechnical engineering field as well as for the construction field. The acceleration of soft soil consolidation, and thus ground improvement, positively impacts the economy as a whole by accelerating the construction of stores, housing projects, and infrastructure, and untimely creating jobs to boost the economy.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 03/15/2017<br>      Modified by: Pedro&nbsp;O&nbsp;Bengochea</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1614253/1614253_10430453_1489545697839_Figure1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1614253/1614253_10430453_1489545697839_Figure1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 1"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1614253/1614253_10430453_1489545697839_Figure1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 1"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Figure 1.
