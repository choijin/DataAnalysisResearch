<AbstractNarration>The last decade has seen an explosion of research concerning the neural processes underlying memory formation and learning. As the basic research in this field becomes more mature, exciting possibilities for application of this knowledge have begun to emerge. This proposal aims to capitalize on these findings by developing assistive learning technologies that may revolutionize the way we teach and train people.  Researchers at New York University will develop automated "adaptive teaching" technologies that guide learners through material in an individualized way. The goal is to increase retention or mastery of materials by tailoring instruction to individual learners.  The novel contribution of this project is to combine insights from cognitive neuroscience and machine learning in the design and operation of such technologies.  Successful development of this synergistic research would be a transformative application of neuroscience to our daily lives and may lead to new commercial technologies.  The research will also provide a post-doctoral training opportunity for the next generation of scientists working at the intersection of neuroscience and computer science. The award is from the Integrated Strategies for Understanding Neural and Cognitive Systems program, with funding from the EHR Core Research (ECR) program, which supports fundamental research that advances the research literature on STEM learning, and from the Behavioral and Cognitive Sciences division in the SBE directorate. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The specific scientific goal is to explore novel applications of neuroscience methods (particularly fMRI) to improve how people learn. Neuroscience research has identified robust neural correlates of successful memory formation (e.g., activity in brain areas such as the medial temporal lobe and the hippocampus). The goal of this project is to use these variables to help predict the information needs of learners in an adaptive way. The project design involves scanning an individual's brain during the learning phase of a task. The research team then will identify which materials would benefit from additional study by combining computational models of the time course of learning and forgetting with theories mapping neural activation to successful memory formation. A computer algorithm then selects new materials for learners to re-study in a subsequent session. The goal is to show that generating a training sequence from a computer-based "neurofeedback" algorithm can enhance long-term memory retention more than when learners choose for themselves which items to re-study. This is a high-risk but potentially large reward project that merges basic science findings from neuroscience and cognitive science in ways that may transform the way we educate people.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Our ability to learn new information is essential for school, work, and life. Given the immense amount of information we need to memorize we often have to make choices about how and when to study.  Most of the time, decisions about what to study and how to study it are left to the learner’s discretion, but research on human memory has shown that people may not be able to accurately predict what they know or what they will remember. It is therefore worthwhile to explore methods of optimizing human learning, such that a learner acquires the maximum amount of new information in the shortest amount of time.  The idea of optimizing human memory is not a new one: over the past several decades, a number of projects have developed intelligent tutoring systems, or "cognitive tutors" that adapt the way material is presented to learners, often using insights from cognitive science and psychology.    In this project, we aimed to broaden and expand these existing model-based tutoring systems by drawing on recent developments in cognitive neuroscience.  In particular, we aimed to make use of subsequent memory signals: neural activity produced at the time of studying something new that differs according to whether material was remembered or forgotten later on (Davachi, Mitchell, &amp; Wagner, 2003; Sanquist et al., 1980). These signals reveal something about how well a studied item has been learned, and thus have value for the development of automated, personalized tutoring systems.  In effect our goal was to "read the minds" of people to understand what they did and didn’t learn well, and then to use that information to personalize the learning process.  To that end, in this project we conducted a series of large experiments (i.e., many, many people tested) where we asked everyday adults to study a list of English-Lithuanian vocabulary translations while their brains were measured using either fMRI and EEG.  We then analyzed these brain patterns to see if we could identify robust signals that could tell us when people successfully learned and when they didn’t.  Finding a brain signal that can predict when people learn would be a basic building block of these future educational technologies because it would allow us to better understand students as they are learning.    The results of our experiments were informative both in what they tell us we *can* do and what we*can’t* do with these current brain measurement technologies.  On the positive side, we showed in our studies that we can in fact predict when a person will remember something several days later just using data recorded from their brain using fMRI.  This is a remarkable validation of past work identifying the neural signals associated with memory formation and was exactly the type of result we were hoping for. However, we also showed that these signals are most likely to be related to the *content* of the information the person was studying (the type of word being learned, the ideas and emotion it evokes, the other ideas it reminds us of) rather than reflecting core "memory operations" in the brain.  This distinction is important because ultimately we want to tell apart brain signals that are directly involved in memory formation and those that are just correlated with the material the person is studying.   In addition to this core research aim, we also had several other novel ideas during the development of this research which make contributions to the cognitive neuroscience field.  In particular, we invented a new method of increasing the statistical power of fMRI studies by more effectively combining data across several types of psychology/neuroscience experiments.  These new mathematical techniques may enable researchers to derive insight from older, already published and completed experiments that have been shared in open-access repositories (saving money in the future from running entirely new studies).    In addition to these core scientific studies we made several other contributions and broader impacts.  First, all of the data, code, and materials from these studies has been published in open repositories.  This means that any member of the public can access our data, replicate our results, or build upon them.  Second, the project provided funding for several young scientists completing their education including several undergraduate students, several student obtaining a master’s degree, a PhD student, and a postdoctoral research fellow.  Many of these individuals have since moved on to continue their career in science, technology, and education.  Third, we have taken many of the analysis codes developed for this research and used them to develop new teaching materials for undergraduates at NYU (and beyond).  This allows young people interested in neuroscience to get exposed to the field earlier in their education and helps them understand how the basic statistics they learn in college apply to more complex data science problems.
