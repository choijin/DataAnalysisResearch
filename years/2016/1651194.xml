<AbstractNarration>The 20th Quantum Information Processing Workshop (QIP 2017) will be held at the Westin Hotel in downtown Seattle, on 14-20 January 2017. QIP is the premier annual conference in the field, and is expected to bring together over 400 of the leading researchers in theoretical aspects of quantum information and computation. &lt;br/&gt;QIP seeks to increase student participation in the field. It is proposed to offer approximately 20 US-based students and postdoctoral fellows NSF-sponsored travel grants to attend the conference.</AbstractNarration>
