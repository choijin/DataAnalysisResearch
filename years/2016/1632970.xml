<AbstractNarration>This award is to assist approximately 25 US-based graduate students to attend the Thirteenth Symposium on Networked Systems Design and Implementation (NSDI 2016) in Santa Clara, CA, on March 16-18, 2016. The conference focuses on the design principles of large-scale networks and distributed systems and the common challenges across diverse systems. This conference brings together researchers from across the networking and systems communities including computer networking, distributed systems, and operating systems to foster cross-disciplinary approaches and to address shared research challenges. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The purpose of this trip is to provide students with the opportunity to interact with more senior researchers in the field, and exposes students to leading edge work in the field. The support requested in this proposal will enable the participation of students who would otherwise be unable to attend NSDI.</AbstractNarration>

Any student enrolled full-time at an accredited university or college is welcome to apply for a grant. Grants have two components: 1) registration costs and 2) expenses. For those students selected, USENIX covers registration costs by providing students with a complimentary registration code. For the expense portion, USENIX provides a check to assist the student with costs related to airfare and hotel. Variations in the amounts offered depend on how far a student will need to travel and the amount they request (i.e., some students may stay with a friend in the town of the conference and therefore do not have a hotel expense). We confirm that the students register and attend the event. We do not require that students provide us with a detailed accounting of how the funds were spent.</p> <p style="background: transparent; border: 0px; font-size: 14px; margin: 10px 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; line-height: 20px; color: #000000; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;">&nbsp;</p> <ul> <li>Students who are participating in the conference (e.g., presenting a poster)</li> <li>Students whose areas of study significantly overlap with the conference topics and who write a concise essay (supporting statement) outlining their research</li> <li>First-time applicants and those who have not received a grant in the past 12 months</li> <li>Students from institutions not traditionally represented at USENIX events</li> <li>Student members of the Association (not required)</li> <li>Class level and financial need</li> </ul> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #000000; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial; display: inline !important; float: none;">USENIX received 61 grant applications from students, and 35 were funded.
