<AbstractNarration>This award provides financial support for travel expenses for a group of US researchers to attend the 17th US-Japan Conference on Composite Materials in Sapporo, Japan on August 1-2, 2016 and to visit the Structures and Advanced Composite Research unit of the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) in Tokyo, Japan on July 29, 2016. Composite materials play an increasingly critical role in a large number of industries, such as the energy, automotive, aerospace and defense industries. Themes covered by the conference represent an interdisciplinary spectrum of topics related to mechanics of composite materials and composite structures and includes topics such as analysis, design, manufacturing, and applications of advanced composites. The travel award will target early career faculty from US institutions of higher education. A special emphasis will be placed on engagement of faculty from underrepresented groups, minority-serving institutions and NSF EPSCoR states. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The travel funding will promote intellectual exchange between US and Japan researchers in the area of composite materials. Funding through this award will increase the number of junior faculty members from academia who will be able to attend the conference due to the financial support for travel. In addition, the selection focus on underrepresented faculty and the inclusion of faculty from minority-serving institutions would potentially broaden the demographics of successful early-career faculty in this field. Planned group activities will also facilitate mentorship, professional development and help to build a professional network among this diverse group of early-career faculty.</AbstractNarration>

Senior-level faculty participating (minority portion) served to provide mentorship to the junior faculty.  Intellectual Merit: The award provided a unique opportunity for the US participants to  -        Engage in the first-hand interactions with Japanese researchers from a broad spectrum of academic, industrial, and governmental research organizations related to advanced composites;  -        Facilitate US-Japan research partnership in the area of advanced composites;  -        Create opportunities for new research collaborations;  -        Advance scientific knowledge in mechanics of composite materials through merging of diverse research perspectives.     Broader Impact: Composite materials play an increasingly important role in a variety of industries, such as energy, automotive, aerospace, defense, etc., that are vital to the US economy, national security, and the nation's current standing as the world leading research- and technology-driven society.
