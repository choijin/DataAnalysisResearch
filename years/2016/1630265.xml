<AbstractNarration>This research project will measure public opinion in voting constituencies around the United States. The project will provide estimates of opinion in districts with little or no survey data, such as state legislative districts. The project's intellectual merit comes from establishing a new means for measuring public opinion that not only uses survey respondents' answers to polling questions but also incorporates important information about where respondents are located and what that implies about geographic patterns in public opinion. Coupled with population information from the U.S. Census, the project will produce stronger estimates of public sentiment when survey data are sparsely distributed.  The investigators will release free software that includes user-friendly functions allowing any citizen to determine public opinion in his or her own district or in districts that have not yet cast any votes, such as proposed congressional districts in a redistricting cycle.  The software will allow more sophisticated users to obtain measures for any variable (even if unrelated to public opinion) in relationship to geographic boundaries, which will have extensions to research in public health, epidemiology, economics, sociology, business, and law. The broader impact to society will be that the data and software from this project will provide more information for the news media, the public, and elected officials regarding the outlook of the nation by constituency and locale, thereby providing a better understanding of the American representation process. The project will recruit a diverse group of research assistants that will be trained in this kind of statistical analysis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Studies relating to public opinion often settle for less-than-ideal data. Frequently, researchers will measure public opinion in the 50 states or the 435 congressional districts by pooling together several surveys taken over time (losing a sense of change over time), using old measures of public opinion (which may not be consistent with current public views), or using presidential vote share to approximate public sentiment (which is prone to error because factors besides ideology affect vote choices). With smaller districts than these, such as state legislative districts, the problem is magnified considerably, because it is rare to have many survey respondents in such a small area. In this project, the investigators ask: How can survey responses and the geographic location of the respondents be used to reliably forecast constituency public opinion? To answer this question, the investigators will use the method of Bayesian universal kriging. This technique fits a training model over survey data to determine how demographic factors shape public opinion and how the portion of survey responses that cannot be explained by demographics can be explained by a geographically smoothed process. With a model like this, public opinion in constituencies can be predicted with known population demographics and the values of the geographically smoothed error process over that district.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This project has created measures of the average ideology of Americans in voting constituencies such as the 50 states, 435 congressional districts, 1,971 state legislative upper chamber districts (state senates), and 5,411 state legislative lower chamber districts (state houses of representatives). Anyone who would like to use our measures for journalistic, academic, or personal research is free to download them from a public Dataverse page (https://doi.org/10.15139/S3/7NNASB ). Creating such measures is not trivial because many small constituencies, such as state legislative districts, have little polling data. We solved this problem with a method called&nbsp;<em>universal kriging</em>: In short, we used polling data to forecast ideology in each district based on census demographics and geographical trends in ideology.</p> <p>As the supporting images show, our measures of citizens' ideology do a nice job of predicting the partisanship and ideology of their elected representatives at all levels. These measures can even help to understand questions of public interest, such as how members of a legislature voted on a bill. (One attached image, for example, shows the ideology of members of all state house chambers in the United States.) Full details on our data and how they are useful can be found in our article entitled "Measuring Constituency Ideology Using Bayesian Universal Kriging," in the journal&nbsp;<em>State Politics and Policy Quarterly</em>.</p> <p>We also made these data, and the methods behind them, available through the free open-source statistical program R. Anyone can freely download R and then install our package, named "krige" (user's manual: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/krige/krige.pdf). Within that package, users can easily merge our data with their own data of interest.&nbsp;</p> <p>The package also allows users who are familiar with R to estimate kriging models of their own just like the one used to create our data. We designed our own Metropolis-Hastings algorithm to estimate this Bayesian model. We include within the package functions that allow the user to diagnose the correct spatial model with tools such as semivariograms. (One attached image shows a raw and estimated semivariogram for data on natural gas production in West Virginia.) Importantly, after estimating the model, there is a function that allows you to make predictions based on locations and covariate values for new cases. In our ideology data, for example, we simulated citizens based on locational and demographic information from census data. After predicting ideology for many simulated citizens, we averaged ideology by voting district. In your own application, though, you might predict natural gas production based on rock pressure and location of the well or the level of ozone at a new site based on site location and population density. If you wish to learn how to apply these techniques, the "krige" package includes four example datasets with practice examples: a contrived dataset, ideology of New York City residents, ideology of New York State residents, and gas production in West Virginia wells. Full details on our R package can be read in our article entitled, "krige: R Software for Bayesian Universal Kriging."</p> <p>For those particularly interested in estimating kriging models, a major problem with them is that they are hard to estimate even with moderately large datasets. In our previously-mentioned article on the "krige" package, we offer a few solutions to this, including an experimental version of the package called "krige.exp." Beyond that, though, we have developed the technique of Bootstrapped Random Spatial Sampling (BRSS). This is a complex problem because bootstrapping techniques normally call for sampling with replacement, but kriging methods will not allow that naturally because they are not defined when two observations are from the exact same location. To resolve this issue, we conducted several experiments that compare bootstrapping without replacement to bootstrapping with replacement and jittering. We show that BRSS does recover estimates that are similar to full-information estimates, albeit with a bit more uncertainty. We illustrate how BRSS can be applied with an enormous dataset of campaign donors in California.
