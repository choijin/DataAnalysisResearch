<AbstractNarration>Range shifts and changes in population size are thought to be common features of evolution in animals, in part because most species are older than recent ice ages and have persisted through dramatic changes in global climate and land cover. Migratory birds present particularly interesting case studies in this context: they are capable of crossing huge geographic areas in search of newly suitable habitats, but their potential for adaptation to new areas may be limited by genetic cues determining the direction and timing of migration. Recent efforts to forecast species' ranges under an assortment of climate change scenarios suggest that most bird species in North America will need to shift their ranges in order to persist in the climatic conditions they experienced during the past century. Understanding the dynamics of range shifts and their long-term impacts on species' evolutionary potential is thus an important task for biologists in the 21st century. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is focused on uncovering the temporal and spatial dynamics of shifts in demography and range in the Bee hummingbirds, a young radiation including all migratory hummingbirds breeding in temperate North America. Hummingbirds are good subjects for studies of range and demography because their extreme physiologic constraints, nectivorous diet, and high dispersal abilities suggest that they are sensitive to shifts in regional climate and phenology. In addition, two of the project's focal species - Selasphorus rufus and Calypte anna - have experienced dramatic range shifts over the last 100 years, offering a chance to study the process of colonization and expansion in contemporary time. This project applies population-genomic analyses of reduced-representation DNA sequencing libraries to examine response to environmental change by (1) determining the role of founder effects and gene flow in establishing populations in novel ranges over the last century, (2) testing for genetic divergence and reduced gene flow across migratory divides, and (3) comparing demographic responses to Pleistocene climate change in a multispecies comparative framework along a latitudinal gradient.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>CJ Battey has completed work on his dissertation research &ldquo;Genomic Signatures of Range Shifts and Demographic Change in Migratory Hummingbirds&rdquo; with support from NSF award # 1600945. This project explored how the geographic ranges and population sizes of North American hummingbirds have changed in response to both long-term climate change (i.e. Pleistocene glacial cycles) and recent human landscape modification by analyzing a combination of genetic data and long-term survey data.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Over the course of the project CJ sequenced and assembled the complete genomes of 40 hummingbirds from three species, and sequenced ~.1% of the genome of an additional 196 individuals from 20 species (these data will be available to the public once the associated manuscripts are through peer review). These data revealed that a pair of closely related species on the west coast &ndash; the Allen&rsquo;s and Rufous Hummingbirds &ndash; hybridize extensively in northern California and southern Oregon, with the only &ldquo;pure&rdquo; Allen&rsquo;s Hummingbird genotypes found in birds from the Channel Islands (Figure 1). Demographic analyses find that both Rufous and Calliope Hummingbirds have experienced exponential increase in populations since the last glacial maximum ~20kya, while the Allen&rsquo;s Hummingbird has maintained roughly constant populations since the early Pleistocene. This is consistent with the presence of a climate refugia in much of California that provided habitat for temperate-zone species during the coldest parts of the most recent ice age, while both the Pacific Northwest and Great Basin regions experienced more intense shifts in climate. A manuscript describing these findings is currently in preparation.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Additionally, analytic methods developed for the project described above to identify and test the robustness of genotype clusters were applied in one peer-reviewed article (&ldquo;A Migratory Divide in the Painted Bunting&rdquo;, <em>American Naturalist, </em>Battey et al. 2018, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1086/695439">https://doi.org/10.1086/695439</a>) and form the basis of a preprint currently in revision (&ldquo;Minor Allele Frequency Thresholds Strongly Affect population Structure Inference with Genomic Datasets&rdquo;, bioRxiv.org, Linck &amp; Battey 2018, <a href="http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/09/14/188623.full.pdf+html">doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/188623</a>).</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>To analyze the impacts of recent human landscape modification on species ranges, CJ gathered historic occurrence records of Anna&rsquo;s Hummingbirds from natural history museums, public survey datasets, and online biodiversity databases. By modeling population growth over time in different regions and applying a series of stringent quality and effort filters, the project mapped the spread of Anna&rsquo;s Hummingbirds from coastal California in the 1920&rsquo;s to as far north as Homer, Alaska, after 2010 (Figure 2, Figure 3). This study showed that the huge range expansion in the species started in the 1950&rsquo;s and 60&rsquo;s, and cannot be explained by changes in climate alone. Instead this appears to be a case of &ldquo;ecological release&rdquo; &ndash; a rapid increase in population growth rates that occurs when ecological constraints on growth are released. The introduction of <em>Eucalyptus</em> to California during the late 19<sup>th</sup> century, coupled with the popularity of hummingbird feeders after ~1960, removed seasonal lowpoints in food availability in the native range. This allowed populations to increase in California, and eventually population pressure lead to colonization of the northwest and interior southwestern US. A preprint describing these findings is currently posted (Battey 2018, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1101/329615)">https://doi.org/10.1101/329615)</a>, and a slightly revised version is under review at <em>The American Naturalist</em>. Analytic methods developed for this project were also key for a separate analysis of elevational shifts in Puerto Rican <em>Anolis </em>lizards which CJ worked on in collaboration with Dr. Ray Huey, and is currently in review at the journal <em>Ecology</em>.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Preliminary results from projects described above were shared at national scientific conferences (North American Ornithological Congress 2016, Evolution 2017) and with public audiences at talks organized by the Seattle Audubon Society in Seattle, WA, and Friends of Skagit Beaches in Anacortes, WA.
