<AbstractNarration>The only self-fertilizing vertebrate, the mangrove killifish, serves as an indicator of environmental pollution in disappearing wild mangrove habitat. The research will explore varying lengths of exposure to biologically and environmentally relevant levels of mixtures of insecticides, fungicides, and herbicides on aggressive behavior, contest dynamics, testosterone (T), and cortisol (F) in the mangrove killifish (K. marmoratus) utilizing a novel experimental approach analyzing flexibility in behavioral and hormonal response phenotypes. The research will be conducted in collaboration with Dr. Yuying Hsu of National Normal Taiwan University in Taipei, Taiwan. The Hsu lab houses captive populations of the mangrove killfish, offering a unique opportunity for international collaboration.  The research augments dissertation research examining behavior and hormones in golf course living birds. Using the killifish as a model, the research in Taiwan will examine how pesticide mixtures commonly in use at this, and other, golf courses may influence behavior and hormones expanding upon my dissertation work. This research may inform on impacts (if any) of levels of contaminants currently thought to have minimal physiological impacts. Studying a unique species while fostering international collaboration with a world leader in scientific research will be valuable to my personal and professional development. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Genetic control with predictable relationships between aggressive behavior, testosterone, and cortisol regarding responses to conspecific conflict are well studied in the mangrove killifish. This provides valuable and difficult to achieve control of genetic variation, often thought responsible for individual variation in hormone-behavior relationships. The experimental design is unique, as fish will be exposed to environmentally relevant levels of a pesticide mixture. Exposure will occur for short (7 days) and long intervals (14 days); while traditional methodology typically uses shorter exposure periods this is unrealistic compared to what is experienced naturally. Measuring aggression, testosterone, and cortisol after exposure also deviates from traditional endpoints measured in laboratory contaminant studies. By utilizing novel animal models and toxicological endpoints, in concert with biological methodology, and accounting for synergistic impacts of multiple contaminants, a realistic perspective concerning sensitive impacts of contaminants on physiology and behavior is possible. Interdisciplinary approaches combining behavioral endocrinology and toxicology are necessary for understanding how contaminants may impact behavioral and hormonal profiles, and ultimately, the health of human and wildlife populations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award under the East Asia and Pacific Summer Institutes program supports summer research by a U.S. graduate student and is jointly funded by NSF and the Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p><em>Research Aims</em>: This research contributes to a growing body of literature showing that biologically relevant, sub-lethal doses of pesticides are detrimental to organisms. Employing an experimental approach, I analyzed flexibility in behavioral responses in the mangrove killifish (<em>K. marmoratus</em>), a self-fertilizing hermaphrodite, and exposed to environmentally relevant concentrations of pesticides. The main goals of this research were to: 1) evaluate the flexibility in aggressive responses to long-term pesticide exposure, and 2) determine if behavioral responses are due to changes in hormone levels (testosterone and cortisol).</p> <p><em>Methods</em>: Experiments were run in collaboration with Dr. Yuying Hsu (National Taiwan Normal University). Two replicate groups of 24 fish were exposed for 9 days to either a control solution (ethanol) or a low (3 mg/L) or high (6 mg/L) dose of the pesticide Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4D). Hormone samples and baseline aggression tests were performed before and after chemical exposure.</p> <p><em>Results</em>: I found an overall decrease in both performance and frequency of aggressive behaviors with 2,4D treatment; I did not find a significant interaction between treatment and replicate. In the high dose group, post-exposure total aggression was predicted by 2,4D exposures, specifically, when treated with a high dose, the fish experienced a significant decrease in total aggression. Additionally, individuals with longer body lengths displayed increased total aggression. Hormone samples have yet to be analyzed.</p> <p><em>Summary</em>: Changes in aggression explained by 2,4D treatment raise intriguing questions regarding neuroendocrine mechanisms modulating such changes. This is because individuals with higher baseline testosterone and cortisol display aggressive behavior more quickly; on the other hand, individuals with lower cortisol before a fight exhibit lower overall aggression. Lastly, larger individuals whom win fights have higher testosterone and lower cortisol before a fight.</p> <p>I found that individuals exposed to higher doses exhibited decreased aggression, and this may be associated with lower levels of cortisol, as previous research suggests. If hormone analyses confirm this, it would imply that 2,4D exposure in the high dose group may have influenced the hypothalamic-pituitary-axis (HPA), the hypothalamic-gonadal-axis (HPG), or both. Additionally, influences of body size on aggression suggest that in larger individuals, the HPG axis, and specifically testosterone production, may have been impacted by 2,4D exposure. While it is interesting to speculate, it is important to note that 2,4D was not quantified in tank water, and it is not possible to say whether 2,4D itself, or degradation products of 2,4D, such as 2,4-Dichlorophenol, influenced outcomes.</p> <p>The oldest herbicide registered for use in aquatic systems in the United States is 2,4D. Given the generous utilization of this herbicide in proximity to mangrove forests in the state of Florida, and that this species<em> </em>is listed as a Species of Concern by the State of Florida and the U.S. National Marine Fisheries Service, results of this research suggest that more in depth study of 2,4D exposures on killifish is necessary. Results must be taken lightly until combined with hormone analyses, however, they may be used as an indication that further investigation is merited. This research shows promise in evaluating behavioral endpoints in toxicology research, as well as more realistic exposures to mimic natural environmental exposures.</p> <p><strong>Intellectual Merit:</strong> The mangrove killifish is vulnerable in Florida due to habitat degradation and pollution. As simultaneous hermaphrodites, traditional toxicological methodologies may not detect impacts of more subtle exposures. This study is the first to explore baseline aggression post-2,4D exposure in a self-fertilizing vertebrate. In addition, this study employed a non-traditional toxicological design without animal sacrifice; this provides a necessary alternative in the study of endocrine disrupting chemicals. Significant changes in aggression explained by 2,4D exposure merit further investigation given the conservation concerns surrounding this species.</p> <p><strong>Broader Impacts:</strong> A transformational impact of the NSF-EAPSI fellowship was the opportunity for cultural immersion in a personal and professional setting. In addition to forming a collaborative relationship Dr. Hsu, I fostered lasting relationships with her graduate students throughout the program. I was also able to develop a collaborative relationship with another researcher, and personal friendships with Taiwanese residents I met throughout my stay. Fostering positive international relationships, both personal and professional, are crucial to continuing positive relations between the U.S. and Taiwan.
