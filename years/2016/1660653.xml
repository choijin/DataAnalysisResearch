<AbstractNarration>The University of Indianapolis will undertake "UIndy STEM3", a Noyce Track 1 (Scholarships &amp; Stipends) project that will recruit and prepare at least 36 STEM graduates and/or STEM professionals who are committed to serve as secondary STEM teachers. To prepare highly effective STEM teachers who possess both content and pedagogical knowledge, the project will integrate coursework with classroom practice in a year-long clinical residency, during which Noyce Scholars will work under the guidance of a cooperating mentor teacher in a partnering high-need school district. This will be followed by two years of post-residency mentoring support. To enhance learning in STEM courses, Noyce Scholars will incorporate project based learning as an instructional strategy. This model will prepare Noyce Scholars to serve as teacher leaders who are able to: translate content knowledge into culturally and developmentally responsive curricula; employ a variety of strategies to encourage students' literacy, engagement, and self-efficacy; employ differentiated instruction to meet the needs of all students; assess the impact of professional practice on student achievement; use data-driven reflection to modify professional practice; and advocate for high-quality urban education.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The UIndy STEM3 Noyce Initiative will model best practices in teacher preparation through: the integration of a clinical residency experience with rigorous coursework; authentic collaborative relationships between the university and high-need local education agencies; and authentic collaboration between the faculty of the Shaheen College of Arts and Sciences and the School of Education. Coursework and clinical residency experiences will be integrated in a full-time program aligned with local education agency calendars and will result in scholars earning, within one year, a Master of Arts in Teaching (MAT) degree along with licensure in a STEM content&lt;br/&gt;area.  The impact of the clinical residency on both the Noyce Scholars and the cooperating mentor teachers (CMTs) will be evaluated. Additionally, the extent to which CMTs benefit as teacher leaders through their experience engaging Noyce Scholars and from their relationships with university faculty will be assessed. Ultimately, the findings from this project will contribute to the knowledge of effective practices in teacher education in Master of Arts in Teaching MAT programs throughout the country and the benefits of clinical residencies.</AbstractNarration>
