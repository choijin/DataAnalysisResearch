<AbstractNarration>This award supports participation in two mini-conferences of the Atlanta Lecture Series in Graph Theory and Combinatorics, held November 12-13, 2016 and April 22-23, 2017 at Emory University and Georgia State University, respectively. Combinatorics and graph theory have undergone dramatic development in the past few decades. These two meetings in the Atlanta Lecture Series in Graph Theory and Combinatorics will feature the latest research developments and themes in the areas of structural graph theory, extremal graph theory, random graphs, percolation, hypergraphs, and extremal set theory. The series has become a major event for the combinatorics community in the southeast region and beyond, providing opportunities to strengthen collaborations among researchers and institutions within the southeast region of the United States.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each conference features two one-hour lectures by a distinguished researcher, four one-hour lectures by established researchers mainly from the southeast region, and four 30-minute talks by early-career researchers and graduate students.  The meetings provide opportunities for interaction among established researchers and rising stars; this award supports the attendance of graduate students, early-career researchers, and invited speakers. Additional information concerning financial support and the conference schedule is maintained at the lecture series website:&lt;br/&gt;http://www.als.math.gatech.edu/</AbstractNarration>
