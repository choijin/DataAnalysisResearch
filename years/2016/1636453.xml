<AbstractNarration>The workshop advances the science of science and innovation policy by linking basic research in an array of disciplines to urgent public policy questions related to the changing nature of work.  The workshop advances the development of the research community focused on understanding more fully the nature of production of societal value. The workshop introduces new data and research-based insights into policy debates about the future of work. The workshop nurtures a new data and structure rich analysis that have the potential to improve science and innovation policy.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The production algorithm refers to the processes for turning ideas into goods and services. A culinary recipe is an example: it is a means for turning ingredients into a meal. The advance of the algorithmic frontier refers to improvements in production algorithms that occur over time.  This workshop brings together a multi-disciplinary team of researchers involved with the relationship between the advance of the algorithmic frontier, the changing nature of human work and the potential for inclusive opportunity.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In February 2017, a cross-disciplinary group of experts on economics and technology convened at SRI International Headquarters in Menlo Park, California, for a workshop to discuss potential directions for updating the neoclassical production function. The motivation for this undertaking was to draw upon frontier research on economic and workforce dynamics to inform methodologies of policy analysis. The workshop built directly on research workshops held at the Santa Fe Institute in August 2013, October 2014, and October 2015 that helped to define and expand a research community focused on understanding more fully the algorithmic nature of production and "innovation as search".  The speakers and other participants at the workshop included a diverse group of highly-regarded scholars from the fields of economics, business, finance, physics, data science, and public policy, representing a research community experienced in developing novel empirical models in evolutionary biology, predictive genomics, labor economics, and growth theory. Undertaken as a multi-institution collaboration involving George Mason University's Schar School of Policy and Government, the Arizona State University-SFI Center for Biosocial Complex Systems, and the Innovation for Jobs (I4J) network, the workshop included over thirty speakers in total representing over twenty different institutions. The organizing committee was comprised of ten scholars and business leaders representing nine different organizations and institutions.  A core objective of the workshop was to test for the existence of a consensus around one or more specific directions for "updating the production function", accounting for the emerging realities of the algorithmic economy. In the course of the discussions, substantial agreement emerged on the need for better methods to measure the value of goods and services and for improved skills-based spatial metrics to track the evolving nature of work.  The workshop was successful in coalescing a community of experts from diverse fields interested in the algorithmic nature of production and its implications for the future of work. It was also successful in seeding a specific set of future cross-disciplinary research collaborations. Additionally, the workshop supported the early definition and development of data- and structure-rich analyses of workforce dynamics falling within the science of science policy, an immediate manifestation of which was was the creation, out of the workshop, of a new company with the specific purpose of applying empirical models of workforce dynamics to workforce planning. That company has received an invitation to submit a proposal to the the National Science Foundation?s I-Corps program.
