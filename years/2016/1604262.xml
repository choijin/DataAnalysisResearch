<AbstractNarration>This award is made as part of the FY 2016 Mathematical Sciences Postdoctoral Research Fellowships Program. Each of the fellowships supports a research and training project at a host institution in the mathematical sciences, including applications to other disciplines, under the mentorship of a sponsoring scientist. The title of the project for this fellowship to Maria M. Gillespie is "Connections between Crystal Theory, Representations, Tableaux Combinatorics, and Macdonald Polynomials." The host institution for the fellowship is the University of California-Davis, and the sponsoring scientist is Anne Schilling.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The three years of the PI's Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Mathematics resulted in five published research papers, two conference proceedings, and one expository book chapter in mathematics, as well as sixteen invited lectures.   Intellectual Merit: The PI, along with coauthors Graham Hawkes, Wencin Poh, and Anne Schilling, found a combinatorial characterization of the quantum queer supercrystals that arise in supersymmetric string theory in physics.  This gives a queer Lie superalgebra analog of known results for ordinary Lie algebra representations, filling in an important missing piece of the theory and providing fast algorithms for computing these representations and their tensor products.  The PI also collaborated with Jake Levinson and Kevin Purbhoo on a series of three papers on the combinatorics of type B Schubert curves and new crystal-like structures that arise in that setting.  We showed that the monodromy of the map from a type B Schubert curve to the projective line is given by a combinatorial operation on shifted Young tableaux, and derived new geometric results on Schubert curves from these combinatorial rules.  We also discovered an analog of Schur function crystals for the Schur Q-functions, and found a new, fast Littlewood-Richardson rule for the Schur Q-functions.  In addition, the PI, Ken G. Monks, and Ken M. Monks solved an open problem on enumeration of k-bounded anchored permutations, which are permutations of 1 through n that start at 1, end at n, and such that the absolute difference between any two consecutive numbers is at most k.  We proved a conjectured recursion for the 3-bounded anchored permutations and showed that for every k, the k-bounded anchored permutations are enumerated by some finite depth linear homogeneous recurrence.   The PI published a solo expository paper on Schubert calculus in an AWM book volume called ``Recent Trends in Algebraic Combinatorics''.  Broader Impacts: The PI organized an AMS special session, co-organized the high school summer program Prove it! Math Academy, served on the USA(J)MO Problem Selection Committee, and volunteered at several local K-12 mathematics outreach events.  She also maintained her math blog, Mathematical Gemstones, which is written for a wider audience to enjoy the results of her research.
