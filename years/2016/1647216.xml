<AbstractNarration>This Phase I SBIR project is directed at developing  a portable, sensitive, and affordable device to detect M. tuberculosis (Mtb) in sputum samples and simultaneously determine the multidrug resistance profile of the pathogen, all within 3 days of sputum collection (It takes more than 6 weeks using current technology).   By significantly reducing the time to detect viable Mtb and obtain its drug resistance profile in patient specimens, the device being developed promises to improve outcomes and reduce healthcare costs. Tuberculosis (TB) is one of the major public-health challenges in the world today, with an estimated 1.5 million deaths in 2013. More alarmingly, the incidence of multi-drug resistant (MDR) TB is rapidly increasing, especially in low resource environments.  Being able to detect the presence of low loads of mycobacteria and gaining knowledge about the drug resistance profile of a particular isolate in 3 days will be a game changer in global community?s efforts to combat the spread of TB (esp. MDR TB). It will lead to better outcomes for patients (less mortality, quicker recovery), and also better public health (less transmission to others and less fostering of drug resistance in populations).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The device being developed incorporates two key technologies that enable it to achieve rapid detection and drug-resistance profiling: (1) super-paramagnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) functionalized with moieties that bind to bacterial cells, and (2) microchannel Electrical Impedance Spectroscopy (m-EIS) that is able to detect in real time the growth or death of cells in suspension.  The proposed approach involves (a) using MNPs to collect the ~1000 Mtb cells present in 2-10ml of sputum sample into a small (200ul) of growth medium during the standard decontamination process (b) dispensing the 200ul suspension into 16 microwells, each containing different formulations of freeze-dried growth-media and/or drugs of interest (c) monitoring the cells in each well m-EIS.  The pre-concentration will take &lt;1 hour, and the monitoring of death/growth/stasis will take 3 days. In Phase I, the team will (1) verify the efficacy of the pre-concentration technique,  (2) establish the ability of the m-EIS method to record in real time the death, proliferation, or statis of mycobacteria, and (3) design a prototype cassette containing 16 wells, and fabricating it using 3D-printing (stereolithography).  In addition, a detailed design (electrical, mechanical and fluidic) of the automated system (disposables and nondisposable hardware) to be built in Phase II will be completed, and other applications of the core approach explored.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Introduction  Sepsis and septic shock are one of the leading contributors to death in US Hospitals, responsible for 250,000 deaths annually (estimated at 30-50% of all hospital deaths).  For these conditions, time is of the essence.  For instance, the administration of targeted (versus broad-spectrum) antibiotic therapy in the first 5-6 hours of septic shock increases the likelihood of survival by ~ 50%.     In fact, for all bacterial (and yeast) infections:  Quicker administration of targeted (effective) Rx results in improved patient outcomes Quicker patient recovery reduces cost to healthcare system Less use of broad-spectrum antibiotics reduces the proliferation of resistant microorganisms      Sepsis treatment is very expensive. It often involves a prolonged stay in the intensive care unit and complex therapies with high costs. The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality lists sepsis as the most expensive condition treated in U.S. hospitals, costing nearly $24 billion in 2013.  People with sepsis are two to three times more likely to be readmitted to the hospital as people with many other conditions, including heart failure, pneumonia, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Readmissions due to sepsis are also   Our Phase 1 SBIR was to demonstrate the technical rational for our technology to enable an FDA approved commercializable product to address a major market need (which we succeeded in doing).  more expensive than readmissions due to any of these other conditions.  Technical  During Phase 1, we successfully completed the following Specific Aims:      (1)  Demonstrate the efficacy of our MNP based sample preparation/pre-concentration technique for pathogens present in blood, urine, etc.  (2)  Demonstrate the ability of the m-EIS method to record in real time, the death, proliferation, or stasis of pathogens in the presence of candidate drug formulations  (3)  Design a prototype cassette containing 16 wells, and fabricate it using stereo-lithography   (4)  Develop a detailed design (electrical, mechanical and fluidic) of the automated  system (disposables and non-disposable hardware) that we will be built in Phase II.   Market Reserach  ImpeDx participated in the full NSF I-Core program during our Phase 1 period of performance.  We interviewed dozens of potential customers (infectious disease clinicians, clinical laboratory directors, and financial stakeholders) that order and conduct clinical diagnostic tests, as well as numerous potential business development partners.  Approximately, 15 million blood cultures are performed in the US annually.  Approximately 15% test positive (2.2 million) and subsequently get tested for: (i) pathogen anti-biotic susceptibility (AST), (ii) minimum inhibitory concentration of those antibiotics (MIC), and (iii) identification (ID).   Thus, the market size for blood analysis alone is over 2 million samples per year.  Urine analysis also comprises a major market for AST and ID.  It has been estimated that symptomatic UTIs result in as many as 7 million visits to outpatient clinics annually. The annual cost to the health care system of the United States attributable to community-acquired UTI alone is estimated to be approximately $1.6 billion.
