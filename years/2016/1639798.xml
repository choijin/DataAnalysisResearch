<AbstractNarration>This award will support attendance by early career researchers at the 18th Rust Belt RNA Meeting Ciliate Molecular Biology Conference to be held at the Marriott Hotel Downtown in Cleveland, OH on October 14-15, 2016.  The format of the meeting is a combination of talks and posters, which will promote scientific exchange in both formal and informal settings. A number of activities are aimed at professional development and mentoring for early career scientists. There will be ample opportunity for sharing latest research results and for networking. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ever-increasing impact of RNA science has been fueled by its immense potential to shed light on a wide array of important problems ranging from the origin of life to the molecular basis of inter-cellular communication. Some of these advances will be among the topics featured in the scientific sessions, which will include:  biosynthesis, processing and export of RNA; translation and RNA decay; RNA-RNA and RNA-Protein interactions; and RNA in disease, health and biotechnology. Results will be disseminated by publication of abstracts on the meeting website.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Project Outcomes The Rustbelt RNA Meeting (RRM) is a regional conference focusing on RNA&ndash;related research that is held annually in the Midwestern United States.  The RRM attracts participants from both research intensive and predominantly undergraduate institutions (PUIs) located in the "Rustbelt" and surrounding areas.  A central goal of the meeting is to offer opportunities for professional development of trainees through presentation of talks and posters combined with events designed to promote networking and career development.  Overview The 18th annual RRM provided a professional scientific meeting that was easily affordable for students, postdocs and principal investigators from colleges and universities of all sizes with different combinations of research and teaching mission.  The meeting was held in Cleveland, OH at the Marriott Hotel Downtown on October 14&shy;15, 2016, the third time in this city and the second time in this venue.  A key advantage of the location is its accessibility by car to longstanding attendees from Ohio, Michigan, Indiana, Kentucky, New York, western Pennsylvania and West Virginia; also, because flying to Cleveland is relatively inexpensive, newer attendees from Illinois, Minnesota, New Jersey, eastern Pennsylvania and Toronto, Canada were also welcomed.  The 2016 meeting assembled researchers with diverse backgrounds and interests in RNA science ranging from genomics to biophysics, thereby expanding the horizons of all attendees.  Through a full schedule of nearly 180 posters and 28 oral presentations by student and post&shy;doctoral trainees, the RRM provided a high caliber intensive experience for participants and fostered collaborative interactions between trainees and PIs across traditional disciplinary boundaries.  The meeting featured a keynote lecture by Professor Melissa Moore (HHMI, University of Massachusetts, CSO at Moderna Therapeutics); remarkably, Prof. Moore is the RRM's first female keynote speaker/distinguished guest.  She, along with three other scientists at different stages of their careers and with diverse professional experience, participated in an optional moderated panel discussion focused on career issues that took place following the RRM proper.  Intellectual Merit The intellectual merit of the RRM revolves around the sharing of new research in RNA science, broadly defined.  Recent years have witnessed breakthroughs in the identification and characterization of regulatory and catalytic RNAs, as well as in genome-wide approaches to understanding the RNA expression and folding.  The 2016 RRM attracted the largest, most geographically diverse group of participants in its history where trainees and PIs alike took advantage of unprecedented l formal and informal earning and networking opportunities.  The meeting covered topics ranging from mechanisms and regulation of RNA processing and decay to RNA chemistry and structure-function analysis.  Attendees were exposed to a broad array of techniques and tools employed in cutting edge RNA research performed at the cellular, molecular and atomic levels, as well as computational approaches for data analysis.  New trainees as well as junior faculty and senior scientists looking to move their research in new directions benefited from the talks, posters, and energized atmosphere of the RRM.  Like previous meetings, the 2016 RRM created a natural environment for forging interdisciplinary collaborations between researchers at diverse institutions.  Broader Impacts The broader impacts of the RRM revolve around providing an affordable yet high- quality conference that undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral trainees can participate in and benefit from. The meeting has a rich history of spotlighting trainees, nearly all of whom presented their research.  All but two of the twenty-eight oral presentations were delivered by students or post&shy;doctoral scholars, as were the vast majority of posters. The poster session featured 178 entries judged by nearly 50 faculty members, two per poster.  Each talk was followed by incisive questions from the audience, and the exchanges between trainees and PIs at the poster session were also lively.  Unique features of the 2016 meeting were:  1) oral presentation awards for multiple undergraduates; 2) the most posters presented by undergraduate researchers to date, many hailing from PUIs, 3) a moderated panel discussion focused on career-related issues faced by trainees featuring representatives from the NSF and multiple academic institutions; and 4) PIs from PUIs, including one under-represented minority, serving as session chairs.  According to custom since 2013, NSF funds were utilized in part to fund travel awards for 15 under-represented minority trainees.  The meeting followed the traditional Friday&shy;Saturday schedule, which allowed for talks and posters during the first evening and additional talks the following morning, with an end time early enough for most participants to conveniently drive home.  In summary, the RRM is an exceptionally valuable meeting for researchers pursuing diverse aspects of RNA science.  Although regional, it features very high quality talks and posters comparable to (and, in many cases, arguably better than) national and international meetings; it is affordable and conveniently located; and provides outstanding opportunities for trainees to present their findings and interact with PIs and fellow students in their field.
