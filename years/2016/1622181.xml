<AbstractNarration>This SBIR Phase I project seeks to develop a novel and fully sustainable/renewable anti-corrosion epoxy primer formulation that meets or exceeds the corrosion protection that is provided by the toxic chromate-based systems.  In addition, it is projected this primer will replace other epoxy primers that rely on additional valuable metal assets, for example zinc.  The pioneering approach developed in this project utilizes US resources/scientific knowledge and it employs a new class of all-organic anti-corrosion pigments bringing in a fresh and very effective scientific method.  These pigments will be manufactured in the US with no reliance on foreign metal supplies or labor; the chemical processing methods developed in this SBIR effort are US patent pending and are both environmentally and economically outstanding in performance.  This SBIR project is a case where US based innovation and science combine to create US jobs in manufacturing and bring to light a transformational technology in the anti-corrosion epoxy primer business.   Stopping corrosion keeps US commercial and defense assets in service, keeps productive people working, and keeps our country safe and prosperous.  Mitigating corrosion is truly one of the important technological challenges ahead in the 21st century as natural resources and energy become limited and more costly.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project brings to fruition first a detailed new and disruptive chemical synthesis technology for an economically and environmentally sound production of specific all-organic anti-corrosive pigments.  The project utilizes these all-organic anti-corrosive pigments to advance and create a new class of Low volatile-organic-compound (VOC) anti-corrosion epoxy primers based on the art and science of solvent selection and blending.   This combination of innovations is positioned to provide the first non-chromate and all-organic anti-corrosion epoxy primer that can replace with ease the present toxic and costly chromate-based primers.  Current synthetic technologies cannot afford a cost-effective route to the additives and this program addresses that concern and will prepare several examples at the 100 g to 1 Kg scale to fully demonstrate the technology and provide parametric data for the design of larger chemical reactors and processes.   This Phase I project will also create a new series of high-solids epoxy coatings that meet the Low-VOC emission value, dry time, corrosion protection, and adhesion requirements as laid out in appropriate military standards;  primers developed in the project will be tested to meet these stringent requirements.  These data will provide the critical performance and test data necessary to validate the coating formulations for certification and acceptance in both the commercial and defense marketplaces.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  We have developed a revolutionary new series of epoxy primers that prevent corrosion using a breakthrough new technology of fully sustainable and eco-friendly anti-corrosion organic pigments (ACOPs).  We intend to continue to refine and improve this system and bring it to market as soon as possible.   For decades the world has depended on chromate-based primers to protect metal from corrosion; chromates were unmatched in performance and affordability.  Chromates, however, have severe health and environmental consequences and are now mostly banned.  This creates a global need and thus an expansive commercial market for a replacement for chromate-based primers.  Our goal was to formulate, produce, and bring to market a replacement for banned chromate metal primers.  There are no effective replacements on the market today, and the lack of replacement has markedly worsened the global problem of corrosion.  This program continues to innovate chemical synthesis methods to create ACOP additives in a manner that is both cost effective and environmentally sound.  We will prove these methods at pilot-scale levels that will provide the data necessary for building a commercial ACOP production facility.  The ultimate objective of this program is to deliver a fully-sustainable, cost-effective, and technically-advanced commercial epoxy primer formulation with unmatched protection of global assets and infrastructure from corrosion.  This program continues to advance the synthesis and use of single-molecule, organic-based, anti-corrosion pigments, a unique and patented approach.  These unique organic pigments are added to a high-solids, epoxy-based primer formulation that provides superb corrosion protection, ease of application using standard equipment, and the ability to mitigate corrosion in scratches and defects that occurs in real world applications.  Thus, our work indicates that we have a real and practical replacement for chromates.  Concurrently, we are also creating methods to markedly increase in-house production of our proven epoxy resin to meet anticipated market needs.  The objective is to continue to bring down cost, reduce waste, and maintain the efficiencies needed for U.S. production in a commercially viable method of operation.  At the conclusion of our project, we anticipate having a fully accepted and approved ACOP-based epoxy primer for both commercial and DoD customers.   The world needs more effective ways to control metal corrosion to lengthen the life of aging infratructure, utilities, transportation systems, and buildings.  Developing nations need efficient and economical protection of their metal assets; funds used on protection and constant replacement of metal could be used on economic development, agriculture, and social programs.  Enhanced scientific knowledge of methods to produce affordable organic pigments to replace toxic chromates will have great environmental and human health benefits.  Although chromates are banned in the U.S. and Europe, they are still in use in some parts of the world; they need to be replaced with a non-toxic substitute.  We have every indication that we are on the verge of delivering a breakthrough product to a world trying to control the staggering problem of metal deterioration.
