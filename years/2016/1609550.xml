<AbstractNarration>With this award, the Chemistry of Life Processes Program in the Chemistry Division is funding Professor Rudi Fasan of the University of Rochester to develop and investigate enzymes (biological catalysts) that convert carbon-hydrogen (C-H) bonds into carbon-nitrogen (C-N) bonds. Carbon-nitrogen bonds are common in both man-made and naturally occurring organic molecules. Currently available methods for making C-N bonds from C-H bonds largely rely on the use of rare and expensive metals and wasteful reagents.  Catalytic methods for the construction of C-N chemical bonds are potentially extremely valuable for the manufacture of commodity chemicals and pharmaceuticals. This project is developing enzymes that increase the rate of new C-N bond formation starting from easily accessible, low or zero waste raw materials. Since these chemical reactions do not occur in nature, this research has broad and far-reaching implications toward expanding the range of synthetically-valuable chemical reactions. Graduate and undergraduate students involved in the project are receiving cross-disciplinary training. Minority students actively participate in the research.  Dr. Fasan offers of a hands-on chemistry course to high school students of the Rochester City School District. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Fasan research group has recently discovered that engineered cytochrome P450 enzymes constitute promising systems for promoting  intramolecular C(sp3)-H amination using azide-based substrates. Organic azides are particularly attractive substrates for C-H amination due to their ready synthetic accessibility, excellent atom economy, and the release of inert nitrogen gas as the reaction by-product. Building on these promising results, this project explores the scope of P450-catalyzed C-H amination reactions in the context of different azide-containing substrates and implements strategies to enhance the C-H amination activity and selectivity of these catalysts. In addition, the mechanism and catalytic intermediates involved in the P450-mediated C-H amination reactions are determined via a combination of complementary approaches. Ultimately, this research is expected to generate knowledge about the scope of engineered P450 enzymes as catalytic platforms for mediating the aminofunctionalization of unactivated aliphatic C-H bonds and fundamental understanding of the mechanism of these novel enzymatic transformations.  Graduate and undergraduate students involved in the project are receiving cross-disciplinary training in chemistry, enzymology, protein engineering, and spectroscopy.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The direct functionalization of carbon-hydrogen (C-H) bonds into carbon-nitrogen (C-N) bonds represents a most important and synthetically valuable chemical transformation owing to the ubiquitous presence of amine functionalities in organic molecules. Despite important progress has been made in the development of synthetic catalysts for C-H amination, these systems suffer from important drawbacks such as limited catalytic efficiency and the need for rare and toxic metals. This NSF-funded project has contributed to the development of new, efficient, and sustainable biological catalysts, based on iron-dependent enzymes, for catalyzing C-H amination reactions and other new-to-nature chemical transformations. For example, this project has resulted in the design of engineered cytochrome P450s capable of catalyzing an intramolecular C-H amination reaction with a catalytic efficiency that exceeds by two orders of magnitude that of previously available chemical catalysts for this transformation. This research has also contributed valuable new insights into the mechanism of P450-catalyzed C-H amination reactions and into structural determinants important for enhancing this non-native reactivity over their native catalytic activity. This knowledge is expected to further guide the future design and development of improved biocatalysts for these synthetically valuable reactions. Finally, guided by these mechanistic insights, this project has culminated in the discovery of various natural iron-dependent metalloenzymes as promising scaffolds for the development of new "nitrene transferases", that is enzymes useful for promoting C-H amination reactions and other nitrene-mediated reactions. Altogether, these studies and findings are expected to pave the way to the development of efficient and sustainable biocatalytic strategies for the selective formation of C-N bonds for organic synthesis and other applications. This project has provided important opportunities for interdisciplinary training and professional development for six graduate students and five undergraduate students, including under. These students have received training in (bio)catalysis, synthetic organic chemistry, protein engineering, enzymology, and molecular biology. Professional training for both graduate and undergraduate students participating in this project has been further realized through their participation in manuscript writing, through the attendance and presentation of their research findings at local and national scientific meetings, and through visits to the laboratory of international collaborators. In addition, this project has entailed a number of outreach activities through which both elementary school students and high school students have been exposed to the process of scientific discovery and given a glimpse of the life of a scientist by means of on-site visits, hands-on workshops, and other engaging activities. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 07/14/2020<br>      Modified by: Rudi&nbsp;Fasan</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
