<AbstractNarration>PI: Schrlau, Michael    &lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: 1604893&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project proposes to create a very tiny biosensor for identifying and quantifying biomolecules inside a single living cell. The investigator proposes a novel way of performing selective measurement inside living cells, (instead of currently used methods of breaking open the cell), and after proving the approach plan is to quantify cellular metabolic state in real time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the project is to create the ability to identify and quantify biomolecules inside a single living cell with minimal perturbation and over long periods of time using electrochemical techniques.  Multifunctional nanoprobe will be constructed, capable of injecting fluids in order to conduct self-contained electrochemical measurements inside confined aqueous microenvironments. The nanoprobe is then utilized to inject a reaction-enabling substrate into the cell for selectively quantifying senescence-associated beta-galactosidase, a cytosolic enzyme, an indicator of many chronic diseases. It is proposed to use carbon nanotube (CNT) -based nanoprobes will provide the ability for selectively quantifying cell senescence in real-time.  It is anticipated that at the conclusion of the project, there will be a new analytical tool and technique for quantifying electroactive biomolecules within single living cells. Simple, scalable template-based nanomanufacturing processes will be employed to integrate the nanoelectrodes into the tip of a pulled glass capillary without nanoassembly.  The CNT-based nanoprobe is designed to readily fit standard cell physiology instruments, thus facilitating easy technological dissemination, broad utilization, and potential commercialization. The outcome of this proposal is likely to provide a first-in-class CNT-based tool for a novel minimally invasive analytical technique for gathering quantitative data from single living cells. The proposed efforts will generate new insights into fundamental cell physiology, which will ultimately help identify the early onset of diseases, facilitate drug development and improve therapeutic efficacy. More broadly, the development of intracellular electrochemistry will advance scientific knowledge in nanotechnology, materials science and engineering, electrochemistry, cell biology, and biomedicine. Further, the project will provide several high-impact research and educational opportunities for students at all levels as well as recruits and will support underrepresented groups in STEM.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   The goal of this NSF project was to create a tiny sensor that could probe a single living cell and determine if the cell was in the early stages of disease.  To accomplish this, a carbon nanotube-based needle-like sensor, a thousand times smaller than the thickness of human hair, was developed to measure the amount of disease-related molecules inside a living cell using electrochemical techniques (using electricity to determine chemistry).  These sensors provide new analytical tools for measuring many important molecules within single living cells and can help medical researchers better understand the early onset of several chronic diseases that affect our country's population. Furthermore, these sensors and the processes used to make them advance the fields of nanomanufacturing and electrochemistry, as well as provide tools for other applications, including ultrasmall sensors for measuring temperature and ways to produce corrosion-resistant coatings.   Intellectual Merit: This NSF project created a biosensor with carbon nanoelectrodes residing at the tip of a needle that is a thousand times smaller than the thickness of human hair.  Simple, scalable template-based nanomanufacturing processes were employed to integrate these nanoelectrodes into the tip of a pulled glass capillary without assembly.  It was demonstrated that these processes could also be used to form micro- and nanoscale carbon structures from other templates.  Furthermore, carbon nanotube-based electrodes could be modified with nanoparticles to improve their measurement sensitivity and selectivity.  It was demonstrated that this sensor could measure small amounts of disease-related molecules inside a confined fluid microenvironment. Due to the low-cost manufacturing process, this nanosensor provides a unique and widely accessible tool for the electrochemical characterization of aqueous and non-aqueous microenvironments, including disease-related molecules inside living cells.   Broader Impacts:  The sensors developed in this NSF project make it possible to gain new insights into fundamental cell physiology, which will ultimately help identify the early onset of disease, facilitate drug development, and improve therapeutic efficacy.  Furthermore, the technology, techniques, and approaches developed in this project can be used to create new wearable, implantable, or point-of-care devices for personalized health monitoring and medicine.  Not only do the outcomes of this project advance nanomanufacturing, electrochemistry, and cell physiology, they provide tools for other applications, including ultrasmall sensors for measuring temperature and corrosion-resistant coatings.  Throughout the four years of NSF support, this project provided exceptional educational experiences for nine students, seven of which were female, at different levels of education, from PhD students to high school students. Moreover, these students shared their passion for research and the project with middle and high school students through several free nanotechnology-based workshops.
