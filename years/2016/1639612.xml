<AbstractNarration>This award provides partial travel support for about 20 US graduate students and post-doctoral scholars to attend the 12th International Symposium on Bioinformatics Research and Applications (ISBRA) that will be held on June 5-8, 2016 at Belarus State University, Minsk, Belarus. The symposium provides a forum for the exchange of ideas and results among researchers, developers, and practitioners working on topics in bioinformatics and computational biology and their applications, ranging from comparative genomics and population genetics to structure prediction and protein-protein interaction networks. The symposium provides ample opportunities for interaction between researchers with complementary expertise thus fostering new collaborations. Students and post-doctoral scholars will gain critical formative experience that will enhance their research and prepare them to and to become the future research leaders in the field. Participation of women and minority students will be particularly encouraged.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ISBRA 2016 materials including the call for papers, symposium program, as well as short abstract proceedings will be made publicly available on the symposium website (http://www.cs.gsu.edu/isbra/). Full versions of selected abstracts presented at the symposium will be invited to peer-reviewed special issues of IEEE/ACM Transactions on Computational Biology and Bioinformatics, BMC Bioinformatics and BMC Genomics.</AbstractNarration>
