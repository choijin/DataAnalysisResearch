<AbstractNarration>An award is made to Oklahoma State University (OSU) to acquire an Illumina NextSeq500 genomic sequencer.  Sequencing technologies are essential to STEM curricula that include bioinformatics at all student levels. The NextSeq will provide hands-on undergraduate research experiences.  The instrument will be used to enhance the development of a diverse, globally competitive STEM workforce through the Bioinformatics Certificate Graduate Program, designed to improve academic and workforce employability of graduate students. The project will enhance research from interdisciplinary users including faculty from Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Botany, Integrative Biology, Plant and Soil Science, Animal Science, Veterinary Sciences, Microbiology, Plant and Soil Science, Entomology, Zoology, and many more. The instrument will dramatically improve capacity to identify pathogens in metagenomics studies for forensics of food contamination including improved national security through the National Institute for Microbial Forensics &amp; Food and Agricultural Biosecurity program which seeks to rapidly identify pathogens related to bioterrorism.  The project will benefit society by strengthening genetic marker breeding research in wheat, beef, and many other agriculturally important crops and animals. Existing interdisciplinary programs that require significant sequencing such as the Wheat Improvement Team, The Oklahoma Center for Respiratory and Infectious Disease, and the Bioenergy Center will benefit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The NextSeq500 is a high-throughput sequencing machine capable of generating up to 120 giga-base-pairs of sequence data per run. This instrument has the capacity needed for eukaryotic de novo genome sequencing, RNA-seq experiments, metagenomic experiments, and other modern high-throughput data experiments at low cost and rapid turnaround. Access to this instrument will strengthen research, research training, collaborations, and outreach across multiple interdisciplinary programs at Oklahoma State University, including existing national leadership programs in agricultural breeding, plant virus biodiversity, plant bioterrorism forensics, population genetics of bald and golden eagles in collaboration with Native American tribes in Oklahoma, collaborative projects with regional institutions including targeted breeding at Langston University (an HBCU), environmental metagenomics projects related to evolution, climate, ecosystem remediation, and multiple de novo sequencing projects of non-model organisms. Undergraduate students will be trained by collecting and sequencing environmental specimens and learning associated bioinformatics in classes and workshops. This instrument strategically complements existing cyberinfrastructure for data management, high throughput data, and big data analyses at OSU.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Nature of the Project:</p> <p>This project funded the purchase of a genome sequencing instrument large enough to sequence most eukaryotic genomes making it the largest publicly-owned sequencing instrument in the State of Oklahoma. We selected the NextSeq500 from Illumina, based on the state-of-the-art in sequencing at the time, and predicted usage. The sequencer is operated from the largest Core Resource Facility on the Oklahoma State University Campus, now known as the Genomics Center. This sequencer replaced an obsolete sequencer the Core Facility had operated for five years. The budgeting infrastructure was mature and made the transition smooth. The use of sequencing in multiple disciplines is growing dramatically, and the need for a larger and more cost-efficient instrument was immediate. In addition to providing sequencing services, the Genomics Center is an important part of recruiting students and faculty, training researchers in new technologies, providing workshops for sequencing analysis, and maintaining or developing new technologies as they become available. Oklahoma State has been recognized nationally as having one of the most diverse student populations and we feel a duty to provide this training to that diverse group.</p> <p>Outcomes of Project:</p> <p>Over the course of this grant, the instrument usage grew until it operated at maximum capacity. Much of this growth was attributable to the excellent quality of data produced by the NextSeq500. We also credit growth to the personalized service, rapid turnaround times, and experimental design training offered by the Center and its staff. The Facility also championed Genomics and Bioinformatics as growing interdisciplinary research fields, and worked to provide biologists training in data-science aspects of working with large data sets produced by sequencers. Workshops and new courses were developed and offered to multiple disciplines across campus. The data produced, and the training provided led to better science, and may have helped to raise Oklahoma State University to the Carnegie Institutions Tier-1 research status.</p> <p>Sequencing projects vary tremendously at Land Grant Universities. We have sequenced genomes from viruses, bacteria, plants, and animals, while also sequencing biomes such as dirt, feces, rumen contents, and good/bad interactions between (or within) organisms. Nonetheless, the most prevalent use of the sequencer was to identify the RNA present in multiple samples from different experimental categories. These might include treated vs. untreated cells, infected vs. uninfected organisms, drought-tolerant vs. non-drought tolerant crops, and growth signals from RNAs in roots, leaf tips, seeds, and livestock. The most important aspects of having this genome sequencer at our University are not just samples, but results. Some examples of what we have learned include improving our understanding of never before seen viruses in plants, gene expression changes in single cells during feline leukemia infections, new computer algorithms for detecting antibiotic resistance in bacteria, learning about metabolic strategies in plant clades, and how to more rapidly detect potential bioterrorism.</p> <p>When new technologies emerged, such as ways to tag and then sequence individual cells, we worked with researchers, vendors, and the sequencing instrument provider to develop these protocols as rapidly as possible. This meant working on projects before the technologies were mature, and sometimes failing (and then absorbing the costs of those failures rather than passing them onto the researcher funds). These are the special roles of Core Facilities, and are an enticement for recruitment of new faculty and students.</p> <p>This grant and this instrument are having a dramatic impact on the education of researchers by driving new initiatives in Bioinformatics. These will be long lasting changes, and include establishing new interactions between life scientists and data scientists.&nbsp; With a sequencer capable of delivering hundreds of billions of DNA or RNA nucleotides per day, computational biology workshops were needed to rapidly bring researchers up to speed. New curricula for undergraduate and graduate students became a high priority. Even with an existing Bioinformatics Program at Oklahoma State, change is happening so fast that very different teaching ideas are needed. Training will have to target a diverse group of students and their specific needs instead of memorizing entire disciplines. Also, this expertise is needed outside of traditional academia. Sequencing has provided the push for a new type of Ph.D. Program in Bioinformatics at Oklahoma State University.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 12/22/2019<br>      Modified by: Peter&nbsp;R&nbsp;Hoyt</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1626257/1626257_10457654_1577052763270_Data-carpentry-day1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1626257/1626257_10457654_1577052763270_Data-carpentry-day1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Data-science Workshop"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1626257/1626257_10457654_1577052763270_Data-carpentry-day1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Data-science Workshop"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">OpenRefine-to-R</div> <div class="imageCredit">Peter R.
