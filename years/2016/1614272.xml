<AbstractNarration>This project will investigate the effect of China's pollution on plant litter decomposition.  Plant litter consists of dead plant foliage, wood, and roots.  Its turnover is an essential process in maintaining organic carbon within soils and is facilitated largely by microorganisms.  The unprecedented levels of nitrogen in China due to industrial pollution have drastically increased soil nitrogen concentration.  It is unclear how the elevated nitrogen will effect plant litter decomposition and the native microbial communities.  Creating laboratory incubations of Mt Changbai field site soil amended with nitrogen, researchers can monitor changes in the composition of plant litter and the microbes involved in plant litter turnover. This research will be conducted in collaboration Dr. Xudong Zhang, a noted expert in soil geochemistry, at the Chinese Academy of Science Institute of Applied Ecology (CAS IAE). Researchers aim to elucidate the long-term impact of elevated nitrogen on forest soil ecosystems because they are important reservoirs of carbon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will investigate the effect of elevated nitrogen deposition on the plant litter-degrading microbial community in Mt. Changbai forest soil. This experiment will directly test for the link between stable soil organic carbon lignin and nitrogen deposition.  Fresh soil from a field site in the Mt. Changbai will be sampled and amended with lignin and varying concentrations of ammonium nitrate. During incubation, all soil microcosms will be routinely sampled for degraded lignin analysis using alkaline copper oxide. The microcosms will also be sampled weekly for microbial community structure and function analysis via next generation sequencing.  Using bioinformatics, samples will be compared to determine differentially abundant species in lignin microcosms at the different levels of nitrogen addition. A better understanding of nitrogen and carbon cycling will lead to better management practices of soil carbon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award under the East Asia and Pacific Summer Institutes program supports summer research by a U.S. graduate student and is jointly funded by NSF and the Chinese Ministry of Science and Technology.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    The effect of elevated nitrogen on the microbial decomposition of lignin in Changbai mountain soil EAPSI Fellow: Hannah L. Woo (University of Tennessee)  Graduate Advisor: Dr. Terry C. Hazen (University of Tennessee) Host Advisor: Dr. Xudong Zhang (Institute of Applied Ecology, Chinese Academy of Science) Intellectual Merit The unprecedented levels of nitrogen emissions from industrialization have drastically increased rates of nitrogen deposition in China. The consequences of excessively high nitrogen are unknown.  The degradation of an important component of soil organic matter, lignin, has been found to decrease in response to elevated nitrogen in some situations while increasing in others. Since lignin degradation is largely mediated by microorganisms, the unclear fate of lignin may be better predicted by characterizing the lignin-degrading community. Using amplicon sequencing, this study will determine if elevated nitrogen deposition changes the lignin-degrading community. Soil Sampling of Changbai Mountain  Changbai Mountain is located at the border of China and North Korea. Soil samples were collected from two forest sites at different elevations that have been managed and extensively studied by the Chinese Academy of Science.   Laboratory Incubations and Future Analysis Soil was amended with lignin and nitrogen in the lab to enrich for the microbes capable of degrading lignin and to simulate the effect of elevated nitrogen. After incubation, DNA was extracted and prepared for 16S rRNA gene and ITS gene amplicon sequencing.  While at the IAE CAS, soil samples were also analyzed for their bacterial to fungal biomass ratios, the state of lignin degradation, and total microbial abundance.  The evidence will provide insight into changes in soil microbial community diversity.  Broader Impacts  The project included research presentations by the PI at the IAE CAS and UT.  There was extensive cross-training in microbiological and soil science techniques between members of host institution and the PI including amino sugars analysis, alkaline CuO analysis for lignin, and cell staining.  Lastly, the project initiated new collaboration between IAE CAS Zhang lab and UT Hazen lab. Acknowledgements The author would like to thank her host Dr. Xudong Zhang, Dr. Hongbo He, the staff and graduate students of the Zhang lab for their mentorship and support throughout the summer.
