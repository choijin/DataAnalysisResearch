<AbstractNarration>This project focuses on two related topics in algebraic geometry, the study of solutions of systems of polynomial equations, that are motivated by their connections with physical theories (string theory and gauge theory). The first topic is Gromov-Witten (GW) theory, which roughly speaking is about a systematic way of counting numbers of curves with particular constraints in a space defined by a set of polynomial equations. For example on  a plane there are four conics passing three given points and two given lines in general positions. The second topic is Donaldson-Thomas (DT) theory, which studies properties of the space parametrizing sets of polynomials defining one dimensional objects with certain topological constraints in a space. In a so-called Calabi-Yau space, a series of remarkable conjectures say that counting using GW theory is equivalent to that using DT theory. Different branches of mathematics are linked together by these two theories and deep properties of geometric objects have been uncovered by calculating invariants they give rise to. In this project the PI will investigate a conjectured duality between these two theories and relate them to other branches of mathematics and physics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In more detail, the projects in this proposal are designed to study several aspects of enumerative properties of the moduli spaces of geometric objects in algebraic geometry. The first topic is Gromov-Witten theory. The PI will study birational transformations between GW invariants, calculate the quantum cohomology of symplectic Deligne-Mumford stacks, and relate the monodromy of the quantum connections to the monodromy coming from the equivalence between the derived categories. The second topic is Donaldson-Thomas theory. The PI will study local DT invariants via Berkovich analytic spaces, apply the cotangent invariants of the PI and R. Thomas to find more dualities for geometric  spaces, and investigate the motivic Donaldson-Thomas invariants by the method of motivic integration.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The award of the project DMS-1600997 is in Algebraic Geometry with relations to string theory and gauge theory in theoretical physics.  The project explored several enumerative counting invariants in the universe inspired by physical duality theories.      When we are very young as small kids, we begin to count numbers like 1,2,3,4&hellip;., the natural numbers.  This was actually the first kind of counting our parents taught us.  When a kid is growing up, he is learning more and more difficult counting objects, like rational numbers, real numbers and complex numbers even geometric objects like triangles, squares, polytopes, etc in high school and college.      The award studied the enumerative geometry to count more fancy geometric objects in the universe such as Riemann surfaces called complex or algebraic curves.  Roughly speaking the theory will count number of Riemann surfaces in a spacetime manifold.  The PI has further proved several enumerative counting invariants dualities inspired by both mathematical and physical theories. In Gromov-Witten theory the PI has proved the Crepant transformation conjecture before, saying that two birational geometric objects have the equivalent Gromov-Witten theory, i.e. the counting complex curves theory is invariant under a topological surgery. This result helps the PI to prove more interesting conjecture called the Monodromy Conjecture in Gromov-Witten theory, exploring more deep relations in the geometric objects.      In Physics Yang-Mils gauge theory generalized the classical electro-magnetic duality of the particle theory to quantum word.  The intersection of quantum particles is controlled by a notion so called instantons.  Vafa-Witten’s S-duality theory is for the counting of instantons on a real 4-manifold.  The PI has given a rigorous mathematical definition in the S-duality theory and proved the Vafa-Witten’s S-duality conjecture in mathematics.  The proof has applications in both mathematics and physics for other duality theories.      The result the PI proved has been circulated in the mathematical community to get interested by a lot of mathematicians and physicists to further study the corresponding theory. The award helps the PI organize learning seminars and conferences in central area of US to get more interests from younger students and postdocs. The PI has weekly seminar here at KU to invite speakers in algebraic geometry and physics to discuss and communicate with them on research topics. This way the award has already motivated a slot activities and discussion at the central areas.  For instance, we have joint conferences and joint seminars with Kansas State University, University of Missouri Columbia and Washington University at St Louis.  The award already helps the PI build a research bridge among all these central area research universities.  The award also train some Ph.D students and young postdocs in this algebraic geometry field.  Right now at KU the geometry group has around 7 graduate students and the PI's project got a lot of interests from them.  Also the intersection with other research group and other department such as physics department here make more academic sense from the PI's research projects.  All in all, the award made a great effort for the PI to build his research lins and research methods in his oen research program and the PI is very grateful for this award and would definitely want  to apply later for more awards.
