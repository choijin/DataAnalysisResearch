<AbstractNarration>Broadening participation in all of the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields as well as in computing, which is critical to all of the STEM fields, is a national challenge. Achieving gender equity in computing is one of the more pressing challenges in the broadening participation effort because of the precipitous decline in the proportion of women earning degrees in computing over the last 20 years. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop will bring together thought leaders to share experiences in an effort to understand the issues faced by black women in computing. Black women, as a group, face acute underrepresentation in computing. Their challenges rest at the intersection of race and gender in the larger broadening participation effort. The goals of this workshop are to: 1) explore the intersectional experiences (race and gender) of black women in CS; and 2) formulate strategies and a plan of action to address the lack of awareness and action around this intersectionality. The workshop addresses these goals by featuring break-out sessions that will enable the collection of rich, qualitative information about the experiences of black women in computing, as well as capture best practices for supporting this population. The data and report from the workshop will inform the STEM+C research community on the specific factors associated with women of color in computing.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    Summary  In January 2017, the inaugural Black Women in Computing (BWiC) Conference was held at Howard University, in Washington DC. The three-day conference included 80 participants, where most of the partic- ipants were black women students or professionals in computing. Participants included graduate students, computer science professors, business leaders, social scientists, and professionals in private industry. Across three days, the conference included distinguished keynote speakers, facilitated panel sessions, and breakout discussion groups.  Ample time was provided throughout the conference for open networking sessions. During one of the breakout session, the participants discussed the following guiding questions:     Why don?t interventions for women in computing work for black women in computing?     What are the implicit and explicit gender and stereotype bias for black women in computing?     What are tangible intervention / support strategies for black women in computing?     Through these questions, the participants provided validation for the seven (7) themes that were identified in a prior workshop of 24 black women in computing (January 2016), providing further validation of the salient themes surrounding black women in computing. Data from facilitator notes, participant surveys (pre-conference, breakout session, and post-conference surveys), and conference artifacts were used to verify the themes. In all, salient themes were validated, utilizing data from about 100 black women in computing.      Outcomes     The themes developed during the Black Women in Computing (BWiC) workshop in 2016 included the following:    Theme 1: Linking black women in computing to the bottom line for accountability     Theme 2: Developing key influencers and thought leaders     Theme 3: Increased cultural and educational supports for black women in computing     Theme 4: Leadership development     Theme 5: Lack of collective research about black women in computing     Theme 6: Our voices: Illuminating our trials and triumphs     Theme 7: Branding and communication   During the Black Women in Computing Conference in 2017, conference facilitators (CS researchers) led small group discussions during a breakout session of the conference to discuss these seven themes to validate and explore these themes further.
