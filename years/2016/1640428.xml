<AbstractNarration>While recent approaches to Natural Language Processing (NLP) based on&lt;br/&gt;machine learning from large quantities of data have delivered valuable&lt;br/&gt;technology, this success has obscured earlier, more visionary goals of&lt;br/&gt;getting computers to understand stories, to engage in natural,&lt;br/&gt;cooperative dialogues with people, and to translate text and speech&lt;br/&gt;fluently and accurately from one human language to another.  As such,&lt;br/&gt;this workshop highlights the value of bringing these early visionary&lt;br/&gt;goals back into view. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop features established researchers who carried&lt;br/&gt;out early work in a major sub-field of speech and language processing&lt;br/&gt;engaging in a moderated public dialogue with younger researchers&lt;br/&gt;involved with significant new ideas and/or methods. The workshop is&lt;br/&gt;organized into four sessions, each with a moderator and invited&lt;br/&gt;speakers, on the topics of Dialogue and Speech, Natural Language&lt;br/&gt;Generation, Text Understanding, and Grounded Language. Dialogue in&lt;br/&gt;each session is enriched through questions solicited beforehand from&lt;br/&gt;prospective attendees, as well as impromptu questions from the&lt;br/&gt;audience. The workshop includes graduate student scribes who&lt;br/&gt;collaborate to deliver a summary of each session, and a poster session&lt;br/&gt;highlights the students' research.  In addition to the workshop&lt;br/&gt;proceedings, the workshop's outcome is a public report based on notes&lt;br/&gt;contributed by the speakers and the session summaries produced by the&lt;br/&gt;team of student scribes.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This award supported a one-day workshop held in conjunction with the 2016 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing. The aim of the workshop was to inspire up-and-coming researchers to re-engage with the early aspirations in the field in the context of today?s large datasets and modern empirical methods. Early researchers in natural language processing had lofty goals, including getting computers to understand stories, engage in natural, cooperative dialogues with people, and translate text and speech fluently and accurately from one human language to another. While there were significant early achievements, the knowledge they were based on and the techniques they employed could not be scaled up for practical use.  As a result, such work was abandoned in favor of shallower approaches based on machine learning from large quantities of data.  Nevertheless, its potential value has not gone away: there is much to be gained from recognizing not just what was said, but why; from identifying conclusions people naturally draw from both what has been said and hasn?t; and from representing domains in a sufficiently rich way to reduce reliance on what is explicit in a text.  As such, the aims of the workshop were to remind the community of early goals and attempts to achieve them, to highlight the uphill battles that remain, and to revive these aspirations in a context in which much more can be done.  The workshop featured established researchers who carried out early work in a major sub-field of speech and language processing engaging in a moderated public dialogue with younger researchers involved with significant new ideas and/or methods. The workshop was organized into four sessions, each with a moderator and four invited speakers, on the topics of Text Understanding, Natural Language Generation, Dialogue and Speech, and Grounded Language. The workshop invited eight graduate student scribes to collaboratively to deliver a summary of each session, and included a poster session to highlight the students? research as well as others focused on deeper problems which continue to baffle today?s natural language processing systems.   The award ultimately supported the travel of six of the graduate student researchers and fourteen of the organizers and invited speakers who otherwise would not have been able to attend the workshop.  The supported graduate students were selected based on submitted research summaries that were evaluated by a 25-member program committee, who also informed the selection of the papers presented during the poster session.  In total, approximately 80 researchers participated in the workshop.   The abstracts and slides from the invited talks were posted to the workshop website (http://www.coli.uni-saarland.de/~mroth/UphillBattles/) and the papers presented in the poster session were published in the workshop proceedings (https://aclanthology.coli.uni-saarland.de/volumes/proceedings-of-the-workshop-on-uphill-battles-in-language-processing-scaling-early-achievements-to-robust-methods). In addition, the workshop website will include highlights of each panel discussion &mdash; based in part on the summaries written by the graduate student scribes &mdash; once the invited speakers have been given the opportunity to review these documents.  Finally, the organizers aim to produce a position piece to be submitted for formal publication that identifies common themes across the panels and opportunities for moving forward.
