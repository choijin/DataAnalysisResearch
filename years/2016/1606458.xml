<AbstractNarration>The search for new fundamental interactions of nature is at the heart of experimental particle physics.  The current Standard Model of particle physics has been enormously successful at describing current measurements, but it is an incomplete theory.  All of the experiments at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) operating at CERN near Geneva, Switzerland are focused on discoveries beyond the Standard Model.  This project and the LHCb experiment as a whole seek new discoveries through precision measurements of particle decays produced at the LHC.  These measurements aim to answer questions stretching back to the Big Bang, such as, why is our universe dominated by matter and not antimatter? &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project involves two main components.  To improve the quality of data taken by LHCb and ensure it continues to produce excellent results throughout the next decade, construction of new detector upgrades is underway.  This project will lead the characterization and production of the silicon microstrip sensors that form the heart of the Upstream Tracker subdetector upgrade.  Using data collected by LHCb, a novel method will be employed to study decays containing particles that are difficult or impossible to measure directly.  As a result, new measurements will be performed of the mixing of quark flavors and the direct search for new interactions that violate conservation laws of the Standard Model.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ One important way to discover new phenomena beyond the currently known Standard Model of particle physics is by making precision measurements of the properties and decays of known particles. These measurements have the possibility to answer questions such as why the universe is dominated by matter and not antimatter. This approach is focused on by the LHCb experiment at the CERN Large Hadron Collider.  To continue to produce high quality results into the next decade of operation, it is necessary to continue to update and upgrade both the physical detectors and our analysis techniques.  This award has helped to establish a new research program utilizing for the first time an analysis technique that makes it possible to study in more detail "missing" particles that are not directly observed in the LHCb detector.  In parallel, this award helps cover a research and development program for new silicon tracking sensors. Understanding the physics of how new features of these sensors work has made it possible to improve their performance without sacrificing the key advantages they provide for a next generation LHCb detector upgrade. These new sensors have now entered production and will be used to build the Upstream Tracker which will be installed in 2019 and 2020.  I have also spent time with local high school students and teachers to teach about particle physics in general and connect those basic ideas directly with the work we do with hardware components and software data analysis in order to produce this cutting edge science.
