<AbstractNarration>This project is to support the organization of the 2016 NSF Enhancing Access to Radio Spectrum (EARS) Principal Investigators (PI) Meeting. The PI meeting provides important information to NSF and the community about progress and trends into research on enhancing access to radio spectrum. This PI meeting will be held on March 15, 2016, collocated with WInnComm 2016, the annual US conference of the Wireless Innovation Forum which will be held March 15 to 17 in Reston, Virginia. WInnComm is a conference focusing on the innovative use of spectrum and advance radio technologies supporting essential and critical communications. Collocation of the EARS PI meeting with WInnComm will provide the EARS PIs with access to a primary user community for the type of research being performed under the EARS Program, including Radio Manufacturers, System Integrators, Procurement Authorities and End User Representatives in commercial, civil and defense markets. Such an environment provides an ideal venue for PIs to get industry recognition of their current work and receive relevant feedback on future directions. Similarly, representatives from this user community attending the conference will gain access to some of the latest research in spectrum sharing and dynamic spectrum access through interactions with the EARS PIs.  This exchange of information will accelerate the realization of the EARS program goals to improve the efficiency with which the radio spectrum is utilized. Such improvements will have significant impact to the nation and the world by improving access to limited spectrum resources for current and new wireless technologies.</AbstractNarration>
