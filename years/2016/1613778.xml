<AbstractNarration>The 6th Conference on "Emergent Phases in Quantum Hall Systems" (EPQHS-6) will take place&lt;br/&gt;in Mumbai, India from January 7 to January 9, 2016. The Conference focus is on quantum phases found in&lt;br/&gt;two-dimensional electron systems. Main goals of EPQHS are to bring together key scientists as well&lt;br/&gt;as young researchers, to evaluate recent developments and to discuss further research directions.&lt;br/&gt;The organizing committee envisions a meeting with approximately 30 high level lectures and&lt;br/&gt;with a total of approximately 150 participants. Its format will enable active discussions&lt;br/&gt;among participants. This proposal requests travel support of students and postdocs from the US to enable their participation.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The major goal of this project is to provide international travel support for junior scientists from the United States to participate in the international workshop ?Emergent Phenomena in Quantum Hall Systems? (EPQHS). The sixth edition of this prestigious series of meetings, EPQHS-6, took place in Mumbai, India, at the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR, widely known as the Tata Institute). The EPQHS-6 conference started on January 7th, 2016 and it ended on January 9th, 2016. Participation of three young scientists from the US was supported by this project.   The quantum Hall effect is regarded as the mother of all topological phases in modern condensed matter physics. The new ideas generated from its investigation have led to topological insulators, quantum anomalous Hall effect, quantum spin Hall effect, topological superconductivity, and topological particles, such as fractionally charged anyons, composite fermions and Majorana fermions. Recent years have witnessed exciting experimental as well as theoretical developments that followed several distinct directions, resulting in further elucidation of many of these topics.  Interest in topological phases in condensed matter systems is driven by novel fundamental science and by a potential to create conceptual frameworks and practical platforms to create quantum states in which topology leads to striking protection from unavoidable disorder that negatively impacts device performance.  This year?s Nobel prize in physics was awarded to three physicists for accomplishments in the areas of research on topological phases in condensed matter. Duncan F. Haldane, one of the recipients of this Nobel prize, was a participant in the 6th international workshop ?Emergent Phenomena in Quantum Hall Systems? (EPQHS-6), as was Klaus von Klitzing, the discoverer of the quantum Hall effect, who won the Nobel Prize in 1985.  EPQHS-6 had 150 participants, including many junior scientists. The conference provided a unique forum to consider and evaluate some of the more exciting developments in condensed matter physics including new developments in quantum Hall physics as other more recent systems and materials that display novel topological character. The invited speakers are leading experts in condensed matter sciences and have lead the pioneering research in the main topics of the conference.  The deliberations highlighted recent developments and explored new conceptual frameworks for harnessing topological phases in relevant condensed matter systems.  The list of invited speakers featured a public lecture by Klaus von Klitzing and an insightful talk by Duncan Haldane. Michael Zalatel, one of the junior scientists supported by this travel grant, presented an invited talk about his exciting work that links composite fermions with Dirac physics.  The EPQHS-6 program and other information on the conference are available at the site:  http://www.tifr.res.in/~nano/EPQHS2016/index.html.
