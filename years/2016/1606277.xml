<AbstractNarration>This award is made as part of the FY 2016 Mathematical Sciences Postdoctoral Research Fellowships Program. Each of the fellowships supports a research and training project at a host institution in the mathematical sciences, including applications to other disciplines, under the mentorship of a sponsoring scientist. The title of the project for this fellowship to Anil Damle is "Sparse representations and fast algorithms for Kohn-Sham orbitals." The host institution for the fellowship is University of California Berkeley, and the sponsoring scientist is Lin Lin.</AbstractNarration>

Specifically, many properties of the system only depend on what linear combinations of functions can be constructed out of a set of eigenfunctions and not the eigenfunctions themselves. Therefore, it is often advantageous to utilize an alternative set of "basis" functions to represent this collection.   This grant primarily funded the continued research and development of methods for constructing such localized basis functions within Kohn-Sham density functional (DFT) theory. Here, the property we wish to leverage is locality of the basis functions we construct, we would like them to only have large magnitude on a small region of the computational domain.   Previous development had focused on building a robust, efficient algorithm for constructing localized basis functions for so-called insulating systems. In this setting, such functions are known to exist. However, in the study of metallic systems, or systems with so-called entangled bands, less is known about this problem. This research extended the selected columns of the density matrix (SCDM) methodology to effectively tackle systems with entangled bands.   These developments were experimentally shown to robustly allow for good band interpolation in crystals with entangled bands. Furthermore, in contrast to existing methods, our framework avoids the potentially sensitive dependence on an initial guess. For complex systems constructing such a guess may be difficult, and avoiding such a task is important.    Code implementing the methodology was developed, as was an interface with the widely used Wannier90 software package. This allows for the use of our method in conjunction with the functionality of Wannier90. A paper detailing these findings has been created, submitted, and is available online.   This grant also funded interdisciplinary research into graph clustering. A common scientific information, given data encoded as a graph, is how to partition the data into groups of similar objects.

As part of this grant preliminary work, available in preprint form, has explored these connections and observes favorable performance of our method when compared with existing techniques.  In addition to the research directly conducted as part of the grant, the PI took part as a teaching assistant in a joint Lawrence Berkeley National Lab and Mathematical Sciences Research Institute summer school on electronic structure calculation.
