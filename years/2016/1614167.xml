<AbstractNarration>This project will advance efforts of the Innovative Technology Experiences for Students and Teachers (ITEST) program to better understand and promote practices that increase students' motivations and capacities to pursue careers in fields of science, technology, engineering, or mathematics (STEM) by developing and testing a novel technology-rich high school bioscience curriculum and teacher professional development model.  The new curriculum and associated online tools will promote development of critical competencies among students in the context of bioscience career-related investigations.  The project will also develop a web-based application that will enable remotely located classrooms to participate in the new curriculum, develop new professional development approaches for high school teachers to support implementation of the new curriculum, and produce research data that will expand the knowledge base on factors influencing  career selection and persistence among students with respect to bioscience careers.  The curriculum will engage students in simulations that involve designing experiments, predicting results, and interpreting data.  Video vignettes of bioscience professionals will be embedded in the curriculum to raise awareness of the wide range of careers related to the bioscience simulations.  The associated teacher professional development will engage teachers in co-designing learning activities, piloting activities with students during summer activities, and an ongoing mentoring process with both in-person and virtual components. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is a collaborative effort involving scientists, educational researchers, and computer programmers from the Center for Translational Science Education at the Tufts University School of Medicine and teachers and biotech researchers in the Boston metropolitan area.  The curricular approach being implemented and tested combines four strategies that have been shown to increase active learning, self-efficacy, and career awareness among students, and to effectively support teacher implementation of new curricula:  a) Collaborative problem-based learning strategies that build career awareness by modeling how workforce teams collaborate in inquiry to solve authentic problems; b) Use of collaborative learning technologies that engage students and teachers in modeling, social persuasion, and problem-solving activities to foster teamwork and shared decision-making; c) A collaborative curriculum design process that engages teacher in developing curricula; and d) A teacher professional development approach that progresses through a series of in-person and virtual experiences that support teacher learning before, during, and after implementation of the new curriculum.   A mixed methods research approach will be used to examine student outcomes related to disciplinary content knowledge and practices, student self-efficacy and outcome expectations, interests, and career goals.  Pretest data and posttest data from innovation and comparison groups will be analyzed using multivariate techniques to examine relationships among outcome measures.</AbstractNarration>

We carried out the following four objectives:    Produced an innovative technology-enhanced curriculum and teacher support tools that can be integrated into existing science courses offered in high schools. Developed a web-based application, https://bioscann.org, that enables classrooms to participate in the intervention.  Developed new professional development (PD) approaches for high school teachers to support implementation. Produced research data that contributes to our knowledge base on STEM career selection.   Intellectual merit  To broaden participation in STEM we must understand the factors in students’ complex ecosystems that shape career selection. One perspective for unpacking these factors is Social Cognitive Career Theory (SCCT). SCCT attempts to identify factors that influence academic or career interests, goals, and performance. SCCT considers a person’s self-efficacy (SE), or confidence that they can successfully pursue the career (i.e. "Can I do it?")  to be the most influential component of goal setting and activity selection (such as pursuing STEM careers). SE then interacts with outcome expectations (OE) (i.e. "What will happen if I try?") to promote interests. Most SCCT instruments are focused on specific STEM fields (e.g. engineering, computer science, math, etc), and as such few are able to gather information about career selection for STEM in general, especially at the high school level.  In this project we designed and validated a new all-inclusive STEM SCCT measure for high schoolers with items from Robert W. Lent, the originator of the instrument. Our findings suggest that Lent's model for career selection is informative at the high school level. Our factor analysis confirms many relationships described by Lent and adds two new constructs (Career Awareness and Negative Perceptions of Scientists) that correlate with SE and OE and that are sensitive and responsive to change from short-term interventions like BioScann.  A critical aspect of the project was to design an impactful approach to increasing career awareness. To do this, BioScann provides students with career related information in the context of an experience in which they can ‘try on’ roles. It is clear that the five-day BioScann experience increases SCCT related student perceptions of self and self-reported career awareness. Furthermore, the curriculum increases student mastery of graph interpretation. Taken together, STEM self-efficacy, career awareness, and graph reading skills are critical factors for building a more robust and diverse STEM workforce. In summary, thinking and working from the perspective of a career is a promising approach that can engage students in meaningful STEM career experiences in diverse classroom settings.  Broader impacts   Over the course of the four year project, BioScann reached over a thousand students and over 150 teachers, far exceeding the projected outcomes. The curriculum is still in use and remains freely available to teachers.   From a pedagogical perspective, the curriculum and BioScann technology have the potential to accelerate the successful design, development, and dissemination of problem-based learning cases applicable to a broad range of topics that are not limited to career awareness or STEM. To this point, the BioScann platform contains authoring functionality uniquely designed to scaffold the replication of multi-role interrupted case studies. Furthermore, the BioScann approach may be applicable in other settings, such as informal learning environments.
