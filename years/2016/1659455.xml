<AbstractNarration>This project is funded from the Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Sites program in the SBE Directorate. It has both scientific and societal benefits, and it integrates research and education. The goal of this REU site program is to provide undergraduate students with an in-depth, hands-on experience focused on gaining clinical research skills for children with social, emotional, and behavioral problems (SEB). Students are trained in the application of the scientific method to develop hypotheses, and trained on how to design and conduct research studies on treatment-related issues for children with SEB. Students are also trained in the ethical conduct of research. Students are mentored by full-time, Ph.D.-level faculty members who have strong programs of research. Faculty members? expertise includes services for children and adolescents with SEBs, parent-related stress and engagement in services for children?s SEB, factors impacting school services for SEB, decision-making for SEB services among parents, providers, teachers, and children, and integrated health systems for children and families with SEB living in rural or underserved settings. As our REU site will include participation of students from underrepresented groups or diverse backgrounds (i.e., rural, first-generation, ethnic or cultural minority, women), we have an opportunity to potentially assist the career trajectories of these students, including enriching their graduate school prospects, career paths, and career options.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 4 aims for undergraduate students who participate in this REU: (1) gain experience conducting an independent project in the realm of treatment-related research for youth with SEB; (2) have educational experiences alongside research experiences that will allow them to become better data scientists; (3) be mentored in the requisite skills to apply to and get into top-notch graduate schools in research-related fields; and (4) gain unique experience transferring clinical research findings from science to practice and from practice to science. Two types of activities, research and educational, will allow these aims to be met. The research conducted by students with their mentors will advance understanding of treatments and treatment-related issues for children with SEB. With regular and frequent contact with mentors, students learn all aspects of the research process, including hypothesis formulation, integration and analysis of scientific literature, research design, data collection, data analysis, and the presentation of research findings. Students also attend seminars focused on statistics, research methods, and preparing for the graduate school application process. To maximize exposure to multiple areas of research, they attend seminars in which faculty mentors present data from recent research. Students receive considerable training in the presentation of research findings and have opportunities and financial support to present their findings at regional and national conferences focused on school mental health, treatments, and treatment-related concerns for youth with SEB. Students and mentors work together to submit research reports for publication in peer-reviewed academic journals.</AbstractNarration>
