<AbstractNarration>This award supports the renewal of the Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site at the University of Illinois in Urbana-Champaign.  The Department of Physics at the University hosts an intensive 10-week summer research program for 12 undergraduates per year, who are integrated into existing research groups led by senior faculty. Students are exposed to life at a large public research university that has extensive research activities across a full range of physics subfields.  During the program, students perform hands-on research in projects on important scientific problems.  In addition to research skills, participants are trained in computing in physics, error analysis, technical communications, research collaboration practices, and professional ethics skills which are essential to their future success. The REU students are also exposed to career options through talks and workshops and receive advice on applying for graduate school and graduate research fellowships.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual focus of the program is to teach students not only how to do physics, but also how to be physicists. Students work on cutting-edge research projects that apply the tools of physics to important problems in traditional physics subdisciplines as well as in materials science, nanotechnology, molecular biology, and high-performance computing. Students also have ample opportunities to learn about technical communications, research collaboration and networking, and responsible conduct of research.  An intangible but real contribution to the project is the University's research infrastructure.  The REU students have the benefit of state-of-the-art research laboratories, extraordinary computer and visualization facilities, desk-top access to library collections and services, and the student computer laboratory in Loomis Laboratory.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>During the course of this project, 66 talented undergraduate students undertook independent hands-on research projects. They learned how to grow and analyze exotic materials like superconductors, wrote code used in data analysis for high-energy physics experiments at the ATLAS Plane detector, and built simulation software to analyze the optical and electromagnetic responses of Fiber Bragg Grating sensors. One student was even able to obtain her drone pilot's license to aid in an experiment that sought to be the first to communicate securely using the entanglement of photons, conducted via drone-to-drone quantum-key-distribution.&nbsp;</p> <p>Three international students, one from Brazil, one from Peru, and one from Ethiopia, who the National Science Foundation did not support, participated in the program to add an international dimension to the experience for the US students.&nbsp;</p> <p>Every student gave at least three talks and wrote a final paper on their research project, and received detailed oral and written feedback on their work.</p> <p>Programmatic activities included a four-day orientation "boot camp" during the first week of the eight-week sessions that covered: lab safety, responsible conduct of research, tutorials on scientific software and literature searches, and discussions on selecting and applying to graduate programs in physics and related disciplines. Additional workshops were held during the program and included presentations on campus safety, research ethics, sexual harassment, and gender bias, creating and presenting scientific posters, giving science talks, and writing scientific articles for publication. At least two students per year received support to present their work at national conferences.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>A total of 23 faculty participated in the program; several took students all three years of the project, and most participated in at least two of the three years. Faculty ranged from senior professors who are members of the National Academy of Sciences to assistant professors who are building their labs, but all were committed to the success of their students. In addition, each student was paired with a senior graduate student or postdoctoral researcher who served as a mentor, providing an additional layer of support for the student.</p> <p>Great efforts were made to recruit a diverse cohort, emphasizing students from smaller colleges, those from backgrounds historically underrepresented in physics, and first-generation college students. In all, 49% of the participants were women, and 55% came from small colleges or universities with limited research programs in physics. In terms of demographics, 15% were Hispanic, 17% were African-American, and 30% were first-generation college students.&nbsp; Of the students who have graduated from college, more than 70% have enrolled in graduate programs in physics, computer science, materials science, medical physics, or electrical engineering.
