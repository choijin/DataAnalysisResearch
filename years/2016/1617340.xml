<AbstractNarration>Over 800,000 people in the US experience a stroke each year according to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, a majority of which is severe enough to disqualify them from receiving the advanced diagnostic standard set forth by modern Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), primarily due to the inability to accurately monitor patient conditions while they are inside an MRI scanner present with strong magnetic fields.  This in turn degrades the ability of the overseeing physician to properly diagnose, as those high-risk patients are excluded from MRI diagnosis and follow-up treatments. This I-Corps team's proposed technology is a patient monitor which allows for continuous high quality monitoring of patient conditions during MRI scans, permitting high-risk patients to benefit from MRI for diagnostic scans and MRI image-guided treatments.  For clinicians, the risk in performing new MR imaging and image-guided procedures will be greatly reduced through this product.  For hospitals, MRI scanner, and life support manufacturers, their services can be expanded to a new patient group that was previously ineligible for MRI, allowing for a competitive advantage. For patients, they can access and receive a higher quality of diagnostic care, with a larger potential for the emergence of advanced diagnostic and functional MR imaging, and MRI image-guided treatments which may become new standards for patient care. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MRI-compatible systems are those deemed safe for operation within the MRI scanner; typically non-magnetic, minimally conductive, and robust against the strong and rapidly switched magnetic fields present within the MRI scanner.  The proposed product will be a high-fidelity, MRI-compatible 12-lead Electrocardiogram (ECG) recording system, capable of monitoring high-risk patients (e.g. being sedated and intubated), as well as low- to med-risk patients, who may require an extended MR imaging session, in which they would remain unattended within the MRI scanner. The product provides real-time diagnostic quality monitoring, previously unavailable using current technologies, while not compromising the operation and diagnostic ability of the MRI scanner.  This product could greatly improve the state of patient monitoring in the MRI, which is critical for severely-ill patients, and subsequently the state of patient healthcare.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The overall goal of this project is to complete market research and develop a commercialization strategy for our product, a portable physiological sensor for patient monitoring during MRI procedures. This project also provides a graduate student with the opportunity to practice entrepreneurial skills.  Our major activities are as follows:   (1) I-Corps Curriculum: We completed the 8-week VentureWell course&mdash;required by our grant&mdash;which included two on-site workshops in Newark, NJ in the spring of 2016.  (2) Customer Discovery: We used a comprehensive customer discovery process and developed a detailed business plan.  (3) Customer Interviews: We conducted over 100 interviews, more than 80 of which were in person, with potential customers, distribution channels, and partners.  (4) Final Presentation: We presented our past activities and plans for the future of our project at the NYC Regional Innovation Node (NYCRIN)  Our key outcomes are as follows:  (1) To address current pain points in MRI scans and MRI-guided procedures:  Some patients are unable to get an MRI or have an MRI-guided procedure because they require physiological monitoring during MRI, but there are no high fidelity physiological monitoring systems compatible with the MR environment (i.e. existing systems are magnetic).  Existing methods for patient monitoring during MRI are suboptimal because they use low fidelity electrocardiogram or single lead pulse oximetry which only measure simple physiological signals and are not diagnostic or useful in emergency situations.  (2) To identify the customer segments:  The main end users will be interventional radiologists who perform surgery on intubated/high risk patients inside an MR scanner.  Distribution channels and partnerships have been identified to be key medical device companies and MRI manufacturers.  The main customers will be hospitals and MRI clinics. Therefore, we hope to build relationships with hospitals and MRI clinics &mdash;including their purchasing office and end users (interventional radiologists, nurses, and technicians)&mdash;by providing technical support, advancing future trials, and via product feedback surveys.  Intellectual Merit  This project allowed us to conduct market research and identify customer segments, channels, and partners through scientific validation of our hypotheses. Going forward, we can pursue commercialization with more market knowledge, collaborative relationships with customers, and a structured business plan.  Broader of Impacts   Our product will have a positive impact the healthcare industry. For clinicians, this product will greatly reduce the risk of performing MRI scans and MRI-guided procedures on high-risk/intubated patients. Hospitals, MRI clinics, as well as MRI scanner and life support manufacturers, will be able to gain a competitive advantage by expanding their services to a new patient group that was previously ineligible for MRI.  Once we have successfully developed and demonstrated our product, we will consult the University of Georgia?s Innovation Gateway for assistance with finding opportunities for technology transfer and licensing.  Beyond science and technology transfer, this project has the potential to improve healthcare for many people, including stroke patients. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), over 800,000 people in the U.S. experience a stroke each year, the majority of which are sufficiently severe to disqualify the patients from receiving an MRI.
