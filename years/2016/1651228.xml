<AbstractNarration>This award supports a Future Internet Architecture (FIA) principal investigator (PI) meeting in September, 2016. This meeting will focus on strategies, methods, tools, and opportunities to advance and support FIA-related and FIA-derived research with the sponsorship and support of a) other US Government agencies, and b) Industry structures such as research consortia. Effective exploration of this topic serves as a key strategic requirement for further developing the intellectual lines of research initiated by NSF within the FIA program, as well as achieving the full broader impact potential of this research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The topics to be addressed represent a critical element needed to sustain future FIA program-related research. The presentations, discussions, and participatory exercises are intended to inform and assist FIA researchers in a) developing ongoing intellectual agendas for their research; b) learning about the technical, cultural, and procedural requirements that underpin research funding opportunities within the US Government and Industry communities, and c) develop skills and abilities in framing and presenting their research to these communities in ways that are effective with respect to community specific norms and objectives. Cross-fertilization and knowledge transfer between the FIA community and these potential research sponsors is a critical objective at this stage of the FIA program. This workshop provides a focused agenda to advance that objective. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The broader goal of the NSF FIA program is enhancing the relevance and impact of the NSF program of network research, intellectual enrichment of the network research community, and the contribution of new concepts and thought leadership to the future of the Internet. The program provides a means to train a cohort of academic network researchers in the practice of long-range architectural thinking. The program has the potential to contribute to a future Internet that is materially more secure, robust, economically viable, and fit for the needs of society than the Internet of today. Results and outputs of this workshop will contribute to the ongoing broader impact of the FIA program by substantially expanding the potential support and sponsorship base for FIA research. The summary of this workshop, which will be posted on the FIA website for public dissemination, will be an additional contribution to this broader goal.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[The Internet has created extraordinary opportunities for advance across the spectrum of human endeavors, from commerce to education to medicine to social engagement and connection.  It has moved amazingly quickly from its origins as a small-scale research project in the 1980s to become integral to our lives and central to society today. Yet the continued benefit of the Internet to the world at large is increasingly threatened by the ever-mounting sophistication of security attacks, concerns about lack of reliability of Internet services, and the cost of providing services to all, throughout the cities, small towns, and rural countryside of America. As our reliance on a highly dependable, secure, and economically efficient information technology infrastructure continues to grow, it is no longer clear that the needs of society can be met using the basic design - the "architecture" - of the current Internet, which is now nearly 40 years old.  Recognizing the critical need for a secure, highly dependable information technology infrastructure, NSF created the Future Internet Architecture (FIA) program to study this question, and to stimulate innovative and creative research to explore, design, and evaluate new Internet architectures.  The objective of the program was to engage the research community in collaborative, long-range, transformative thinking - unfettered by the constraints of today's networks yet inspired by lessons learned and promising new research ideas - to design and experiment with new network architectures and networking concepts that take into consideration the larger social, economic and legal issues that arise from the interplay between the Internet and its users throughout society. In the summer of 2010, NSF funded four major research projects within the FIA program. A fifth project was subsequently funded under a different solicitation. Since that time, these projects have produced a wide range of new, early stage research results that show strong potential to lead the next 40 years of Internet technical development. With the NSF FIA program coming to a close, a key question became how to continue this research and move it towards widespread commercial use.  The project described here supported a meeting of FIA researchers, government and commercial research sponsors, and other experts held in September, 2016 to address this question. This meeting focused on strategies, methods, tools, and opportunities to advance and support FIA-related and FIA-derived research with the sponsorship and support of other US Government agencies, and through cross-industry commercial structures such as research consortia.  A central aspect of the meeting was a series of presentations, discussions, and participatory exercises designed to assist FIA researchers in developing ongoing directions and agendas for their research once the NSF program concluded; in learning about the technical, cultural, and procedural requirements that underpin research funding opportunities beyond the NSF itself, both within the US Government and through industry opportunities; and in develop their skills and abilities in framing and presenting their research to these communities in ways that are effective and likely to succeed. An additional aspect of the meeting was to directly connect the researchers of the NSF FIA community with potential research sponsors for their future work; meeting a critical need at this final stage of the FIA program.   The key outcome of the meeting was that several direct opportunities were create for FIA researchers to continue and further develop lines of research initiated by NSF within the FIA program. FIA researchers gained significant experience in demonstrating the merit and impact of their research to multiple audiences within the larger commercial and government research funding community, and potential funders and supporters of this research were introduced to FIA researchers and research projects. As a result, a number of specific directions for further advance of the FIA research, as well as sources of sponsorship for this work, were identified, moving the FIA community substantially closer to achieving the remarkable and broad potential impact of this research.
