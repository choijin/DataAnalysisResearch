<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is related to a wider use of superhydrophobic admixtures and concrete with enhanced durability. This approach is expected to lead to a highly effective method for improving the durability of concrete, especially concrete with large volumes of industrial by-products such as fly ash and slag used as cement replacements.  New superhydrophobic admixtures enable extending the service life of concrete structures, save raw materials and energy, and reduce the environmental impacts associated with construction; these features are essential for future durable and resilient civil and transportation infrastructure. In order to boost concrete durability, thisp roject aims to incorporate the proposed admixture into concrete as a component of the mixture (the approach used for new concrete) or as a surface treatment (the option for concrete repair). This project will explore the feasibility of a family of superhydrophobic products tailored for these two large-volume markets. Ultimately, the proposed approach will improve the performance of concrete structures while substantially decreasing the maintenance costs compared to standard practices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project aims to test the business model hypotheses and verify the commercial potential of admixtures for high-performance concrete. The superhydrophobic admixture combines the emulsified hydrogen containing siloxane precursor and small quantities of submicron-sized particles. When added to fresh concrete, the developed admixture releases hydrogen and forms very small air voids evenly distributed within the cement paste. The resulting concrete is water resistant, improving concrete resilience and durability. The developed superhydrophobic coatings applied on existing concrete render it water repellant and also ice-phobic, reducing ice adhesion.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>With I-Corps training and support, our team has identified the urgent need for better, more durable concrete solutions. Currently, the construction industry invests $72 billion annually on infrastructure, with an estimate by ASCE (American Society of Civil Engineers) of $430 billion by 2020 to repair current structural systems in dire need. State DOT&rsquo;s and local municipalities have recognized the need to invest in construction materials with enhanced durability to gain a higher efficiency, longer service lives and enhanced sustainability of modern civil and transportation infrastructure.&nbsp; The research team conducted 150+ interviews with a blend of engineers and managers leading the U.S. construction industry. The objective of this project was to identify current issues related to concrete and define the qualities which are desired for improved performance. Based on the survey results, it was concluded <em>that the</em><em> durability was the most important value expected for concrete</em>. When analyzing the critical factors of concrete durability, the freeze-thaw, corrosion, sulfate attack and shrinkage were among the critical parameters which are responsible for poor performance. Water penetration and saturation are the main factors causing some of these damaging effects on the structures. Many interviewed professionals stated that various sealants are commonly used on existing concrete structures in order to reduce water absorption. However, the cost of current sealants on the market is far too high, and also the longevity in terms of maintenance is too demanding. <em>The proposed superhydrophobic admixtures overperform the existing products used for surface treatment and so extending the durability of concrete structures</em>. <em>The updated value proposition of superhydrophobic admixture and superhydrophobic concrete</em> addresses the concerns identified by the survey, the largest of which is durability. Due to the strong water-repellent properties of the developed coatings, the structures in question can be effectively protected from water ingress and penetration of aggressive chemicals. As a result, this approach can prevent early deterioration and, so, to boost the durability. Better durability contributes to sustainability and also reduced maintenance costs as the structure ages. Therefore, there is a need for new construction and architectural coatings that impart improved durability and lifespan effectiveness. The mainstream waterproof adhesives and sealants have major applications in the building and construction industry, and there is room for the next generation of advanced superhydrophobic products with added-value and enhanced overall performance.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 09/04/2018<br>      Modified by: Konstantin&nbsp;Sobolev</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1659229/1659229_10464902_1536036805616_NSF-F2--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1659229/1659229_10464902_1536036805616_NSF-F2--rgov-800width.jpg" title="The Team"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1659229/1659229_10464902_1536036805616_NSF-F2--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="The Team"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Panthers Team</div> <div class="imageCredit">Konstantin Sobolev</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Public Domain</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Konstantin&nbsp;Sobolev</div> <div class="imageTitle">The Team</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1659229/1659229_10464902_1536036031317_NSF-F1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1659229/1659229_10464902_1536036031317_NSF-F1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="SUPERHYDROPHOBIC CONCRETE"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1659229/1659229_10464902_1536036031317_NSF-F1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="SUPERHYDROPHOBIC CONCRETE"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">SUPERHYDROPHOBIC CONCRETE</div> <div class="imageCredit">Konstantin Sobolev</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Public Domain</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Konstantin&nbsp;Sobolev</div> <div class="imageTitle">SUPERHYDROPHOBIC CONCRETE</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1659229/1659229_10464902_1536036928388_NSF-F4--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1659229/1659229_10464902_1536036928388_NSF-F4--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Market"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1659229/1659229_10464902_1536036928388_NSF-F4--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Market"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">The Market Size</div> <div class="imageCredit">Konstantin Sobolev</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Public Domain</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Konstantin&nbsp;Sobolev</div> <div class="imageTitle">Market</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
