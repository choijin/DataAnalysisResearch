<AbstractNarration>Authentic research experiences in research laboratories run by professors do a far better job of developing students' research skills and improving student retention in science than traditional laboratory experiences associated with a course. This is particularly true with groups who traditionally have not entered science fields. Authentic research experiences provide motivation to learn the research skills and demonstrate rewards in solving research problems. CUREs (Course-based Undergraduate Research Experiences) have been created to provide all science students with a real research experience. However, little is known about the impacts of CUREs on student research skills and retention in science. The University of Northern Colorado has developed an introductory biology CURE based on Tigriopus californicus, a small marine organism, and initial results indicate the CURE increases students' content knowledge and improves their motivation towards learning biology, both of which have been shown to increase retention. This project will expand the CURE to three different institutions: a Liberal Arts University; a large, Hispanic-Serving Research University; and a small, Women's Minority-Serving College. Using these diverse student populations, this project will determine if the CURE improves students' content knowledge, research skills, motivation towards learning biology, and retention in biology. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Most research conducted on CURE student outcomes relies heavily on student self-reported learning gains, has been completed with self-selected student populations, and has not been conducted with student populations who are underrepresented in the STEM disciplines. The proposed project will enhance and expand current knowledge by adding to the existing CURE research including: (1) testing aspects of a recently developed CURE impacts model; (2) the exploration of CURE impacts on students' experimental design skills, motivation, science identity, and persistence in science; and (3) the examination of the impacts of CUREs on diverse student groups, including minorities and first-generation students. This project will also greatly expand our understanding of Tigriopus californicus, about which very little is currently known despite its important place at the base of the marine food chain. Finally, this project will potentially broaden participation of underrepresented groups in the biological sciences.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The aim of this project was to scale up a course-specific CURE, the <em>Tigriopus </em>CURE, for implementation at four diverse institutions. This involved two major components: (1) designing, implementing, and assessing professional development for individual instructors who would be incorporating the CURE into their curricula; and (2) performing within- and between-institution comparisons of student-level outcomes for individuals enrolled in traditional laboratories <em>vs. </em>the <em>Tigriopus </em>CURE. Professional development was conducted in both virtual and in-person formats to provide participants with the information and experience necessary to implement the CURE at their home institution. Following the in-person PD session, quantitative and qualitative data were collected to evaluate the impact of the PD on participants. Overall, the results indicated that the summer PD improved participants' knowledge, self-reported teaching competency, and perceived CURE benefits. In addition, the participants rated the PD associated with CURE implementation as effective or above and agreed with the statement that they were satisfied with the overall PD experience provided. Relatedly, we collected data to help understand what drove faculty to change their teaching practices and implement a CURE. We found the most important factors considered by faculty before implementing a CURE are the potential benefits for the students, but these benefits are balanced by challenges that faculty believe will accompany teaching the new CURE. After teaching the CURE, we found that benefits to students were still the most important criteria, but that most anticipated challenges were not as difficult as originally considered. The support of other faculty teaching this CURE and the availability of CURE experts for guidance and troubleshooting were the most common intangible resources that faculty utilized when implementing the CURE. For many faculty, CURE adoption would not have occurred without these supports.</p> <p>Concerning the impact of the CURE on student outcomes, Table 1 (supporting images) shows the institutional and student demographic data for the participant schools, reflecting that the CURE was implemented at a diverse range of institutions with diverse institutional profiles. The impact of the CURE at these four institutions was measured using the Biology Motivation Questionnaire (BMQ), the Science Identity Scale (SIS), and the Expanded Experimental Design Ability Tool (E-EDAT). These surveys were given to students at the beginning and end of the semester in which they were enrolled in either the traditional laboratory course or the CURE. As shown in Figure 1 (supporting images), analysis of covariance procedures controlling for BMQ/SIS pre-scores (as appropriate), student demographic characteristics, and instructor teaching self-efficacy (as measured via the Teaching Self-Efficacy Scale) indicated significant, between-group differences in student?s intrinsic motivation at the Hispanic-Serving Institution (HSI) and Liberal Arts College. Significant, between-group differences in students' career motivation were also observed for participants at both the Liberal Arts College and Private University; and significant, between-group differences in self-efficacy were observed for HSI participants. Figure 2 (supporting images) shows that CURE students from the Private University and the Women's College performed significantly better on the E-EDAT at the end of the course than did their non-CURE counterparts, after controlling for pre-E-EDAT score, student demographics, and instructor teaching self-efficacy. These data contribute to the larger body of knowledge on the impact of CUREs. From this project, one publication, six oral presentations, three poster presentations, and three publications in preparation have been produced. Further, two additional institutions not part of the original list of participating institutions are now implementing the <em>Tigriopus </em>CURE, thus increasing the number of students who have access to and engage in research at the undergraduate level. Overall, the expansion of the <em>Tigriopus</em> CURE has had positive impacts on a large number of students across the country.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 10/12/2020<br>      Modified by: Ginger&nbsp;R&nbsp;Fisher</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1625141/1625141_10455021_1602538381930_Figure2--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1625141/1625141_10455021_1602538381930_Figure2--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 2"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1625141/1625141_10455021_1602538381930_Figure2--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 2"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Comparison of CURE and traditional students� post-semester scores on the Expanded Experimental Design Ability Tool.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Ginger Fisher</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Royalty-free (unrestricted use)</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Ginger&nbsp;R&nbsp;Fisher</div> <div class="imageTitle">Figure 2</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1625141/1625141_10455021_1602538129594_Table1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1625141/1625141_10455021_1602538129594_Table1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Table 1"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1625141/1625141_10455021_1602538129594_Table1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Table 1"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Institutional and Student Demographic Information</div> <div class="imageCredit">Ginger Fisher</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Royalty-free (unrestricted use)</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Ginger&nbsp;R&nbsp;Fisher</div> <div class="imageTitle">Table 1</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1625141/1625141_10455021_1602538276889_Figure1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1625141/1625141_10455021_1602538276889_Figure1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 1"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1625141/1625141_10455021_1602538276889_Figure1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 1"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Comparison of CURE and traditional students� post-semester scores</div> <div class="imageCredit">Ginger Fisher</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Royalty-free (unrestricted use)</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Ginger&nbsp;R&nbsp;Fisher</div> <div class="imageTitle">Figure 1</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
