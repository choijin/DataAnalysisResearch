<AbstractNarration>This research project lies at the interface of algebra, geometry, and mathematical physics. One of the central problems in modern theoretical physics is to construct a mathematically consistent theory of fundamental interactions. The paradigm for this construction is known as quantum field theory. An underlying theme of the research is the role of the boundary of "space-time." One way to think about this is the usual evolution of time over a finite interval. In this case the boundary of space-time is the union of the space at the initial time and at the target time. Quantum field theory on a space-time with boundary is important not only for high energy physics, but also for low energy physics, for example insulators and other states of matter where the surface (the boundary) has distinguishing physical properties. This project will develop algebraic tools to study two and three dimensional quantum field theories. It will also construct quantum field theories with infinite dimensional symmetries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposal consists of three parts. The common theme is the effect of the boundary on local quantum field theory and on local spacial models in statistical mechanics. The first part is focused on representation theory. The main goals are to connect coideal subalgebras to boundary q-Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equation by studying vertex operators for principal series representations of the corresponding quantum affine algebras; to study integrable systems on symmetric spaces; and to construct invariants of knots with flat connections in the complement using R-matrix intertwining representations of quantum sl(2) at roots of unity and construct the corresponding invariants of 3-manifolds via surgery. In the second part the goals are to construct perturbative topological quantum field theories, which involves constructing perturbative topoplogical quantum field theory for manifolds with boundary; and to construct semiclassical asymptotic for q-6j symbols for simple Lie algebras of rank grater then one. The goal of the third part is the study of limit shapes in statistical mechanics. This part is closely related to the second part and can be regarded as the study of the semiclassical limit of spin models in statistical mechanics. The main concept is that the thermodynamical limit is similar to the semiclassical limit. The models in question involve the stochastic 6-vertex model, ASEP models and others.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Here is the list of some major outcomes of the project.     Topological quantum field theories on symplectic complexes are constructed   using perturbative Batalin-Vilkovisky method. This is an important step towards  construction of quantum gauge field theories. This result handles the gauge fixing   in such theories. It gives a theory that does not depend how to approximate the  space time by a cell complex. The method gives a gauge invariant regularization for  space times with boundary and is a natural candidate for using in more complicated  non-topological gauge theories like Yang-Mills theory.     Similar method applied for Poisson sigma model gives a semiclassical expansion  for eigenfunctions of commuting Hamiltonians in quantum integrable systems in  terms of Feynman diagrams. This result demonstrates the universality of the semiclassical  limit in integrable systems. In particular, it gives a semiclassical asymptotic for   6j symbols and their quantum counterparts in terms of the geometry of corresponding  coadjoint orbits in multiplicity free cases. Moreover it gives a away how to construct  the semiclassical expansion in all orders.      A superintgerable system in Hamiltonian mechanics is has a remarkable property that  dimensions of compact invariant tori have an upper bound which can be less  then half of the dimension of the phase space. A classical example of such system  is Kepler system. A large class of superintegrable systems was constructed on symplectic leaves  of moduli spaces of flat connections. This study was motivated by investigating connections  between co-ideal subalgebras and boundary dynamical q-KZ equations.     Finally the PI obtained the statistics of irreducible components in large tensor  products of finite dimensional representations of simple Lie groups.  These results extend previous ones by many authors. Similar results were    used recently in quantum information theory. They can be recasted in terms   of a natural class of random walks.     The PI organized many conference, gave lectures, advised graduate and  undergraduate students. Results outlined above are published.
