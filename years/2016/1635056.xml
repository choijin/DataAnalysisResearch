<AbstractNarration>This project will build upon model-based investigation of group decision-making in animals, to create a rigorous methodology for bio-inspired control of multi-agent systems.  It is well known that bird flocks and fish schools show a remarkable ability to choose between mutually exclusive competing options with speed, accuracy, robustness and adaptability.  This project will derive a general and flexible framework for modeling collective decision making, by applying singularity and bifurcation theory to graph-based representations of the dynamics of networked systems. The mathematical framework will be validated on experimental data from observations of swarming honeybees and schooling fish. The resulting methodology will find application to design and control of, for example, mobile sensing networks, transportation networks, and power networks. These applications have significant potential societal impact in environmental monitoring, hazard response, transportation, energy, healthcare, and manufacturing.  Leveraging this exciting, cross-disciplinary topic, the project will engage middle and high school girls through researcher visits into schools, and student and teacher visits to the Principle Investigator's lab.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An analytically tractable, abstract agent-based model for collective decision-making dynamics that captures nonlinear phenomena observed in animal groups will be used.  This will enable a new methodology for coordinated decision-making that extends current capabilities of networks of dynamic agents to reliably perform demanding tasks in complex, changing environments. A principled approach, based on singularity theory -- a robust bifurcation theory -- will be used for this model to connect biology to engineering design.  Realizations of collective decision-making between alternatives will be derived and conditions for high performance proved by building in value-sensitive decision-making and addressing heterogeneity in preferences across the group. Explorations will go beyond biologically plausible parameter ranges to identify and prove conditions for high-performing engineered collective decision-making dynamics.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ We have developed a theory of social decision making for an interacting group of decision makers together with a mathematical model that reveals the underlying mechanisms of opinion formation, opinion transition, and opinion cascade. The model provides an analytically tractable explanation for the observed resilience in the behavior of animal groups, i.e., their flexibility in response to changing environmental conditions and their robustness to disturbance and uncertainty.  In the designed setting, e.g., for design of decision-making strategies for a team of search-and-rescue robots, we can use the model dynamics to ensure the kind of remarkable resilience observed in biological groups.    Our model describes continuous-time opinion dynamics for an arbitrary number of agents that communicate over a network and form real-valued opinions about an arbitrary number of options.  The model generalizes linear and nonlinear models in the literature. Drawing from biology, physics, and social psychology, we introduce an attention parameter to modulate the strength of social influence on an agent’s opinion formation process.  Attention can be driven by an urgency in deciding among options or a susceptibility to social influence. We also introduce a saturation function that bounds the magnitude of inter-agent and intra-agent opinion exchanges.  The result is simply parameterized dynamics that exhibit the range of opinion formation, transition, and cascade behaviors observed in nature and predicted by model-independent theory but not exhibited by linear models or existing nonlinear models.  Importantly, the opinion formation process is inherently nonlinear as seen in nature.  Opinions form rapidly since they are driven by nonlinearity rather than slow linear integration of evidence. Opinions can form even when there is little or no evidence that one option is better than another, as long as attention (urgency, susceptibility) is sufficiently high.  Behaviors include reliable formation of consensus (agreement) and dissensus (disagreement), even in homogeneous networks. This is a departure from the literature, which predicts that strong heterogeneity is required in order for groups to reach dissensus, i.e., a polarized state.  The opinion dynamics display ultra-sensitivity to inputs near critical values of parameters and robustness to disturbance away from those critical points.  The dynamics also exhibit the simultaneous stability of multiple solutions, which explains how transitions between opinion states can be achieved, even between consensus and dissensus. Augmenting the opinion dynamics with feedback dynamics for the attention parameter results in tunable thresholds that govern sensitivity and robustness.  That is, the parameters that describe how attention changes as a function of the state of the system are the parameters that determine implicit thresholds on how much input (or change in input) is needed to enable a response by individuals or the group.  These parameters can thus be chosen to prevent jitter and hesitancy in the opinion formation process.  The theory and model we have developed provide new means for the systematic study and design of dynamics on natural and engineered networks, from information spread and political polarization to collective decision making and dynamic task allocation.
