<AbstractNarration>This award provides funding to help defray the expenses of graduate students and postdocs attending the "Nineteenth Riviere-Fabes Symposium" that will be held from April 15-17, 2016, on the campus of the University of Minnesota.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This annual conference, of which the 2016 meeting will be the nineteenth rendition, honors the mathematical legacies of the late Nestor M. Riviere and Eugene B. Fabes by focusing on recent developments in analysis, especially in the field of partial differential equations. The 2016 program will feature four principal speakers (Andrea Bertozzi, Fanghua Lin, Jonathon Mattingly, and Roman Vershynin), each of whom will deliver a two-hour lecture. The program allows ample time for informal discussion among the participants.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This proposal supported the participation  of graduate students and postdocs at the Nineteenth Riviere-Fabes Symposium, held at the University of Minnesota from April 15 to April 17, 2016.  The symposium focuses on recent developments in Analysis, in 2016 especially in the fields of  partial differential equations, applied analysis, high-dimensional probability, harmonic analysis, geometric measure theory, calculus of variations. The 2016 program featured four two-hour speakers: Andrea Bertozzi, Fanghua Lin, Jonathan Mattingly, Roman Vershynin.   More than 50 mathematicians participated, mostly from outside of the University of Minnesota.  Local funds were used for the organization expenses, as well as for the costs associated with the travel of the speakers. The NSF grant funded junior participants from other universities.   Intellectual merits. The principal speakers listed  above represent research programs of considerable interest to the mathematical community and have all demonstrated remarkable recent progress in these programs. The intellectual merit of the proposal lies mainly in the opportunity to bring these researchers together with  other participants and in the interactions and communication of ideas that will result.  Broader impact.  The broader impact of the proposed grant is in the dissemination and promotion of mathematical discovery and understanding, and broadening participation of under-represented groups. The NSF support gave 35 young researchers without other funding the opportunity  to participate in the conference.
