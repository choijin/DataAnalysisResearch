<AbstractNarration>Because of the slow pace of terrestrial ecosystem processes, including the slow generation time, growth rate, and decomposition rate of trees, the impact of changing climate and disturbance on forests plays out over hundreds of years. For this reason, terrestrial ecosystem models are used to anticipate the centennial scale projections of forest response to environmental change. Current terrestrial ecosystem model predictions vary widely and results have large statistical uncertainties. Furthermore, testing and calibration of these models relies on short term (sub-daily to decadal) data that fail to capture longer term trends and infrequent extreme events. The capacity of ecosystem models for scientific inference and long-term prediction would be greatly improved if uncertainties can be reduced through rigorous testing against observational data. PalEON is an interdisciplinary team of paleoecologists, statisticians, and modelers that have partnered to rigorously synthesize longer term paleoecological data and incorporate into ecosystem models to provide a deeper understanding of past dynamics and to use this knowledge to improve long-term forecasting capabilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Funds are provided to address four objectives and associated research questions: 1) Validation: How well do ecosystem models simulate decadal-to-centennial dynamics when confronted with past climate change, and what limits model accuracy? 2) Initialization: How sensitive are ecosystem models to initialization state and equilibrium assumptions? Do data-constrained simulations of centennial-scale dynamics improve 20thcentury simulations? 3) Inference: Was the terrestrial biosphere a carbon sink or source during the Little Ice Age and Medieval Climate Anomaly? and 4) Improvement: How can parameters and processes responsible for data-model divergences be improved? The data synthesis will include wide range of ecosystems, encompasses past climate variations that were large enough to affect tree growth rates, disturbance regimes, and forest demography, and leverages available paleodata. The synthesis will include 1) fossil pollen and Public Land Survey data to reconstruct forest composition, 2) sedimentary charcoal, stand-age and firescar indicators of past disturbance regimes, 3) tree-ring records of tree growth rates, and 4) multiple paleoclimatic proxies and paleoclimatic simulations. Bayesian hierarchical statistical models will be used to reconstruct key ecological variables and their associated uncertainty estimates. A standardized model intercomparison involving 13 ecosystem modeling groups will be used to evaluate the robustness of the modeling approach.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Three areas will be emphasized for PalEON's broader impacts. Community Building: The PalEON research community has doubled over the past 10 months, with more than 60 participants now. It is anticipated to nearly another doubling over the next five years, and the funds will allow the ongoing community-building via annual large meetings and task-oriented workshops. Interdisciplinary Training and Mentoring: A new generation of researchers will be trained to naturally conceptualize large spatial and temporal scales and to approach ecological forecasting as an integrative activity spanning data collection to model prediction. Eight postdocs and seven graduate students will be involved in proposed PalEON research, with multiple opportunities for cross-training. Additionally, the PalEON Summer Short Course provides an intensive cross-training experience for young scientists in all areas encompassed by PalEON. The 2012 course will be followed by courses in 2014 and 2016.  Building Scientific Infrastructure: All PalEON datasets will be made publicly available upon publication, as will our new data-assimilation methods and model intercomparison protocols. Tools will be developed for optimal site selection (given the goal of reducing the integrated prediction uncertainty about past vegetation and climate over space and time) and will distribute a publicly available webtool version that will be linked directly to the Neotoma Paleoecology Database.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Ongoing and predicted global change, including changes in climate, land-use, and natural disturbance regimes, have profound impacts on terrestrial ecosystems and the services they provide to society. Predicting these outcomes is a major challenge to ecologists and Earth scientists, with direct implications for policy makers, and land and natural-resource managers. The major goals of PalEON were to improve our ability to understand and accurately predict terrestrial ecosystem change, through the combined advancement and application of paleoecological records, statistical modeling, and ecosystem modeling. PalEON was a large collaborative project, with PIs from over a half-dozen institutions. The principal goals of the work through this award were to develop new fire history records in a previously unstudied portion of boreal forest in interior Alaska, and collate existing fire history records across Alaska to help test and evaluate statistical and ecosystem models projecting fire activity over the past 2000 years. The major project outcomes, communicated at scientific meetings and published in two papers, are summarized below.</p> <p>We investigated the relative importance of climate and landscape flammability as drivers of fire activity in boreal forests by developing high-resolution records of fire history, and characterizing their centennial-scale relationships to temperature and vegetation dynamics.<em> </em>Specifically, we reconstructed the timing of fire activity within and around the Nowitna National Wildlife Refuge in interior Alaska, USA, using seven lake-sediment charcoal records spanning the past 465 yr (1550-2015 CE), and compared fire history to existing records of vegetation and climate. Our results add to a growing number of studies suggesting that recent burning is approaching or exceeding the highest rates of burning experienced in Alaskan boreal forests over the past 2,000-6,000 years, a pattern well correlated with increasing summer or growing-season temperatures. Our results also show evidence that past periods of widespread burning across the study area were controlled by a combination of climate and vegetation dynamics that together influenced flammability. At landscape to regional spatial scales, the response of fire regimes to ongoing and future climate change will thus depend both on climate, as a primary driver of fuel moisture, and stand age, as a determinant of broad-scale fuel continuity and fuel loading. These results highlight the importance integrating site- and landscape-level fire history into ecosystem models, as fire-regime response to climate change is in part contingent upon past fire history.</p> <p>In a second study, we investigated the impact of threshold relationships on our ability to project ecological change outside the observational record, using the challenge of predicting fire regimes in boreal forest and tundra ecosystems of Alaska over the past c. 1200 yr. Specifically, we informed a set of existing statistical models that predict the 30-yr probability of fire occurrence based on mean climate conditions, with downscaled global climate model data spanning the period 850-1850 CE. We evaluated model performance outside the observational record by comparing results to 29 previously published lake-sediment based fire-history records from both boreal forests and tundra ecosystems in Alaska. We found that statistical projections of fire activity were highly sensitivity to changing threshold relationships and uncertainty in the climate data driving the models. Our results imply that projections of future ecosystem change in threshold-governed ecosystems will be accompanied by notable uncertainty. This work further suggests that ecological responses to climate change will exhibit high variability across space and time, as different geographic regions approach and surpass climatic thresholds over the 21<sup>st</sup> century.</p> <p>In addition to these scientific findings, the project helped train the next generation of scientists, including undergraduate and postgraduate students, a MS student, and a PhD student. Both graduate students obtained fellowships that supported their contributions to the project, including a Joint Fire Science Program Graduate Innovation Award, and a University of Minnesota LacCore visiting Graduate Student Award. The project also engaged four undergraduate or post-graduate students in research and scientific discovery, through field and lab work. Findings from this project were also consistently included in an undergraduate Fire Ecology course taught by the PI.</p> <p>Finally, note that PIs from Notre Dame, University of Arizona, University of Wisconsin, Boston University, and Harvard Forest have requested no-cost extensions to finalize a number of analyses.
