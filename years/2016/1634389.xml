<AbstractNarration>Because of increased global water scarcity governments are increasingly considering the contribution made by desalination as a primary source of drinking water. Thus, the fate of dense brine effluent from coastal discharges is becoming an increasingly acute issue. The areal extent over which brine plumes from desalination facilities impact the coastal ocean remains a major uncertainty, particularly because there are energetic internal wave fields which can cause significant mixing in many coastal oceans where desalination facilities are present or proposed. Fundamental understanding of the mixing of the plume with the ambient receiving waters is thus critical to predicting the concentrations of brine and chemical additives in the plume and surrounding waters. In particular, determining the pathways and mechanisms in which the mixing and dilution of dense gravity-current underflows down slopes are influenced by oncoming internal waves is an outstanding question. Although our understanding of how waves on slopes break and how gravity currents descend through stratified environments have independently moved forward considerably in recent years, surprisingly little work has been done on the increasingly important coupling problem. This project will address this need using laboratory experimentation in combination with complementary numerical simulations and theoretical modeling. The experiments and theoretical approach extends gravity current analysis to the important setting of breaking interfacial waves in the environment. Understanding the influence of this kind of ambient motion on dispersion in gravity currents is important to many industrial and scientific fields. For example, the results of this work will enable industry and other stakeholders to make better assessments of the environmental impacts of desalination design alternatives, including the potential creation of GIS-based tools. Summer research students will be engaged through the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering?s Research Experience for Undergraduates Program and the Stanford Summer Engineering Academy run by the School of Engineering. This project will also directly support the training and education of a post-doctoral researcher and one graduate student, who will both be involved in teaching undergraduates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed laboratory experiments and numerical simulations will establish what happens to a gravity current that descends down a slope through an ambient that has a two-layer density profile and internal gravity waves. Numerical simulations of the same experimental setup will be validated against the laboratory observations, and then used to further investigate parameter regimes unattainable in the laboratory. A theoretical framework based on the potential energy required to change the density profile within the current will be created to understand the detrainment observations from first principles.  The investigation will be performed using internal wave tank and numerical modeling facilities, and will examine the physics of how interfacial waves influence inclined gravity currents. Shoaling internal waves have different regimes of breaking, including non-breaking seiches on steep slopes; coherent boluses; less-coherent and more turbulent boluses; and turbulent surges. Gravity currents descending through two-layer ambients can either form intrusions at the pycnocline; form underflows which penetrate beneath the lower layer; or split into an intruding and an under flowing part. When gravity currents and internal waves are present at the same time, however, much less is known. This project will lead to substantial new insight in two ways: by identifying and systematically cataloging the ways that internal waves can influence the physics of gravity currents, and by building and validating mathematical models of the mechanisms by which they do so. Three key parameters (the wave Froude number, the Iribarren number, and the density Richardson number of the current) will be used to define the parameter space of the investigation.</AbstractNarration>

To achieve these aims, we employed a combination of laboratory experiments, numerical simulations, and theoretical modeling.</p> <p>From the experiments we have learned that the presence of a pycnocline causes a gravity current to split and intrude into the ambient at two distinct levels of neutral buoyancy, as opposed to the classical description of gravity currents in stratified media as being either a pure under or interflow. This is shown in the attached Figure 1 which shows three different inflow conditions. The inflows are characterized by a Richardson number (Ri-rho) which captures the magnitude of the buoyancy flux; the lower Ri-rho the stronger the inflow.</p> <p>Additionally, we have also identified two different types of waves that form on the pycnocline in response to the intrusion of the gravity current. An underflow-dominated regime causes a pycnocline displacement where the speed of the wave crest is locked to the gravity current (as shown in Figure 2), whereas an interflow-dominated regime launches an internal wave that moves much faster than the gravity current head or interfacial intrusion (as shown in Figure 3).</p> <p>We also completed a full set of experiments investigating the effects of the basin walls interacting with the initiated waves, and characterized the reflected waves and subsequent mixing efficiencies. From these longer time scale experiments we have identified two modes of motion initiated by the interaction. First, there is a low frequency surge of the lower layer caused by the gravity current, and also higher frequency internal waves that break when they encounter the topographic slope and quickly dissipate. The results are very similar to the motions induced by a relaxation of a sustained wind over a stratified basin. The initial system response (described by a Wedderburn-like number), was found to be a linear function of the forcing (gravity current Richardson number); however this formulation most likely has constraints based on the geometry of the basin. The mixing efficiency of the reflected internal waves breaking on the topographic slope was quantified as an overall mixing efficiency (across all wave breaking events), and was found to be low compared to previous similar studies. The additional motion caused by the lower frequency surge is likely the reason for this. &nbsp;</p> <p>Our numerical simulations of the same physical set-up show that incident (upslope) internal waves can have a significant influence on the mass transported by a gravity current. As the amplitude of the internal wave was increased we observed a progressive reduction in the average mass flux of the source gravity current fluid and the thickness of the gravity current. Specifically, the mass flux in the initial part of the gravity current was reduced by 40% when the largest wave produced in this study, with wave Froude number of 0.29, was incident on the slope. In a similar manner to the laboratory experiments the numerical simulations also show that the gravity current splits into an intrusion of diluted fluid that propagates along the interface and a hyperpycnal current that continues to move downslope. The simulations provide detailed quantitative information on the energy budget components and the mixing dynamics of the current?wave interaction, which demonstrates the existence of two distinct parameter regimes. The first regime corresponds to small-amplitude waves that affect the current in a largely transient fashion, so that the post-interaction properties of the current approach those in the absence of a wave. The second regime corresponds to large-amplitude waves, which perform a sufficiently large amount of work on the gravity current fluid so as to modify its properties over the long term. Finally, the numerical simulations also identified the presence of an initial ?decapitation? event whereby the initial wave-current interaction greatly reduces the downslope flow of the gravity current.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <div></div> <div></div> <div></div> <div></div> <div></div><br> <p>            Last Modified: 11/29/2020<br>      Modified by: Jeffrey&nbsp;R&nbsp;Koseff</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1634389/1634389_10451728_1606666725344_Figure7--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1634389/1634389_10451728_1606666725344_Figure7--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 2:"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1634389/1634389_10451728_1606666725344_Figure7--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 2:"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Figure 2: Progressive snapshots of a gravity current with Ri-rho = 1.7 in the lower layer, where the crest of the pycnocline deflection is locked (i.e. remains in the same relative position) to the gravity current head.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Yukinobo Tanimoto</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyright owner is an institution with an existing agreement allowing use by NSF</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Jeffrey&nbsp;R&nbsp;Koseff</div> <div class="imageTitle">Figure 2:</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1634389/1634389_10451728_1606666807164_Figure8--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1634389/1634389_10451728_1606666807164_Figure8--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 3:"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1634389/1634389_10451728_1606666807164_Figure8--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 3:"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Figure 3: Progressive snapshots of a gravity current with Ri-rho = 3.7.
