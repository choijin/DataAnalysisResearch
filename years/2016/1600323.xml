<AbstractNarration>General Audience Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is to support a workshop, the seventh annual meeting of the Society for the Study of Nanoscience and Emerging Technologies (S.NET). The meeting will take place in Montréal, Québec, Canada, on 18-21 October 2015. It will be held in conjunction with the Knowledge Network on the Ethical, Environmental, Economic, Legal and Social issues regarding Nanotechnology Network. The funds will be used to enable participation of students, postdoctoral researchers, junior scholars and independent scholars who have minimal travel and lodging funds to attend, and fully participate in, the 2015 S.NET meeting in Montréal. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;S.NET is an international scholarly organization devoted to furthering critical and diverse analyses of technoscientific research and development in various fields. It includes a wide range of academic and professional communities, and strives to incorporate a correspondingly broad spectrum of disciplinary perspectives and methodologies into its scholarly activities. The award will support the professional development of junior science and technology studies scholars, as well as students and researchers from underrepresented groups. More generally, it will encourage the production of scholarship of significant and practical value to multiple important societal activities, including the critical advancement of a wide range of scientific and technological inquiries, innovative approaches to product development and sustainable marketization, and, consequently, insurance of the near-term well-being and longer-term survival and enrichment of humanity.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ National Science Foundation Project Outcome Report: Award Number 1600323  Workshop: Building Better Futures-Junior Scholar Support for the 2015 Annual Meeting of The Society for the Study of Nanoscience and Emerging Technologies (October 18-21, 2015)     Overview   National Science Foundation grant award # 1600323 funded a workshop entitled Building Better Futures-Junior Scholar Support for the 2015 Annual Meeting of The Society for the Study of Nanoscience and Emerging Technologies ("Building Better Futures"). The workshop was designed to enable the participation of junior Science and Technology Studies researchers, and researchers from underrepresented groups at the 2015 annual meeting of The Society for the Studies of New and emerging Technologies ("SNET" colloquially, and formerly "The Society for the Study of Nanoscience and Emerging Technologies"). S.NET is a scholarly international organization whose primarily mission is to further critical and diverse analyses of technoscientific phenomena, particularly in emerging and under-examined domains.     S.NET members come from a wide range of academic and professional communities, and the Society strives to incorporate diverse disciplinary perspectives and methodologies into scholarly activities. Most of its conference participants use analytical approaches derived from the humanities and social sciences, but S.NET encourages inclusion of engineering and natural science perspectives that can further discourse on emerging technologies, science knowledge production and co-constituting interactions between the societal and technoscientific.     Realization that such an organization offers ample opportunities for junior scholars to present their work, converse with more senior scholars and extend their professional networks was the primary impulse behind this grant?s submission.     The bulk of the funds secured through this grant were used to support the participation of citizens or residents of the United States. To further NSF?s goals of broad dissemination of funded project results, and increased international understanding of interpenetrating technological and societal changes, some funds were also used to enable the participation of researchers from other countries; the investigators focused specifically on developing countries.     Intellectual Merit  A basic component of S.NET?s traditional fundamental mission is furtherance of critical and diverse analyses of nano-scale technoscientific research and development, and examination of other emerging technoscience. The requested funds helped incentivize and intensify critical intellectual inquiry in nano-scale research and development, and contributed to a wide range of discourses on interactions between society and emerging technoscience. Each of the fifteen (15) participants who received funding under this grant presented at the meeting. Of those fifteen, three (3) generated manuscripts that were ultimately included as chapters in Responsibility and Emerging Technologies: Experiences, Education and Beyond (Bowman, et al. eds., 2016), the edited volume of conference papers compiled by the S.NET?s editorial board. The grant?s primary investigator contributed a Foreword to the volume. The grant?s co-investigator served as lead editor and contributed a chapter to it. Supported participants? chapter submission make up 25% of total number of chapters in Responsibility and Emerging Technologies.     Broader Impacts  The requested funds encouraged the production of scholarship of significant and practical value to multiple important societal activities, including the critical advancement of a wide range of scientific and technological inquiries, innovative approaches to product development and sustainable marketization, and, consequently, insurance of the near-term well-being and longer-term survival and enrichment of humanity. The funds also supported the professional development of junior science and technology studies scholars, as well as students and researchers from underrepresented groups.
