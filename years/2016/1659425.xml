<AbstractNarration>A distributed team of data and workflow facilitators ("cyberteam") from the University of Colorado Boulder, the University of Utah, and Colorado State University support experimental and observational science (EOS) research as part of the Rocky Mountain Advanced Computing Consortium (RMACC). Advances in the number/diversity of data sets require enhanced capabilities to access, reuse, process, analyze, understand, curate, share, and preserve data. A critical aspect of these efforts is to provide expert support for efficient and effective workflows involving data generation, data analysis, visualization, and preservation. Typically, these activities have been the responsibilities of individual researchers, and as a result, data can be difficult to reuse by others. Likewise, computational and data generation workflows are often cobbled together, hard-coded, and not readily amenable for sharing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These problems are addressed by the distributed RMACC cyberteam who will provide support for researchers in the region by assisting them with data and workflow reuse and management. The facilitators have complementary skills and expertise, and are fully integrated into campus and regional efforts. Their focus is on data curation and metadata, and data and compute workflows, including protected information. These facilitators, in collaboration with others in the region, provide and develop regional, shared resources to support data management for small research groups and under-resourced communities, including working with regional RMACC partners.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   The purpose of this project was to provide expert support for researchers on efficient and effective workflows involving data generation, data analysis, visualization, and preservation in the Rocky Mountain Advanced Computing Consortium (RMACC).  The goal of facilitators at the University of Colorado (CU) Boulder, University of Utah, and Colorado State University was to integrate their complementary skills and expertise to focus on data curation and metadata and data and compute workflows, including protected information, to encourage workflow reuse and management to diverse members of RMACC.  This project has had an instrumental impact on the region. Facilitators were hired at each of the institutions as part of this project, with continuing funds provided from the institutions to support these staff members. The facilitators at the three institutions have worked closely together to share expertise among the institutions to advance individual researcher data or computational workflows. An example of this collaboration resulted in opportunities for researchers at CU Boulder to store HIPAA compliant data at the University of Utah to support their projects.  The team deployed a survey and conducted interviews with researchers to determine priorities, challenges, and areas for support.  Results showed most researchers experienced challenges around the introductory use of computational and data resources, including data transfer and access to large-scale computing resources.  High satisfaction was shown by researchers through concierge support offered by the facilitators.  This information resulted in changes to the outreach, training, and support services offered by the service sites to researchers.  The teams focused on providing learning opportunities to ease access to systems, which included enhancing available materials on such topics as Jupyter notebooks, containers, data transfer, and support throughout the research data lifecycle.  The strong collaboration between the three facilitators resulted in shared expertise that researchers directly benefited from, as the facilitators often worked together to solve individual problems.  This project also enhanced collaboration throughout the region, resulting in several well-attended sessions at the annual RMACC symposium, collaborative proposals, and increased engagement by the home institutions in supporting data and compute resources.  At the University of Colorado, the Center for Research Data and Digital Scholarship (CRDDS) was formed, resulting in strong collaborative activities on data lifecycle issues among the Research Computing and Libraries groups.  Other impacts have included working with the Northeast Cyberteam project to become part of their Connect.Cyberinfrastructure portal, allowing members of RMACC to connect with other regional consortiums across the country.  This project has also resulted in off-site backups of researcher data, providing data storage to all members of RMACC via CU’s large-scale data storage resource, and increasing the number of affiliates who have joined RMACC.  A continuing and direct result of this project is the formation of the RMACC facilitators group, which meets monthly to discuss facilitation issues researchers and support staff face at institutions across RMACC.
