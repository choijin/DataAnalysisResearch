<AbstractNarration>This project supports students at U.S. institutions to attend the 5th Networking Networking Women (N^2Women) Workshop. This workshop will be co-located with the ACM MobiCom 2016 conference, to be held in New York City, NY, October 2016.  The workshop will be a full-day event.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this proposal resides in the contributions that the student participants will make to (1) the N^2Women Workshop, (2) the MobiCom 2016 event (the premier conference in the mobile networking communications field) and (3) the future scientific progress of the student's research. Participant support funds will allow these graduate students to attend high-caliber technical presentations, be exposed to state-of-the-art research, and interact with leading researchers and fellow graduate students.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This grant provided financial support for women to attend the N2Women Workshop in 2016 and 2017.   N2Women (Networking Networking Women) is a discipline-specific community of researchers in the fields of networking and communications.  N2Women encourages diversity and aims at fostering connections among under-represented women in this computing sub-field.   N2Women workshops are full-day professional development workshops. The objectives of the N2Women Workshops are:  Connect newer generations of networking women researchers with the community and create mentorship relationships. Such relationships are particularly important for students and junior researchers at institutions where such mentorship is missing or is inadequate. This continues the tradition of previous N2 Women workshops. Create a research forum in which students and junior researchers learn and discuss current trends in networking, present their results and receive feedback. This will be achieved by soliciting research posters that will be presented in a poster session and a poster competition. Engage the women community with other underrepresented groups in networking and communications. In particular, we will target the African- American and Latino-American communities. This will be reflected thorough diverse members of the panels and the topics discussed in small groups.   Students had the opportunity to present their work, received feedback from top reserachers in the field, and network with top resreachers.   The two workshops were help in conjunction with ACM MOBICOM (2016), and ACM SIGCOMM (2017), allowing students to also attend these two flagship conferences in networking.  The webites of the two workshops are:  2016 - http://n2women.comsoc.org/workshops/new-york-2016/  2017 - http://n2women.comsoc.org/workshops/los-angeles-2017/          Last Modified: 09/03/2018       Submitted by: Cristina Nita-Rotaru]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
