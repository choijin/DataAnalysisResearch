<AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nontechnical Explanation of the project's significance and importance&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The availability of spatial data from satellite imagery has increased in both scope and resolution in recent years. The Polar Geospatial Center (PGC) at the University of Minnesota has been a principal resource for remote-sensing data from the Arctic and Antarctic regions and they now have the ability to provide enhanced access to a wider spectrum of the Earth Science research community. This project will convene a workshop to explore the latest developments in satellite imagery, its interpretation and availability, and explore the possibilities for expanding the services of the Polar Geospatial Center to a variety of research fields that would benefit from detailed images of landscapes and topography.&lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;Technical Description &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The overall goal of the workshop is to avail the Earth Science research community of the commercial imagery, services, infrastructure, and technology that is offered by the Polar Geospatial Center. This center and its partners have transformed the poles from one of the least mapped and imaged regions on Earth to one of the most. The Polar Geospatial Center has developed innovative and dependable services along with products built on capabilities that are not readily available to a significant proportion of the science community. This workshop will build on the Center's successes and further explore the possibilities for extending availability of the imagery and associated tools and products to other Earth-science researchers. It has become clear that there is significant demand for the high-resolution commercial imagery and products that the Center curates and produces. Experience has shown that if data is online and the community is educated about how to effectively use the imagery collection, then additional science can be supported. These research efforts can help earth science researchers with societally important measurements, such as the degree of coastline erosion, the extent of landslide hazards, and the monitoring of long-term monitoring of Earth-surface processes.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   The overall goal of the workshop was to produce a report outlining the opportunity that the combination of the commercial imagery and the PGC services/infrastructure and technology offers the earth science community. The workshop report will be used by NSF, PGC, and PGC's Science and Operations Committee to help determine the direction of PGC's nonpolar science support.    Intellectual Merit:  PGC and its partners have transformed the poles from one of the least mapped and imaged regions on Earth to one of the most. This change was enabled by the continued support of the NSF, the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA), and the polar science community. With the help of these collaborators, PGC has developed innovative and dependable services along with products built on capabilities that were not imaginable when PGC began and are not readily available to a significant proportion of the NSF funded science community. This workshop builds on PGC?s successes at the poles, and further explores the possibilities for extending availability to the imagery and associated tools and products to the NSF earth sciences communities.     Broader Impacts:  It has become clear that there is significant demand outside of NSF-OPP for the high-resolution NGA commercial imagery and products that PGC curates and produces. Though it is not practical for PGC to support the use of high-resolution imagery for the rest of the Earth with the one-on-one support it provides to NSF?s polar researchers, experience has taught PGC that if data is online and PGC educates the community on how to effectively use the imagery collection then additional science can be supported. The societal implications of PGC?s products derived from the NGA commercial imagery have never been more important or relevant. PGC?s products could help NSF earth science researchers measure coastline erosion, and change detection associated with other Earth surface processes, in addition to many other societally relevant themes and challenges.    Project Summary and Outcomes    In May 2017, 27 NSF-funded geoscience researchers convened for a two-day workshop at the University of Minnesota McNamara Alumni Center to discuss and explore the benefits of expansion of the NGA-OPP arrangement to a broader spectrum of NSF-sponsored geoscience research. The workshop was held May 23-24, with a smaller set of the organizing committee members and other participants meeting for a third day on May 25th to begin outlining and drafting the workshop report. Kip Hodges of Arizona State University was the chair of the organizing committee, and led efforts for producing the workshop report. A final outcome of the award is that the workshop participants and the steering committee found great benefit in extending PGC's products and services to support EAR researchers. On the most basic level, high-resolution imagery would be provided anywhere on the Earth. Digital Surface Models can be produced on-demand and at scale. The committee also stated that perhaps the most significant contribution would be the community's access to PGC's User Services staff and consulting capability. In addition, NGA and NSF Polar have funded the establishment of the hardware and software to provide the imagery and derived products to the community. This is a significant investment that could leverage a modest additional outlay by EAR.             Last Modified: 07/03/2019       Submitted by: Paul J Morin]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
