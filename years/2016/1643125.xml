<AbstractNarration>The 2016 Paul J. Sally, Jr. Midwest Representation Theory Conference will be held October 14-16, 2016, on the campus of University of Iowa, Iowa City, Iowa. The conference will gather established experts, junior researchers and graduate students for the purpose of discussing and disseminating new research results. Representation theory is a branch of mathematics devoted to the study of symmetries of mathematical and physical systems that has applications to many other areas of mathematics, particularly number theory and geometry. This is the 42nd anniversary of the original Midwest Conference. Over the years it has served as an important source of information for experts in the field and numerous collaborative efforts have originated from these meetings. This year's meeting will continue that tradition. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference will feature ten main talks, including talks by young researchers, on a broad range of topics in representation theory of groups over non-archimedean local fields. Topics covered may include Plancherel formula, supercuspidal representations, the structure of smooth representations of reductive groups via types and covers, functorial transfer to general linear groups, and the Local Langlands Correspondence.
