<AbstractNarration>Digital forensics is a critical area of forensic science research. New electronic devices and systems are constantly being developed, and these are at risk of being compromised by cybercriminals. The University of South Alabama will bring together academic researchers and industry/agency partners to identify specific projects in Digital Forensics Information Intelligence and work towards establishing a research site that would be part of a larger, multi-site Center for Advanced Research in Forensic Science. The researchers will focus on basic and fundamental research topics in digital forensics that will support industry innovation, economic growth, and national security by making new technologies safer and more secure. The University of South Alabama also has multiple, established channels for dissemination of research findings, K-12 science outreach, undergraduate and graduate student training, and support of diversity and the inclusion of underrepresented groups in the STEM sciences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The University of South Alabama will hold a planning meeting with the goal of establishing a research site in an Industry/University Cooperative Research Center (I/UCRC) for Advanced Research in Forensic Science (CARFS). The mission of the proposed Center is to provide a multidisciplinary forum for advancing research, innovation, and training in the forensic sciences. The University of South Alabama research site will focus on Digital Forensics Information Intelligence (DFII), which is the development, testing and implementation of novel approaches to detect and understand compromises to electronic devices, information systems, and software. The research site will undertake industry-collaborative, long-term research addressing such topics as malicious software analysis, detection and exploitation; and technology evaluation. Application areas include mobile devices, additive manufacturing, medical devices, and transportation systems. This is a critical area of research, given the constant development of new electronic devices and systems and their risk of compromise by cybercriminals. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This planning grant is jointly supported by NSF and the National Institute of Justice.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The University of South Alabama, School of Computing (SoC) applied for the IUCRC Planning grant in order to allow us to establish an industry-academia joint research program. The Planning Grant?s three primary activities were to:    1. Develop an IUCRC research and industry collaboration vision and supporting structure that facilitates joint research between SoC and industry partner investigators    2. Recruit industry partners to join collaborative research and commit to the Center through funded research.    3. Conduct a planning meeting that leads to a full proposal to the NSF IUCRC program  SoC received the NSF IUCRC planning grant award in May 2016 and conducted an IUCRC planning meeting that brought together SoC researchers, prospective industry partners, and NSF representatives in September. There, we presented prospective projects and promoted industry membership in the Center, engaged the industry partners for research ideas, and solicited feedback on the overall DFII concept.  Through the recruiting activities that were enabled by this award we engaged over seventy separate companies, agencies, and academic organizations seeking partnerships with joint research interests. Through these efforts, we successfully attained industry partner support that exceeded NSF membership and funding requirements for submission of a full IUCRC proposal in January of this year. That proposal was funded in July of this year.  The Digital Forensics Information Intelligence (DFII) IUCRC site (http://www.southalabama.edu/colleges/soc/research/nsfdigitalforensics.html) is now fully operational and has five active joint industry-university research projects on digital forensics. Interest continues to grow in the site and we will continue to recruit additional partners to find future joint research projects.  The DFII Site?s research scope strives to enhance the body of knowledge in digital forensic science through core long-term research thrusts in malicious software analysis, technology evaluation, and detection and exploitation. We have identified four target areas where SoC faculty will bring applied research to bear on new technologies with potentially cross cutting industry impact: (1) Mobile devices, (2) Additive manufacturing, (3) Medical devices, and (4) Transportation systems.
