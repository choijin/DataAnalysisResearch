<AbstractNarration>Plastics are made from polymers and polymer manufacture represents one of the largest and most dynamic sectors of the chemical industry. Companies are targeting better performing polymer materials derived from more economical and environmentally friendly (bio-renewable) feedstocks. These improvements are often driven by chemical advancements in polymer synthesis research, such as the work supported by this award. It is critical to the field of polymer chemistry to improve the basic understanding of the relationships between polymer structure and the properties of the resulting plastic, which is a primary goal of this research.  Undergraduate students, including low income and first generation college students, perform laboratory work for this study and receive valuable training to prepare them for graduate school and/or employment in the chemical industry. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With the support from the Macromolecular, Supramolecular, and Nanochemistry Program of the NSF Division of Chemistry, Prof. Robertson of Northland College and Prof. Carney of the University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire conduct collaborative research to better understand the properties of ruthenium catalysts in polymerization reactions.  Specifically, this project focuses on making advancements in five key areas: (1) preparation of polymers from bio-renewable monomers, such as 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF), (2) polymer alternatives to polyurethanes (found in many paints, varnishes, adhesives, and foams), (3) increasing the utility of commodity plastics, (4) depolymerization methods to produce useful chemicals from waste plastics, and (5) synthesis of new ruthenium compounds to better understand the impacts of chemical structure on the catalyst's performance.  Toward this end, the research team is synthesizing and studying new ruthenium catalysts with structurally versatile N-phosphinoamidine and beta-diketimine ligand backbones.</AbstractNarration>

The primary outcome of the project was the development of synthetic methods for the synthesis of polyureas and polycycloacetals, two classes of polymeric materials that are formed from readily available building blocks (monomers) and often with high levels of biorenewable content.
