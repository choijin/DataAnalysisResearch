<AbstractNarration>Valorization is the process of transforming by-products and co-products into valuable products such as fine chemicals, materials (specifically polymer) and fuels. Waste valorization is based on the concept of circular economy and has attracted much attention in recent years with the aim of managing and reusing co-products that would otherwise end up in landfills. This conference is designed to spur discussions among food (agricultural and aquaculture) product manufacturers, biochemical industries, academia and foundations to systematically explore co-products available from various industrial sectors, the challenges in disposal, and opportunities for conversion of this waste into useful products while lowering environmental impact and/or toxicity. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This conference will serve as a platform to support the needs for this growing community of researchers working on the unique aspects of pre-consumer waste valorization.  The conference will feature a workshop to discuss research priorities in the area of organic waste valorization and identify the steps necessary for the advancement of this topic.  A conference website will be maintained and will act as the platform for further interaction and collaboration for developing ideas and research agenda in this area. The conference will be held at the University of Massachusetts - Lowell on December 12-13, 2016.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Waste Valorization Conference 2016 was focused on pre-consumer waste by-products that constitute a largely yet-to-be utilized resource with the potential for being turned into feedstock for the production of value-added products.  The goal was to demonstrate that pre-consumer waste by-products that constitute a largely yet-to-be utilized resource can be turned into feedstock for the production of various value-added products in an economically viable manner. This would potentially allow for reclassification of "waste" as a valuable component of the resource economy. Understanding and disseminating information on the true cost of under or non-utilization of co-products or byproducts and the need for life-cycle thinking as well as toxics use reduction were important aspects of this conference.  Conference Objectives:  The waste valorization conference was designed to spur discussions among food (agricultural and aquaculture) product manufacturers, biochemical industries, academia and foundations to systematically explore co-products available from various industrial sectors, the challenges in disposal and opportunities for conversion of this waste into useful products while lowering the environmental impact and/or toxicity. Examples of successful sustainable conversion of solid pre-consumer co-products, gaseous co-products such as methane and carbon dioxide into value-added products were considered for presentations from industry and academia followed by discussions.  The conference was geared towards, experts in Agriculture, Aquaculture industry and Timber/Forestry, Food manufacturers and processors, waste handlers, waste valorization experts in the biochemical and petrochemical industry  Accomplishments:  This first ever conference on Waste Valorization was organized around three featured areas:  1) Co-Product Availability and Utilization; 2) Challenges in Conversion of Feedstock from a Biochemical Perspective; 3) Co-Product Toxicity, Toxics Use Reduction.  Workshop: Priorities and Next Steps Chairs: Debra Darby, Organix Solutions; Nina Goodrich, GreenBlue  The workshop was scheduled at the end of day to identify economic, social, environmental and technological trends and drivers within the industry to create a foundation toward developing a complete Value Innovation Process (VIP). This was led by Nina Goodrich of the Sustainable Packaging Coalition.   VIP is a workshop tool that identified potential elements of performance around Waste Valorization outlined by resource efficiency, service delivery, use cost, asset recoverability, risk mitigation, profit margins, job creation.  Key Next Steps:  Based on the inputs from both the presenters and the attendees, the following were the recommended next steps:  Broadening the conference organizing committee to include leaders in specific areas. One of the suggestion was to include Dr. Jonathan Krones from Yale University to be part of the committee. Developing a new definition for Waste Valorization that doesn?t involve burning of biomass for merely energy. Primary goal is not to depend on non-renewable hydrocarbon sources for not only energy but also for functional materials.
