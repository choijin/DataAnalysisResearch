<AbstractNarration>This award supports participants in the Texas-Oklahoma Representations and Automorphic Forms (TORA) conference series will take place at the University of North Texas (UNT) in Denton, TX, April 8-10, 2016; at Oklahoma State University (OSU) in Stillwater, OK in Fall 2017; and at the University of Oklahoma (OU) in Norman, OK in Fall 2018.  Each TORA conference will feature three plenary guest speakers consisting of two outstanding leading research mathematicians from outside the Oklahoma-Texas region as well as a recent Ph.D. or a graduate student nearing completion of a Ph.D. In addition, regional graduate students and researchers will present their work. These weekend conferences will provide ample opportunities for collaboration and interactions among the students and researchers in the region, specializing in number theory, automorphic forms and representation theory. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Automorphic forms are basic objects of study in modern number theory.  The interplay between automorphic forms and representation theory has seen a number of very exciting new developments recently which also fuel applications to several other fields. J. Arthur's work on endoscopic classification of representations of the orthogonal and symplectic groups is an example of such new developments.  Research faculty from over a half dozen universities in the Oklahoma and North Texas region work in automorphic forms and representation theory. The TORA conference series has been successful in bringing together researchers from the region and beyond, as well as their students, and propel innovation and exchange. TORA VII-IX will continue this success in collaborations and exchanges not only between institutions, but also among mathematical areas.

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The Texas-Oklahoma Representations and Automorphic forms (TORA) series is a conference series in the south central region of the United States launching collaborations in the Texas-Oklahoma region among mathematicians working in number theory, modern algebra, and related fields.

Meetings were held each year in rotation by Oklahoma State University, University of Oklahoma, and University of North Texas. During each meeting, two prominent guest speakers and a junior plenary speaker from outside the Texas-Oklahoma region presented new research results.

There were 11 regular talks (ranging from 20-50 min) and 5 Speed TORA talks (5 min) on various aspects of automorphic forms and representation theory. There was also a poster session, where several graduate students presented posters on their research. The plenary talks were given by Freydoon Shahidi (Purdue University) and Birgit Speh (Cornell University), and the invited junior plenary talk was given by Shuyang Chen (University of Michigan). A departmental colloquium talk by Ben Brubaker (University of Minnesota) was also held at the start of the conference.
