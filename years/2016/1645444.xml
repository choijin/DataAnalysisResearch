<AbstractNarration>Part I&lt;br/&gt;The Geoscience Diversity Experiential Simulations (GEODES) project tests new research-based methods for providing professional development (PD) in equity and inclusion for geoscientists. The project will create virtual reality role-play simulations designed to teach cohorts of geoscientists to develop and practice skills for recognizing bias and effectively intervening in geoscience-specific scenarios. This new ability to act will also be harnessed in the project?s leadership curriculum by focusing on institutional work to minimize the effects of bias on gatekeeping decisions. Testing the success of these scenarios in changing real-life behavior will contribute to the literature around diversity training for scientists. Evaluation of our comprehensive PD program will inform promising practices for geoscience departments to change attitudes and practice to create a more welcoming climate for all.&lt;br/&gt;Our project provides PD to university faculty to train them as champions for diversity who will also become role models for other professionals. Participants will begin to systematically open up the profession by employing a social-closure lens to minimize bias in key professional gate-keeping roles (e.g., search committees and graduate admissions). Furthermore, our virtual simulation provides a tool that various levels of geoscience leadership might be interested in demonstrating, advertising, and implementing. The proposed new immersive-learning tool will be generalizable to other STEM fields. A combination of machine learning and technology development may allow such active-participation simulations for all faculty, students, and administrators in the near future. The leadership curriculum will systematize the broad literature on institutional change for inclusion, thus creating a coherent, understandable, and general strategy that can be applied to many more institutions&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Part II&lt;br/&gt;The Geoscience Diversity Experiential Simulations(GEODES)project draws from social cognitive theory (Bandura, 1986) and social closure theory (Murphy, 1988) to provide professional development (PD) for a cohort of geoscientists to 1) increase their knowledge of bias and social justice issues relevant to the geosciences; 2) engage in bystander intervention training using virtual reality simulations; 3) develop leadership skills to target critical gatekeeping decisions to transform their home institutions; and 4) support their continued development into champions for diversity, equity, and inclusion. These goals are achieved through several phases, beginning with a three-day intensive workshop that teaches and challenges participants to think critically about social justice and develops leadership skills. The workshop will culminate in bystander intervention training using virtual reality role-play scenarios. Participants will continue to meet for a monthly journal club over video conferencing, where issues of  equity, inclusion, and leadership are discussed as a group. Measured outcomes include pre-post changes in attitudes and knowledge regarding diversity, equity, and leadership techniques.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The GeoDES project's aim for intellectual merit was to test the effectiveness of an innovative way to teach geoscientists how to intervene in situations that help make their university geoscience departments more diverse and inclusive.  Our recent publication in the Journal of Diversity in Higher Education showed that our program was effective at increasing our participants' self-efficacy for saying and doing things that push up against prejudicial practices in their workplaces (see Chen, Tutwiler, Jackson, 2020).  Our publication also showed that, despite their gains in self-efficacy, there were no credible gains in their collective efficacy (i.e., their confidence in working together with their departments to achieve diversity, equity, and inclusion goals in their departments).  This points to the need for further development of our program to target group practices rather than teaching single participants within a department.  Our findings also showed that White faculty, men faculty, and faculty who are higher ranked felt less confident in addressing diversity, equity, and inclusion compared to faculty of color, women faculty, and more junior faculty.  This points to the need for instructors to focus specifically on developing the efficacy beliefs of those who traditionally and historically have more institutional power (i.e., White men full professors).  Although they have more power, they seem less likely to make bold moves due to their lower self- and collective efficacy.  Regarding broader impacts, the work we did in GeoDES seeded Mursion Inc.?s work in the area of diversity, equity, and inclusion, including several large corporate learning projects with companies such as T-Mobile (5,000 managers), LinkedIn (1,000 leaders), and PwC (20,000 leaders).  Mursion is now working with nearly a dozen Fortune 1000 companies applying GeoDES-like simulations for people learning DEI.  Also, GeoDES provided a three-day DEI workshop to 30 geoscientists along with a follow-up journal club. All these activities fostered new DEI-related networking among geoscientists and social scientists with ripple effects.  For example, in February, 2018 one of our participants shared that he had used the techniques learned in GeoDES to advocate for creating a departmental code of conduct for field experiences.  His department enthusiastically adopted that new code of conduct.  Also, because he shared his successes with geoscientists in other universities, others were also able to make changes in their organizations.      Chen, J. A., Tutwiler, M. S., &amp; Jackson, J. F.
