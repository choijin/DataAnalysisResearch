<AbstractNarration>This workshop, NSF Cloud for Everyone, will develop curricula, course materials, and projects, for the use of the NSF Cloud facilities CloudLab and Chameleon in graduate and advanced undergraduate systems courses at institutions serving under served populations, specifically Hispanic Serving Institutions (HSIs) and Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs). The Workshop will feature tutorials to train faculty at the target institutions on the use of CloudLab and Chameleon, and then will consist of collaborative interactive sessions to adapt existing course material to use Chameleon and CloudLab and develop new assignments and research projects that use these facilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:  This workshop will develop new course materials for graduate and advanced undergraduate courses in Cloud computing, particularly the design and implementation of Clouds. Though targeted at specific institutions, these materials will be broadly usable by undergraduate and graduate classes throughout the United States. This Workshop will also demonstrate joint project across both facilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:  The primary impact will be the enhanced education of underserved communities. Workshop participants have in identified specific classes at their institutions which will feature these facilities. This also has the effect of enhanced workforce training, both for commercial Cloud ventures and for the undergraduate and graduate research population. Workshop participants will form the nucleus of a Cloud Education community going forward, since we will make results public and maintain the community as a mutual-support organization.</AbstractNarration>
