<AbstractNarration>The brain is an amazing organ which is responsible for a number of important functions including cognition, attention, emotion, perception, memory, and motor control.  Many brain functions and disorders are believed to have a dynamical origin; for example, it has been hypothesized that some symptoms of Parkinson's disease are due to pathologically synchronized neural activity in the motor control region of the brain. Recent research suggests that an FDA-approved treatment for Parkinsonian tremors, called deep brain stimulation, is effective because it partially desynchronizes the neural activity via clustering, in which neurons in a subpopulation are synchronized with each other, but desynchronized with neurons in other subpopulations. This research will use engineering techniques, mathematical principles, computer simulations, and in vitro experiments to develop more energy-efficient electrical current stimuli which promote such clustering.  Moreover, stimuli will be developed which enhance beneficial neural plasticity in which neurons change their connection strengths based on their activity patterns, work that may be important for treatment of diseases and for situations in which plasticity is desirable such as learning, memory, and recovery from strokes and spinal cord injury.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will use engineering techniques, mathematical principles, computer simulations, and in vitro experiments to develop efficient electrical stimuli for controlling neural populations in beneficial ways.  This will include designing power-minimized stimuli which cause a neural population to split into balanced clusters, in which each cluster contains a nearly identical proportion of the overall population and neighboring clusters are roughly equally spaced in phase, a state of partial desynchronization which recent work suggests is responsible for the success of the standard protocol for deep brain stimulation treatment of Parkinson's disease.  Moreover, Hebbian models for synaptic plasticity will be used in combination with optimal control theory to design stimuli which optimally promote plasticity to give beneficial long-term changes in synaptic connections, work which is expected to have important implications for Parkinson's disease and other disorders such as epilepsy and depression, and for situations in which plasticity is desirable such as learning, memory, and recovery from strokes and spinal cord injury.  The plasticity studies will also include in vitro brain slice experiments in which neurons will be synchronized to an oscillating electric field and stimulation applied through an electrode to generate balanced clusters, whose effect on synaptic strengths will be measured.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Neural stimulation with electrical pulses, similar to a cardiac pacemaker, is used for treatment of Parkinson’s disease, epilepsy and a growing number of other diseases.  Generally, high frequency stimulation, such as 130 Hz, has been used.  The goal of this research is to utilize control algorithms to improve stimulation.  In particular, it has been seen that novel stimulation patterns, such as coordinated reset, appear to have long term persistent benefits that has not been observed in standard high frequency stimulation, where symptoms return as soon as stimulation is turned off.  We hypothesize that coordinated reset elicits plasticity changes in the brain which rewires and permanently alters the pathological networks.  By utilizing our knowledge of how stimulation induces changes in synaptic strengths, the goal of this grant is to design stimulation waveforms that more efficiently and optimally changes coupling between neurons to alter connectivity to suppress pathological oscillations observed in Parkinson’s disease.  The project will use a combination of control theory analytic tools, computational modeling, and brain slice electrophysiology to develop and test these new approaches.  In previous work, we had developed algorithms designed to desynchronize neural populations to disrupt neuronal oscillations thought to be core to the pathology of Parkinson’s disease.  Coordinated reset provided an insight that clustered states, where different regions of the brain are locally synchronized, but fire at different times than other areas, may be more effective. In this work, the Moehlis lab developed control algorithms to determine stimulation waveforms designed to induce clustered states based on the activity and relative timing of neurons within a population.  The Netoff portion of the collaboration was to test this algorithm both in computational models of the basal ganaglia and in brain slice, where we can measure the effects.  We first developed a computational model to simulate neuronal activity in the basal ganglia and how synaptic connectivity changes with that activity.  We then developed algorithms to test and optimize stimulation patterns to maximize these synaptic changes.  The computational model was also used to test the closed-loop neuromodulation to induce clustered states by the Moehlis lab.  We then tested these algorithms in brain slice.  We used carbachol applied to hippocampal brain slices to generate spontaneous neural oscillations.  The slices were stained with dyes that allow us to measure the neuronal activity with fluorescent light.  We developed a system that allowed us to analyze the neural activity in real time to determine the amount of synchrony and the phase and amplitude of neural populations in different regions of interest within the slice.  Using the Moehlis lab’s control algorithm, we could then determine the optimal times to stimulate the slice with electrical pulses to separate the phases of the different regions of interest.  We found that the effect of the stimulus persisted in suppressing the oscillations measured by averaging activity across the slice, but the local oscillations persisted.  This research continues and we are now testing if induction of these clustered states induces more permanent changes by changing synaptic strengths.  Intellectual Merit:  This research has developed novel closed-loop algorithms for stimulating the brain to create clustered neuronal states that we hypothesize may be more effective for treatment of Parkinson’s disease that stimulation waveforms that desynchronize neurons. This was tested in computational model and brain slice.  Our core hypothesis tested is that clustered states will induce greater synaptic plasticity changes than desynchronizing stimuli.  We have shown that this closed-loop control algorithm works both in computational models and in brain slice.  Broader impacts:  How deep brain stimulation alleviates symptoms is not well understood.  By testing novel approaches to designing new deep brain stimulation waveforms that target particular aspects of neuropathology, we can test particular hypotheses and develop a better understanding of the pathophysiology of Parkinson’s disease.  A targeted stimulation design may also reduce side effects by decreasing the energy needed to achieve an effective therapy as well as more specifically deliver therapy when needed.  This optimization work has led to several other translational projects and that have been tested in human patients.  While the goals of these clinical studies was not directly in line with the goals of this project, the immediate translational potential to test optimization in human patients was within the larger scope and long term goals of the project, and has produced some very exciting results over the past year.  In these projects we have use Bayesian Optimization to determine optimal stimulation frequency based on rigidity measured using a force feedback robot in Parkinson’s patients.  We have also used Bayesian Optimization to optimize spinal cord stimulation parameters for treatment of spinal cord injury based on patient preferences.
