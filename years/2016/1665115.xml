<AbstractNarration>Theory of differential equations is a fundamental mathematical tool of physics and engineering. Few differential equations can be solved explicitly, and approximate numerical solutions do not always give essential features of the behavior of exact solutions. A class of simple differential equations that frequently occur in applications has been studied by mathematicians for centuries; their solutions are called special functions of mathematical physics, and they are widely used in science. The general goal of this project is to extend this class of well-understood equations. Building on earlier work relevant for applications to physics, control theory, and materials science, this project aims to apply a variety of recently-developed methods to study longstanding questions of intrinsic mathematical interest. The work is anticipated to further improve understanding of the qualitative features of analytic functions defined by some basic differential equations arising in mathematical physics and geometry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Most of the special functions of mathematical physics are defined by linear differential equations with at most three singularities. Solutions of the Heun equation (with four regular singularities) and the Painlevé VI equation (non-linear, with four fixed singularities and no movable singularities) lie on the boundary of the class of special functions. Because of their intrinsic mathematical interest and numerous applications in science, they have been extensively studied since the beginning of the 20th century. This research project aims to advance understanding of these important functions through the use of new geometric methods. The main topics of this project are the qualitative study of real solutions of the Painlevé VI equation, the study of Riemannian metrics of constant positive curvature with conic singularities, with the emphasis on the metrics with four singularities closely related to the Heun equation, and finally the study of the eigenvalues of some parity-time symmetric anharmonic oscillators.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project results are published in 12 publications published in peer-reviewed mathematical journals, 2 papers accepted for publication and one submitted.  Project participants advised 2 students, one graduate and one undergraduate.  Both students are preparing papers for publication.  The results of the project contribute to the following mathematical disciplines: geometry, ordinary differential equations, special functions, and mathematical physics.  Project participants solved several old mathematical problems, one of them coming from mathematical physics, namely:  1. Gave mathematical proofs of the phenomena discovered by physicists Bender and Bottcher in their foundational paper on PT-symmetric quantum mechanics published in 1998.  2. Solved the problem stated by Bank and Laine in 1982. This was done by developing a new method in the theory of linear differential equations.  3. Solved a problem of Stanislaw Saks stated in 1940, stated in the famous collection called the Scottish Book.  4. Solved a problem by Robert Maier related to Lame functions (a type of special functions of mathematical physics) which have been studies since 1839.  These and other results were obtained by developing new methods which connect several mathematical disciplines, namely geometry and the theory of differential equations. The results have applications both inside the discipline of pure mathematics, and outside it, in particular mathematical physics related to quantuum mechanics.
