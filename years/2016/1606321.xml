<AbstractNarration>This program of research aims to better understand the Universe at the smallest scales by probing nature's basic symmetries and their relation to the origin of mass.  The 2012 discovery of a Higgs boson with mass close to 125 GeV represents both the crowning achievement of the standard model of particle physics and a hint beyond it - how can a light Higgs boson possibly survive huge, destabilizing quantum effects without new, undiscovered physics?  Further, dark matter is known to exist from astronomical observations; however the particle properties of dark matter remain shrouded in mystery. The combined activities of the UIC group address those basic questions puzzling science - the origin of mass and the particle nature of dark matter - and have the potential for surprising discoveries that may change the way we understand our physical world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The award also supports technological advances for high energy frontier experiments, in particular building and commissioning sophisticated high-speed electronics and silicon tracking systems for particle physics experiments.  The challenges faced in advancing those technologies enhance the disciplinary knowledge in engineering fields. The data analyses and hardware projects supported by this award provide valuable experience and knowledge for students and post doctoral associates at UIC, enabling them to pursue successful careers in the private sector, academia, or research laboratories. The UIC group also fosters close collaboration between high school teachers and the UIC group members, strengthening teaching and learning in Chicago-area high schools. As these high schools serve predominantly minority students, this project aims to increase the number of students from historically underrepresented groups that major in STEM disciplines.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The award funded the research of the experimental high energy particle physics group (HEP) at the University of Illinois Chicago (UIC) in its quest to understand the universe at the smallest scales while probing nature?s basic symmetries and their relation to our fundamental understanding of mass. The program was centered on the Compact Muon&nbsp;&nbsp;Solenoid experiment that took data at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) located in Geneva, Switzerland. Group members pursued a multi-prong approach to investigate the existence of phenomena that cannot currently be explained by the standard model of particles and fields. We excluded the existence of exotic new phenomena by direct searches of predicted particles, as well as by precise measurements of properties of phenomena predicted by the standard model. In doing so, we shed light on some of the most basic questions puzzling science - the origin of mass and the particle nature of dark matter.&nbsp;</p> <p>The award also funded our work on particle detector instrumentation, maintenance and operation. All our&nbsp;postdocs and graduate students contributed to the online detector operations and to the analysis of data, gaining valuable hardware and information technology skills. Our silicon and trigger projects provided training in the development of sophisticated detector devices, and gave students and postdocs the opportunity to participate in basic detector research, simulations, development of quality assurance techniques, and operation of silicon detectors and trigger systems.&nbsp;</p> <p>UIC is an urban, broad-access, minority-serving, Research 1 university, and the HEP group has been at the forefront of efforts to increase diversity in STEM. Throughout the years, we have regularly included undergraduate students in the group's research, with the majority being admitted to PhD programs in STEM after they graduated from UIC. We have worked to build a diverse group, achieving more than half female members,&nbsp;&nbsp;and about 20% identifying as brown and black. Our African American research associate secured a scientist position in one of the US DOE national labs and we have recently succeeded in recruiting a graduate student first-generation college DACA recipient. We continue to invest resources in our 20-year-old QuarkNet outreach program that fosters collaboration between high school teachers and the UIC HEP group members, strengthening teaching and learning in Chicago-area high schools.
