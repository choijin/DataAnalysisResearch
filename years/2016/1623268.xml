<AbstractNarration>With the advancement of technologies, networked devices become ubiquitous in the society. Such devices are not limited to traditional computers and smart phones, but are increasingly extended to cover a wide variety of embedded systems (ES), such as sensors monitoring bridges, electronics controlling the operation of automobiles and industrial equipment, home medicine devices that are constantly reporting patient health information to doctors. While the wide deployment of networked ES significantly benefits various aspects of human life and society at large, it also poses daunting security challenges that can put national security as well as the privacy of ordinary citizens at risk. Adequately addressing such challenges requires advanced technologies to be developed by industries and ES designers as well as users to be well educated about the security related issues. To facilitate technology development and better educate future designers, this project develops curricula focusing on the unique challenges of the emerging ES security, which has not been systemically covered in existing computer security related curricula that emphasize security in computers and the traditional Internet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project makes intellectual contributions through the completion of the following objectives: 1) developing course modules (lecture notes, labs and evaluation questionnaire) to introduce ES security in the layers of software, networking, operating system, architecture, and hardware; 2) integrating the developed material into several existing undergraduate courses at PIs' Universities; 3) establishing a unified ES security course with two versions (computer engineering and computer science versions) by integrating the developed course modules; 4) getting the developed material evaluated by an External Advisory/Review Committee; 5) teaching the developed material using both project-based learning and flipped classroom learning; 6) assessing the proposed teaching methods using formative and summative approaches; 7) broadly disseminating the developed material and promoting diversity in ES security education. Material to be developed will reach over 100 students per year, including many minorities and women.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Internet is rapidly evolving to be an Internet of Things (IoT), in which a majority of connected artifacts are not traditional devices (such as PCs), but embedded devices. This motivates the need to increase awareness of embedded systems security among Computer Science  students. Research suggests that integrating security-related concepts into multiple Computer Science course curricula is more effective than just offering a single upper-level undergraduate computer security course. This research aims to incorporate security concepts, with specific content related to embedded systems security, into undergraduate operating systems and networking curricula.  Key outcomes:   A junior-level Operating Systems and Networking course was fully flipped. The course includes a comprehensive set of short lecture videos/readings as preparatory work, pre-class quizzes to ensure that students complete preparatory work, real-time interactive quizzes and over 30 hands-on, engaging, application-oriented activities. Class activities that use a network emulator named IMUNES were developed to help students make observations on network flows, packet headers, etc., including security related activities that require students to use packet sniffing to distinguish between secure and non-secure data on a network. A tool that automatically generates problems (and their corresponding solutions) in the areas of memory management and network routing were developed, to allow students to practice the application of related concepts learned in the course. Mini course modules (termed minimal interventions) in the following areas of operating systems and networking were developed:    Introduction to the CIA Security triad Processes and the impact of fork bombs on embedded systems Security considerations in CPU scheduling within embedded real-time systems Memory management and process trustworthiness in embedded systems Security considerations and challenges for file management in embedded systems Security issues in network related embedded systems such as routers Introduction to FTP, SSH and encryption    The above minimal interventions were deployed in a junior-level Operating Systems and Networking course and student learning in these areas was evaluated over a period of six semesters across fifteen sections.
