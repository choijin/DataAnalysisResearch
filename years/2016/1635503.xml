<AbstractNarration>Organisms in Nature have crafted tools and processes to perform tasks such as foraging, eating, hunting, and burrowing with high efficiency. This award supports fundamental research that will examine mechanisms of cutting processes used by various organisms in the natural world, so as to identify new concepts that can potentially be translated into the industrial manufacturing domain. Research results can potentially lead to a class of highly efficient manufacturing processes for cutting and deformation processing of soft matter, and impact pharmaceutical manufacturing and orthopedic surgery. Given the critical importance of surgical cutting ranging from soft tissue excision to more serious orthopaedic procedures, the research could also contribute to improving quality of life by accelerating post-surgery healing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research objectives are: (1) identification of some typical mechanisms employed by insects, rodents, and other small animals in cutting and indentation processes in the natural world, and compare and contrast these against conventional manufacturing processes with soft matter in terms of efficiency and material removal mechanics; (2) characterization of key mechanical properties of soft natural material systems, relevant to these select processes, which determine their cutting and indentation response; (3) obtain fundamental knowledge on manufacturing processes used in the natural world and explain their applicability to manufacturing.  To achieve the first research objective, experimental studies will be conducted on cutting and indentation processes in nature.  The tool systems will include animal teeth (canine and equine) and insect mandibles (leaf cutter ants and beetles) such as mouthparts used for biting, cutting, and crushing. Experiments will be performed in both a simulated natural environment in a glass container within the lab and through instrumented lab-scale model systems. Direct observations will be performed using high speed imaging and microscopy, coupled with quantitative analysis by image correlation techniques. To achieve the second objective, mechanical properties and surface characteristics of natural tools and work materials (e.g., leaves, wood, bone, and flesh) will be examined using Atomic Force Microscopy, nano-indentation, micromechanical testing, and electron microscopy.  To achieve the third objective, numerical modeling will be used to analyze the mechanics of cutting and indentation processes in two select natural systems. This modeling will be validated by experiments and then used for benchmarking against industrial cutting processes such as comminution and punching. The modeling tools will be Finite Element Analysis and moving heat source theory.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    This project focused on the cutting and indentation processes of various materials, and comparing and contrasting these against conventional manufacturing processes with soft matter in terms of efficiency and material removal mechanics. It also characterizes key mechanical properties of soft natural material systems, relevant to these select processes, which determine their cutting and indentation response.   Large strain extrusion machining of lead with sharp tools is studied with finite element simulation and compared to experimental measurements.  The phenomenon of large surface and subsurface strains arising from the severe plastic deformation intrinsic to cutting and chip formation are observed.  The influences of parameters such as ratio of chip thickness to depth-of-cut (lambda, &lambda;), tool friction, and rake angle, have been explored, along with examination of hydrostatic pressure.  The subsurface strain distribution is notably influenced by the &lambda; parameter, and is shown to increase with smaller &lambda; values. Simulation work on deformation trends show agreement with direct measurement trends.    The ability to numerically predict and analyze accurate deformation behavior and hydrostatic pressure in the large strain extrusion machining process may hold value in producing component surfaces and chips with controllable microstructure and texture under stable conditions.  This research has used finite element simulation matched to previous experimental results to analyze the deformation and hydrostatic pressure behavior at the surface and subsurface in large strain extrusion machining of lead as function of machining parameters &lambda;, tool face and constraint friction, rake angle and material strain hardening modeling. The results showed connection between &lambda; and the resulting deformation characteristics at surface and subsurface, and results show agreement with those noted experimentally in previous literature, including shape of primary and secondary deformation zones. This work may aid in developing predictions and design rules for controlling resulting surface properties and microstructure in materials undergoing large strain extrusion machining, including natural materials such as bone in orthopaedic procedures.  The BMSI, Bone Material Strength Index, defined as the ratio of the indentation distance into a reference material divided by the indentation distance into the material under test, is significantly correlated with Vickers Hardness and Rockwell B Hardness measurements done according to ASTM, American Society for Testing and Materials, Standard Test Methods, on conventional materials. The correlations between BMSI and Rockwell, r = 0.73, and between BMSI and Vickers, r = 0. 79, are comparable to the correlation between Rockwell and Vickers, r = 0.79. The correlation between BMSI and Rockwell is significant at p = 0.05 and the correlation between BMSI and Vickers is significant at p = 0.025. The Osteoprobe, which measures BMSI, gives results on bone in patients that is of interest to physicians. Our fundamental measurements help establish what is measured by the Osteoprobe from an engineering standpoint.   An experimental method using digital image correlation has been developed to investigate internal deformation fields and validate finite element indentation models in analysis of soft material indentation.  In the experiment a semi-transparent elastomer was used as model material, under axisymmetric conditions, with spherical indentation. This study details a new approach for directly imaging and measuring subsurface deformation in soft materials, providing new insights and validation of finite element analysis, and provides information on experimental methods that failed and methods that succeeded. Development of handling and experimental procedures for skin/muscle-like silicone materials will aid in further fundamental research on biomechanical testing.  Research results can potentially lead to a class of highly efficient manufacturing processes for cutting and deformation processing of soft matter. Research results on deformation of soft materials with advanced finite element techniques provides further understanding of the mechanical behavior of soft materials and can be expanded to biomedical research by providing more accurate muscle and tissue deformation models.
