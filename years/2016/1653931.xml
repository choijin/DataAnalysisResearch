<AbstractNarration>PI Name: Liu&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: 1653931&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main objective of this project is to investigate the chemical processes governing the release of toxic metals and metalloids from the water distribution infrastructure. Awareness of chemical reactivities of accumulated contaminants in corrosion products with residual disinfectants and source waters is largely unknown. The PI will focus on the mechanisms of toxic metal release in diverse water chemistries. One goal is to create a new paradigm in managing drinking water and provide essential insights for the safety of water treatment applications. Reaching this goal will require the integration of fundamental principles of corrosion, chemistry, and kinetics modeling with the development of advanced tools in electrochemistry. Insights gained from this study will be used to minimize release of toxic drinking water contaminants, help protect public health, and ensure sustainability of the water infrastructure.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary objective of this project is to elucidate the fundamental redox chemistry in the water distribution infrastructure.  The central research hypothesis is that in situ release of accumulated inorganic contaminants from the drinking water distribution infrastructure is closely associated with the redox behavior of these contaminants. Solution chemical conditions can be optimized to control their mobility. In this project the PI will investigate 1) the redox-driven release of chromium, arsenic, selenium, and vanadium mediated by different residual disinfectants in the distribution systems; 2) quantify catalytic and inhibitive effects of solution chemical conditions and changing water sources on the rates of inorganic contaminant release; and 3) examine the nature of short-lived metal intermediates that control the ultimate yields of inorganic contaminants in water distribution systems. Research themes will be integrated into systematically assessed educational initiatives that will 1) increase four-year university enrollment for underrepresented students in Inland Southern California; 2) cultivate a creative and globally engaged workforce in environmental engineering; and 3) inform the water industry and the public about water distribution system issues. The PI will integrate the research with educational outreach opportunities for two PhD students, hundreds of undergraduates, community college students, K-12 teachers, water utility managers, and the residents of Inland Southern California. Students enrolled at the University of California, Riverside (UCR) and three community colleges (all accredited Hispanic-Serving Institutions) will participate in research. The PI will collaborate with local middle and high schools in the UC Mathematics Engineering Science Achievement program to engage students in water quality issues. Collaborations with universities in Switzerland and China will prepare students as globally competent engineers. The research will be disseminated to the public through University of California Television, K-12 STEM teacher training curricula, UCR courses, website materials, industrial workshops, and publications.</AbstractNarration>
