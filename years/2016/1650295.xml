<AbstractNarration>The Cyberlearning and Future Learning Technologies Program funds efforts that will help envision the next generation of learning technologies and advance what we know about how people learn in technology-rich environments. Cyberlearning CAP projects build capacity for research and development in the field of cyberlearning by improving technical infrastructure, human capital, and in other ways. The Symposium on Educational Advances in Artificial Intelligence, affiliated with the AAAI (Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence) conference in San Francisco in February 2017 is a premier venue for sharing knowledge about how to use AI in education and how to teach about AI. This grant helps support participation of US students and teachers in the conference, as well as early career faculty and organizers of REU (Research Experiences for Undergraduates) sites. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The symposium includes a variety of activities that advance the field and train the next generation of AI researchers and investigators. Peer reviewed papers and keynote addresses are complemented by sessions on model classroom assignments in teaching AI, and a competition for undergrads to create innovative tasks for students learning robotics. A discussion group will share best practices among REU site coordinators. Tracks will consider outreach and ethics in teaching AI. Broader impacts beyond the participants at the symposium are supported by the materials produced and shared among the community, such as the database of open educational materials, and the outputs of the student competition.</AbstractNarration>

The products resulting from EAAI, including the symposium proceedings and a set of ready-to-go Model AI assignments, are publicly available.  The Model AI assignments included in EAAI are available openly for other educators to use in their classes, and are widely used around the world in teaching AI.  The EAAI proceedings are published openly as part of the AAAI proceedings.  EAAI targets educators who might be outside of AAAI's usual community: those at smaller institutions, those who teach or use AI in their teaching, but not in their research, those from liberal arts colleges, and educators who serve student groups that are poorly represented in STEM disciplines.
