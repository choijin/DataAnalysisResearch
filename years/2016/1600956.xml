<AbstractNarration>The behavior of deep planetary materials helps drive the flows that produce plate tectonics. Voluminous igneous eruptions driven by deep mantle sources are thought to have caused global environmental changes. Located approximately 3000 km below the surface of the planet, the core-mantle boundary region represents one of the most dramatic compositional and thermal boundary layers within our planet. Gradients across this boundary exert a primary influence on the cooling of the planet, on the dynamics of the core (and hence Earth's magnetic field), and on the dynamics of the mantle (perhaps expressed as large-scale volcanism at the Earth's surface). Major progress towards understanding the dynamics of the deep Earth system within various geoscience disciplines has been made possible through advances in experimental and computational facilities and techniques, instrumental resolution, and deployment of the USArray. Capitalizing on these major advancements and the team's individual expertise within seismology, geodynamics, and experimental mineral physics, the team will study the interaction of subducted slabs with multi-scale lower mantle structures in the framework of mantle flow. They will mentor next generation scientists working in their multi-disciplinary environment, which should improve understanding of how the planet works as a global system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Seismologists have revealed that the mantle side of the CMB is extraordinarily heterogeneous, with km-scale fine structure that could harbor distinct chemical reservoirs. Thermal and chemical heterogeneity, solid-solid phase transitions, elastic anisotropy, variable viscosity, and melting are probably all required to explain this observed complexity. With individual expertise in seismology (Helmberger and Zhan), geodynamics (Gurnis), and experimental mineral physics (Jackson), they will connect the atomic scale (thermoelastic properties of deep Earth phases) to the tectonic scale (seismically observed structures and their dynamics) and link all processes to the temporal dimension (reconstruction of tectonic plate history). They will conduct a systematic study of the Pacific large low seismic velocity province (LLSVP) using whole seismograms compared against synthetics generated from existing enhanced tomographic models and compressible thermo-chemical convection with reasonable plate tectonic reconstructions. A detailed comparison of the Pacific and African LLSVPs will be done to test the impact of tectonic histories, presence of seismic anisotropy, and possible compositional and/or thermal differences. The experiments assess the sources of (1) seismic anisotropy through inelastic x-ray scattering and diffraction experiments on single crystals of (Mg0.22Fe0.78)O magnesiow√ºstite (2) seismic gradients and discontinuities through x-ray diffraction experiments on mid-oceanic ridge basalt phase assemblages. Their study will culminate with generating an updated global map of the CMB region. The fundamental questions they will address include: Can the presence of subducted slabs deform LLSVPs into seismically resolvable 3D shapes? Is iron-rich (Mg,Fe)O a source of observable seismic anisotropy, developed by flow of the mantle near subducting slabs? How do these slabs interact and affect D? topography and chemically-distinct structures near the edges of LLSVPs?</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The boundary between the core and mantle is a primary interface within Earth's deep interior and has a fundamental influence on the cooling of the planet. The lowermost mantle, referred to as the D" layer, hosts a myriad of anomalous seismic features and may provide essential clues revealing the planet's thermo-chemical evolution. The features have been associated with structures of different length scales, ranging from large-scale seismic velocity anomalies and seismic anisotropy to small-scale ultralow velocity zones. Thermal and chemical heterogeneity, solid-solid phase transitions, lattice or shape preferred orientation, complex rheology, and melting are probably all necessary to explain the observed structures. With our individual expertise in seismology, geodynamics, and experimental mineral physics, we have connected the atomic scale (thermoelastic properties of deep Earth phases: Jackson) to the tectonic scale (seismically observed structures and their dynamics: Helmberger and Zhan, Gurnis), while linking processes to the temporal dimension (reconstruction of tectonic plate history: Gurnis).

Also, this new hypothesis supposes that there is a low viscosity channel (LVC) between 660 and 1000 km. We found that an LVC will lower the amplitude of long wavelength (&gt; 5000 km) geoid highs over slabs, with amplitudes &lt;10 m in height, while increasing the slab dip angle and downdip tension in the upper 300 km within slabs. In addition, the endothermic phase change at 660 km depth can substantially affect the stress distribution within slabs, but has a minor influence on the geoid. Model fits to both the observed long wavelength geoid and observed focal mechanism favor models without the presence of the LVC between 660 km and 1000 km depths and are more consistent with a jump in viscosity at 660 km depth.</p> <p><strong>Detailed investigation of D" underneath the Northern Pacific</strong></p> <p>The source for the Hawaiian hotspot is hypothesized to have a deep origin within the Earth at the core-mantle boundary. Using seismic waves that bounce between Hawaii and the core-mantle boundary, we show that the source is not a broad vertical plume directly below present-day Hawaii. Instead, we find that the plume is most likely located about 12 degree southeast of present-day Hawaii, in agreement with models of mantle convection. At this location, seismic waves that propagate close to the core-mantle boundary show strong anomalies which suggest the presence of several distinct structures, namely an ultralow velocity zone and a subducted slab, near the edge of the LLSVP.

Using dislocation dynamics, we have constrained the viscosity of (Mg,Fe)O, revealing that iron-rich (Mg,Fe)O "magnesiowuestite" has a very low viscosity at lowermost mantle conditions, affecting the shapes of ULVZs. Experiments on single crystal iron-rich (Mg,Fe)O at high pressures reveals a strongly anisotropic magnesiowuestite in Earth's lower mantle, exhibiting as much as 60% shear wave anisotropy, more than twice that of olivine. If magnesiowuestite is present at the base of the mantle, it could develop lattice preferred orientation related to mantle flow and be seismically detectable. We use mineral physics data and ULVZ seismic reduction ratios of S- and P-wavespeeds with respective uncertainties in a best-fit optimization approach to evaluate this hypothesis, including parameter correlations. For reduction ratios of around 2, ULVZ assemblages containing iron-rich (Mg,Fe)O provide the best results for a large density range. Lattice preferred orientation of magnesiowuestite crystallites within ULVZs would explain seismic wave reduction ratios ranging from 2 to around 3. Reduction ratios below 2 or above 3, particularly with large density enhancements for the latter, require different explanations than those considered here. Our analysis suggests a diversity of ULVZs, rather than a single origin.</p> <!--    @font-face  {font-family:"Cambria Math";  panose-1:2 4 5 3 5 4 6 3 2 4;  mso-font-charset:0;  mso-generic-font-family:roman;  mso-font-pitch:variable;  mso-font-signature:-536870145 1107305727 0 0 415 0;} @font-face  {font-family:Calibri;  panose-1:2 15 5 2 2 2 4 3 2 4;  mso-font-charset:0;  mso-generic-font-family:swiss;  mso-font-pitch:variable;  mso-font-signature:-536859905 -1073732485 9 0 511 0;}    p.MsoNormal, li.MsoNormal, div.MsoNormal  {mso-style-unhide:no;  mso-style-qformat:yes;  mso-style-parent:";  margin:0in;  mso-pagination:widow-orphan;  font-size:12.0pt;  font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;  mso-ascii-font-family:Calibri;  mso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin;  mso-fareast-font-family:Calibri;  mso-fareast-theme-font:minor-latin;  mso-hansi-font-family:Calibri;  mso-hansi-theme-font:minor-latin;  mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman";  mso-bidi-theme-font:minor-bidi;} p  {mso-style-noshow:yes;  mso-style-priority:99;  mso-margin-top-alt:auto;  margin-right:0in;  mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto;  margin-left:0in;  mso-pagination:widow-orphan;  font-size:12.0pt;  font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;  mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";} .MsoChpDefault  {mso-style-type:export-only;  mso-default-props:yes;  font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;  mso-ascii-font-family:Calibri;  mso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin;  mso-fareast-font-family:Calibri;  mso-fareast-theme-font:minor-latin;  mso-hansi-font-family:Calibri;  mso-hansi-theme-font:minor-latin;  mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman";  mso-bidi-theme-font:minor-bidi;}size:8.5in 11.0in;  margin:1.0in 1.0in 1.0in 1.0in;  mso-header-margin:.5in;  mso-footer-margin:.5in;  mso-paper-source:0;} div.WordSection1  {page:WordSection1;} --><br> <p>            Last Modified: 10/19/2020<br>      Modified by: Jennifer&nbsp;M&nbsp;Jackson</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
