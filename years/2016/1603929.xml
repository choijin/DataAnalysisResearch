<AbstractNarration>PI:  Takagi, Daisuke&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: 1603929&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The focus of the proposed project is to investigate the dynamics and associated fluid flow around small organisms driven by multiple appendages. The goal is to develop theoretical understanding and new mathematical models based on experiments for the swimming of small animals that could be used to challenge existing concepts of aquatic locomotion and to design micro-robots that can move autonomously in aquatic environments. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed activities are expected to reveal new flow patterns around crustaceans, which move differently from the flagellated and ciliated microorganisms that have attracted much attention to date. The project will elucidate the basic physical mechanisms of generating seemingly complex patterns of Stokes flow using a simple combination of paddling legs as performed by swimming and feeding crustaceans. The flow fields should be different from those commonly assumed in existing models of the collective behavior of swimmers, so they may produce novel interactions with other organisms and boundaries and produce new emergent behavior. The results can impact fields beyond fluid dynamics including biological and soft matter physics. In addition to elucidating the swimming and feeding behavior of small organisms, the work could inspire novel designs for driving and controlling flow in practical applications such as the development of versatile and efficient biomimetic robots. There is also an outreach and education plan that involves hands-on demonstrations of robots to promote STEM education at local public schools in Hawaii. The proposed activities involve participation of K-12 teachers and students from underrepresented groups including Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders.</AbstractNarration>
