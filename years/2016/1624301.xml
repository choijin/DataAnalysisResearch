<AbstractNarration>This NSF award provides partial support for U.S. based mathematicians to participate in an advanced school and workshop on "Geometric Group Theory and Low-Dimensional Topology: Recent Connections and Advances," to be held at ICTP, Trieste, Italy, 23 May - 3 June 2016. The proposed activity is a mix of "hot topics" that would afford tremendous opportunities to mathematicians at all career stages to interact and generate new ideas.  The advanced school will expose graduate students to a diverse array research topics.  Introducing both US based and international students to leading experts from across the globe should have a profound effect on cultivating mathematics in the US and in the developing world. The potential for fostering initial contacts and interactions that lead to closer connections between US based mathematicians and those in the developing world is a long term benefit for faculty and students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main topics to be covered at this advanced school and workshop include character varieties and deformation of geometric structures, effective geometry and topology of hyperbolic 3-manifolds, left orderability and Heegaard Floer theory, the mapping class group action on Teichmuller space and the curve complex, dynamics on these spaces and virtually special cube complexes and groups. There have been important developments in these areas recently, for example: the impact of geometric group theory in the work of Wise and subsequently Agol's resolution of the famous "virtual conjectures" in 3-manifold topology.

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This is a report on the activities associated to the Advanced School stated above that ran from May 23d--June 4th 2016 at ICTP Trieste.  The activity was funded by ICTP, The Clay Mathematics Institute and the National Science Foundation.  The organizing committee consisted of Michel Boileau, Dick Canary, Bruno Martelli, Maryam Mirzakhani and Alan Reid. All but Mirzakhani were present for most of the two weeks. There were 105 participants from across the globe (including graduate students, postdocs, junior and senior faculty).  Intellectual Merit: The motivation for the Advanced School and Workshop was to expose students, postdocs and researchers to various key roles that geometric group theory has played in recent advances in low-dimensional topology and geometry. These included the role of virtually special groups, representations of Kleinian groups in $\SL(2,{\Bbb C})$ and generalizations (e.g. Higher Teichm\"uller Theory), the Mapping Class Group and its recent role in low dimensional geometry and topology and group theoretic connections with Heegaard Floer theory through left-orderability.  The first week, May 23-- May 27 was aimed at graduate students and  consisted of 5 lecturers giving 3 talks each. In addition, there was afternoon breakout sessions with participants working on problems (prepared by the speakers and available as links in the schedule on the website) under the supervision of more senior grad students and recent Ph.D's working ``as TA's''.  The second week of lectures, which were a series of standard 1 hour research level talks, dovetailed beautifully with week 1.  The second week had 22 talks (6 by women) and all lectures were videotaped and are available at the ICTP website.  Central objects of both of these two weeks were  surfaces, whose properties, or analogues, were presented, studied and used in many different  contexts and circle of ideas.  Broader Impact:  The two weeks afforded the opportunity for many students and researchers with different interests to gather together around challenging problems arising from the connections between low-dimensional geometry and topology and geometric group theory.  Graduate students from across the globe were exposed to background courses, as well as cutting edge research, and connections made.  As well as talking in the workshop in the second week, Agol gave the ICTP school colloquium based on the background and ideas in his proof of the virtual Haken conjecture.  For many of the students attending the first week, this was a highlight as it brought to conclusion the ideas and results described by Sageev in his lectures.  The organizers believe that this was a very successful event, both mathematically and culturally.             Last Modified: 06/01/2017       Submitted by: Alan W Reid]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
