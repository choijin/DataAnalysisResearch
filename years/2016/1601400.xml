<AbstractNarration>Early life is a critical stage during which the environment experienced can have important life-long effects for an individual. Understanding how the interaction between an individual's genes and the environment during early development create the variation seen in nature is an important question in Biology. This research will leverage a well-established study system for evolutionary and behavioral research to determine how the developmental environment shapes the expression of a trait that is critical to reproductive success later in life. Specifically, this study will manipulate nest parasites, an important component of the environment, during early development to determine how parasite infections and the immune responses they generate interact with the genes that underlie plumage color in birds. Plumage color, here a brownish-red melanin coloration, is an important signal used in communication between the sexes and it is impacted by early life conditions, and therefore the reproductive success of an individual. Genes expressed in tissues where feathers are grown will be measured to allow for the identification of specific genes whose expression is influenced by environmental conditions. Results from this work will be broadly informative as melanin is a common pigment underlying appearance and coloration in various groups of animals. However, it is not well understood how the environment interacts with genes to influence the development of melanin coloration. Broader impacts include training undergraduates and middle-school teachers in scientific research, and the creation of lesson plans that will be implemented in public middle schools and shared broadly with teachers at science-teaching workshops.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Female preferences for male coloration are thought to be adaptive because of the potential information advertised by these male traits. Melanin-based color traits are traditionally thought to be under strict genetic control. However, condition-dependence for some melanin traits may occur during early development. If so, trait variation may provide information about an individual's developmental history. Previous work has shown that variation in melanin-based color in barn swallows is due almost entirely (70%) to differences in early environment, and that plumage color provides information about ectoparasite loads in a male's territory. Mites affect nestling survival, growth, immunity, and melanin-based plumage color. This project will identify gene expression differences associated with color variation by cross-fostering eggs and manipulating mites to tease apart the roles of genes and environmental quality. Developing feathers will be collected and RNA expression will be quantified to understand how early environment interacts with genes in the melanin pathway to influence the life-long expression of a melanin-based signal. The research will have important implications for understanding the gene by environment interactions during the early developmental period for melanin-based ornamental traits, and thus, information that females gain by using these traits. Results from this work will provide a clearer picture of how melanin-based traits interact with the environment during development at many levels: from the detailed gene expression, to lifelong trait expression, to variation within a population and how this relates to the parasite community, and finally to divergent morphological traits across populations that are involved in reproductive isolation.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Melanin-based traits are used as signals across a diversity of animals, yet we still do not have a good understanding of the mechanisms producing variation in these signals. While scientists have long thought that variation in melanin was genetically controlled, new information suggests that some melanin traits may be condition-dependent and sensitive to the environment. This sensitivity may occur only during certain time periods, such as early development.</p> <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Female barn swallows (<em>Hirundo rustica erythrogaster)</em> use rust-colored melanin plumage to select mates. A male&rsquo;s color remains relatively consistent throughout his lifetime, despite re-growing of feathers each year. Interestingly, previous research has demonstrated that the heritability of this color is quite low, suggesting that variation is controlled by more than just genetic differences. In this grant, I proposed an experiment where I manipulated parasites and cross-fostered eggs to tease apart the influence of genes and environment on the development of melanin-based coloration. By examining gene expression in developing feather tissue collected from this experiment, I can better understand how aspects of the environment shape melanogenesis and influence the lifelong expression of a melanin-based signal<em>.</em></p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Much progress has been made towards the completion of this project. The proposed field experiment was successfully completed in 2016. This involved monitoring 24 breeding colonies of barn swallows in Boulder Colorado, where I captured and measured 274 adult birds. I created 58 experimental nest pairs where I cross-fostered two eggs across nests. This created a situation where related individuals are raised in different environments and unrelated individuals are raised in the same environment. In these nests, I also manipulated parasites; all nests were disinfected and one nest in each pair received a parasite treatment (100 live mites). In addition to parasites, I monitored incubation temperatures by placing thermocouple egg probes in 97 of the nests. These sensors tracked egg temperatures every minute across the incubation period. In total, 282 nestlings survived to fledging and samples from these individuals are being used for further RNA analyses.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All the lab work for this project has also been completed. Adult and nestling feather samples have been mounted and color data has been collected using a photospectrometer. DNA has been extracted from all blood samples, parental analysis using microsatellites has been completed, and a pedigree has been constructed for experimental individuals. All nestlings have been sexed using molecular markers, and testosterone levels have been quantified for male nestlings. The temperature data from the egg probes has been analyzed and incubation temperatures and behavioral rhythms of incubating females have been quantified. Photos of experimental eggs have been analyzed using image software to quantify yolk size. <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The gene expression analysis that is the focus of this project is also nearly complete. I have successfully extracted RNA from all feather tissue samples. For the first round of analysis, I am focused on the extremes of the color distribution to better understand if certain genes are associated with particularly light or dark individuals. These samples were recently sequenced using RNAseq, which provides a detailed examination of gene expression, as well as sequence and splice variation. I am currently analyzing the RNAseq data to assess gene expression differences between light and dark males. To examine gene expression across all of my experimental individuals, I have optimized a relatively new technique, TagSeq, which will allow me to get gene expression data on a large sample size for a lower cost compared to standard RNAseq. These samples are currently being sequenced and results are expected soon. Using these data, I will be able to associate gene expression differences and aspects of the environment (e.g. parasites or incubation temperatures) with color expression. This will allow me to better understand the underlying mechanisms generating color variation and what information females gain by using this color for mate choice decisions. &nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Several products have already come out of this project, though the central manuscripts are still forthcoming. This project supported two undergraduate honors thesis students: Will Dube, used temperature and humidity data loggers in a subset of experimental nests to measure abiotic and biotic predictors of mite population growth. Will successfully defended his honors thesis, and together we have written a paper that is currently under review. Kelley McCahill used the thermocouple egg probes to analyze how parasites influence female incubation behavior and has also successfully defended her honors thesis. Three middle school science teachers, Kim Greene, Heidi Reeg, and Dan Tomlin, also participated in this project, through the NSF-RET program. Together we wrote a 3-week science unit for our local school district based on this project which is currently being used in the classroom. Finally, I recently presented on this work during an invited seminar at the Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology in Japan. I plan to publish two manuscripts on the results of this work in the coming year.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 08/29/2018<br>      Modified by: Amanda&nbsp;Hund</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1601400/1601400_10422207_1535560808665_IMG_1957--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1601400/1601400_10422207_1535560808665_IMG_1957--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Variation in Melanin Coloration"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1601400/1601400_10422207_1535560808665_IMG_1957--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Variation in Melanin Coloration"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Figure 1.
