<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to deliver a price-competitive source of alternative jet fuel that will help meet growing worldwide demand while allowing the airline industry to achieve carbon-neutral growth. Demand for jet fuel is increasing rapidly driven by global economic growth.  Usage is expected to rise from the current 80 billion gallons a year worldwide to more than 100 billion gallons by 2040. At the same time, prices are expected to increase and constraints in supply are likely to cause pricing volatility. Finally, concerns over greenhouse gas emissions could drive adoption of alternative fuels. All of these factors are creating a need for new fuel sources, for both commercial and military applications.  This I-Corps project will focus on using waste lignin, the second most plentiful renewable carbon source behind cellulose, in a proprietary process to make jet fuel range hydrocarbons and chemicals to increase the flexibility of existing applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project aims to commercialize a process for biojet that converts waste lignin from cellulosic biomass refineries using a combination of catalyst and acidic zeolite to make relatively long-chain hydrocarbons.  The current version of biorefineries undervalues lignin's potential to address the world's high quality liquid fuel requirements. Despite the potential, selective conversion of lignin has proven to be challenging. Processes that have been successful at breaking the lignin bonds have typically resulted in shorter chain monomers as opposed to the longer chain hydrocarbons needed for fuel. The surprising outcome of the process used here is a mix of hydrocarbons that are long-chain and can be made into nearly the right mix for jet fuel. Scaling this process and putting it into production alongside current biorefinery production facilities would significantly improve biomass conversion and improve the economics of biofuels and chemicals production.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The project focuses on exploring the commercial opportunities of the technology of alternative jet fuel from biomass lignin. The grant raised the awareness or attention of the public about biojet fuel market and reduced the gap between biojet research and market needs.</p> <p>Our team consist of Dr. Libing Zhang, a postdoctoral research associate, the Entrepreneurial Lead, Dr. Terri L. Butler, the Commercialization Mentor from University of Washington. Bin Yang, the Principle Investigator from Washington State University to learn how to turn lignin biojet research being completed at the university into a commercial business.</p> <p>We interviewed more than 100 fuel procurement managers and VPs of potential customers, such as United Air, Alaska Airlines, FedEx, US Navy, and Air Force. We also interviewed other national and international stakeholders, including oil refineries, biojet competitors, government agencies, NGOs, and feedstock lignin suppliers. For example, interviews were implemented with Shell, Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), International Paper, and International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). Those interviews provided helpful information/resource to map our business. From the information we collected, several critical issues were resolved to initiate the startup, such as the decision makers of fuel procurement in commercial airlines and US military in fuel business. The value propositions for customer segment commercial airlines, the significance of governmental partnerships, the ecosystem of jet fuel business, product distribution logistics, the certification process of jet fuel were determined for completing a business model. In addition, the team has mapped potential business competitors and the availability of future biojet fuel technologies.</p> <p>This grant provided opportunity to us for reaching out various stakeholders, and allow us to understand the biojet market which is very closely associated with carbon emission regulations to drive their business motivations. The interviews and market results showed that the market has enough growth room for all alternative jet fuels. The US market has annual demand of more than 20 billion gallons of jet fuel. The currently available alternative jet fuel is far from meeting the demand. The market feedback accumulated from this grant is important for the team to develop relations with customers and competitors as well as biojet production technology that is commercialization feasible. Additionally, the main players in the aviation industry have taken multiple actions to facilitate alternative jet fuel, including the offtake agreements made by biojet companies and commercial airlines, alternative jet fuel test flights, and investments on biojet technologies. The interests from commercial airlines and military on alternative jet fuel are not only because of the international regulation pressure but also because it brings strategic and economic benefits such as the reduction of exposure to price volatility of jet fuel and staying competitive in the market.</p> <p>The notable outcomes from our team won several top place in business competitions in Washington State. For example, we won the third place among 21 teams at the Alaska Airlines Environmental Innovation Challenge finals in April of 2017. For the challenge, interdisciplinary student teams define an environmental problem, develop a solution, design and build a prototype, create a business plan that proves their solution has market potential and pitch their idea to 170 judges from throughout the Northwest. Team also won the Wells Fargo &ldquo;CleanTech&rdquo; Big Picture prize during the University of Washington&rsquo;s Business Plan Competition in May of 2017. The team has been accepted into the Cascadia CleanTech accelerator program, which is a 14-week program that delivers mentorship, curriculum, connections and funding opportunities designed specifically for early-stage cleantech startups. The EL has been encouraged to participate Aviation Alternative Fuels Initiative (CAAFI) conference to help us for building networks with main stakeholders in aviation fuel industry and got attention from main business players about our technology and business.
