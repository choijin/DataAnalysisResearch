<AbstractNarration>The LEVERAGE design &amp; development launch pilot, led by an alliance of the seven largest national diversity-serving engineering professional organizations, will design, develop and test strategies that will inform how best to strengthen engineering education to increase the number of historically underrepresented faculty in engineering. This pilot will support the alliance's longer-term objective to construct a fully integrated system for faculty transition stages to double the number of historically underrepresented engineering faculty by 2025. This diversification will promote the progress of science by increasing innovation and creativity among engineering faculty and will significantly increase the likelihood that all engineering students will have the opportunity to take classes from diverse engineering faculty members. Addressing the dearth of diverse engineering faculty in higher education is particularly important for the success of historically underrepresented engineering students - the prospective source of future faculty. The project will create resources and programs which provide full circles of support for the retention, productivity and success of early-career faculty. The alliance members currently offer professional development for early-career engineering faculty workshops at their respective annual conferences. This project will extend these workshops to offer year round programming at multiple personnel levels, thereby increasing the impact and offering early career faculty resources to support their success in academic careers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broadening participation challenge addressed by this design &amp; development launch pilot is the severe shortage of historically underrepresented racial/ethnic faculty members in engineering. This project contributes to broadening participation in the nation's scientific workforce by strengthening and diversifying the engineering professorate that can create a more inclusive engineering education experience. The goals of the project are to design, develop, and test strategies that can then be brought to scale to double the number of underrepresented minorities holding engineering faculty positions by 2025 - from 1,683 diverse faculty in 2014 to 3,366 in 2025. These strategies include the creation of full circles of support for early-career faculty - fostering greater productivity and success in navigating the tenure and promotion pathways. The full circles of support will include a variety of professional development methods including webinars, virtual learning groups, mentoring, self-paced virtual learning, virtual brown-bag lunches, and networking opportunities. This pilot leverages the existing NSF ASSIST collaboration between the seven largest national diversity-serving engineering professional organizations to extend the American Indian Science and Engineering Society's (AISES') Lighting the Pathway to Faculty Careers for Natives in STEM model.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The project titled, "NSF INCLUDES: LEVERAGE, Strengthening the ASSIST Collaborative to Illuminate Engineering Faculty Pathways" was a launch pilot, which focused on one stage -- early career faculty -- and their progress toward promotion and tenure. This design and development project leveraged the existing NSF ASSIST collaboration between the seven largest national diversity-serving engineering professional organizations to extend the American Indian Science and Engineering Society’s (AISES’) Lighting the Pathway to Faculty Careers for Natives in STEM model to double the number of underrepresented minorities (URM) holding engineering faculty positions over the next seven years. This research was designed and implemented to provide full circles of support for early career faculty to promote their success along academic career pathways.     The broader significance of this project were to address the extreme shortage of URM faculty of all ranks in 4-year colleges and universities, including our nation’s Minority-Serving Institutions (MSIs) and research-intensive institutions. By making significant progress toward diversifying engineering faculty on university campuses, perceptions of what the face of engineering looks like will be forever changed, benefiting all students and particularly those facing stereotype threat, and both conscious and implicit biases in the engineering educational system. In addition, diversification of STEM faculty should result in stronger engineering programs on university campuses as diversity contributes to group innovation and creativity.   This project extended established partnerships among the largest national diversity-serving organizations and utilized an established model to significantly increase the number of faculty contributing to engineering education. The three primary over-arching goals were:1. To strengthen and extend the collaborative infrastructure between the seven leading diversity-serving professional organizations in engineering,2. To utilize this collaboration to design, implement, and evaluate the efficacy of engaging diverse faculty, post-docs, and graduate students in full circles of support for their success along academic career pathways, and3. To scale professional development opportunities for early-career faculty, post-docs, and graduate students to support their success and persistence in academic careers.  LEVERAGE impacted the efficacy of creating culturally-based professional development opportunities, creating both synchronous and asynchronous offerings that allowed early-career faculty to engage in the programming that is most useful and relevant to their circumstances.   By participating in the full circles of support afforded by the LEVERAGE project, early-career faculty had the opportunity to gain access to resources to enhance their academic career paths and to support their personal well-being.    Major Accomplishments Included:  - Significant time was invested to redesign and implement a new web portal that replaced assisttravelgrants.org, which was a very basic application submission portal.  The new portal - leveragefaculty.org - included automated eligibility checking and peer-review processes, and the functionality for NSF program officers to utilize the site to rercruit participants to diversify their proposal review panels.  - The LEVERAGE Portal served as a useful tool for connecting with a diverse faculty, post-docs, and graduate students for engagement in the academic development programs and services offered by the seven organizations. Over 2,000 users of the portal received marketing materials and informational flyers regarding the 25 symposiums conducted by thediversity organizations. This enabled the organizations to cast a far-reaching net for recruiting applicants for the symposium.   - Created a community of over 2,000 diverse scholars from various engineering disciplines, who became a resource to expand cross-collaborative research and network with NSF.  - Designed and delivered the LEVERAGE Summer Institute, a cross-organizational face-to-face workshop, which was held on July 24-25, 2018 in Dallas, TX.  Twenty-eight faculty members engaged with the seven organizations attended the Summer Institute. The former LEVERAGE Program Officer, Dr. Paige Smith, attended and presented at the LEVERAGE Summer Institute.      - Strengthened the collaborative infrastructure for LEVERAGE and extended the cloud-based infrastructure to support participant engagement in LEVERAGE.  - Created an External Advisory Board chaired by Dr. Bevlee Watford. The Board's input was important to inform programming and content decisions.   - Developed two pilot webinar modules to be delivered through the LEVERAGE portal as a proof of concept.   The six partner organizations greatly valued the faculty engagement launched as part of the NSF LEVERAGE pilot grant.
