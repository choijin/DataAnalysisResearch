<AbstractNarration>The Association of Public and Land-Grant Universities (APLU) will lead this Design and Development Launch Pilot to conduct activities aimed to increase the number of STEM faculty at APLU member universities from underrepresented and traditionally underserved groups: Women, historically underrepresented minorities (URM), persons with disabilities (PWD), and people from low socioeconomic backgrounds. This project was created in response to the Inclusion across the Nation of Communities of Learners of Underrepresented Discoverers in Engineering and Science (NSF INCLUDES) program solicitation (NSF 16-544). The INCLUDES program is a comprehensive national initiative designed to enhance U.S. leadership in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) discoveries and innovations focused on NSF's commitment to diversity, inclusion, and broadening participation in these fields.  The INCLUDES Design and Development Launch Pilots represent bold, innovative ways for solving a broadening participation challenge in STEM.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The full participation of all of America's STEM talent is critical to the advancement of science and engineering for national security, health and prosperity.  Our nation is advancing knowledge and practices to address a STEM achievement and the graduation gap between postsecondary STEM students who are women, URM, PWD, and persons from low socioeconomic backgrounds and males, non-URM, non-PWD, and persons from middle and upper socioeconomic backgrounds.  At the same time U.S. universities and colleges struggle to recruit, retain and promote a diverse STEM faculty as role models and academic leaders for historically underrepresented and traditionally underserved students to learn from, to work with and to emulate.  Recent NSF reports indicate that URM STEM associate and full professors occupy 8% of the senior faculty positions at all 4-year colleges and universities and about 6% of these positions at the nation's most research-intensive institutions. The APLU INCLUDES: A Collective Impact Approach to Broadening Participation in the STEM Professoriate has the potential to advance a national network of organizations to improve the representation of women, URMs, PWDs and persons from low socioeconomic backgrounds in STEM faculty positions, eventually providing URM STEM role models to STEM undergraduate and graduate students at postsecondary academic institutions across the Nation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;APLU will work closely with multiple organizations to address key objectives, including the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the Center for the Integration of Research, Teaching and Learning, the Collaborative on Academic Careers in Higher Education, the Committee on Institutional Cooperation (recently renamed the Big Ten Academic Alliance), the Council of Graduate Schools, the Florida Education Fund's McKnight Doctoral Fellowship Program, Southern Regional Education Board State Doctoral Scholars Program and the University of California's Office of the President.  Together this network plans to connect APLU member institutions and experts to (1) develop and test a set of diagnostic tools and practices for recruiting, hiring, retaining and supporting faculty, to (2) identify a set of institutional activities to increase participation along STEM pathways toward the professoriate, to engage a group of institutions to collectively implement one or more of the activities, and to (3) evaluate the adequacy and coverage current data sources and metrics available to track students from entry into postsecondary education through the professoriate.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The APLU INCLUDES Project was funded by NSF as an inaugural INCLUDES Design Development Launch Pilot (DDLP).  The project sought to diversify the STEM professoriate at public research universities?a critical lever to broadening participation throughout the global STEM community.     Using a collaborative, evidence-based approach, the pilot provided tools for APLU?s national network of member universities to effectively recruit, hire, and retain faculty from underrepresented groups and foster career pathways toward the professoriate by broadening student participation in STEM programs. Moreover, the pilot successfully leveraged relationship building, collaboration, and products to design, apply, and receive funding from NSF to evolve into an inaugural NSF INCLUDES Alliance, Aspire: The National Alliance for Inclusive &amp; Diverse STEM Faculty.    Specific Objectives:  The APLU INCLUDES Project focused on a set of activities aimed at the diversification of STEM faculty across our member institutions. The pilot project had three primary objectives:      Objective 1: Develop a set of diagnostic tools and practices to more effectively recruit, hire, retain, and support faculty from traditionally underrepresented populations within STEM.    Objective 2: Identify a suite of transformative institutional activities to increase participation along the STEM pathways toward the professoriate in order to build the pool of future candidates.    Objective 3: Evaluate the adequacy and coverage of current data sources and metrics available to track the progress and success of STEM students from entry into postsecondary education through the professoriate.      Deliverables:  Six deliverables were developed in this DDLP to provide a foundation for institutional leaders to strengthen pathways to support underrepresented groups' access and success within STEM pathways and ultimately to the U.S. STEM workforce.  These deliverables are now leveraged within Aspire?s continued efforts to cultivate an inclusive &amp; diverse STEM professoriate.     Strengthening the Pathways to Faculty Careers in STEM: Recommendations for Systemic Change to Support Underrepresented Groups: This report synthesizes the work of the APLU INCLUDES STEM Pathways Taskforce and the Technical Advisory Committee to document how the pathways to faculty careers in STEM can be strengthened and better understood to enhance the diversity of the STEM professoriate. Making change is difficult because a) we have not reckoned with the complexity of the pathways to the STEM professoriate, including how we recruit, hire, and retain diverse STEM faculty; b) we have not created enough programs and interventions that address the roots of bias; and, c) our efforts towards change are not systemic.  The complexities of these pathways have also been captured in an interactive map.

The Guidebook provides: (1) A summary of the scholarship and practice-based insights leveraged to develop the model for increasing faculty diversity &amp; institutional self-assessment; (2) Instructions on how to complete the institutional self-assessment; and, (3) practical guidance for campuses as they develop action plans for advancing faculty diversity.

Responses were curated to create innovative program profiles and shared publicly within the Network of STEM Education Centers (NSEC).

[Link: https://www.aplu.org/library/2018-aplu-includes-summit-report/file]    Institutional Model for Increasing Faculty Diversity: This Model offers a framework to promote a broader understanding of what is required for effectively hiring, retaining and promoting the success of underrepresented STEM faculty. This model has been transformed into an institutional self-assessment tool to guide campus teams in their assessment of institutional strengths and areas for improvement which is currently being piloted by 15 institutions in Aspire?s IChange Network.
