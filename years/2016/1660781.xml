<AbstractNarration>With Capacity Building funds from the NSF Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program, the University of Hawaii Manoa (UHM), in conjunction with faculty across colleges in the UH System and with outside experts, will establish and strengthen the infrastructure and collaborations that will ultimately lead to increasing the number and diversity of highly-qualified mathematics and science teachers in high-need schools across Hawaii. In Hawaii, the attrition rate for licensed teachers who come from out of state or who start teaching prior to completion of a teacher preparation program is significantly higher (50%) than for those who complete teacher preparation programs in Hawaii. Working toward solutions, project partners will include the UHM College of Education, STEM faculty from the College of Arts &amp; Sciences and College of Engineering, as well as Kapiolani Community College (KCC) and the Hawaii State Department of Education.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These partners will work collaboratively to create pathways for undergraduates majoring across STEM fields (specifically, mathematics, science, and engineering) to pursue a double major with secondary education. In consultation with an expert on the effective UTeach model, the project partners will (1) design course sequences allowing STEM and education double majors; (2) design new courses to introduce teaching to students early in their college careers thus enabling them to concurrently complete STEM degrees and College of Education coursework; and (3) develop recruitment plans involving awareness-raising, advising, scholarships, and articulation agreements with UH system community colleges.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   The state of Hawai?i is experiencing a major secondary STEM teacher shortage and is in dire need of teachers licensed in secondary STEM content areas.

The long-term goal of this cross-college initiative is to increase the number of licensed, highly effective secondary STEM educators in the state of Hawai?i.    The goal of our Noyce capacity grant was to leverag underutilized infrastructure to begin addressing obstacles undergraduate students who major in STEM fields at UHM and UH Hilo encounter when exploring secondary STEM instruction as a career path, including:   1) Current undergraduate education degree pathways require students to drop their STEM major in order to switch to an education major. This discourages students who are passionate about their STEM field from pursuing and becoming secondary teachers.    2) Those who do pursue an education major receive more limited STEM content preparation than those who major in STEM fields.   3) STEM faculty are generally unaware of pathways for students interested in careers in secondary education and funding to support students in engaging in such pathways.   4) Lack of coordination between STEM departments and CoE regarding student recruitment, advising and 4-year planning for students.   Over two years of grant implementation we have address the four (4) obstacles identified above in three (3) ways.
