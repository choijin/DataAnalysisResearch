<AbstractNarration>Part 2: &lt;br/&gt;Women, people of color, LGBTIQA individuals, and people with disabilities continue to be underrepresented in STEM fields, including the geosciences. The lack of diversity and inclusion of people with different identities and backgrounds in the geosciences harms the profession, by failing to recruit, retain, and nurture the best talent, and create welcoming and inclusive environments where all staff can reach their full potential. The purpose of this study is to develop and test new methods for helping geoscientists become more actively inclusive of diversity in their profession. In particular, the study aims to create at least 10 three-person geoscientist change-teams who are trained to 1) recognize and manage their own implicit biases; 2) intervene as social justice advocates when witnessing the biases of others; and 3) target critical gatekeeping decisions as a strategy to transform their home institutions. To do so, the study proposes evidence-based professional development that uses active learning techniques and is carefully evaluated for efficacy. Change teams will attend a workshop that spans three days - one day of innovative methods to address each specific aim. Day 1 will give leading-edge perspectives on implicit bias to build self-awareness in a non-threatening manner, and provide a proven, flexible  framework for empathy, motivation, and successful self-regulation. Day 2 will teach a ?social-closure? perspective on institutional exclusion, that focuses on key gatekeeping processes as inclusion/exclusion decision points (e.g., search committees, annual review, promotion, graduate admissions) and offers a coherent strategy to initiate and drive institutional change. Day 3 will build upon earlier awareness and motivational work to focus on practicing effective habits for bystander interventions. An innovative aspect of this training will be the creation of an immersive virtual environment of geoscience colleagues committing various microaggressions and acts of exclusion. The conversations among participants and avatars will be based on geoscience-specific interview data, and will provide participants with a safe space to actively practice effective interventions and create new habits that promote inclusion. The study will assess participants? knowledge and beliefs via surveys and interviews after the workshop over the span of a year, and will create and moderate a peer network for mentoring and continuing education.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[Overview  GeoDES is a pilot project to test progressive strategies for teaching about Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) best practices to tenured faculty and academic administrators in the geosciences. Nearly thirty academic leaders participated in the project. There are four goals for GeoDES:  Goal 1: Increase participant knowledge of bias and social justice issues relevant to the geosciences. Goal 2: Increase participant knowledge of bystander intervention techniques related to the geosciences. Goal 3: Develop participants' leadership skills to target critical gatekeeping decisions as a strategy to transform their own home institutions. Goal 4: Support participants' continued development into champions for Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion.   Major Project Activities  Host DEI training workshop: Academic leaders participated in a 3-day workshop that introduced the importance of DEI and what social structures are in place that present barriers to embracing DEI. Facilitators first presented information about DEI challenges and best practices and then engaged workshop participants in activities, active discussions, and training opportunities.  Develop and implement DEI training simulations: The GeoDES team collaborated with a technology company called Mursion to develop three interactive, mixed-reality training simulations that addressed common DEI challenges and situations experienced in the geoscience community. Workshop participants interacted with the simulations through a computer using Zoom meeting software. The simulations use virtual reality avatars that emulate people in realistic academic situations tailored for the geosciences. Using the simulations minimizes the social and political risk of practicing new DEI skills. Three simulation scenarios were created:   How to identify and address microaggressions. How to combat social structures in academia that systematically exclude certain populations and how to act as an advocate for these individuals to increase their participation.  How to propose and implement changes to the tenure and promotion process so that DEI best practices become a structural component in order to catalyze meaningful policy changes that will drive institutional change.    Facilitate journal clubs: GeoDES team members hosted journal club meetings with reading assignments reinforceing DEI concepts.     Outcomes  The following describes four key outcomes of the GeoDES project:  Participants reported that they gained knowledge about bias and social justice issues found within the geosciences. Participants learned the importance of practicing bystander intervention techniques and why intervention is necessary.  They noted that the simulations provided valuable opportunities to practice being diversity champions through bystander intervention in a low-risk environment. Participants' leadership skills increased as a result of the workshop. They learned about the need to stand their ground in difficult DEI conversations and that using inclusive language is an important aspect to becoming a DEI champion. Participants' beliefs about their capabilities and beliefs about their department's collective capabilities to confront individual prejudices and prejudicial structures increased significantly from the start to three months after the workshop.   Impact  Findings from the GeoDES project have notable potential impacts for the scientific and non-scientific communities moving forward.  Impacts in the geosciences: Participants' ability to identify and breakdown DEI barriers through their new bystander intervention and leadership skills may make appreciable impacts on their own departments and institutions, which would move the needle on making a more inclusive culture for all scientists, students, and staff. By extension, that cultural shift may catalyze more action by other faculty and department administrators. These may include implementing policy changes, volunteering in professional societies to drive change, or at the individual level by helping students. These seemingly small steps accumulate over time to reduce DEI barriers in the geosciences as a whole.    Impacts across STEM: Similar DEI challenges appear in other STEM disciplines, but perhaps for different reasons. The GeoDES interventions using bystander training, the use of virtual reality simulations, leadership development, and discussing concepts of bias and privilege, for example, can address common challenges across STEM. Once the results from GeoDES are published, strategies and outcomes will be available for other disciplines to learn from and add to these efforts.   Impacts on society: DEI is at the forefront of many business, social, and political movements currently happening in the United States. This societal momentum may increase the impact GeoDES has beyond science and technology:    Improving public knowledge, attitudes, and abilities in DEI: Leverage Mursion's corporate connections to reach clients and provide resources to develop new trainings and simulations. If applied broadly to large corporations' staff, more professionals working outside of STEM will have exposure to DEI best practices. This experience would increase public knowledge, help build skill sets relating to bystander intervention techniques, and allow them to practice these skills in safe and inclusive environments. Improving social conditions: As the outcomes from GeoDES become broadly disseminated to the scientific communities, the strategies may be complimented by and added to current activities, interventions, and trainings in other academic departments, professional societies, corporations, and other high-profile/high-impact places. Already, the novel approaches GeoDES has taken are generating discussions with other companies, start-ups, and non-profits.
