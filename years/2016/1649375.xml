<AbstractNarration>Finding inclusive approaches to broaden the participation of underrepresented communities in the sciences is the focus of this project. The team will create pathways for Native American students from the development of new partnerships between tribal communities and STEM institutions that promote the participation and inclusion of Native American scientists in the geosciences. Each partner brings a successful program, based on good practices from the research literature in improving outcomes for underrepresented students and scientists. Together, the researchers will create scientific collaborations that support a pipeline for Native American students from middle school through to graduate school and beyond. In addition, the project will work on building welcoming workplace climates for indigenous researchers within ?traditional Western? organizations. The approach will integrate indigenous and Western knowledge in research collaborations to create more creative, innovative, and culturally relevant science research programs. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project, Integrating Indigenous and Western Knowledge to Transform Learning and Discovery in the Geosciences, uses the principles of collective impact to create new partnerships between tribal communities and STEM institutions that promote the participation and inclusion of Native American scientists in the geosciences. The project collaborators will more strongly integrate indigenous and Western knowledge into collectively-developed research projects. The project partners the Rising Voices: Collaborative Science for Climate Solutions (Rising Voices) and member tribal colleges and communities with Haskell Indian Nations University, the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR), the University of Arizona?s Biosphere 2, and National Center for Atmospheric Research?s Significant Opportunities in Atmospheric Research and Science (SOARS) internship and Global Learning and Observation to Benefit the Environment (GLOBE) citizen science programs. Together, they will build research partnerships between Native American and traditional Western scientists, provide professional development for NCAR and Biosphere 2 scientists on how to engage appropriately with tribal communities, and provide pathways for NA students from middle school through college, to grad school and beyond. The project will connect community-based citizen science programs for middle- and high school youth with undergraduate programs at Haskell Indian Nations University and University of Arizona, and with summer research internship experiences for undergraduates and graduate students that address topics of interest across tribal communities, tribal college faculty, traditional science institutions, and community-based citizen science.  This project also enhances the research capacity of all partners, and brings together diverse perspectives, which have been shown to lead to greater innovation, creativity, and higher impact research.  The project has the potential to provide a tried and tested model for building similar partnerships at other institutions, including content and methods for professional development for mainstream scientists, ways to create more welcoming spaces for Native American students and scientists, promising practices for improving how research in the geosciences carried out, and an increase in the representation of Native American students and scientists in that vital research enterprise.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goal of this NSF INCLUDES Collaborative Pilot was 1) to provide meaningful, and culturally appropriate geoscience and Earth systems research opportunities for Indigeneous undergraduate students at both Biosphere 2 and with our collaborators at the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research (UCAR) in Boulder, Colorado; and, 2) to improve the capacity of academic staff, scientists, and faculty to link Indigenous knowledge and inquiry with pathways to STEM careers for under-represented groups.  As a two-year INCLUDES Pilot project, this endeavor was successful in both engaging and supporting specific Indigenous undergraduate students and in developing capacity at the University of Arizona and Biosphere 2 for successfully mentoring Indigenous students in Earth systems science experiences.  Recruiting, training, retaining, and promoting underrepresented students ? while also learning from them and their communities - is an important goal that NSF, academic institutions, and individual scientists all need to work harder to achieve. We have made a difference for at least 4 students in the past two years, and will continue to be more successful in the future because of what we have learned about the best collaborative practices.  In conjunction with the University of Arizona Biosphere 2 REU Site (NSF funded; Katerina Dontsova, PI) that provides immersive research, training, and education opportunities (10 students x 10 weeks) for undergraduate students broadly interested in Earth systems science, we specifically targeted qualified Indigenous Students with our recruitment efforts for summer 2017 and summer 2018. We were very pleased to have a cohort of ten students of which fully half identified as Indigenous in 2018.   Along with the Arizona-based Biosphere 2 faculty and research staff, four of the Indigenous students visited Boulder, CO in July of 2017 or 2018, meeting with their SOARS (Significant Opportunities in Atmospheric Research and Science) peers and the SOARS program staff and research mentors - the goal being to entice these four students to apply for participation in SOARS following the summer experience at Biosphere 2. In 2018, we scheduled the timing of the Colorado visit to coincide with a visit to SOARS by Haskell Native Nations University students and faculty.  The intensive and hands-on mentorship provided to these four Indigenous students by University of Arizona faculty during summer 2017 or 2018 assisted both of them in 1) developing and executing excellent summer research, 2) presenting their findings to the public at the Arizona-Sonora Desert Museum and to their peers, other researchers, and faculty at a campus-wide University of Arizona undergraduate research symposium organized by the UA UROC program (Undergraduate Research Opportunities Consortium) and funded by the University of Arizona Graduate College. Additionally, each of these students presented their work, or will present this spring, at a national conference - attendance, housing, and travel paid for by the Biosphere 2 NSF REU grant.  Training and professional development included that specifically for the above-mentioned four Indigenous students, and also for University of Arizona faculty and researchers to better respond to the specific considerations necessary for working with Indigenous students. For example, a mentorship workshop, and follow up presentation by one of our UA colleagues, Dr. Karletta Chief, helped all of these participants become more aware of how best to support inclusive research and mentoring partnerships. Creating an inclusive cohort each year comprising students of a variety of backgrounds helped everyone expand their horizons.  Importantly, the Principle Investigator and colleagues are now more effective at facilitating education success among underrepresented groups in STEM fields.  Connections to initiatives at the University of Arizona, a newly recognized HSI (Hispanic-Serving Institution), because of the NSF INCLUDES project has been especially valuable.
