<AbstractNarration>The Division of Chemistry supports a workshop entitled "Workshop on Chemical Sciences Needs for Mid-Scale Instrument Development" organized by Professor Marcos Dantus of Michigan State University and Paul Bohn of the University of Notre Dame. This workshop brings together a diverse group of 35 participants from a broad range of institutions and geographic areas to discuss opportunities for instrument usage in the "mid-scale" range. These discussions focus on instrument development activities that meet the needs of the chemistry community. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Workshop addresses the following objectives: define national needs in the chemical sciences for mid-scale instrument development,  organize needs assessment around chemical grand challenge problems, and develop a report specifying prioritized objectives in chemistry. The broader impacts are addressed by dissemination of the findings and recommendations which start a broader conversation among key stakeholders in the US chemical sciences community, including instrument developers, facility managers, and users, as well as federal agencies supporting chemical sciences.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Workshop on Mid-Scale Instrument Development for the Chemical Sciences was organized to address the need and potential for mid-scale instrument development in the chemical sciences.  It targeted the support of activities in the design, development, testing and characterization of chemical instrumentation of a scale and complexity that cannot be addressed through existing programs of instrument support from federal agencies.  The workshop, thus, assessed the needs and opportunities for instrument development on the mid-scale level that could impact the entire chemical sciences community, and closely associated industries (fuels, energy, commodity materials and medicine) in the U.S. and the world. A key objective of the workshop was to bring together research leaders in the chemical sciences with a specific interest and expertise in the development of advanced instrumentation. Over the course of two days, participants considered the impact of new initiatives in mid-scale instrument development on overarching challenges in modern chemical sciences by: (1) Defining national needs in the chemical sciences for mid-scale instrument development; (2) Organizing needs assessments around chemical grand challenge problems; and (3) Raising community awareness regarding mid-scale instrument development.     Prior to the meeting, workshop participants proposed 33 "transformative instrument development" concepts. Informed by a series of grand challenge talks, these concepts were then refined through a down-selection and aggregation process into eight overarching thematic concepts for further fine-tuning. From these eight concepts emerged three key examples of instrument-dependent scientific problems with the potential to revolutionize the chemical sciences: High-Flux Ion Sources to Transform Synthetic Chemistry; Mapping the Dark Molecules of Life; and Quantum-Level Prediction and Control of Chemical Reactivity.     In addition to these exemplary research initiatives, the workshop developed four principal conclusions.  (1) Mid-Scale Instrument Development Focused in the Chemical Sciences. The workshop identified a need - as evidenced by strong interest of the participants - to develop novel chemical instrumentation that cannot now be encompassed within existing programs. (2) Scale and Scope.
