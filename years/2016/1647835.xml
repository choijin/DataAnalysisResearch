<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop a disruptive tow tension control technology specifically designed for the unique processing variables of composite material manufacturing to solve the limiting factor of tension control the industry currently faces. In composites manufacturing multiple materials with different tensile strengths and elasticity are combined to make a stronger product, and the lack of affordable tension control has up to this point limited the speed and quality of finished products within the industry. By controlling tension there are fewer gaps, uneven tows, and breaks, resulting in higher quality end product and reduced scrap rates. The composites industry is forecasted to grow at a 7% compound annual growth rate to $10.9 billion in 2018 despite these manufacturing limitations. By removing the limiting factor of tension control it is estimated that production could expand 15%-25%, increasing the growth of this industry even further. With composites? primary and growing role in renewable energy, aerospace, construction, automobiles, pipe and tank, and consumer goods, a manufacturer?s ability to remove limitations to effectively meet demand without sacrificing quality will be critical. Expanded productivity will allow for greater innovation with composites within existing industries and promote their use in new industries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this project centers on determining the feasibility of a Modular Tensioning Cartridge for composites manufacturing. The objectives of this project are 1) to determine if tension can be controlled near or at zero, 2) to achieve miniaturization of the unit for multiple use applications, and 3) to determine cost targets and economic feasibility. Research will be conducted to develop a load cell (sensing unit) capable of detecting minor (gram) changes in output in relation to key considerations of beam loading and sensing capability, through testing of multiple design, shape, and material combinations. Further research and testing will be conducted to discover heat dissipation requirements, fuzzing risks and solutions, and determine design and material requirements in order to achieve proper miniaturization of the full unit. Final research will be conducted to validate the economic value proposition of the unit to customers based on unit quality, size, performance, and service life in relation to cost and additional output/productivity generated. The team will determine the viability of load cell technology as a sensing device, and the combination of materials and design that will meet sizing, performance, and cost requirements.</AbstractNarration>
