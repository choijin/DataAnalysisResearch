<AbstractNarration>This award provides funding for a faculty development workshop to be held in conjunction with the Venture Well Open Conference, which promotes and supports innovation and entrepreneurship in engineering education. Participants will learn to develop and use physical simulations and moving analogies to help students learn innovation and entrepreneurship skills and concepts in the classroom. Since the Venture Well Conference attracts a wide group of faculty and students from varied institutional types, the workshop will have strong potential to affect engineering education practice broadly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop offers two tracks for the 40 to 60 participants anticipated, one track for those who are new to the pedagogy and one track for those who are experienced with it.  This project has the potential to broaden and improve student learning of innovation and entrepreneurship concepts as well as to engage faculty who teach these concepts so they can explore and implement effective teaching practices.  The activities following the workshop aim to build a community of practice through a series of virtual sessions and to provide a mechanism to sustain and expand the network of participants engaged in the development and implementation of evidence-based educational practices in the context of engineering innovation and entrepreneurship.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This workshop grant provided the opportunity to offer a full day workshop for faculty, students and other interested parties on the use of games and moving analogies as teaching tools for content related to innovation and entrepreneurship.  Moving analogies are characterized as physical activities that serve as analogies to engineering or other concepts. The workshop was hosted in conjunction with the VentureWell Open 2015 conference to a total of 45 participants.  Participant feedback after the workshop was very positive with 96% of participants stating that they were "likely" or "extremely likely" to implement the activities they were exposed to as part of this workshop in their courses.      To assist faculty in the implementation of games and moving analogies within their own institution, we offered a community of practice that served as a support network for participants.  Twelve of the participants at the workshop elected to be part of the community of practice that followed.  The community of practice lasted over a period of 8 months with 6, one-hour sessions for participants.  Each community of practice session focused on having participants share updates on their game-based implementations or ideas that they had for implementing the games within their classroom.  Afterwards, the facilitators and the broader group of community members would provide individuals with feedback and help them address any concerns they may have about their implementation.  Survey results obtained from community of practice members showed that 86% of participants in the community of practice had implemented the game-based techniques in their classroom.  Additionally, the participants shared that they found the community of practice to be very valuable as a support structure for their implementations.       Intellectual Merit: Innovation and creativity are key skills that we seek to encourage amongst the next generation of students that will graduate from our undergraduate programs particularly in STEM fields.  To produce more graduates with these skillsets it will be necessary to engage them in this content area as they progress throughout their programs.  One method to captivate their interest is through the use of games or moving analogies.  Games have been lauded for their ability to engage and reach, if not exceed, the learning that is observed through other teaching techniques.  This workshop provided an opportunity to expose more faculty to the benefits of introducing games and moving analogies within the classroom, while providing a supportive community that they could rely on when moving forward with implementations at their institutions.  This form of professional development was able to better facilitate the translation of game-based techniques into practice due to its supportive community structure that continued past the original workshop.     Broader Impacts:  The workshop brought together educators that had experience with the use of games and moving analogies as well as faculty that were new to this style of teaching.  This workshop model and its evaluation results also generated both a journal article and conference paper that discussed the development of the workshop, outcomes of the workshop implementation, and the additional benefits gained from the support of the community of practice.  Through these publications, others who are interested in developing faculty professional development workshops will be able to learn from the results we obtained.  The community of practice that formed as a result of this workshop continues to provide a support network for individuals that are interested in the use of games and moving analogies to teach innovation and entrepreneurship concepts.  As more participants implement activities that they have learned at the workshop, it will be possible to encourage publications of their results, which will help raise awareness of the benefits of this teaching style within undergraduate education....]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
