<AbstractNarration>CAREER: Carborane Cluster Architectures Featuring Multiple Metal-Boron Interactions&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this project funded by the Chemical Synthesis Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Dmitry Peryshkov of the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at the University of South Carolina is developing novel molecular architectures that enforce unique electronic and geometric environments on metal centers.  These architectures, in turn, are expected to significantly change the chemical reactivity of these metal centers. An unusual three-dimensional structure known as a carborane, which consists of a cluster of boron and carbon atoms, is utilized for the synthesis of these metal complexes with novel chemical bonds. This project studies the role of these metal-boron bonds in the activation and transformation of organic molecules into useful products.  Dr. Peryshkov is also developing an outreach initiative, which promotes graduate-level education and scientific research among underrepresented minority groups in South Carolina, including students at Historically Black Colleges and Universities. This program integrates educational and research opportunities for students in inorganic and organometallic chemistry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this project, Professor Peryshkov is developing methods to synthesize novel molecular architectures based on icosahedral carborane cages. Dr. Peryshkov utilizes the unique three-dimensional geometry and delocalized electronic structure of boron cages to access novel types of arrangements of metal centers on the surfaces of boron clusters. Facile interconversion between carborane, carboranyl, and carboryne bonding modes plays an important role in the reactivity of these metal complexes and leads to cooperative activation of organic substrates. Dr. Peryshkov is also developing synthetic methods for novel (BB)-carboryne complexes containing three-membered (B)(B)(M) metallacycles, which are inorganic boron-based analogs of metal benzyne complexes. The unusual electronic structure of these carborynes results in enhanced reactivity with organic and inorganic electrophilic components. Studies of metal-boron interactions in the novel molecular architectures provide a fundamental understanding for development of new synthetic approaches to functionalization of boron clusters and their utilization in catalytic transformations. Dr. Peryshkov is engaged in the educational outreach initiative aimed to attract and retain talented students in STEM disciplines targeting undergraduate students belonging to underrepresented minority groups.</AbstractNarration>
