<AbstractNarration>Many mathematical questions can be solved in multiple ways, each with its own advantages.  Short, conceptual proofs can avoid complicated calculations, but sometimes cannot provide the detailed quantitative information those calculations would reveal.  A recent insight is that, sometimes, mathematics can have it both ways.  By studying the structure of mathematical proof itself, techniques from the field known as proof theory make it possible to take abstract proofs and to extract detailed calculations from them.  Used in the opposite direction, these techniques can take certain kinds of lengthy calculations and replace them with short, abstract arguments which can then be generalized to prove new results.  The focus of this project is to both further extend these techniques to new areas, particularly recently discovered applications in statistics, as well as continue the application of known techniques to new problems, especially in areas where probability and randomness play a central role.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this project, Towsner will build on previous applications of ultraproducts to studying the way mathematical objects can be separated into structured and random parts.  An explicit quantitative approach to such dichotomies has long been central to extremal graph theory, but recent work has shown that these can also be viewed in measure-theoretic terms by using ultraproducts to mediate between the finitary and infinitary perspectives, leading to new results in the area.  Towsner will study this connection systematically, both developing new tools in the infinitary setting and using the proof-theoretic functional interpretation to translate these tools back to the classical setting, extracting explicit calculations from these infinitary arguments.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project developed a general method for extracting quantitative numeric information from mathematical proofs which use certain types of infinite limits ("ultraproduct methods"), and applied this technique to obtain new bounds in other very different parts of mathematics (functional analysis and differential algebra).  This project supported the development of a short, natural proof of the "hypergraph containers" theorem, which shows that certain sets in hypergraphs can be characterized by small "fingerprints", by identifying the right notion of dimension describing the relationship between fingerprints and sets.  This project supported solving an open problem about the difficulty of computing increasing sequences in a linear ordering by developing a new method for constructing such sequences by making several simultaneous attempts.  This project also supported a result characterizing when sets of k-tuples can be characterized by sets of r-tuples for r&lt;k, a first step towards the development of a "higher-arity" classification theory.  This project also led to the publication of a video course available to the public on very large numbers and the connection to proof theory, and supported the Penn Emerging Scholars Program, which exposes first and second year undergraduates, primarily from groups underrepresented in mathematics, to ideas in mathematics outside the standard calculus curriculum.
