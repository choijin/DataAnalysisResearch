<AbstractNarration>Delivering pervasive access to data-hungry wireless applications is contingent upon enabling wireless cellular systems to sustain the foreseen 1000x increase in the demand for wireless capacity. One promising solution is via wireless network densification in which small base stations are deployed at possible adverse locations, such as lamp posts and the sides of the buildings, to significantly boost the wireless capacity. However, reaping the benefits of such dense cellular networks requires devising novel heterogeneous backhaul solutions that can connect the small base stations to the Internet and core network by smartly and jointly exploiting existing, wired infrastructure, as well as new wireless, possibly in-band, backhaul solutions. The key goal of this project is therefore to introduce a fundamentally new cellular network design framework in which elaborate wireless, wired, heterogeneous, and possibly multi-hop backhaul models are tightly integrated with the access networks to facilitate joint analysis, modeling, and optimization of backhaul and radio wireless access. This proposed framework will enable tomorrow's cellular systems to support bandwidth-intensive wireless applications such as mobile high-definition video streaming, thus expediting their global deployment. The proposed research is further coupled with an elaborate educational plan that includes the introduction of an educational program encompassing new courses and student seminar series focused on heterogeneous cellular networks. Moreover, under-represented student groups will be involved in the research via hands-on projects and outreach events, thus contributing to training tomorrow's workforce in the area of wireless communications. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research will introduce a holistic mathematical framework that will lay the foundations of joint backhaul and radio access design in heterogeneous wireless networks. The proposed framework will marry together notions from stochastic geometry, microeconomics, and wireless networks to yield several important outcomes that include: 1) Novel tractable models and quality-of-service (QoS) metrics that will provide an in-depth, fundamental understanding on the performance limits of joint backhaul and access design in heterogeneous networks; 2) Fundamentally new resource management algorithms that can be used to jointly optimize the backhaul and radio access network performance; 3) New resource allocation and network design methodologies, such as joint uplink/downlink optimization with end-to-end QoS guarantees, that can explicitly leverage the opportunities brought forward by the presence of heterogeneous backhaul links; and 4) Validation of the developed theory over software and hardware testbeds. These critical outcomes are expected to break new research ground by providing a truly unified theory for system-wide design of emerging heterogeneous cellular networks.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This NeTS award has developed a transformative new framework for the joint backhaul and radio access design in heterogeneous cellular networks (HetNets) by weaving together ideas from stochastic geometry, microeconomics, and wireless networks. The first suite of results relate to the analysis of integrated access and backhaul (IAB) in large-scale HetNets. While contributing key advances to the stochastic geometry-based analysis of HetNets, these works have resulted in the following key system-level insights: (i) there exists a critical volume of cell-load (total number of users) beyond which the gains provided by the IAB-enabled network disappear and its performance converges to that of the traditional macro-only network with no small cell base stations, (ii) offloading users from the macro base stations to small cells may not provide similar rate improvements in an IAB setting as it would in a HetNet with fiber-backhauled small cells, and (iii) it is not possible to improve the user rate in an IAB setting by simply densifying the small cells due to the bottleneck on the rate of wireless backhaul links between macro base stations and small cells. The underlying terrestrial-only network models were then extended to develop 3D models that provided a deeper understanding of how connectivity can be provided through the use of drone access points in hotspot areas as well as scenarios in which there is limited ground infrastructure. In particular, using ideas from game theory and wireless communications, new approaches to optimize connectivity across both radio access and backhaul access in integrated ground-drone-satellite networks were developed. The developed tools have contributed to a better understanding on how such a HetNet can better manage its resources, such as bandwidth and energy, in a way to maintain a desirable wireless connectivity to the users.
