<AbstractNarration>The workshop on Systems for Solar Fuels Generation Utilizing PV and Electrolysis will be held at the University of Delaware on March 7-8, 2016.  The purpose of this workshop is to bring academic, industry, and government researchers together to assess the potential of making hydrogen gas, a sustainable zero-carbon fuel, from the splitting of water into hydrogen and oxygen using electricity generated through solar energy.  The expected outcome of this workshop is the formation of team that can advance both the science and practical development of integrated photovoltaic / electrolyzer (PV/EC) systems through coordinated efforts.   The workshop will also include a Poster session highlighting student research and projects in this area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop will cover two major topic areas underlying systems-level integration of PV/EC processes for potentially low-cost solar hydrogen fuel production.  The first area is Systems Optimization, which will focus on identifying systems-driven approaches for scalable design, manufacture, assembly, and operation of large-scale PV/EC systems for solar fuels production. Topics discussed will include techno-economic analysis, minimization of coupling losses, power conditioning, and design implications for PV and electrolyzer components in an optimized system.  The second topic area is Integration of Photovoltaic &amp; Electrolyzer Design, which will focus on identifying opportunities to improve system performance by redesigning both components for synergistic operation. Topics will include identification of low-cost/high-performance components, novel module and electrolyzer designs, membrane technologies, and catalyst development.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Systems for Solar Fuels Generation Utilizing PV and Electrolysis           Commercial photovoltaic (PV) and electrolyzer (EC) technologies have been available for decades, and their combination represents an attractive means of converting renewable electricity into storable "solar fuels" such as H2. Though not as elegant as an integrated artificial photosynthesis device that simultaneously performs solar harvesting and electrolysis, the physically decoupled PV/EC system has great potential to be a low-cost technology for solar fuels production.  The key positive attributes of a decoupled PV/EC system include i.) flexibility in energy output (electricity vs. H2), ii.) the use of technology with proven durability and scalability, and iii.) relatively simple "precursor-in/fuel-out" management. Despite the promise of such a system, commercial PV modules and EC systems have been largely developed in isolation, and there remain great opportunities to improve performance and drive down costs of PV/EC plants through device- and systems-level optimization.  The workshop focused on identifying the challenges in the design and development of low cost PV driven EC systems for large-scale production of H2  and other fuels and useful chemicals from H2O, CO2  and other abundant starting materials. The workshop evaluated the current state of PV/EC technology and identified challenges and opportunities in two critical areas:  1) Systems optimization: A systems-driven approach was used to identify design and scaling rules for optimizing the manufacture, assembly, and operation of large-scale PV/EC systems for solar fuels production. Topics included techno-economic analysis, minimization of coupling losses, power conditioning, and design implications for PV and electrolyzer components in an optimized system.  2) PV &amp; electrolyzer design: Current state-of-the-art PV and electrolyzer technologies have been designed independently, and as a result there is tremendous opportunity to improve system performance by redesigning both components for truly synergistic operation. Topics which were addressed included the identification of low-cost/high-performance components, novel module and electrolyzer designs, membrane technologies, and catalyst development.  Invited speakers included representatives from industrial,  academic  and  sponsoring  agencies,  who provided  the  current  status  of  research  and  development  of  renewable  fuels  and which stimulated discussions on the merits and challenges of obtaining high production capacities using the proposed PV/EC approach. A critical workshop emphasis was to identify the challenges for large-scale fuel and chemical production.  A paper highlighting system designs and R&amp;D needs identified during the workshop was prepared and distributed to attendees which they share with their NSF and DOE contract monitors to provide the basis for future programs.
