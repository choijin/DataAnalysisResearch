<AbstractNarration>Individuals can vary widely in their experience of color. Whether these differences are more closely tied to innate differences in the brain or to experience and learning remains actively debated. Recent studies in adults show systematic biases in the perception of blues and yellows and also striking differences in how they perceive these colors in images.  This project will use behavioral measurements to examine whether these perceptual differences are also present in infants, and explore the potential role of development and experience in color perception. The research will be conducted at Chuo University in Japan in collaboration with Dr. Masami Yamaguchi, a noted expert in infant perception. With the paradigms designed in Japan, data will also be collected in the United States to explore cross-cultural factors. The results of this project will help reveal how both visual sensitivity and color appearance are shaped by experience and the timescales of these effects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Human observers show a reduced sensitivity to blue and yellow compared to other hues. This sensitivity bias is postulated to represent an adaptation to the natural environment, which varies predominantly in blue and yellow. Individuals also show ?higher-order? differences in how they experience blue and yellow, with the bluish tints more likely to be attributed to the lighting than the object. This may again reflect a learned property of the world (e.g. that shadows tend to be bluish). Little is known about how these effects develop, and this project will explore this development by testing for parallel color biases in infants. At Dr. Masami Yamaguchi's lab, preferential looking techniques are used to investigate the color perception of infants, and this project will use this technique to evaluate color sensitivity and appearance in infant observers. Results from infants and adults in the United States and Japan will be compared to inform whether the blue-yellow axis asymmetry is also influenced by the observer?s specific visual environment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award under the East Asia and Pacific Summer Institutes program supports summer research by a U.S. graduate student and is jointly funded by NSF and the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>We measured infant brain responses to color stimuli using a NIRS system (ET-4000; Hitachi Medical). We presented the infants with a checkerboard pattern of geometric figures, colored as cyan and orange (blue-yellow) (135&deg;-315&deg; axis of cone-contrast space) in one condition and magenta and lime (red-green) (45&deg;-225&deg; axis of cone-contrast space) in the other condition. These color axes are notable as they stimulate the three cone photoreceptor types equally on average, therefore making any significant difference in the fNIRS response amplitude between conditions based on later stages of color coding. Studies of the color distributions of natural environments have revealed that they have greater variance for cyan-orange directions in terms of both the illumination (sun to skylight) and the scene (earth to sky). Adult human color vision parallels this asymmetry &ndash; contrast sensitivity is weaker, achromatic settings more variable, and color constancy more ambiguous, along the cyan-orange axis.&nbsp;Yet, how these properties vary across timescales is not well characterized. We explored the extent to which infants show an adult-like response asymmetry to cyan-orange versus magenta-lime stimuli. For preliminary analyses, we averaged the oxygenated hemoglobin (oxy-Hb) concentration at each channel across all trials, and compared the activity during each condition to the baseline using a z-score. A grand averaged result across infants (age =168-239 days, n=5) using a two-tailed paired t-test revealed a significant difference in the magnitude of activation between the magenta-lime (<em>M =&nbsp;</em><em>1.09, SD = 1.40)</em>&nbsp;and cyan-orange&nbsp;<em>(M = 0.48, SD = 0.64)</em>&nbsp;condition (<em>t</em>(149) = 8.186,&nbsp;<em>P &lt; 0.0001</em>).

When adult observers are asked to name the original dress image, about 40% label it as white-gold and 60% as blue-black. However, when the original image is inverted, almost all observers agree that the dress is yellow. This is notable because the colors of the original dress image tend to be around the cyan area of color space (135&deg;) and the inverted image at complementary oranges (315&deg;). That there are less individual differences in the perception of the inverted dress compared to the orignial reveals an increased ambiguity in cyans compare to oranges, and thus an asymmetry along this axis. We tested whether this trend persists in infants using a preferential looking paradigm. We presented the infants with the original dress image and an inverted dress image on either side of the same monitor, and compared the amount of time during presentation that the infant looked at each stimulus. The mean total looking time of the two trials was 13.06s for 5 to 6 month olds (n = 23) , and 14.35s for 7 to 8 month olds (n = 16). A two-tailed paired t-test revealed that there was no difference in looking time between the inverted and original dress image for 5 to 6 month old observers (t(22) = 0.80, p = 0.43) or 7 to 8 month old observers&nbsp;<em>(t</em>(15) = -0.22,&nbsp;<em>p = 0.83)</em>. However, we used a hierarchical agglomerative cluster analysis to reveal whether there was a group to emerged which had a preference for the inverted dress, while a different group would emerge which had a preference for the original dress. This clustering was motivated based on the grouping observed in adults who have a clear and stable percept of the original dress as either "white and gold" or "blue and black". We tested whether clear groups existed within infant observers. The cluster analysis revealed a group which preferred the inverted dress (looking time to inverted dress &gt; 50.53%), and a group which preferred the original dress (looking time to orignial dress &gt; 50.38%).
