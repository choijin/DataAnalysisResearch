<AbstractNarration>With this award, the Chemistry of Life Processes Program in the Chemistry Division is funding Dr. Neil Marsh from the University of Michigan for studies on a potentially useful new enzyme.  Enzymes are proteins that speed-up many chemical reactions within cells and thus, enzymes are necessary for life.  There is increasing interest in using enzymes to catalyze industrial chemical reactions because they are extremely efficient, renewable, biodegradable and non-toxic.  One class of industrially promising enzymes is known as decarboxylases.  These enzymes have the ability to add carbon dioxide to (or remove carbon dioxide from) molecules, which may allow them to be used in processes to develop new biofuels or important commodity chemicals such as styrene (used in making plastics).  This project is studing the biochemical properties of a newly discovered decarboxylase enzyme with the long-term objective of producing this enzyme for industrial applications.  In synergy with the scientific goals, the project is advancing the education, training and professional development of undergraduates, graduate students and postdoctoral scientists in the inter-disciplinary area of chemical biology.  Students and postdocs are receiving training in a wide variety of specialized techniques ranging from organic synthesis to sophisticated spectroscopy experiments.  &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The project investigates the mechanism of a novel 2-component decarboxylase system recently identified from yeast.  Ferulic acid decarboxylase (FDC) catalyzes the decarboxylation of a wide range of substituted phenylacrylic acids and sorbic acid.  The enzyme uses a novel, modified flavin mononucleotide (FMN) as a cofactor that contains an additional 6-membered ring derived from dimethylallyl phosphate. The second enzyme, termed PAD1, synthesizes the cofactor from reduced FMN and dimethylallyl phosphate. In particular, the Marsh group aims to determine the mechanism of FDC and role of the novel, modified flavin cofactor in catalyzing the decarboxylation reaction.  They further aim to determine the mechanism by which PAD1 synthesizes the modified flavin cofactor.  The experimental approaches includes measuring the kinetics of the FDC- and PAD1-catalyzed reactions using both steady state and pre-steady state techniques with a variety of substrate and coenzyme analogs.  Deuterium, and 14C and 13C kinetic isotope effects are measured for FDC and combined with computational studies to fit the experimentally-determined kinetic isotope effects with models of the enzyme transition state.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[             Enzymes are proteins that catalyze all the chemical reactions in cells that are necessary for life.  There is increasing interest in using enzymes to catalyze industrial chemical reactions because they are extremely efficient, renewable, biodegradable and non-toxic.  One class of industrially promising enzymes are known as decarboxylases.  These have the capacity to add or remove carbon dioxide from molecules, which may allow them to be used in processes to develop new biofuels or important commodity chemicals such as styrene.  This project studied the biochemical properties of a newly discovered decarboxylase enzyme with the long-term objective of engineering this enzyme for industrial applications.                The project investigated how an enzyme from yeast called ferulic acid decarboxylase (FDC) catalyzes the decarboxylation of the food preservative, cinnamic acid to produce the industrially important hydrocarbon, styrene and carbon dioxide.  We discovered that the enzyme requires a novel, modified form of vitamin B6 to perform this reaction.  A common for of vitamin B6 is flavin mononucleotide (FMN) but this new form of FMN contains an additional 6-membered ring derived from isoprene give a new molecule known as prenylated-FMN. A second enzyme, termed PAD1, synthesizes the cofactor from FMN and the activated isoprene derivative, dimethylallyl diphosphate.  We characterized both these enzymes, both in terms of their chemical mechanism and the rates with which they catalyzed their respective reactions.               For FDC we determined the maximal rate at which the enzyme could convert cinnamic acid to styrene (kcat) was ~ 7 times per second.  This is fast enough that it could potentially be useful for biotechnological applications.  In contrast, the rate at which PAD1 synthesizes the prenylated-FMN cofactor is very slow, only 12 times per hour, however only very small amounts of prenylated-FMN are required.              Most interestingly, the reaction catalyzed by FDC is thought to occur by a type of chemical mechanism that was previously unknown in biochemistry, known as a cycloaddition reaction.  We conducted various experiments to validate that this novel chemistry was indeed occurring.  These included reacting the enzyme with an inhibitor that allowed a key chemical intermediate predicted by the reaction mechanism to be isolated and characterized, thereby providing valuable support for the proposed chemical mechanism.  These studies provide additional understanding of the mechanism by which FDC catalyzes decarboxylation reactions that may facilitate engineering the enzyme to be more efficient and/or to use a wider range of substrates.              During the course of this project an increasing number of related decarboxylase enzymes were discovered; therefore, our studies on this archetypical enzyme provide the basis for understanding the chemical reactions catalyzed by the other enzymes in the prenylated-FMN family.                In addition to the scientific goals, the project advanced the education, training and professional development of 2 University of Michigan undergraduates, 3 graduate students and a postdoctoral scientist in the inter-disciplinary area of chemical biology.  The students and post-doc received training in a wide variety of biochemical and biophysical techniques and presented their results at local and national scientific conferences.
