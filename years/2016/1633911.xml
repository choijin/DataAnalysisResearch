<AbstractNarration>While the significance of the Gulf Stream to the global climate system has long been recognized, subsurface observations that resolve its variability and dynamics are limited. Understanding the dynamics of the Gulf Stream under the current climate is a critical first step, and this study will contribute significantly to advancing knowledge of the fine scale structure, dynamics, and stability of the Gulf Stream and may shed light on western boundary currents in other basins. Estimates of subsurface Gulf Stream structure and variability will serve as targets for modeling efforts. Observations from this program will be made available in near-real time for use in operational numerical models where they have demonstrated impacts. Concurrent biological and physical measurements within the Gulf Stream collected during this program are likely to lead to opportunities for interdisciplinary studies. Outreach and education activities will include involvement with established undergraduate summer programs at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, inclusion of new findings in graduate instruction through the Massachusetts Institute of Technology-Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution Joint Program, and showcasing of the research and underwater gliders at public events. The project will train and support one graduate student.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Building on a successful 1-year pilot study, this project will use autonomous underwater gliders to collect high-resolution measurements of temperature, salinity, currents, and biological indicators within the Gulf Stream between southern Florida and New England for two years. At the conclusion of the field program, an unprecedented set of approximately 150 cross-Gulf Stream transects through the upper 1000 m over a three-year period will offer a unique opportunity to examine the fine scale structure and dynamics of the Gulf Stream. This project will focus on 1) seasonal and along-stream variability in Gulf Stream structure, including potential vorticity and implications for stability; 2) large-amplitude internal waves and thick bottom mixed layers that are formed when the Gulf Stream flows over the continental margin upstream of Cape Hatteras; and 3) quantifying the effects of horizontal stirring using along-isopycnal temperature, salinity, and potential vorticity as passive tracers.  This research will stimulate future theoretical and analytical advances in the understanding of western boundary currents and their role in the Earth's climate system.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Gulf Stream is a key component of the Earth's climate system located along the eastern seaboard of the US. The major goal of this project was to use autonomous underwater gliders to collect high-resolution observations during many crossings of the Gulf Stream along the US East Coast. By the close of the project, over 200 such transects had been occupied and over 20,000 profiles of temperature, salinity, velocity, and other properties in the upper ocean had been returned. This routine, high-resolution sampling of the Gulf Stream along the US East Coast has filled a critical gap in subsurface observations of a critical component of the Earth's climate system. The observations were made available in near-real time for operational usage, with demonstrated impact in operational ocean forecasts. Post-processed data are publicly available for further analyses.  The observations have been used to examine a variety of processes associated with the Gulf Stream along the US East Coast. Among the particularly novel results of this work are:  Discovery of large-amplitude internal lee waves and thick bottom mixed layers that develop as a result of the Gulf Stream impinging upon relatively shallow bathymetry along the southeastern US Coast. These processes transfer energy from the large-scale flow of the Gulf Stream to smaller scales. Detailed characterization of the along-stream evolution of Gulf Stream volume transport along the US East Coast, particularly identifying that the well-known downstream increase in volume transport is driven by entrainment of sub-thermocline waters from the seaward side of the current. Detailed analysis of the impact of multiple hurricanes in September 2017 on the transport of the Gulf Stream. Examination of the formation of submesoscale coherent vortices as the Gulf Stream encounters topography alon the SE US coast. These vorticies provide a mechanism for cross-frontal transfer of waters from the continetnal margin to the deep ocean. Estimation of the three-dimensional distributions of mean and eddy kinetic energy in and near the Gulf Stream along the US East Coast. Clear demonstration of the feasibilty of sustained surveillence of a mid-latitude western boundary current using autonomous underwater gliders, motivating a larger role for gliders in the Global Ocean Observing System.
