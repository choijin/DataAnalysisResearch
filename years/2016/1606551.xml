<AbstractNarration>This workshop will be held in Lyon, France, and will bring together international experts from the US and France to discuss advancements in cyberinfrastructure (CI). The specific focus will be on commonalities that exist between cluster, cloud, and data analytics computing. CI has become of growing importance to nearly all NSF research, which makes increasing use of computational simulation and large-data analysis methods. The results will be published in an open report as well as in several journal papers. They will contribute to and leverage new ideas in cluster, cloud, and data analytics computing for the benefit of the research community&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The architectural similarities between the above issues, and the fact that high performance clusters typically make up the major compute nodes of computational grids and clouds, means that deployment, operational, and usage issues surrounding computational clouds form a superset of the issues that revolve around clusters. The workshop will discuss topics such as extreme scale performance and related software development issues, common protocols and APIs necessary to facilitate seamless movement, recombination and analysis of large data flows, creating dramatically easier programming paradigms for highly parallel systems, creating tools that can support application development in highly virtualized environments, and system management problems that arise in multicore-heterogeneous architectures and data intensive applications.</AbstractNarration>

The fundamental infrastructure for advanced computational science today is composed of what are referred to as cluster, cloud, and data analytics computing&mdash;features that are being radically transformed by the convergence of at least two unprecedented trends.  The first trend is the ongoing emergence of microprocessors that are ushering in a new era of computing in which system energy usage is a first-order constraint, and parallelism&mdash;the execution of computing processes simultaneously rather than serially&mdash;and the position of data must be exploited to an uncommon degree. The traditional supercomputing applications that work together in tandem (an arrangement known as a software stack) are poorly matched with the new system architectures that are required.  The second trend is the dramatic escalation in the amount of data that leading-edge scientific applications, and the communities that use them, are either generating or trying to analyze. A key problem in such data-intensive science lies not only in the sheer volume of digital bits that must be processed and managed but also in the logistical problems associated with making the data of most-current interest available to participants in large national and international collaborations sitting in different administrative domains, spread across the wide-area network, and wanting to use the diverse resources of clusters, clouds, and data.  For the cyberinfrastructure research community, these new conditions raise a broad set of challenging design and deployment issues in areas such as scalability, programmability, interoperability, resilience, resource virtualization, data logistics, and system management.    The biennial Workshop on Clusters, Clouds, and Data for Scientific Computing is directed at addressing the aforementioned design and deployment issues by providing a forum for creative dialogue between leading-edge researchers in the field to produce the kind of coordinated review, penetrating analysis, and new insights that can help translate the unprecedented trends into highly consequential benefits for the scientific community.   This latest edition of the workshop, which convened on October 3 through 6, 2016, at La Maison des Contes, 427 Chemin de Chanz&eacute;, France, articulated a set of concrete approaches and proposals to develop software infrastructure for data analytics used in scientific computing across a broad spectrum of research domains.  Specificaly, the workshop accomplished the following:  surveyed and analyzed the key deployment, operational, and usage issues for clusters, clouds, and grids, with special focus on the discontinuities produced by multicore and hybrid architectures, data-intensive science, and the increasing need for wide- or local-area interaction; discussed the current state of the art in clusters, clouds, and data analytics and identified interesting questions and limitations;  documented experiences with clusters, clouds, and grids with respect to the science research communities and science domains that are benefiting from the technologies; discussed interoperability among disparate clouds, as well as between various clouds and grids, and the impact of this interoperability on the domain sciences; and discussed directions for future research and development in the context of disruptive trends and technologies and the recognized gaps in the state of the art.   This series provides a model of what international collaborations should be and it continues to supply the underpinnings for international partnerships in hardware and software cyberinfrastructure essential for rapid progress in the scientific fields vital to the long-term welfare of our society.  A major part of the success of this workshop and the previous ones in the biennial series is attributable to the outstanding quality of the people drawn from national and international communities to attend and give talks at this meeting. They are uniformly of "invited speaker" quality.  Furthermore, the organizers worked with colleagues to recruit promising junior faculty&mdash;especially women, minority, and underserved individuals&mdash;before invitations were sent. Of primary consideration was expanding the range of topics to include issues such as economic efficiency for cyberinfrastructure, workflows across all infrastructure down to the campus level, and the experiences of different research fields in using various types of cyberinfrastructure innovatively and productively.  Thirteen publications stemming from this workshop are now under review. The papers will be published in a special issue of International Journal of High Performance Computing and Supercomputer Applications.
