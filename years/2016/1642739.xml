<AbstractNarration>This is funding to cover airfare, ground travel and certain other expenses for approximately 40 attendees (30 promising junior investigators plus 10 accomplished senior scholars as mentors, eight of the latter from academia and two from industry) at the 9th Summer Research Institute (workshop) being organized by the PI under the auspices of the Consortium for the Science of Socio-Technical Systems (CSST), which will be held June 27-July 1, 2016, at Skamania Lodge in Stevenson, WA. The CSST resulted from recognition of the growing importance of research on the interplay of humans and technology. The science of socio-technical systems (SST) is fundamental to the rapidly growing "virtual organizations" thematic area, among others; thus, the urgent national need for research that is firmly grounded in the SST tradition. Yet this community of scholars, which includes faculty in diverse fields such as social informatics, social computing, CSCW, computational social science, HCI, and information science, remains fractured and largely invisible. The CSST series of Summer Research Institutes is a critical step toward unifying this diverse community and enhancing its visibility, by providing an immersive experience for the next generation of SST leaders (both advanced doctoral students and pre-tenure faculty) so that they will be well prepared to engage in distributed scientific inquiry. The Summer Research Institutes build critical intellectual and social capital by fostering creation of a cohort group of new researchers whose work is shaped by hearing experts in socio-technical systems research provide encouragement and give advice on how to advance the field's intellectual basis, methodological approaches, and potential for sustained, meaningful and even transformative impact. Increasingly, the iConference has become a showcase for Summer Research Institute alumni; for example, in 2011 more than one third of all events involved a sociotechnical scholar and Summer Research Institute alumni. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 2016 workshop will adhere to the successful format that has evolved and been refined over the course of the prior Summer Research Institutes. The workshop will bring together early career researchers selected through a competitive review process with a set of more senior researchers for an intensive five-day research exchange. The event will be residential and located in a semi-isolated locale to encourage the maximum amount of social interaction among participants. Senior faculty, junior faculty, and advanced doctoral students will collectively strive to articulate in more coherent and contemporary forms the basic principles, goals and approaches to doing socio-technical science across a range of relevant intellectual communities. They will explore topics and methods for advancing the science of socio-technical systems, while focusing on intellectual development of individual research that is aligned with core aspects of the socio-technical perspective. More than 68 accomplished senior scholars and 240 promising junior investigators have participated in the previous eight CSST Summer Research Institutes The diversity of participants across a number of dimensions (e.g., institutional, disciplinary, geographic, gender, minority group status), serves to broaden participants' perspectives at a critical stage in their careers. The immersive intellectual experience during the workshop will facilitate creation of a social network among the participants and the senior researchers who serve as Institute instructors. This network will play a major role both in the professional development of the participants and in the evolution of the field of socio-technical systems research.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Funding supported doctoral students and other young scholars to attend the Consortium for the Science of Socio-Technical Systems (CSST) Summer Institute. This annual week-long Summer Institute, running since 2008, brings together promising junior investigators and accomplished senior scholars to (1) explicitly pursue sociotechnical scholarship with direct benefit to society and substantial intellectual contribution, (2) extend the large and distributed intellectual community of scholars interested in advancing sociotechnical research, and (3) advance the basic principles, goals, and approaches to doing sociotechnical science across a range of intellectual communities.  Extending from the Summer Institute, we have developed a trans-disciplinary community of more than 1000 people whose "home" disciplines include HCI, CSCW, social computing, information science/social informatics, sociology of work and organization, communication, science and technology studies, ICT for development, and medical informatics.  The sociotechnical approach brings a somewhat different lens to bear on technology-enabled social activity: Whereas the HCI approach focuses on psychological states, dyadic relations between humans and computers, and attending to an individual’s roles in groups and communities, the sociotechnical approach is premised on social activity and attention to organizational arrangement, institutional forces, and collective action. With a rise in social media, virtual work arrangements, shared databases, and other constructions of technology and collaborative groups, the sociotechnical approach is increasingly important for understanding modern work, leisure, and association.  The scholarly development that arises from this event is visible in the success of CSST alumni.  With nearly 500 junior scholars having completed CSST since 2008, we have evidence of high rates of success in securing research positions in academia and industry. In academia, a high percentage of alumni are securing tenure-track faculty positions at a range of institutions. More than three of every four alumni succeed at tenure.  Alumni in industry are moving forward in their research and management careers. And, we are seeing alumni encouraging their current students to apply and attend.  We have four times as many senior scholars seeking to be a mentor than we can accommodate: a five-year backlog of interest!  Since this grant was awarded, the entire leadership group has changed: new leaders have stepped in and expanded the reach and remit of the effort, while continuing the core goals of sociotechnical development and career engagement.  By every measure, support from this grant has a disproportionally positive impact and long-lasting effect.           Last Modified: 08/06/2020       Submitted by: Steven B Sawyer]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
