<AbstractNarration>The New England Cybersecurity Operation and Research Center (CORE) is a collaboration between cybersecurity researchers and networking experts from the University of Massachusetts Lowell, and Information Technology (IT) support personnel and leadership from the Office of the President of University of Massachusetts (UMass), who work together to improve the security of under-resourced institutions in New England and providing a model of a regional approach to cybersecurity. The project leaders have built long term partnerships with local IT and cybersecurity-related organizations and consortia, which enable the project to reach beyond academia and affect the cybersecurity of the general public. Finding qualified cybersecurity personnel is a challenge faced by campuses and businesses across the nation.  One major goal of the CORE center is development of the cybersecurity workforce in New England.  The project directly addresses this need, providing a template for other regions to follow. The project offers internships, assistantships, and co-ops for students to work in the security operations and research center and obtain hands-on training in cybersecurity operation and research. The researchers incorporate the outcomes of the project into courses on computer and network security and privacy, mobile computing, wireless networks and digital forensics. They have a track record of accepting female and minority students into research groups, and consciously and actively encourage students from traditionally underrepresented groups to join this project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The researchers have established an open cybersecurity program at UMass, which guides customers through a sequence of steps and selects security controls and technologies from both proprietary solutions and free open source solutions, considering the budget of the institution or enterprise that wants to protect their assets. In the UMass cybersecurity program, these assets go through the UMass controls "factory". The input of the factory is unmanaged assets with weak security controls or without any controls. The output is a suite of managed assets with strong security controls, thus ensuring campus environments have robust cybersecurity protection. The researchers have applied the UMass open cybersecurity program to the UMass network and assets, which are monitored 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. This project expands the services including security consulting, security operations and security training/education to other local institutions and companies, and performs research on emerging threats, trends and defense based on the collected data. To sustain the operation, the CORE center provides services at affordable rates.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>University of Massachusetts Lowell (UMass Lowell) and the Office of the President of University of Massachusetts (UMASSP) established a regional New England Cybersecurity Operation and REsearch Center (CORE). The center is hosted in the UMass Data Center in Shrewsbury, MA and a satellite site is established as Cyber Range at UMass Lowell, which is a National Center of Academic Excellence in Cyber Defense Research (CAE-R) designated by the National Security Agency (NSA) and Department of Homeland Security (DHS). The functions of the center include cybersecurity education/certification, security consulting/design reviews and assessments, cybersecurity implementation/professional services, cybersecurity operations/managed security services and cybersecurity research on emerging threats, trends and defense. The focus of this initiative includes under-resourced colleges and universities as well as collaboration with government and industry partners.</p> <p>The major outcomes of this project are summarized as follows. 1. We have been striving to provide the cybersecurity operation service for under-resourced institutes in New England for collaborative cyber defense. We served 12 institutes at peak and monitored 10 sites as of January 1 2020 with the LogRhythm Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) purchased under this NSF grant. The core of our LogRhythm SIEM at Shrewsbury, MA includes five Indexer over 130TB storage, four Data processors, one Advanced Intelligence Engine (AIE), one Platform Manager (PM) and two Web Servers. Our personnel traveled to each site we serve and applied the proposed UMASS controls factory model to identify crown jewels of a site's assets. Data collectors are positioned at the assets to retrieve audits and logs, which are sent to the LogRhythm SIEM for big data analytics so as to reduce false alerts for intrusion detection. On average we monitor 25 devices per customer on a daily base. The peak traffic at the LogRhythm SIEM is 30,000 messages/second and 15,000 messages/second on average. CORE plays an important role in terms of cybersecurity operation for those institutes we serve. For example, in 2019, we created and resolved 824 cases with our customers.&nbsp; 2. Under the support of this grant and UMass Lowell, we have also established a satellite center at UMass Lowell, the UMass Lowell Cyber Range, for cybersecurity education, research and workforce development. Cyber Range is now a hub for cybersecurity related activities around Lowell, MA. For example, Cyber Range hosts UMass Lowell's cybersecurity club, which participates in various cybersecurity related competitions, including CTF (catch the flag) ethical hacking and National Collegiate Cyber Defense Competition (CCDC). The cybersecurity club had more than 40 students in 2019. 3. Our center has been striving to train next generation cybersecurity taskforce. During the three years of this project, we trained three different Ph.D students and five different undergraduates through the center. The Ph.D students focused on new trends of cyberattacks and defense techniques, particularly those related with Internet of Things (IoT). The research conducted in this project has prompted us to investigate more deeply the trend of cyberattacks such as those against smart buildings and air quality monitoring networks, which are critical infrastructure and shall be closely monitored with cybersecurity operation. Three undergraduates have graduated and work in the cybersecurity related fields. Two students including an African American student hired through this grant&nbsp;in 2019 have decided to pursue their master's degree at UMass Lowell. The major benefit of internship at the center is to connect the knowledge obtained from the courses and classroom to the real problems in practice. Students are much more motivated and also perform better in classroom with the internship.</p> <p>CORE is a very valuable and critical infrastructure in terms of collaborative cyber defense. An industry-grade security SIEM product is a valuable but expensive investment, which can and shall be shared among different entities. Sharing produces better results for a SIEM, which relies on big data analytics for better intrusion detection with less false alerts. Sharing reduces redundant investment and helps the community with collaborative defense. Although the project ended, PI Fu is still actively working with UMASSP and hopes CORE plays its critical role of cybersecurity operation for under-resourced entities. Given the low fee we charge our customers, there are concerns of running the cybersecurity operation service, including liability, workload, cost and scale of monitoring.&nbsp;</p> <p><br /><br /></p> <!--    @font-face  {font-family:"Cambria Math";
