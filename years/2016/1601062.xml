<AbstractNarration>The Amazon racerunner (Ameiva ameiva) is distributed across four very different South American biomes that cover an area larger than the continental US.  This project will perform the first distribution-wide, phylogeographic study of this lizard species, providing opportunities to find cryptic diversity in the group (i.e., new species) as well as a unique opportunity to evaluate competing hypotheses of diversification in both rainforests and dry habitats.  Data collected for the Amazon racerunner will also be used to address future risk to species due to climate change.  The work is a collaboration with South American colleagues to study key physiological traits (e.g., temperature preference and performance) to reconstruct species distribution models and assess extinction risk.  Because modeling historical distributions is based on paleoclimate data, these same models can be used to predict the effect that increasing temperatures will have on future distributions of organisms.  Results from this research will be developed into a teaching module and used to show non-Biology major students real-world observations used in hypothesis testing, here focused on speciation and biogeography.  Real examples from the researchers' extensive field and lab work will personalize the data for students and enhance their appreciation of the multi-faceted nature of science, and the nature of its conclusions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Preliminary results suggests that Ameiva ameiva represents a complex of species, which will be tested by sampling as much of the distribution as possible, and generating a combination of Sanger, NextGen, and several classes of morphological data to define species boundaries.  Researchers will visit three herpetological collections in Brazil to measure morphological data from museum specimens.  In addition to morphological data collection, 100s-1000s of SNPs (ddRADseq) for 200 individuals of A. ameiva will be incorporated into newly developed species delimitation (SDL) methods.  A recently developed SDL Bayesian approach that integrates morphological with molecular data (iBPP) was shown to perform well under a variety of scenarios, and this will be the preferred (but not exclusive) method used in this study.  Diversification hypotheses for the Amazon and Dry Diagonal of South America will be compared using SNP data with programs that allow the analysis of historical scenarios and a summary approach to estimate the strength of each hypothesis.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Derek Tucker's PhD research focused on three hiearchically-structured studies.  The first was to complete a "Next Generation" sequencing study of the lizard family Teiidae, in part to test the morphologically-based hypothesis published earlier by Harvey et al. (2012).  Tucker collected sequences from 316 nuclear genes from 251 lizards representing 45 species, representing all major lineages and all 16 genera recognized by Harvey et al.  Tucker's paper was published in 2016 before we secured this DDIG award, but it was integral to the success of the DDIG submission, and as background to the remaining studies.  Tucker's second paper focused on dense sampling of the species in the Caribbean endemic genus Pholidoscelis, which included 16 of thew 19 recognized species.  Again he used a phylogenomic data set to construct the clade's genealogy, to estimate divergence times, and to and reconstruct a phylogeographic history.  This study revealed a divergence of Pholidoscelis from it sister clade at 25 million yrs ago, and diversification within the Caribbean over the past 11 million yrs. Reconstruction of patterns of colonization suggest that the ancestor of this clade colonized either Hispaniola or Puerto Rico from Middle America.    The final chapter is still in preparation, but it will present a continental-scale phylogeographic/species delimitation studie of the widespread species "complex" Ameiva ameiva.  MtDNA sequence data are collected from 315 lizards across a region larger thant the continental US, and SNP data are collected from a subset of 240 lizards, along with morphological data from ~ 2,700 lizards.  Data analyses for the mtDNA and morphological data are complete, and SNP data analyses are in progress.  Derek presented a progress report of this work at the Joing Mtg. of Ichthyologists &amp; Herpetologists this past summer (2017) in Austin, TX.  We include 11 collaborators in this massive study and keep all updated via regular emails.             Last Modified: 11/14/2017       Submitted by: Jack W Sites]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
