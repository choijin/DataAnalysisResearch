<AbstractNarration>PI:  McKenna, Gregory B. / Schroeder, Charles / Anderson, Rae&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number:  1603943/ 1604038 / 1603925 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this proposal is to explore the behavior of polymer molecules that form large ring, instead of the usual linear polymer molecules. Such polymers, example of which can be the DNA molecule, behave in a different way than linear molecules when processed or when they flow in a solution, because there are not ends in the chains. Results of this work can lead to improved polymer materials, to understanding in detail the behavior of bio-molecules and to new technologies for DNA sequencing. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Circular polymers are fascinating materials that have inspired polymer theorists and experimentalists for decades. The dynamics of circular chains differ fundamentally from their linear counterparts due to the absence of chain ends. Despite recent progress, however, the effects of circular topology on polymer dynamics remain a key unresolved problem in the field. In this proposal, the PIs are poised to make major progress in our understanding by preparing circular and linear DNA molecules that are monodisperse and of high topological purity. The assembled team has the expertise to synthesize and characterize circular and linear DNA, and will study the rheological behavior of these materials over a wider range of concentrations and molecular weights than previously achieved. A comprehensive approach is proposed that will include macroscopic and micro-rheology, single molecule polymer dynamics, and DNA synthesis, to provide new information regarding the dynamics of linear and circular DNA. Beyond providing a point of departure for understanding their circular counterparts, the parallel study of linear entangled DNA will provide unprecedented data using perfectly monodisperse DNA samples to directly test predictions from reptation theory, such as the cross-over to reptative behavior at extremely high entanglement densities. In addition to graduate student participation, educational activities are proposed in all three collaborating institutions, ranging from underrepresented minority student involvement at Texas Tech, to high school teacher engagement at Illinois and undergraduate student participation at the U of San Diego, a mainly undergraduate institution.</AbstractNarration>

For these reasons, systematic physical characterization and rheological studies of the effects of topology on dynamics in dilute and entangled solutions have been hampered.  Our work made important advances to address this open problem.   Our advances in producing well-characterized ring, linear and supercoiled polymers (DNA) of varying lengths and concentrations can be used by other researchers to produce similar samples to address the long-standing problem of understanding the dynamics of circular polymers under varying conditions.  We performed the first microrheological measurements on entangled blends of ring and linear polymers &ndash; characterizing the dynamics in the linear and nonlinear regimes. We created and characterized the dynamics of ring-supercoiled DNA blends &ndash; exploring, for the first time, the dynamics of supercoiled polymer solutions and/or blends with polymers of different topologies.   We demonstrated unequivocal evidence of threading of ring polymers by linear DNA, supercoiled DNA, and cytoskeleton filaments.

Broader Impacts: Our large-scale DNA purification methods can be used by the synthetic biology, biomedical and chemical engineering communities and industries seeking ways to efficiently produce and characterize large quantities of DNA material. The emergent strong viscoelastic response that we showed that ring-linear and ring-supercoiled blends exhibit, along with the ability to finely tune the rheological properties of these blends, can be used in diverse materials applications including in medicine, infrastructure, defense, and green technology. Finally, our measurements of DNA transport through cytoskeleton systems impact the fields of cell biology, synthetic biology and biomedicine.   The PI is dedicated to training the next generation of interdisciplinary scientists and expanding opportunities for a diverse group of students to identify as scientists. As such, undergraduate researchers played a central role in this research, with 11undergraduates (8 women, 1 veteran, 3 first-generation) conducting research on the project, resulting in 5 peer-reviewed publications with 6 unique undergraduate co-authors. Undergraduates also presented 8 posters and talks at 4 national conferences. The students conducting research on this project were trained in a wide range of research skills including: wetlab and molecular biology techniques, microscopy, force spectroscopy, and computational data acquisition/processing/analysis. Their interactions with our collaborators broadened their scientific network and provided additional mentoring. These opportunities were designed to encourage students to pursue STEM graduate training and prepare them to excel in STEM careers. Further, the two postdocs trained under this award gained valuable experience mentoring undergraduate researchers and teaching undergraduate physics and biophysics courses.   Finally, the PI developed two outreach programs for URM-serving K-12 schools and an internship program for local high school students to increase the visibility and accessibility of STEM to the broader community - particularly to low-income and first generation junior high students, teachers and parents. These efforts were aimed at improving the education and opportunities available to underrepresented communities, and having a more informed and scientifically literate global community.
