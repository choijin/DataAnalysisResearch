<AbstractNarration>The project will conduct a series of field campaigns to observe phenomena producing high-energy radiation in thunderstorms.  These include terrestrial gamma-ray flashes (TGFs), long-lived gamma-ray glows observed in many parts of the thunderstorm charge structure, and x-rays associated with the stepping of lightning leaders.  The overall strategy is to locate probing sensors in or near the high-field regions where these emissions are primarily generated. The sensors to be used include two gamma-ray instruments developed at the University of California, Santa Cruz, under previous NSF awards, as well as sensors provided by our collaborators that sense lightning remotely via static and dynamic electric and magnetic fields. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:&lt;br/&gt;All the phenomena under study were discovered within the last 30 years or so, with research only becoming widespread in the last decade. Some of the many open questions that will be addressed by this project include: whether downward TGFs occur in natural lightning, whether glows (an avalanche of relativistic electrons) contribute significantly to the discharging of thunderstorms, and whether positive lightning leaders emit x-rays and low-energy gamma rays the way negative leaders do. The primary advantage the field measurements have over others are 1) the proximity of the detection sites to the radiation sources to be studied (thundercloud charge centers and lightning leaders); and 2) the high time resolution and throughput capabilities of the detectors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:&lt;br/&gt;The selected field sites (an urban tower in Canada, a region of very low altitude storms in Japan, and a very high altitude site in Mexico) represent the three situations in which it is at least feasible that downward TGFs might produce high enough radiation fields at the ground to represent a public safety issue (upward TGFs seen from space produce dangerous levels of radioactivity within thunderclouds at 10--15~km altitudes). Thus this program should allay (or justify) any concern about radiation at ground level nearly comprehensively. Significant participation from undergraduate and graduate students, including first-generation and otherwise underserved undergraduates, is part of the program.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Terrestrial gamma-ray flashes (TGFs) are extraordinarily bright bursts of high-energy radiation produced by a small subset of lightning flashes.  They were discovered using satellites in low-Earth orbit, and the radiation detectors on those satellites have been saturated or even paralyzed by these flashes, even though they take place in thunderclouds 600km below.  In this program, we set out to learn more about TGFs -- the physics of how they are created, whether they are rare or common, and whether they post a radiation hazard to humans on aircraft or even on the ground in certain areas where they might occur beamed mostly downward instead of up toward space.  We placed a variety of detector systems in several contexts: on a Hurricante Hunter aircraft, on high mountains in Mexico, Japan, and Switzerland, and near towers in Canada and Japan that are often struck by lightning.  In addition to some other findings and a number of improvements to our instrumentation, we made three significant scientific advances over the course of this project.  First, we have gathered increasingly more persuasive evidence that TGFs are both very rare and always very bright -- there seems to be no larger population of weaker events.  This is very different from phenomena like earthquakes and solar flares, which become more and more frequent as you look for weaker ones.  The most dramatic illustration of this was in a pair of lightning flashes we observed in winter on the west coast of Japan, an environment known for particularly powerful lightning.  These flashes both began *upwards* from the top of a tower (see the illustration attached).  As one approached the cloud overhead, it released a TGF powerful enough to saturate our detectors.  The other flash, on the same day, appeared more energetic by conventional standards (the speed at which it rose and the amount of electrical current it eventually carried), yet it produced not even a hint of gamma radiation -- if there was any at all, it was at least 10,000,000 times weaker than the TGF from the other flash.  With this same downward TGF in Japan, we became the first research group to observe a theoretically predicted flood of neutrons released in the aftermath of a TGF.  This was, in fact, the only way we were able to calculate the intensity of this event, as it paralyzed our detectors during the first millisecond when the gamma-rays themselves were reaching the ground.  These neutrons are knocked out of the nuclei of atoms in the air by occasional interactions of the gammas, leaving a cloud of radioactive nitrogen and oxygen behind.
