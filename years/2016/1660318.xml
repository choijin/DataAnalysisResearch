<AbstractNarration>This project is enabling the acquisition of a state-of-the-art multi-collector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (MC-ICP-MS) to support a team of researchers within the Department of Geological Sciences at the University of Florida to make significant advances for research applications in the Earth and Ocean Sciences.  This instrumentation facilitates the research program of the lead investigator, who is an early career female with a research focus on Uranium-series geochemistry, a technique used widely to determine the age of materials in studies of past climate and sea level change on time scales from a human life to thousands of years.  This MC-ICP-MS instrument allows the development of sea level reconstructions with high temporal accuracy and precision, to define the rates and tempo of ice sheet retreat and sea level rise during past warm climates.  These reconstructions can be paired with climate data to inform future projections of sea level rise over the coming decades to millennia.  Additional capabilities afforded by this instrument will significantly improve other existing research programs as well as enabling new lines of research in a wide range of Earth science applications. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The new MC-ICP-MS acquired through this project will enable the incorporation of new investigators and new research directions within our department, as will improve our analytical capabilities.  Specifically, the primary new capabilities will allow for several ion-counting channels, including multiple high abundance sensitivity filters to facilitate the analysis of U-series measurements.  The instrumentation will also allow for simultaneous measurement capability of U-Th-Pb-Hg during laser ablation analyses for U-Pb geochronology applications.  These advances, among others, will impact research in a wide range of disciplines beyond earth and ocean sciences, including existing collaborations within anthropology, chemistry, agriculture, paleontology, biology, medicine, engineering, and forensic science.  The instrumentation will be used to train students and post-doctoral scholars supported by a wide range of NSF programs.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This grant enabled the acquisition of a multi-collector inductively-coupled mass spectrometer (MC-ICP-MS) for use in a wide range of research topics in Earth and Ocean sciences.  We purchased and installed a Nu Plasma 3D instrument to meet the needs of multiple lab groups within the Department of Geological Sciences and to support future research directions of current and new faculty members.  This instrumentation also provides hands-on experience for students which is crucial to career development.  We have a strong history of engaging external users and students from high-school to graduate level and expect that their participation in analytical work that will be enabled by this instrumentation will be a valuable contribution to their scientific development.  Amongst other applications, the new capabilities afforded by this instrumentation have enabled the quantification of rates and timing of past sea level changes on 10 - 10^5 year timescales that improve our understanding of Earth's climate system and are used to calibrate ice sheet models that are used in future projections of sea-level change.   In the year since installation, we have utilized the instrument for 8 faculty members, 2 post-docs,  10 graduate students, 5 undergraduate students and 3 external users.  In this time frame, 8 different analytical methodologies have been successfully developed on this new instrument, enabling several analyses that we were previousy unable to conduct.  This new capability has already had a wide reach in terms of impact on research directions and student training both within the University of Florida and for external users and visitors.
