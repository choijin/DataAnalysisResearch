<AbstractNarration>This award supports participants at the Macaulay2 Development Workshop, May 7th-10th, 2016, at the University of Utah.  Macaulay2 is one of the world's leading open source software systems devoted to supporting research in commutative algebra and algebraic geometry. The aim of this workshop is to bring together researchers in these fields to develop new packages and functions that utilize Macaulay2's existing functionality to perform computations essential for research in algebra and geometry. These are then made available for use by other mathematicians throughout the world.  Many of the current Macaulay2 packages were started at, or greatly enhanced by, work at workshops such as this one. More information is available at the conference website&lt;br/&gt;http://wiki.macaulay2.com/Macaulay2/index.php?title=Utah2016_-_Main_Page&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop is designed to help guide researchers, including graduate students and faculty members at both research universities and 4-year colleges, in the development of packages for Macaulay2.  This will be done by having groups of participants consisting of a mix of experienced and novice members work intensively on developing packages.  Many of these packages will eventually be integrated into Macaulay2, with some of those also going through a peer-review process at the Journal of Software for Algebra and Geometry.  These packages can then be used by researchers throughout the world.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Algebraic Geometry and Commutative Algebra are two closely related subjects that study the solutions to polynomial equations.  These fields have many applications to other areas of mathematics as well as applications to robotics, computational theory, optimization, physics and statistics.  Many interesting and important problems in these fields have been motivated by computer experiments, and some groundbreaking results have recently been proven using computational techniques.    Macaulay2 is an open-source programming language that facilitates computations in these areas.  The software is maintained by a large number of core developers who regularly gather to add functionality to the software.  From May 7-10, 2016 we hosted a Macaulay2 Intensive Workshop at the university of Utah.  The participants were 39 people from research universities and four-year colleges.  Over the course of the workshop, participants wrote software packages to extend the capabilities of Macaulay 2.   Our work at the workshop is summarized as follows:   Discuss research and computational needs in different areas and implement software packages to aid in research.  Grow and mentor Macaulay2 users especially in package writing and software development. Build connections between the Macaulay2 and other computer algebra systems by fostering collaborations between developers.    The workshop was very successful.  We attracted several senior people in the field, as well as 17 graduate students. Among the participants were 7 women and 4 participants from primarily undergraduate institutions.  The large number of graduate students allowed us to introduce many new people to our developer community.  Our commitment to training underrepresented groups and early-career mathematicians is one of the main broader impacts of this workshop.     Our work throughout the conference, including a list of topics discussed, packages written, can be found on the final report or on the wiki page:    https://github.com/Macaulay2/Workshop-2016-Utah/wiki       Last Modified: 05/09/2017       Submitted by: Adam L Boocher]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
