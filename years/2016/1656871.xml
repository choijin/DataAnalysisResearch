<AbstractNarration>General Abstract&lt;br/&gt;This research investigates mechanisms that reduce violence and prejudice between groups currently involved in a violent conflict.  Scholars, governments, and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) develop and implement strategies designed to create positive interactions between members of conflicting groups as means to prevent violence. These strategies, however, are not tested among groups currently engaged in conflict, which prevents insight into possible effects of particular strategies -- whether they serve to prevent violence or escalate conflict.  This project initiates economic collaboration between two conflicting groups to study how intergroup contact might reduce intergroup prejudice. To do so, this study utilizes a behavioral game as means to gain a measure of intergroup prejudice. The researcher devises a new way to measure prejudice through the observation altruistic or selfish behavior during structured intergroup interactions, instead of the more prevalent survey-based procedure. The project is implemented with the assistance of a peace-building NGO in an area marked by significant intergroup violence between farmers and animal herders, which results in thousands of deaths per year, high levels of food insecurity, significant property destruction, and the displacement of families and communities. Results from the study will provide valuable insight to inform scholars and policymakers about effective strategies to prevent violence between groups. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Abstract&lt;br/&gt;This research focuses on strategies to reduce violence between conflicting groups.  In particular, it works with a peace-building NGO program that developed such a strategy derived from a "contact hypothesis."  This approach posits that structured interactions between members of competing groups is the most effective means of reducing intergroup prejudice. Numerous studies confirm that intergroup interactions can reduce prejudice.  Experiences with outgroups has been shown to remove negative stereotypes and allow the prejudicial individual to re-conceptualize the outgroup. Recent studies, however, also conclude that social contact between groups involved in conflict does not always reduce prejudice, and may even increase it. Positive interactions do not always generalize to the entire outgroup, and can increase prejudice when such positive interaction conflicts with an individual's strongly held prejudicial beliefs. This project contributes to the research intergroup contact and prejudice reduction by testing if and how sustained economic collaboration might reduce prejudice between conflicting groups. An additional and equally important contribution of this project is a novel and new procedure to measure of prejudice in the field. Prejudice is typically measured via survey responses, which raises questions with respect to the reliability of the measure. Instead of a survey-based measure, this study evaluates prejudice directly by observing behavior in a public goods game played between farmers and animal herders, groups engaged in violent conflict. This project offers an empirical test of contact theory to reduce prejudice between conflicting groups and a novel measure of prejudice. Its findings will benefit scholars, policymakers, and NGOs in evaluating the effectiveness of their conflict prevention and prejudice reduction strategies.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project evaluated a peacebuilding program in Nigeria's Middlebelt states, where farmer and pastoralist groups are engaged in a deadly conflict.  The intervention was inspired by the "contact hypothesis," which proposes that intergroup prejudice can be reduced by structured interaction between group members.  Despite many rigorous studies of the contact hypothesis, it is rarely tested through field experiments and none of the field experiments involve groups in an active conflict.  Our evaluation provides evidence about the effectiveness of structured intergroup interaction to reduce conflict.  We evaluated the program?s effects with an experiment in which 10 communities received the peacebuilding program and 5 communities did not.  We measured project outcomes in two primary ways: (1) surveys at the beginning and end of the program and (2) an economic "public goods game" in which we provide members of both groups with money and the option to contribute none, some, or all the money to a community fund that will help both farmers and pastoralists.  We donate $2 to the fund for every $1 they donate, so their community receives the maximum benefit when the individuals donate all the money to the fund. However, that community fund will help both farmers and pastoralists, so individuals high in prejudice should donate less money.  If the peacebuilding program reduced prejudice, we should observe higher donations in communities that received the program than in communities that did not receive the program.  Within communities that received the program, we should observe higher donations among people who were involved with the program than with people who were not involved with the program.  The NSF doctoral dissertation research improvement grant funded us to implement this public goods game as part of our final evaluation.   Our final evaluation took place in early 2018.  We visited the 15 communities in the program to conduct an endline survey and the public goods game.  Trained survey enumerators surveyed 50 farmers and 50 pastoralists in each community, surveying equivalent numbers of males and females from each group to ensure men and women were represented equally.  From each community they also surveyed 10 farmers and 10 pastoralists from the 2015 baseline survey so that we could track their survey changes over time.   The results suggest that the peacebuilding program did not encourage community members to donate more money to the community fund.  The average donation amount did not differ between communities that received the program and communities that did not.  The likelihood of donating at least some money was higher in communities that received the program, but not to a statistically significant level.  By "not statistically significant", we mean that the difference between program communities and non-program communities could be explained by random chance.  Within program communities, people who directly participate in the program were more likely to donate money and donated more money than people who did not directly participate in the program, but this difference was not statistically significant either.  The results of the surveys corroborate the findings in the public goods game.  Program communities tended to score higher on some survey outcomes, but not so much higher that the difference could not be explained by random chance.  The same result is true for individuals within program communities: people involved in the program tended to score higher than individuals not directly involved, but not higher than could be explained by random chance.  The difference between program communities/people and non-program communities/people is not large enough to rule out random change on any individual outcome or when combining all outcomes together.  These results do not mean that the program was ineffective or the contact hypothesis is wrong.  The program could have had an effect and structured intergroup interaction could have reduced prejudice and conflict, but not to a level that we could differentiate from random chance.  A larger study with more communities could differentiate smaller effects from random chance.  The results of this project call for further studies about the effect of structured intergroup interaction among groups in conflict.  Only after seeing the results of several studies can we understand the average effect of structured intergroup contact in conflict environments.
