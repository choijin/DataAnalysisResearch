<AbstractNarration>Topological data analysis (TDA) is rapidly developing as a way of finding structure in data that can bring analytical insights. It has great potential in Health Informatics and Bioinformatics -- both of which need ways to distill the essence form the sea of data that threatens to drown conventional analysis. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project provides travel support for students to attend a workshop on Topological Data Analysis at the 7th ACM-BCB, the conference for ACM SigBIO, on Bioinformatics, Computational Biology, and Health Informatics. As such, it will increase exposure of students in BCB to the tools and researchers in TDA, and students in TDA to the rich and varied data sets in BCB.  Thus, this project, and the workshop in general, will facilitate new collaborations between the TDA experts and BCB researchers that can lead to new analyses for increased understanding in medicine and health. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Priority will be given to supporting student applicants from groups that are underrepresented in science. Slides from presentations as well as videos of the talks will be made available to the public on the conference web page.</AbstractNarration>
