<AbstractNarration>Honey bees, live as a group of organisms that form a cooperative unit: a colony. Colonies, like individuals, have a cycle of growth and development. When a colony transitions between developmental stages, the workers must coordinate the transition. The goal of this project is to understand the cues that non-reproductive worker honey bees use to detect the developmental stage of their colony and coordinate the switch between producing more workers and producing reproductive males and females (drones and queens). This research will encourage collaboration between researchers studying animal behavior, chemical ecology, and electrical engineering. Current methods used by beekeepers to assess the strength and developmental stage of a honey bee colony are based on metrics that humans can easily determine, but are almost certainly not those used by the bees. Honey bees are the primary pollinator of agricultural crops worldwide, providing billions of dollars of pollination services. By identifying the metrics that bees use to detect their own colony's development, this research will help beekeepers determine which colonies need to be managed, and when.  Better colony management can in turn improve crop production. The outcomes of this research will be shared through beekeeping classes. This project will also train graduate and undergraduate researchers in behavioral ecology, chemical ecology and engineering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Descriptive work has shown that social insect colonies invest first in workers (for growth) and then switch to producing reproductive individuals. Theoretical work has shown why colonies invest as they do, but it is unknown how developmental transitions are coordinated. The researchers recently discovered that a threshold number of workers is the trigger that induces honey bee colonies to invest in reproduction, but how workers detect this reproductive threshold is unknown. The goal of this research is to test two hypotheses of the mechanism by which individual honey bees assess their colony?s size: (1) beeswax comb vibrations, and (2) volatile chemical compounds. Using accelerometers to measure comb vibrations, and gas chromatography to analyze chemical compounds, the researchers will determine whether these cues reliably change with colony size. The cues will then be experimentally manipulated, to determine which one(s) the workers use to detect that their colony is above the reproductive threshold. Understanding the cues that superorganisms use to coordinate their developmental transitions will give insights into how evolution has solved similar problems at different levels of biological organization such as individuals and societies.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ How does a honey bee know how big her colony is?  We know that bees behave differently depending on the size of the colony, but we don't know how workers detect their colony size.    For this Doctoral Dissertation Improvement Grant, we proposed and tested two hypotheses of how bees detect their colony's size: the comb vibrations hypothesis, and the chemical composition hypothesis.   For both hypotheses we first needed to demonstrate that there's a reliable difference in the proposed cue (comb vibrations or chemical composition).   To measure vibrations in beeswax comb, we collaborated with an engineer in the neighboring department.  Once we showed that the accelerometers could detect comb vibrations, we manipulated colony size, to see how vibrations change with the number of bees on the comb.  Surprisingly, the magnitude of the vibrations actually decreased as the number of the bees on the comb increased.  We then tested to see if it was the mass of the bees that was damping comb vibrations, but found that it was not.  It is likely the bees' posture that damps the vibrations.    The magnitude of this vibration damping, however, is not sufficient for bees to detect changes in colony size, so we could reject this hypothesis.  What this did show, was that the comb vibrations do not increase with colony size, and so communication systems that rely on substrate vibrations (like the waggle dance), are not impeded when a colony grows, and it's combs become covered in bees.  It seems the bees have an elegant and simple solution to substrate noise in the colony.    For the chemical composition hypothesis, we measure substrate compounds in colonies of three target colony sizes (small, large, extra large).  We also collected chemical compounds from the cuticle of the bees in these different colony sizes.  After describing which compounds were present, and at what concentration, we found no evidence for changes in chemical composition with colony size.  This includes the number of compounds, the concentration of those compounds, and their relative/absolute compositions.  We are still analyzing these data to confirm, but it appears that there is not a good cue of colony size within the chemical composition of honey bee colonies.    While we did reject both hypotheses, this research was incredibly valuable to undertake.  Both projects required strong collaboration between departments and research areas.  One has already resulted in a publication, and the other is forthcoming.  The Co-PI was able to present these findings at multiple conferences, both to beekeepers and to researchers.  The comb vibration work also attracted media attention (two written pieces, and one radio interview).  These activities are important both for the dissemination of research findings, but also for the training and development of the researchers.
