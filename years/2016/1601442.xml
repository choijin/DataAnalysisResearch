<AbstractNarration>Employers in the Texas Upper Gulf Coast region, like many areas of the United States, need highly qualified advanced technology employees to meet current and future workforce demand; however, they often find it difficult to find and hire sufficient number of engineering technology graduates technicians to meet their growing needs. This project at Galveston College (GC), a two-year Hispanic-serving community and technical college, is designed to advance desired societal outcomes through increased gainful employment for graduates and economic growth of employers.  The goal is to revamp the existing Electrical and Electronics (E/E) Program into an advanced E/E and Instrumentation Program (INT) that will produce highly qualified technicians able to meet current and future workforce demands while substantially increasing the employability of technical graduates from the college program. The disciplinary focus of the project is Engineering Technology with an emphasis on Electronics Technology. Project partners are members of the college Industry and Business Implementation Team (IBIT) and include government agencies, businesses, and industries such as Marathon Petroleum Corporation, Landrys Corporation, Pyramid Instrumentation, SpawGlass, City Electric, Economic Development Division of County of Galveston, and Galveston Independent School District. These partners typify stakeholders providing almost 3000 new E/E &amp; INT job opportunities within the next few years. The project will broaden opportunities for GC technician students, the majority who are from groups typically underrepresented in STEM technician fields, by supporting the social and financial investment needed to stimulate industry-academic partnerships and develop curriculum based on documented workforce needs. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The project will advance knowledge and understanding within community colleges of technician education by developing a revised Integrated Curriculum Framework for Technician Education (ICF-TE). The ICF-TE, adaptable to other technician education programs, will build industry-academic partnerships that result in increased interactions between students and employers, increased employability, and improvements in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) technician teaching and learning. It will adapt known strategies to support recruitment, retention, and completion of students; and create articulation agreements with area secondary schools. Critical components of the ICF-TE were established in coordination with the IBIT who will continue to assist with implementation and outreach. These critical components of the ICF-TE include: (1) industry recognized stacked certifications, (2) problem-based teaching and learning, (3) advanced technician skills training through progressive (stacked) modules, (4) work ethics curriculum, and (5) practical training with real-world work experiences. IBIT members will interact directly with students by providing opportunities for employment, supervision, mentoring, and instruction. The primary project focus is on the E/E Associate of Applied Science (AAS) degree and certificate students and associated faculty and administration. Secondary audiences are future STEM technician students recruited from area high schools and current workers seeking to advance their technician skills. The college will expand successful practices and instructional strategies learned from this project to the other STEM technical programs. An evaluation is designed to determine best practices in technician education to meet workforce needs.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Engineering Technology Instrumentation Project  Supported at Galveston College with grant funding from the National Science Foundation     Executive Summary     Purpose of the project was to advance knowledge and understanding within community colleges of technician education by providing a piloted and revised Integrated Curriculum Framework for Technician Education (ICF-TE) that results in increased interactions between students and employers, increased employability, and improvements in STEM technician teaching and learning.     Evaluation was utilization focused and collaborative with the project personnel who convened and documented interactions with the Industry-Business Implementation Team (IBIT), organized and documented marketing of the E/E&amp;I program, developed and conducted surveys and pre-and post-tests of students’ E/E&amp;I knowledge and skills, and used the information to guide project decision making. The external evaluator observed project activities, conducted nominal group interviews with students, and assembled data across years to provide this criterion-referenced summative evaluation report.  Key Results  IBIT investments in the ICF-TE E/E&amp;I program despite decreasing numbers of active IBIT members across project years. IBIT actively urged focus on work ethics, assisted project efforts to bring the classrooms and lab up to code for supporting intense hands-on experience, and indicated willingness to support real world work experience opportunities such as job shadowing, internships, and externships.     Enrollment in E/E&amp;I increased across the years and exceeded the target of at least 67 students impacted by the project. Students were mostly males of diverse ethnicities and primary languages, but there was notable growth in numbers of female students. The instrumentation path grew into an Associate degree program.     Participating students consistently averred via survey and in nominal group interviews that they had "gained important knowledge and skills" that helped them "to be ready for what a company expects from you." Nearly all who participated in the project’s course specific evaluation obtained higher scores on the post- than on the pre-test of technological knowledge.     Informal feedback from students about their success in the NCCER credentialling process included 5 who earned levels 2, 3, and 4 certificates for Instrumentation Academic Year 2019, 2 female students were known to have obtained certificates in Academic Year 2020 in E/E or I, and at least 5 were known to have obtained employment as Electrical or Instrumentation Technicians.     Project aspects where implementation or outcomes were less robust than expected were numbers of business-industry partners active in supporting the program and dissatisfaction with the work ethics curriculum that was adopted for integration into the courses.     Conclusions and Recommendations: Progress was made toward stated goals, and valuable outcomes were documented under each of four specific objectives identified in annual reports to the NSF. Areas for continued attention are strategies for widening partnerships with business-industry and perhaps accepting students’ recommendations that work ethics problem scenarios be set and facilitated by those partners.
