<AbstractNarration>Since 1997, the National Science Foundation (NSF) has required that all proposals submitted for funding explicitly address two review criteria: intellectual merit and broader impacts. Advances in both intellectual merit and broader impacts are essential if NSF is to achieve its mission "to advance the national health, prosperity, and welfare; to secure the national defense; and for other purposes." The two criteria are often considered separately in developing and reviewing projects. A conceptual framework for understanding the various dimensions of the two criteria and their potential synergy may lead to projects with greater societal value. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This conference will bring together leading faculty members in the field of Electrical Engineering to address the requirements and challenges associated with Broader Impacts activities in research grants funded by the Electrical, Communications and Cyber Systems (ECCS) Division of the Engineering Directorate of NSF. Participants of the workshop include faculty members, many of whom are current or past principal investigators of the ECCS division, as well as government and industry leaders in Electrical Engineering. The goals of the workshop are to: 1) delineate the economical and societal value of research and education activities in the fields of ECCS; 2) create meaningful metrics and incentives to assess and promote the Broader Impacts of EECS projects; and, 3) stimulate new thinking and institutional initiatives on Broader Impacts that can effectively enhance the human capital and societal value from the resources provided. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The outcome of the workshop will be a report that provides a clear roadmap, as well as consistent metric and incentives, to advance and catalyze Broader Impacts innovations in ECCS research. This report will be publically available and used for dissemination and outreach to research communities and various stakeholders, via presentations at professional meetings, social media, website and publication on relevant magazines.</AbstractNarration>
