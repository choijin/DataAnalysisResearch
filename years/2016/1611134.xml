<AbstractNarration>With support from the Chemical Measurement &amp; Imaging (CMI) and the Chemical Structure, Dynamics, &amp; Mechanisms - A (CSDM-A) Programs in the Division of Chemistry, Dr. Susumu Takahashi and his group at the University of Southern California are devising means of improving magnetic resonance (MR) techniques in order to enable application of these powerful characterization tools to study the structure and dynamics of biological molecules down to the level of single molecules.  Dr. Takahashi is also developing educational/training programs and materials that will help explain these methods and the chemistry they help to explain to USC graduate and undergraduate students, as well as to high school and elementary school students in USC's neighborhood community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Magnetic resonance spectrometry techniques, such as nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), can provide detailed information about molecular structure and dynamics, but are hampered by intrinsically low sensitivity.  Recent technological advances, particularly those utilizing a single nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond as a sensor, have enabled detection of a single electron spin.  Dr. Takahashi seeks to demonstrate MR analysis of a few molecules under physiological conditions using NV centers and high-frequency/high-field EPR.  Success in the research work will provide a promising pathway to enable EPR investigation of single biological molecules containing either native electron spin centers or extrinsic spin labels.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This project entails a research plan that integrates the development and application of a new magnetic resonance (MR) system with innovative inter-disciplinary educational and outreach activities centered at the Department of Chemistry at the University of Southern California (USC). The research activities focus on the demonstration and applications of MR analyses of biomolecules at the single-molecule level under physiological conditions. The educational activities focus on academic/training developments that will benefit USC graduate and undergraduate students, as well as high school and elementary school students in USC's neighborhood community with a high concentration of under-representative population. Through the research project, we developed a novel MR technique with single-molecule sensitivity by utilizing a quantum sensing technique. Our development spans from the development of quantum sensors in diamond to demonstration of high-resolution MR of a few spins at a high magnetic field. The MR technique developed by the project is applicable to various materials to improve the current sensitivity of MR analysis drastically.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The project provided valuable training to many Ph.D. and undergraduate students. Our graduate and undergraduate students gained hands-on research training and experiences that were beneficial for their career avenues in academia and high-tech industry - chemistry, biochemistry, laser, optics, microwave, semiconductors, computer, and biomedicine. During the project, three (one female and two male) graduate students graduated with their Ph.D. Among them, two students became research scientists in high-tech companies. One student became a teaching faculty at colleges in the Los Angeles area. In addition, five graduate students worked on the project, including one expected to graduate with her Ph.D. by the end of 2020. One master student and ten undergraduate students also obtained research training through this research project. Moreover, through the funding period, four high school students were hosted by the PI?s research laboratory to get experience in the research.&nbsp; From the results of the project, seven journal articles had been published, and one manuscript has been submitted for publication. Also, during the project, the PI gave fifteen seminars/invited talks. PI's students and PI gave thirteen contributed talks and twenty-eight poster presentations in scientific meetings.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Furthermore, the project supported a USC science outreach club (USC SCout). SCout provides STEM education to local elementary schools where the minority dominates their enrollment. The PI is a founding member of SCout and the only faculty advisor. SCout has implemented classroom science sessions at five elementary schools. The enrollment of USC students keeps increasing. SCout has ~200 USC student members currently. As a faculty advisor, the PI secured an on-campus storage space to store the experiment items and provided liquid nitrogen for the cryogenic demonstration (~20 sessions per year). The PI also oversees safety in their activities. SCout has never had safety indents in SCout activities since we started in 2011. The PI was also active in exploring financial support for SCout. SCout has successfully received financial supports from the USC Good Neighbors Grant Program every year since 2014.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 08/30/2020<br>      Modified by: Susumu&nbsp;Takahashi</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1611134/1611134_10454520_1598811308627_SCoutThankYouLetter1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1611134/1611134_10454520_1598811308627_SCoutThankYouLetter1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Thank you letter 1"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1611134/1611134_10454520_1598811308627_SCoutThankYouLetter1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Thank you letter 1"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Thank-you-letter for the SCout activities.
