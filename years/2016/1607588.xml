<AbstractNarration>This project is aimed at the development of new, non-standard computational tools for representing the interaction of poly-electronic atomic systems with ultra-short "attosecond" light pulses. These ultra-short pulses act like high speed cameras capable of imaging the motion of electrons within atoms and/or molecules. They accordingly provide a unique picture of the complex dynamics associated with electron motion, and may also provide an opportunity to control the outcome of ionization and other fragmentation processes, even within complex, highly-correlated materials. The severe computational challenge of representing the motion of electrons on such short time scales derives from the uncertainty principle, which indicates that atomic and/or molecular states spanning a broad energy range will need to be accurately described, including high energy states in which two or more electrons are simultaneously excited. The project should accordingly shed light on the role of multiply-excited states in fragmentation processes induced by the absorption of attosecond radiation pulses. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The theoretical description of the dynamical regimes triggered in atoms by ultrashort laser pulses is challenging because it entails the representation of several electronic states, across a wide energy range, that decay by emitting photoelectrons. The electrons liberated to the continuum interact strongly with the parent ion they leave behind, as well as with the dressing laser pulses commonly employed in attosecond pump-probe experiments. To tackle these difficulties, this project will merge parallel simulation techniques for the time-dependent Schrodinger equation of general poly-electronic atoms in the presence of arbitrary external fields, with state-of-the-art numerical methods to compute stationary bound states, multichannel single-ionization scattering atomic functions, and Siegert states, represented in terms of a multi-configuration Hartree Fock B-spline close-coupling approach. The numerical tools developed in the project will be applied to study unexplored aspects of driven multi-electron attosecond dynamics in rare gas atoms, with a special focus on the role of autoionizing states, which constitute the best approximation of a persistent reference onto which building coherent-control schemes for photo-fragmentation processes. In particular, the project will explore the creation, imaging and tailoring of transiently bound wavepackets, by means of both optical and photoelectron attosecond interferometric pump-probe schemes. The project will study how transient coherences can be used to control branching ratios, angular distributions, and residual-ion coherence in photoionization events. Properties of laser-driven autoionizing states, such as their ac-Stark shift, their tunnelling rate, and the electric susceptibility of dressed atoms in the extreme ultraviolet (XUV) range, will be charted. The affect of electron correlation on these properties will be studied, and this information will be used to help control population transfer within the system as well as the spectrum and shape of the XUV light transmitted through the target.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Atoms, the basic constituents of matter, can exchange energy by absorbing and emitting light. The energy boost, or atomic excitation, is due to a rearrangement of its electrons: away from the nucleus, to which they are attracted, and away from each other, which reduces their mutual repulsion. It is the balance between these attractive and repulsive forces that determines whether an excited atom is stable or if, like a Jenga tower, it will collapse under its own weight. The absorption of energetic electromagnetic radiation such as x-rays almost invariably causes atoms to break up, emitting one or more electrons. Such excitation and relaxation processes have paramount technological and scientific significance. On a practical level, they are at the basis of many energy- and charge-transfer processes in nature. On a more fundamental level, they depend on the relative motion of multiple electrons and nuclei, the ultimate constituents of ordinary matter, which is only partly understood due to its chaotic character. Until twenty years ago, following electronic motion in atoms in real time was impossible, on account of the small size of atoms and to the fantastically short timescale at which electron moves. The ejection of an electron, for example, can take anywhere between few tens and few hundred attoseconds, where one attosecond is one billionth of a billionth of a second, nor could a single emission process be observed in isolation with sufficient accuracy. The discovery in the 1990?s of high-harmonic generation, a process by which atoms invested by intense pulses of infrared light emit isolated flashes of x-ray radiation with a duration as short as few tens of attoseconds, changed everything. By the turn of the century, it became possible to engineer sources of ultrashort x-ray laser pulses that beat the size and time limits of electronic motion. Laser pulses are a highly collimated electromagnetic shock waves whose front invests millions of identical atoms in the same way and at the same time, thus resulting in a collective response that multiplies by orders of magnitude that of a single atom. Furthermore, thanks to their short duration, a sequence of attosecond pulses is able to record multiple snapshots of the moving electrons as they evolve after an initial excitation event, like a stroboscope.</p> <p>The goal of the present NSF project was to develop new computational tools to predict the reaction of atoms to such ultrashort laser pulses, thus guiding and interpreting the new attosecond experiments as a GPS and satellite images guide ships across uncharted seas. In the process, the project would train undergraduate and graduate students in the intricate art of quantum mechanics, code construction, and scientific communication. It would also support participation to scientific events of national relevance, and promote collaboration with other research groups active within and without the United States. A foremost outcome is NewStock, a suite of computer programs that can reproduce with high accuracy how excited states of complex atoms break up in fragments in the presence of intense light, and predict both the angular and energy distribution of the fragments (attosecond photoelectron interferometry) as well as the spectral properties of the light transmitted through the sample (attosecond transient-absorption spectroscopy). The program has allowed us to reproduce with unprecedented accuracy the properties of metastable states in atoms, and to explore, with the help of semi-analytical models and other ad-hoc programs, several aspects of attosecond spectroscopy. In particular, on the phenomenological side: We have accurately reproduced the resonant features in the two-photon photoelectron spectrum of argon; We have demonstrated and characterized autoionizing polaritons, entangled states of radiation and matter subject to controllable decay; We have proposed two different spectroscopies, codenames 1-2 RABBIT and CHIP, to reconstruct in time the collapse of autoionizing states without the distorting effect of infrared pulses; We have characterized and controlled the polarization of the excited ions emerging from the ionization of the helium atom; We have clarified the role of infrared probes in distorting the temporal distribution of electrons once they are ejected from but are still under the influence of their original atom. The program has directly supported two Ph.D. students who are expected to defend their thesis by 2021, and two undergraduate students, one of which has has been accepted in the graduate program at UC Boulder. The program has also indirectly supported the progress of the research of three other graduate students visiting from other collaborating groups, one postdoctoral fellow, now assistant professor at a US State University, and four different experimental groups, two in the United States, and two in Europe. In four years, the project has resulted in more than 15 peer reviewed papers, and almost 40 contributions to congresses, between posters, and contributed and invited talks. By all accounts, therefore, the project has accomplished its goals.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 12/29/2020<br>      Modified by: Luca&nbsp;Argenti</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1607588/1607588_10457429_1609275546824_ScreenShot2020-12-29at11.20.51AM--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1607588/1607588_10457429_1609275546824_ScreenShot2020-12-29at11.20.51AM--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Formation of autoionizing polaritons"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1607588/1607588_10457429_1609275546824_ScreenShot2020-12-29at11.20.51AM--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Formation of autoionizing polaritons"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">The avoided crossing between the bright 3s-1 4p state of argon and several light-induced states, as a function of the laser-dressing frequency, gives rise to autoionizing polaritons, which exhibit stabilization due to the destructive  interference of their radiative and Auger decay channels.</div> <div class="imageCredit">L.
