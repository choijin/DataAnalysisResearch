<AbstractNarration>Agriculture is the dominant land use under direct management by people, and it is one of the biggest agents of global change, with far-reaching impacts on human welfare and the environment. The application of ecological knowledge to improve sustainable agricultural ecosystems remains a recognized grand challenge for environmental science.  Since 1988, research at the W.K. Kellogg Biological Station (KBS) LTER has addressed this challenge for row-crop ecosystems and landscapes, by seeking to understand the fundamental ecological underpinnings of these highly managed ecosystems and to reveal ways that ecological knowledge can enhance the long-term sustainability of production agriculture. This renewal award builds on past work to launch an effort to better understand the long-term stability of key ecosystem services afforded by agriculture, with an emphasis on three major drivers: climate change, changes in the science of land management for crop production, and invasive species.  Proposed research bears directly on agricultural and environmental management and policies at scales ranging from local to global. The study of agricultural systems also informs ecology because few other ecosystems have such a degree of simplification and control of major environmental drivers.  Training graduate students and postdocs is an important component of this project, as is providing research experiences for undergraduates. KBS scientists also will continue to work with K-12 science teachers through an established partnership with 11 nearby school districts. Outreach and extension activities will reach a broad community of stakeholders, and will include a new emphasis on farmers and those who influence farmer decisions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The major scientific foci of the KBS LTER are vulnerability and resilience of cropping systems to drivers of change, and how ecological theory can help design more sustainable crop production.  Two overarching questions motivate the research: 1) How do changing environmental drivers affect the resilience of key ecosystem services including crop yield and profitability as well as environmental and socioecological benefits, and 2) To what extent can ecological knowledge help maintain the robust and reliable delivery of these services?  Key ecosystem services include crop yield but also extend more broadly to climate stabilization (greenhouse gas emissions), water quality (eutrophication), pest suppression (insect herbivory and predation), and soil fertility (plant-microbe-soil interactions).  Knowledge gaps identified from research to date will be addressed with new research lines that include rainfall manipulation experiments, watershed observations, and examinations of rapid evolution of plant-microorganism associations, predator-prey dynamics newly influenced by invasive species and novel pesticides, and long-term changes in farmer attitudes and behaviors.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Since 1987 we have pursued a better long-term understanding of the ecology of intensive row-crop agriculture typical of the US Midwest with its huge impact on human and environmental welfare. In this research we have integrated experimental studies and long-term observations to reveal ways to use ecological knowledge to better manage annual and perennial field crops in order to make US agriculture more productive and sustainable. We have discovered ways that ecological knowledge can advance both crop productivity and environmental goals:</p> <p>1) High crop yields are an important aspect of sustainability. We tested how ecological management can substitute for synthetic chemical inputs in high productivity corn, soybean, and wheat crops. We managed these crops in four different ways, ranging from conventional to organic. By not disturbing the soil, our no-till crops yielded 10-20% more than the conventional crops that were tilled. A reduced input system, with only 1/3 of conventional chemical inputs, yielded as much as the conventional system. The organic system had equivalent soybean but lower corn and wheat yields. Results show that management based on ecology?instead of relying solely on chemical inputs?can provide high yields.</p> <p>2) Agriculture can contribute substantially to global greenhouse gas mitigation. By measuring the greenhouse gases CO<sub>2</sub>, nitrous oxide, and methane from annual, perennial, and natural ecosystems we were able to evaluate the potential for different crops and farming practices to produce or consume greenhouse gases. We found that the way we farm annual crops such as corn, soybean, and wheat makes a tremendous difference on agriculture?s climate impact. We also found that perennial crops grown as feedstock for cellulosic biofuels can be extremely mitigating when managed appropriately.</p> <p>3) Healthy soils are key for attaining crop production and environmental stewardship goals. The soils under our annual crops grown without tillage had ~20% more carbon (organic matter) than did the conventional system with normal tillage. This higher level of carbon increased the soil?s ability to hold water and deliver nutrients to the crops. This was particularly important in drought years such as 2012, when conventional yields decreased by 50% and no-till yields by only 25%. Belowground, we discovered that long-term use of nitrogen fertilizers accelerated the evolution of beneficial soil microbes (rhizobium bacteria) that supply nitrogen to plants like soybeans, making the microbes less effective nitrogen providers. Rapid evolution was aided by horizontal gene transfer in soil and point mutations.</p> <p>4) Understanding how agriculture affects the quality and quantity of water is important for environmental and human health. We measured the amount of nitrate flowing from our different annual and perennial crops. We found that organic and low-input management of corn, soybean and wheat reduced nitrogen pollution to groundwater. We were also surprised to find that water use was not different between various annual and perennial crops or vegetation types, which suggests that water dynamics across Midwest landscapes will not change much with different crops or climate variability.</p> <p>5) In agricultural landscapes, plant and landscape diversity helps to control unwanted pests, provide sufficient pollination, and enhance soil health. By examining landscape level plant-insect dynamics, we discovered how the diversity of plants surrounding crop fields enhances habitat for predators of agricultural pests. Across the upper Midwest, we documented how beneficial ladybeetles that consume soybean aphids helped to reduce pesticide use and averted pesticide expense and yield losses worth millions of dollars annually. We also found that non-native, invasive ladybeetles were just as able to suppress the aphids. This highlights the importance of landscape-level research to help manage crops more sustainably.</p> <p>6) There are many barriers to adoption of sustainable farming practices, farmer cost being one. Increasingly society is willing to pay farmers to protect our natural resources. Our research revealed that farmers would accept low payments to provide environmental benefits that they valued, such as building soil organic matter and reducing nitrogen pollution to groundwater.
