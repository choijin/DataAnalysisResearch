<AbstractNarration>Understanding how behavior emerges from the dynamic patterns of electrical and chemical activity of brain circuits is universally recognized as a fundamental mystery in science. Furthermore, better knowledge of healthy brain function has broad societal implications by laying the groundwork for advancing treatments for neurological disorders and for developing brain-inspired technologies. Various brain research efforts around the globe have embraced this scientific grand challenge. This meeting brings together US and international brain researchers to discuss the need for coordinating brain research efforts around the globe, the bottlenecks and challenges that stand in the way and strategies to overcome these. A particular focus of the meeting is on cyberinfrastructure and data resources needed to further enhance collaboration and analysis of disparate streams of neuroscience data. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Organizers are making a strong effort to invite women and members of underrepresented groups as participants. Further, the meeting entails extensive cross-disciplinary interactions, which will be aided greatly by the face-to-face nature of this meeting. To maximize the workshop's impact, a white paper summarizing the discussion will be published at a high-profile venue.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  This award enabled us to organize three different workshops for coordinating brain research around the globe. The first, http://brainx.io/, hosted 60+ scientists and 15+ observers from national, private, and foundation organizations.  It identified three challenges (described in more detail at F1000 Research):    What makes our brain unique? This project would generate a highly multimodal dataset that would yield multiscale brain maps from multiple species and disease models.   How does the the brain solve complex computational problems? This challenge led to the development of the "International Brain Laboratory"), which is a collaborative effort between experimental and theoretical neuroscientists collaborating to understand brainwide circuits for complex behavior (see whitepape, An International Laboratory for Systems and Computational Neuroscience   How can we augment clinical decision-making to prevent disease and restore brain function?  This requires an all-purpose computational platform that addresses the needs of clinical data, including privacy.   Finally, we agreed for the need for a universal resource, which we called the "Internation Brain Station".  This resource was described in detail in a Neuron NeuroView, To the Cloud! A Grassroots Proposal to Accelerate Brain Science Discovery.   Our first event was covered by MIT Technology Review, Science, and Nature. It led to a second event, hosted alongside the United Nations General Assembly, and culminated with an announcement by the state department launching the international brain initiative with the International Brain Station. It also led to the founding of a company, Gigantum, dedicated to lowering the barrier for scientific collaborations.    The second event, https://brainx2.io/, brought together developers from academia, industry, and non-profits, to codify various collaborations to build several of the components required to address the three challenges. A progress report summarizes several of the key accomplishments at that workshop.  It also led to a Nature Methods peer-reviewed correspondence, characterizing the state of our Community-Developed Open Source Computational Ecosystem for Big Neuro Data, and a Toolbox description of the work in Nature.   The third event, https://brainx3.io/, further focused on reproducability, and engaged more developers from companies than the previous events.  This event led to several teams committing to adopting more reproducible practices, and several companies agreeing to work together more explicitly to support reproducability of the entire scientific workflow.     The overall conclusion from the set of events is that working together in multi-disciplinary cross-sector teams has been the most effective tactic thus far for developing widely adopted tools that set the standard for further development and adoption.
