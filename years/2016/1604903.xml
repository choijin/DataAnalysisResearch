<AbstractNarration>PI:  Schultz, William&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: 1604903&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal is based upon the hypothesis that health is reflected by changes in biological fluids, most important and accessible of which is saliva, and these changes affect the rheological properties of biofluids. This hypothesis further stipulates that rheological characterization of saliva, and quantification of its properties, can provide information about a person's health. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Saliva rheology is similar to that of water, making measuring non-Newtonian properties difficult. Capillary Break-up Rheometry (CBR) is commonly used to determine extensional parameters of such fluids. It is proposed to re-examine CBR foundations with differential one-dimensional models to eliminate the large correction factors required when measuring the radius-thinning rate at the filament midpoint. Unlike previous methods, new analysis recognizes curvature gradients that drive the flow and therefore the free surface profile evolution is required to accurately determine extensional properties. This analysis is consistent with filament evolution all the way through beads-on-a-string formation that they have been observed in Newtonian and preliminary saliva demonstrations. Next the spatially-varying surface tension in Newtonian analysis is used to study the role of surfactants in filament dynamics as well as the more prominent extensional viscoelastic properties of long-chained molecules (such as mucins) or by surfactants (such as in soap films) that could be interpreted as stickiness. Unlike saliva viscoelasticity, the role of surface activity in saliva filament formation and its implications on health diagnosis have not yet been considered. Characterizing saliva rheological properties could guide the development of more effective saliva substitutes, stimulants, and hydrating liquids for xerostomia or dysphagia. The co-PIs will collaborate with U. Ghana Biomedical Engineering Department to study dysphagia problems prevalent in local populations. Techniques developed through this project can help to characterize other biological and industrial fluids. There are also plans to engage in activities to promote women in engineering including educational outreach to over 200 4th through 6th grade girls through the University of Michigan FEMMES program and involving undergraduate women in research.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project has primarily focused on the flow properties of biological fluids. In particular, we were interested in quantifying "sticky saliva" (a medical term indicating viscous stringy saliva), that is associated with poor health outcomes including gingivitis, dental carries and in particular aspiration pneumonia. Sticky saliva can form strings that can be aspirated into the lungs and cause pneumonia.  These fluids of relatively low viscosity are commonly studied by capillary breakup rhecometry (CBR) involving stretching a string of fluid until it breaks in two.  We have developed a similar procedure that much more accurately determines viscosity and requires fewer assumptions.  This new procedure measures the surface curvature near where breakup occurs. However, this measurement of the smooth surface curvature is made challenging by interpretation of pixelated images. An improved edge detection method, a carefully chosen finite difference stencil, and a rather slow stretch gives a much more accurate viscosity measurement than standard CBR.   Our new method no longer requires breakup, allowing various stretch schemes (including oscillation) that facilitate measurement of viscoelastic and surfactant effects. These effects are the subject of ongoing research.  We also included a preliminary study    of urinary reflux. where urine flows backward from the bladder to the kidneys through the ureter.  This was primarily supported by internal university funding. Urinary reflux is a serious condition occuring most commonly in pediatric patients. It leads to urinary tract infections with possible loss of kidneys.

We are starting to examine the effects of peristalsis (the pulsating of tubes) on reflux and how it may aid urinary incontinence and cardiac assist devices.  This funding has provided the primary financial support for two PhD students, one having graduated and the other within nine months of graduation.  It has also aided the PI in advising another PhD student and a postdoctoral fellow studying urinary reflux.       Last Modified: 12/31/2020       Submitted by: William W Schultz]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
