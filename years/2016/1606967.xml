<AbstractNarration>Topological data analysis (TDA) is a relatively new branch of statistics whose goal is to apply topology to develop tools for studying the coarse-scale, global, non-linear, geometric features of data. Persistent homology, the most widely studied tool for TDA, has been applied to many areas of science and engineering, including image processing, time series data in biological systems, and sensor networks. Persistent homology yields invariants of data, called barcodes, by associating to the data a sequence of nested topological spaces called a filtration, and then applying standard topological and algebraic constructions. However, for many data sets of interest, such as point cloud data with noise or non-uniformities in density, a single filtration is not rich enough to encode the structure of interest in the data. This motivates the consideration of multidimensional persistent homology, which associates to the data a topological space simultaneously equipped with two or more filtrations. Multi-D persistent homology yields algebraic invariants of data far more complex than in the 1-D setting. New methodology is thus required for working with these invariants in practice. The goal of this project is to introduce such methodology in the 2-D setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specifically, this project is to develop algorithms and design practical software tools that extend the usual persistent homology methodology for exploratory data analysis to the 2-D setting. The proposed tools provide an interactive visualization of the barcodes of the restriction of a 2-D persistence module to affine 1-D lines. At the heart of the computational approach is a novel data structure, based on planar line arrangements, on which one can perform fast queries for these barcodes. The tools also provide a visualization of the multi-graded Betti numbers of a 2-D persistence module. It is proposed to apply the tools to the study of scientific data - especially data arising from biological systems - in much the same way that ordinary persistent homology has been applied to the study of data over the last ten to fifteen years. This project will intend to establish statistical foundations for the corresponding methodology.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   The goals of this project were to design and implement a practical software tool, RIVET, for the visualization and analysis of 2-parameter persistent homology, and to develop the required  mathematical and algorithmic foundations for this.  Officially released in 2018, RIVET allows data scientists to compute and visualize two-parameter persistence modules arising from real-world data.  RIVET is available at https://github.com/rivetTDA.  It is open-source software, and also the first publicly available software for working with 2-parameter persistent homology.  It consists of a substantial computational back-end and a user-friendly graphical interface.  APIs for RIVET written in the Python and Rust languages have also been developed. As of this writing, 11 people have made contributions to the RIVET code, including eight students and junior research assistants.  In addition, the project has also provided research experiences for five other undergraduate students, who worked on data analysis, and (in one case) the development of  benchmarks. RIVET was initially designed with interactive visualization foremost in mind, and this continues to be a central focus. But RIVET also provides functionality for two-parameter persistence computation that should be useful for other purposes. The basic idea of 2-parameter persistent homology is as follows: Given a data set (for example, a point cloud in Euclidean space), one constructs a 2-parameter family of simplicial complexes, called a bifiltration, whose topological structure captures some geometric structure of interest about the data. For example, the bifiltration may encode information about the presence of clusters, holes, or tendrils in the data. Applying simplicial homology to the bifiltration gives a diagram of vector spaces called a bipersistence module, which algebraically encodes information about the topological structure of the bifiltration. In contrast to the 1-parameter case, bipersistence modules can have very delicate algebraic structure. As a result, there is (in a sense that can be made precise) no good definition of a barcode for bipersistence modules. Nevertheless, one can define invariants of bipersistence modules that capture aspects of their structure relevant for data analysis. RIVET computes and visualizes three such invariants: the Hilbert function, the bigraded Betti numbers, and the fibered barcode. The fibered barcode is a parameterized family of barcodes obtained by restricting a bipersistence module to various lines in parameter space. A key feature of RIVET is that it computes a data structure called the augmented arrangement, on which fast queries of these barcodes can be performed. These queries are used by RIVET?s GUI to provide an interactive visualization of the fibered barcode. RIVET also computes minimal presentations of bipersistence modules. These are specifications of the full algebraic structure of a persistence module which are as small as possible, in a certain sense. Those who wish to study invariants of 2-parameter persistent homology not computed by RIVET may find it useful to take the minimal presentations output by RIVET as a starting point. In practice, when working with real data, these presentations are often surprisingly small. The design and development of RIVET has gone hand in hand with substantial work on mathematical and algorithmic foundations for the software.  In particular, we have developed novel, efficient algorithms for computing minimal presentations, the bigraded Betti numbers, and the Hilbert function of large two-parameter persistence modules that arise in topological data analysis.  We have also developed efficient algorithms to compute the augmented arrangement described above. Many of the mathematical and algorithmic ideas behind RIVET are explained in detail in the papers Interactive Visualization of 2-D Persistence Modules and Computing Minimal Presentations and Betti Numbers of 2-Parameter Persistent Homology.  RIVET is also accompanied by online documentation, which provides an accessible introduction to the software and to some of the basic mathematical ideas.  An application of RIVET to virtual screening is described in the paper Persistent Homology for Virtual Screening.  Additional papers describing other aspects of RIVET are in preparation. This award also supported a workshop to train young researchers in multiparameter persistence, which occurred August 13-15, 2018, in Minneapolis. The workshop presented a cohesive introduction to two-parameter persistence, with a goal of equipping attendees to use two-parameter persistence in their own research. Fifty-four people participated in the conference, including nine who presented talks.  While our primary efforts in this first phase of the project have been towards the development of scalable, user-friendly software, we have also applied RIVET to computational chemistry data, neuroscience data, and network data.  RIVET remains in active development; ongoing and future will focus on further optimizations of RIVET's algorithms (especially minimal presentation computation), refinements to the user interface, statistical foundations, and further applications to scientific data.
