<AbstractNarration>The High Performance Distributed Computing (HPDC)conference seeks to increase student participation in the symposium as well as the field in general. HPDC is the premier forum for presenting the latest research findings on the design and use of parallel and distributed systems for high end computing, collaboration, data analysis, and other innovative applications. Student will have the opportunity to mix with premier researchers from leading institutions, national labs, vendors, and user communities in the field of high performance distributed computing. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The award suppots the travel of eligible US students to this year's symposium in Kyoto, Japan.
