<AbstractNarration>Landslides are a natural hazard that can potentially damage infrastructure and cause loss of life. Some landslides are rapid and catastrophic, occurring over periods of seconds to minutes. Others are sluggish, sometimes moving only millimeters per year and only when activated by rain. Over years to centuries, these slow-moving landslides, also known as earthflows, can contaminate waterbodies with sediment and damage dams and other types of civil infrastructure. This project will examine a long dormant earthflow in California that is expected to move this winter as a result of the coming El Nino that meteorologists are predicting. The data collected may lead in the future to the ability to predict the conditions that result in earthflow movement. This knowledge could be useful for construction and management of civil infrastructure. In addition, this project will provide training to a Native American Ph.D. student. The project results will be shared with a public utility commission to inform their management decisions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will use new measurements from a continuous Ground-Penetrating Radar (GPS) station and a shallow groundwater monitoring network in combination with an existing network of 40 established benchmarks on the Oakridge earthflow near San Jose, CA, to test the Principal Investigator's hypothesis for the physical process that regulates the deformation of earthflows and prevents them from failing catastrophically. The proposal addresses the lack of transport laws for predicting landslide motion, identified as a key knowledge gap in the 2010 National Research Council report "Landscapes on the Edge". Given the possibility that the coming El Nino event may be among the strongest ever recorded, this project offers a unique, time-sensitive opportunity to examine widespread landslide activity.</AbstractNarration>

Some landslides are rapid and catastrophic, occurring over periods of seconds to minutes. Others are sluggish, sometimes moving only millimeters per year and only when activated by rain. Over years to centuries, these slow-moving landslides, also known as earthflows, can contaminate waterbodies with sediment and damage dams and other types of civil infrastructure. Whether slow versus catastrophic deformation occurs is fundamental to predicting landslide hazard and landscape evolution in mountainous regions.   This project examined an earthflow in California during the 2015-2016 El Nino in order to explore processes that regulate the motion of slow moving landslides. Specifically, the project tested two hypotheses related to the coupling of deformational and hydrological processes in slow-moving landslides.  Intellectual Merits  1. The Bathtub Hypothesis.   Observations at several sites in the western United States indicate that the persistent movement of earthflows may be aided by the reduction in hydraulic conductivity that occurs in the basal and lateral shear zones of landslides. Entrapment of water in the landslide mass by low hydraulic conductivity shear boundaries should sustain high pore fluid pressures within the slide mass, making it more poised for future failure compared to well drained hillslopes. Equally significant, sealing of the boundaries of a landslide should suppress vertical drainage through the landslide and hence encourage seepage forces that are parallel to the basal slide plane of the landslide, which is a relatively less stable orientation for groundwater flow from the perspective of landslide triggering. The conductivity changes induced by shear deformation, combined with strain-weakening of landslide margins that accompanies sliding, together represent a potent potential positive feedback on landslide deformation that is referred to as the ?bathtub? model'.  2. The Dilatant Strengthening Hypothesis  While the ?bathtub? model helps to explain how earthflows might recur at the same location over time by trapping water, it does not address the ability of earthflows to maintain relatively low velocities for long periods of time without failing catastrophically. It has been proposed that soil dilation during landslide shear deformation, which causes pore-water pressure to drop and friction to rise, can provide a strong negative feedback on slide motion.   We installed a continuous GPS station, two shallow wells (to monitor groundwater pressure), and a weather station on Oak Ridge earthflow near San Jose, CA.  In addition, we analyzed historical air photo records, vegetation greenness (a proxy for soil moisture) and performed a field survey of active slide displacement as recorded by a fence line that crosses the slide. How the results of each of these measurements informed the project hypotheses is discussed below.    Bathtub Hypothesis.  A  ~ 20-fold longer response time of a well within the lateral shear margin of the landslide relative to the interior is consistent with a ~20-fold decrease in the hydraulic conductivity within the shear margin relative to the interior.  This result supports the bathtub model in that the highly sheared lateral margins of the landslide have much lower apparent hydraulic conductivity compared to the relatively unsheared landslide interior.  Our greenness analysis provides independent support for this interpretation. During 2005-2006, when Oak Ridge earthflow was most active between 2003-2014, we observe that Oak Ridge earthflow exhibits a significant elevation of spectral greenness over its surroundings and that this signal adheres closely to the morphological boundaries of the landslide. Moreover, our own field observations show that seeps and standing water appeared on the surface of the earthflow shortly after the onset of precipitation in the winter of 2015-2016, suggesting the water table within the landslide was near the surface at the start of the rainy season despite 3-years of drought that preceded this wet season. Thus, taken together our analyses and observations support a co-evolution of landslide deformation and groundwater drainage on the earthflow that is consistent with the bathtub model.  Dilatant Strengthening Hypothesis  The vertical GPS data showed an apparent ~ 1 cm dilation of the earthflow mass that occurred during a ~ 2 week period of accelerated landslide motion. This observation provides, to our knowledge, the first direct measurement of dilation associated with the acceleration of a slow moving landslide. Consequently, our preliminary GPS observations provide both important field support for dilatent strengthening.   Broader Impacts  The data collected for this project provided important constraints on sediment loading to one of the principle reservoirs operated by the San Francisco Public Utility Commision. In addition, the results of the project provided important constraints on landslide hazards posed to the Calaveras Dam, which impounds the reservoir. This knowledge will be useful for construction and management of civil infrastructure associated with the reservoir. In addition, this project provided training to a Native American Ph.D. student.        Last Modified: 04/19/2017       Submitted by: Noah Finnegan]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
