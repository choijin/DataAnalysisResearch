<AbstractNarration>Phosphorus (P) has been shown to limit a number of fundamental ecosystem processes in a wide range of ecosystems. Despite its importance, however, most Earth system models do not currently include any aspect of the P cycle. This hinders the utility of these models for generating and testing hypotheses and for forecasting the effects of global change. Importantly, a critical challenge for P modeling efforts is also a critical challenge for the scientific community as a whole; namely, determining a way forward for improving our understanding of the key drivers, processes, and global change responses of the P cycle. Bringing together P experts will address this need through a more synthetic understanding and conceptualization of P cycle dynamics, integration of varied P-related data, improved process-based modeling of the P cycle, and P data-model integration. Another potential advance stems from the power of explicit collaborations between empiricists who study P cycling and modelers considering the inclusion of P in a range of different models. The workshop will include scientists at all career stages including students and postdocs, as well as participants from underrepresented groups. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Workshop participants will represent diverse theoretical, empirical, and numerical modeling perspectives that are critical for improving our understanding of the terrestrial P cycle in the context of global change. The meeting will include experts that span a variety of research perspectives and methods and is expected to have five outcomes: 1) an improved understanding of terrestrial P cycling from varied assessments; 2) synthesized datasets that will be publicly available for analysis and modeling; 3) a meeting report that will be submitted for publication in a peer-reviewed journal and a complementary set of data-based papers; 4) a set of plans for collaborative research projects and grants to identify approaches to obtain the knowledge necessary for improved understanding in critical areas; and 5) a network of individuals dedicated to fostering cross-disciplinary approaches to P research.</AbstractNarration>
