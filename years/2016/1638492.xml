<AbstractNarration>1638492-Wei&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NSF has made an award in support of travel and registration fees for undergraduate students, graduate students, post-docs, and under-represented, female and junior faculty to attend and present at the symposium on "Biomaterials for Tissue Regeneration" at the Fall Materials Research Society (MRS) national meeting in Boston, MA, November 28-30, 2016. The symposium will address recent advances in the development of biomaterials used for regenerative medicine.  Topics to be addressed include: 1) delivery of bioagents to promote tissue regeneration; 2) biomaterials as cell delivery vehicles; 3) biomaterials as tissue engineering scaffolds; 4) biomaterials to modulate immune responses; 5) evaluation of biomaterials for in vivo applications; 6) biomaterial design to influence cell interactions; 7) high throughput biomaterial screening and testing for regenerative medicine; 8) novel imaging techniques for studies of biomaterial-cell interactions; and 9) commercialization of biomaterials for regenerative medicine. Though in depth discussions will consider tissue engineering scaffolds, stem cells, and growth factors, the focus will be on scaffolds and improving scaffold design and development and their in vitro and in vivo performance.  Broader impact will be achieved with a larger attendance by graduate students, postdoc researchers, and junior faculty, especially from the under-represented groups made possible by the availability of NSF funding.  The organizing committee will select high-quality student and post-doctoral contributions during abstract review.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The purpose of Symposium BM3 on Biomaterials for Regenerative Medicine was to bring together the researchers from around the world working on different biomaterials for varied applications that are critical to the further scientific and technological advancement of the field of regenerative medicine.  Although technical advances have been made in this field, only a few tissue-engineered products are commercially available and approved for clinical use, namely engineered skin.  This limited success is in part due to our current lack of understanding of the regenerative process in native tissues, the complexity of the 3D environment, and our ability to identify and recapitulate the appropriate cues that promote functional cellular and tissue growth.  Therefore, there clearly exists a need to bring together a diverse group of scientists and engineers to help address thse current hurdles and advance the field.  The symposium hosted a number of sessions based on topics that are at the forefront of tissue engineering including Advances in Biomaterial Design, Smart Biomaterials, Biomaterials for Soft Tissue Regeneration, Biomaterials for Musculosketal Tissue Regeneratoin, and Future of Tissue Engineering.  All talks were well received and provoked critical discussion and collaboration among academics, clinicians, and industry.  Great emphasis was placed on optimizing the platform of 3D printing for biomaterials design.  The symposium successfully served a vital role in highlighting some of the leading global research and trends in the design of biomaterials for regenerative medicine.  Funding from NSF was used for the support of graduate students and junior and female faculty attending the symposium, many of whom gave outstanding presentations.
