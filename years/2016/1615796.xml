<AbstractNarration>Blazars are the ultra-luminous, highly-variable hearts of galaxies.  Physicians have tools to study how the human heart varies, and that variability is used to understand how the heart works.  Similarly, astronomers have tools to study how blazars vary, and that variability is used to understand how blazars work.  The team will use telescopes in Arizona to observe blazars at optical wavelengths.  They will look for minute-to-minute changes in the blazars' brightness and polarization.  They will also look for night-to-night changes in the blazars' emission lines.  These changes will be compared to predictions from the team's models.  Senior team members will train junior members.  Navajo-Hopi students from Arizona schools will visit the telescopes.  While there, they will be able to witness the changes in the blazars.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The team will investigate the physical processes responsible for blazars' time variability.  The team's goals are to use observations and models to examine (1) if particles are accelerated via shocks or magnetic reconnection; (2) if very rapid variability on parsec scales is caused by turbulence or magnetic reconnection; and (3) if gamma-rays can be generated on parsec scales via the seed photons from nearby emission-line gas.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Intellectual Merit:</p> <p>The project involved observational and theoretical studies of a type of active galactic nucleus (AGN) called "blazars." In an AGN, a black hole with mass between about 1 million and 10 billion times the Sun's mass resides at the center of a galaxy and actively accretes gaseous matter from its surroundings. The gas orbits the black hole but also gradually falls toward it, becoming so hot that the atoms lose some of their electrons to become ionized. Magnetic fields are mixed with the ionized gas to form a state of matter called a "plasma." As the plasma falls toward the black hole's event horizon, it swirls around the black hole, twisting the magnetic fields into a spiral pattern. As is the case for a twisted wire, this causes a spring-like action that ejects jets of high-energy particles and magnetic fields in opposite directions along the rotational poles of the system. (The rest of the plasma falls into the black hole.) The plasma is propelled down the jet at nearly light speed. If one of the jets points within a few degree of our line of sight, we see the blazar phenomenon. The near-light speed causes the light from the plasma to be beamed into our direction and creates the illusion that events happen faster than is actually the case.
