<AbstractNarration>Scientific discovery is a collective process based on collaboration, assessment and consensus. But the enormous expansion of scientific research makes it difficult to tell which intellectual efforts forge collective advances.  Better models for identifying and tracking scientific movements from the vast collections of articles, books, grants, and patents that compromise scientific and academic work is crucial to improving our nation's ability to make advances in science and industry, helping policy makers, funding agencies, and venture capitalists as well as scientists and scholars themselves.  Our project studies innovation by collecting and analyzing texts in vast collections of scientific and other scholarly articles, books, grants and patents. By looking at the subtle patterns of language and how they change over time, we can describe and predict where and when collective trends of knowledge innovation emerge and decline; which scientific ideas and movements result in translational knowledge key to industry and health care; and what the key drivers are for such collective intellectual movements.  This work is helping identify where the potential is greatest for innovation, which fields are most primed and receptive to the arrival of new discoveries, and the times and places where resources have the greatest influence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is based on a large dataset of texts the researchers have compiled on US research activity from 1990-2016, including scientific articles, grants, and patents, and by disambiguating and linking mentions of individual people across these datasets.  This project uses topic modeling and other natural language processing algorithms to identify distinct intellectual movements in these corpora by drawing on the sub-languages that characterize them, also applying methods to validate and evaluate these movements. This allows the researchers to model the trajectories of movements over time with tools like latent growth mixture modeling and k-spectral clustering, identifying the mechanisms associated with each movement, how they rise and fall over time, and how they translate into industrial or health applications. For example, the project studies how the trajectory of intellectual movements is a function of their environment and competing research efforts, and show the ways in which it depends on the timing and magnitude of key resources (e.g., money, recognition, new recruits and trainees, social networks of support, or the coherence of the knowledge itself). In such a fashion, this work is an important first step in unraveling the recipe for innovation as a collective, episodic process.</AbstractNarration>

The project is based on a large dataset of texts the researchers have compiled on US research activity from 1990-2016, including scientific articles, dissertations, grants, and patents. We employed natural language processing techniques (phrase extraction) to identify scientific concepts or ideas, and then discerned their organized use (as latent themes via topic modeling) and flow across texts and settings over time. We also identify social network and intellectual factors associated with the increased (or decrease) adoption of these ideas and their potential to transfer to applied domains. We use multilevel growth models to identify mechanisms driving flows and machine learning to predict transfer occurrence (Cao et al 2020).</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Our models of field specific topical trends show that for education, the field encountered a "paradigm war" in the 1980?s that resulted in the field becoming more and more qualitative over time. Moreover, job prospects flowed toward such qualitative fields as well. This was the result of changing composition and hiring by departments (Galvez et al 2020). For sociology, we do observe a "cultural turn". Sociology shifts student composition and this amplified interest in identity-research and more interpretive approaches. In addition, new advances arise where survey methods decline as causal and qualitative approaches emerge (Heiberger et al). Last, for history, we find that genders contribute different topics to a field, and that women bring to light a variety of key topics of history that without, our knowledge base would be severely curtailed (Risi et al).

First, we find that many new concepts are invented in science every year. Only some of these concepts find resonance in the scientific community and diffuse more widely as conceptual innovations. On the one hand, conceptual novelty can be thought of as a new token-term. On the other, it can be seen as new token-term pairings, where old terms are recombined. We study the uptake of new token-terms in a first study (Cheng et al) and find that a shift to the concept level reveals semantic and intellectual contexts are at least as important as institutional and social ones in diffusing ideas. Terms that have competitors or which lack distinction, fail to take hold, as do those which lack consistent use and recognition, and those with little relevance to more general or root concepts. The more concepts have these intellectual features, the more they take off. And this is in addition or net of their social (higher status authors, more broad use among authors, etc) and intellectual conditions (use in high status and bridging outlets). In a second study (Hofstra et al 2020) we focus on token-term pairs, identifying which sorts of scholars are associated with new combinations, whether those begun by certain authors find uptake (innovation), and whether they have the same value (return to jobs). There we find that underrepresented groups are more likely to introduce novel conceptual linkages, but that these novelties go underutilized, and even when they are heavily utilized and taken up, they do not have the same career returns as majority group members gain from such connections.

In the 1990?s there was less interdisciplinarity and little internet search. All collaboration was local and faculty came to resemble each other intellectually after they collaborated. In the 2000?s this shifted with the internet and the university?s support for interdisciplinary centers. Faculty now sought out intellectual similars and then formed collaborations, and many more collaborations arose across units and productivity rocketed upwards.
