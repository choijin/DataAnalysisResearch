<AbstractNarration>As part of its overall strategy to enhance learning in informal environments, the Advancing Informal STEM Learning (AISL) program funds innovative resources for use in a variety of settings. The National Association of Math Circles (NAMC) will convene the Math Circle-Mentor and Partnership (MC-MAP) Workshop in late 2016.  The proposed MC-MAP workshop will build the field's understanding of the training content and mechanisms that enhance the knowledge and skill development of participants in Math Circles. The workshop will bring mentors from experienced Math Circle leaders together with novice Math Circle leaders to develop the expertise of the notice leaders and their group to develop their expertise in facilitating math circle activities and in organizing related events. The approximately 180 Math Circles currently operating across the nation enlist mathematics professionals to share their passion for mathematics with K-12 students, teachers, and the general public in contexts that emphasize exploration, problem solving and discovery.  This initial conference and Math Circle trainings informed by this conference will help build a community of practice around Math Circles through which novice and existing leaders are connected, encouraged and inspired.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The MC-MAP workshop will include structured planning as well as guided observation and structured debriefing of a demonstration Math Circle sessions.  The workshop design will be grounded in research related to effective adult learning and to discovery-based mathematics. The workshop will serve as a training prototype that will assist the National Association of Math Circles to identify effective training formats and materials for both experienced and novice Math Circle leaders.  Pre- and post- conference surveys of Math Circle leaders will produce data to be used in planning and designing future trainings.  The NAMC will share key findings from the workshop evaluation and workshop resources not only with its membership, but also with other mathematics K-12 outreach programs.  Workshop materials will address recruiting and serving diverse participants in Math Circles, including girls and women, persons with disabilities, students from varied socioeconomic backgrounds and underrepresented minorities in STEM.</AbstractNarration>

Mentees learned effective facilitation techniques, learned and familiarized themselves with existing resources for finding quality Math Circle session materials, and gained knowledge of the various administrative aspects of leading a Math Circle program.  In addition, a community of support was established through informal interactions throughout the conference.  Novice Math Circle leaders took advantage of the expertise of their more experienced peers through a variety of contexts during the meeting: structured planning sessions, guided observation and structured debriefing of a recorded Math Circle session, and an opportunity to practice facilitation skills via a one&shy;-day Julia Robinson Math Festival open to local students. These experiences supported the mentees in learning effective facilitation techniques, sharing resources for finding and developing quality Math Circle lessons, and gaining knowledge about effectively preparing and supporting Math Circle session facilitators. In addition, workshop sessions addressed logistical issues (e.g. fundraising, recruiting and advertising, administrative essentials, and emergency plans)? effectively facilitating a meaningful mathematical experience for participants? and content issues (how to develop or identify a rich problem or activity).   One of the most powerful aspects of the workshop was the Julia Robinson Math Festival, co-hosted with the University of Colorado Denver.  The 4-hour event brought together 198 students from five middle schools across the greater Denver metro area.  Workshop participants found that working with the middle school students was helpful for their development as Math Circle leaders.  This project kickstarted a year-long program and training and support for Math Circle leaders. Additional details about the impact and final summaries of this work were presented in detail to the NSF and are available on request.
