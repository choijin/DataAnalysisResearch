<AbstractNarration>Algebraic geometry is the study of shapes defined by polynomial equations.  The field of algebraic geometry is central to modern mathematics, describing spaces that play important roles in physics, computer science, and certain subfields of biology.  The most important feature of a shape is its curvature -- how much it deviates locally from a flat plane.  An active topic of current research is how the curvature affects the other properties of a shape.  For example, it seems to influence the number of integer solutions to the defining polynomial equations.  This research project aims to deepen the study of curvature and its implications in algebraic geometry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first goal of the project is to study the geometry of subvarieties from a numerical perspective.  More precisely, the project addresses how the position of a numerical class in the pseudo-effective cone relates to the asymptotic geometry of representatives of multiples of this class.  This is a well-established story for divisors, and recent work suggests a similar beautiful theory for all subvarieties.  Second, the project will study Manin's conjecture predicting the growth rate of rational points of a bounded height.  Using recently developed geometric techniques (known as the minimal model program), the investigator will analyze the geometric underpinnings of Manin's conjecture.  This work is anticipated to provide positive evidence for the conjecture and to identify new examples that lie on the boundary of known techniques.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The PI works in the area of algebraic geometry: the study of polynomial equations and the geometric shapes they define, known as algebraic varieties.  One of the key developments in algebraic geometry over the past sixty years is known as the "Minimal Model Program."  This ambitious program aims to "decompose" algebraic varieties into smaller pieces which are easier to understand.  This grant has supported research activities in two different areas related to the Minimal Model Program.  First, the PI completed several projects in the area of positivity of cycles.  The goal of these projects is to extend foundational results concerning the geometry of codimension 1 subvarieties to subvarieties of arbitrary dimension.  Second, the PI has worked in the area of Manin's Conjecture.  Manin's Conjecture addresses the rational number solutions of polynomial equations.  By bringing ideas and techniques from the Minimal Model Program into the realm of number theory, the PI and his collaborators have developed new insights into this conjecture.  This perspective has also allowed us to generalize and extend the conjecture in surprising new ways.     The grant has also supported several broader impact activities, including: summer research projects for undergraduates, organization of conferences and workshops, conference activities specifically aimed at the professional development of young mathematicians or under-represented groups in the mathematical sciences, and the development of curriculum activities for advanced high school students.
