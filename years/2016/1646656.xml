<AbstractNarration>Computing has become a pervasive part of the global human society and has powered a radical transformation in the ways in which the nation designs and produces goods, delivers services, and conducts business.  A new generation of faculty in computational- and data-enabled science and engineering have emerged for whom computing is a seamless and integral part of their work.  The shift in the way in which faculty work within disciplinary communities that includes new forms of digital scholarship as well as interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary collaborative efforts has created contemporary challenges on their path to make an impact in their fields as well as earning institutional and disciplinary recognition. To meet the challenges of supporting interdisciplinary cyberinfrastructure (CI) research and education, it is now urgent for the CI community to recognize the fundamental causes for these challenges and the potential solutions to overcome these challenges.  The specific objectives of this workshop are to 1) identify priority problem areas that constitute the fundamental causes of the challenges in interdisciplinary CI research and education, and 2) devise an initial set of strategies, approaches, and potential solutions that could be implemented at a personal, organizational, and/or national level to ameliorate these problems.  Thus, it is aligned with NSF's mission in promoting progress in science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These objectives will be achieved by harvesting wisdom from the prior four CyberBridges workshops and conducting focused discussion and problem-solving sessions. The long-term goal of this workshop is to raise the awareness in the CI community of the challenges that impede progress and affect early and mid career interdisciplinary CI faculty, and to promote the adoption of strategies at community level to mitigate these challenges.  The broader impact is expected to be significant.  The PIs has elaborate plans for recruitment of attendees from diverse backgrounds, both CI-users and CI-contributors, and including those from underrepresented groups.  This may help create a model for career pathways for cyberinfratstructure researchers and educators.  In the long term, the roadmap created may contribute to advancement of science with better-motivated and prepared scientific workforce.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The fifth NSF CyberBridges workshop for ACI CAREER and CRII awardees was held on October 21 &ndash; 22, 2016 at the Rochester Institute of Technology in Rochester, NY.  This workshop was dedicated to the discussion of the growing challenges and potential solutions to support interdisciplinary research and education in cyberinfrastructure (CI). This theme was selected to recognize a common and priority problem that has coherently emerged from discussions in prior CyberBridges workshops: the increasing need of an interdisciplinary workforce in CI, and the inability of the dominant disciplinary model of current higher education to adequately support the development and growth of such an interdisciplinary CI workforce.  A total of 12 NSF CAREER or CRII awardees and 6 invited speakers participated in the workshop.  The invited speakers presented on the coherent theme of the challenges and solutions to support interdisciplinary work in three broad areas: Programs and Centers, Research, and Education. Presentations in each area were followed by two focused discussion sessions to identify the priority root causes underlying the challenges in each area, and to devise initial solutions to ameliorate these problems.  Through the invited presentations and the discussions, participants of the workshop identified the following priority problems that need to be addressed, and potential initial strategies that can be implemented at different levels to address these problems.  The initial high investment necessary to establish an inter/multidisciplinary effort compared to usual disciplinary work    Problems: This includes the longer period of time for incubating an interdisciplinary center or program, the challenge and extra effort in teaching an interdisciplinary course due to the diverse background of students and the preparation of course materials across multiple disciplines, and the time and overhead needed to establish common communication ground and group management for an effective research collaboration. Solutions: The potential solutions include encouraging recognition of the additional efforts and overhead necessary for multidisciplinary work, training soft skills and management skills for faculty, and streamlining and optimizing administrative burdens related to collaboration.   The lack of reward structure to evaluate and recognize interdisciplinary work  Problems: This includes the lack of incentive for the participation and leadership in interdisciplinary centers/programs, the lack of metrics for generation of artifacts and tools as a result of interdisciplinary work, and the lack of recognition and rewards for the extra efforts required for interdisciplinary teaching. Solutions: The potential solutions include faculty-level memorandum of understanding initiated at hiring to ensure the recognition of non-traditional artifacts generated from interdisciplinary work, interdisciplinary centers or colleges that grant tenure, and incentives from the administration level to encourage and support interdisciplinary activities.   The inherent challenges in seeking and securing funding   Problems: This includes difficulties to secure funding to sustain an interdisciplinary center or program once established, to identify appropriate funding mechanisms to support interdisciplinary research, to seek funding for preliminary work necessary to write competitive proposals, and to seek funding that is significant enough to support larger, multiparty research teams. Solutions: The potential solutions include seeking overt and clear support from NSF leadership for new and collaborative projects.
