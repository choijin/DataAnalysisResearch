<AbstractNarration>The Rocky Mountain-Great Plains Graduate Research Workshop in Combinatorics (GRWC), will be held in Laramie, WY (2016), Denver, CO (2017) and Ames, IA (2018), building upon successful NSF-funded workshops in 2014 and 2015.  Each workshop will involve approximately 39 graduate students and postdoctoral researchers, and 10 or more faculty members in an intense two-week collaborative research experience. Participants will work to solve important, relevant problems from graph theory, enumeration, combinatorial matrix theory, finite geometry, and other modern sub-disciplines of combinatorics. Students will prepare open problems prior to the workshop under the guidance of faculty mentors from the organizing committee, which consists of faculty from Iowa State University, the University of Colorado Denver, the University of Denver, the University of Nebraska Lincoln, and the University of Wyoming. These problems, presented at the workshop by their proposers or hosted on the workshop's secure problem wiki, will be worked on by small groups of participating students, postdocs, and faculty. For more information about the GRWC, including a detailed description of the workshop format, please see the workshop website at http://sites.google.com/site/rmgpgrwc &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the collaborations at the heart of the GRWC is to produce high-quality, publishable research on a variety of topics. Another longer-term goal of the workshop is to help student participants expand their professional research networks. A strong research network is often a crucial part of building a generative and sustainable research program, and establishing these connections at an early career stage can have a long-term positive effect on the quality, impact, and depth of a professional's research portfolio. Participation in the GRWC will allow students to cultivate a large professional network of peers from the combinatorics community with whom they will be able to interact and collaborate throughout their careers. The GRWC will also offer professional development workshops to help students and postdocs prepare for job searches and future careers in academia, industry, or government.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Graduate Research Workshop in Combinatorics (GRWC) is a 2-week summer workshop for graduate students and postdocs in combinatorics, a branch of discrete mathematics.  The GRWC has been in existence from 2014, and this award provided funding for the 2016 GRWC at the University of Wyoming, the 2017 GRWC in Denver, CO (co-hosted by the University of Colorado Denver and the University of Denver), the 2018 GRWC at Iowa State University and the 2019 GRWC at the University of Kansas.  The goal of the workshop to support early-career mathematicians through individual and group mentoring, exposure to important research problems and cutting edge methods, and the development of a durable professional network of their peers.       At each GRWC, teams of students, postdocs and faculty mentors collaborate on open research problems from across the discipline.  Students and postdocs also take part in professional development seminars on topics including careers in industry, government and academia, the grant writing process, equity in the mathematical sciences and more.  From 2016-2019 this award supported over 100 graduate students and postdocs as well as 12 faculty from U.S. institutions.  With additional support from other funders, the 2016-2019 workshops supported the training and mentoring of nearly 180 early-career mathematicians from over 50 institutions.  Teams from these workshops are responsible for 12 accepted or published research papers, with 19 additional papers under review and even more in progress.  Participants have also presented their work well over 100 times, including GRWC-organized sessions at 4 international meetings and talks at multiple national and regional conference and seminars.
