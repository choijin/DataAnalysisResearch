<AbstractNarration>General Abstract&lt;br/&gt;Questions about whether and how political leaders influence outcomes are fundamental to the study of politics.  If politicians are responsive to constituent opinions, one would expect to observe similar outcomes across different leaders.  In reality, though, public policy outcomes tend to vary systematically depending on who serves in elected office. This dissertation examines representation in American cities. New data reveal that American mayors, like politicians at higher levels of government, tend not to be highly representative of their constituents.  For instance, they are more likely to be white males with prior political experience and white-collar careers. Business owners and executives are especially well represented. By providing compelling evidence that mayors can and do shape public policy, this research contributes to our understanding of the nature and importance of local politics. In addition, the study also begins to explore the causes and consequences of the overrepresentation of business owners and executives. The findings suggest that the nonpartisan election system used in a large share of local mayoral elections may create an interesting interaction with the preferences of voters that affects the electoral prospects of underrepresented groups. Moreover, this research implies that more equitable representation may result in policy changes that could benefit less affluent citizens. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Abstract&lt;br/&gt;While elected executives typically have limited formal authority, they are unquestionably important actors in the policymaking process. Investigating the influence of executives, however, presents several methodological challenges. In an effort to overcome some of these obstacles, this study focuses on mayors in American cities. Although city halls may lack the prestige of the White House or the state house, mayors oversee the provision of essential public services that Americans rely on every day. This project addresses three fundamental questions about mayors and local politics: 1) Who serves as mayor? 2) How do voters select mayors?  And, 3) does it matter who voters choose to serve as mayor? A new dataset comprised of information about mayoral candidates provides unprecedented details about American mayors and descriptive representation in U.S. cities. The study incorporates both observational and experimental methods to advance causal arguments about how voters select mayors and how mayors influence policy. The results of a conjoint survey experiment suggest that a considerable deficit of descriptive representation does not necessarily reflect voters' reluctance to choose women or minority candidates.  Rather these attributes may be more influential in the absence of party labels, common to numerous cities that select officials in non-partisan elections. Of particular importance is the fact that the individuals who lead have significant influence over policy outcomes. An analysis of the effect of electing a business executive mayor finds that mayors can and do shape fiscal policy outcomes with implications for how the costs and benefits of local government are distributed.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Questions about whether and how political leaders influence outcomes are fundamental to the study of politics, and there is empirical evidence to suggest that public policy may vary with characteristics of politicians and policymakers, such as partisanship, race, or gender.  Despite progress in descriptive, or numerical, representation, women and minority groups remain underrepresented in American politics, and the wealth gap between lawmakers and their constituents continues to grow. These circumstances are particularly troubling in light of rising levels of income inequality and recent studies suggesting that the overrepresentation of the affluent may affect public policy.  This study examines U.S. mayors and yields new insights on representation in U.S. cities and the mayors who oversee the provision of essential public services that Americans rely on every day.  This project addresses three fundamental questions about mayors and local politics. Who serves as mayor? How do voters select mayors? And, does it matter who voters choose? A new dataset of mayoral candidates provides unprecedented details about American mayors and descriptive representation in U.S. cities.

This project generated a new dataset that includes detailed profiles of approximately 4,500 mayoral candidates from 288 cities in 44 states between 1950 and 2007.  These data indicate that American mayors are not very representative of their constituents.  Specifically, they are very likely to be white and male, with prior political experience and white-collar careers. Disparities in descriptive representation may not necessarily reflect reluctance on the part of voters to choose women or minority candidates.  Candidates from underrepresented groups win at similar rates to their white and male counterparts but tend to run more often in cities with the council-manager form of government.  One possibility is that potential candidates from underrepresented groups make strategic decisions to run (or not) based on assessments of how likely they are to win.   Business owners and executives are especially well represented among American mayors, accounting for about 32% of all candidates.   Voters choices on election day can have meaningful implications for public policy.  For example, this study finds evidence that electing a business owner or executive mayor leads to an increase in municipal spending on infrastructure accompanied by a decrease in spending on programs that benefit low income residents.  The study?s findings suggest that mayors can and do shape fiscal policy outcomes.
