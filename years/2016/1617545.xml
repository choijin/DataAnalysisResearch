<AbstractNarration>High-performance Phase Locked Loops (PLLs) for frequency synthesis are critical and are often performance-limiting components in nearly all modern electronic communication systems. Despite their many advantages, digital PLLs have not replaced analog PLLs in present-day high-end frequency synthesis applications such as in 4G mobile systems, and fall far short of anticipated 5G requirements. The new generation of mobile communication systems will require PLLs to have higher accuracy, lower power dissipation, greater re-configurability, greater immunity to interference, and lower costs. Towards this goal, this project will explore novel techniques for development and design of Digital PLLs. Successful completion of the project will not only have a strong technical impact on the communications industry, but will also educate the next generation of design engineers for the industry by training them to join the workforce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary research focus of this project is theoretical and is the development and optimization of enabling new signal processing techniques and their rigorous mathematical analyses. Additionally, a digital PLL prototype IC enabled by the new techniques will be developed that targets best-of-class 5G RF frequency synthesis performance. This experimental work will provide feedback that will guide the theoretical work as well as a definitive means of evaluating the success of the project in achieving its objective.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[       Phase-locked loops (PLLs) are in nearly all electronic devices. They make it possible to modulate and demodulate wireless signals, clock both digital and sampled-data analog circuits, and measure time intervals. Moreover, they are astonishingly precise. For example, present-day mobile telephone transceivers incorporate several highly-tunable multi-GHz oscillators whose output signals have integrated jitter of less than a hundred femtoseconds. Nevertheless, oscillator precision is often a limiting factor in high-performance applications such as modern wireless and wireline communications, radar, and high-speed digital circuits.        Until recently, the best-performing PLLs have been analog PLLs, i.e., PLLs based on conventional analog circuitry, so analog PLLs are predominant in high-performance applications such as mobile telephones. Yet analog PLLs have major limitations. The decades-old scaling trend of integrated circuit (IC) technology has exponentially improved digital circuit performance, but has come at the expense of conventional analog circuit performance. The ever-increasing circuit densities offered by successive IC technology nodes has come hand in hand with low supply voltages, high flicker noise, high device nonlinearity, poor signal isolation, and device leakage, all of which severely limit the viability of conventional analog circuitry.     These issues have fueled nearly two decades of intensive research to develop digital PLLs that are compatible with highly-scaled IC technology, avoid the large-area analog loop filters required by analog PLLs, and are easily reconfigurable. The digital PLLs developed prior to this project achieved these objectives, but they do not achieve the excellent phase error performance of the best analog PLLs. The results of this project address this issue.  The project has developed and refined a new type of digital PLL that incorporates a dual-mode ring oscillator frequency-to-digital converter. It has developed several new techniques and refinements that improve performance and has demonstrated multiple prototype PLL ICs enabled by the new results that achieve state-of-the-art performance.
