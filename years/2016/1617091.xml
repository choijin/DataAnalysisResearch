<AbstractNarration>Huge data centers increasingly form the heart of the Internet.  This project will develop an optical-fiber-based network architecture for data centers, together with associated network control algorithms, that is highly configurable, scalable, and meets the requirements of future data centers. The proposed architecture is hierarchical and uses low-cost passive optics at the lowest levels of the hierarchy, and a combination of electronic and configurable optical switching at higher layers, thus striking a balance between cost and capability of optical systems and devices. Moreover, the use of passive optics significantly reduces energy consumption, which has become an important consideration in large data centers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our research plan includes both architecture development and algorithm design, including:&lt;br/&gt;1. Develop a Wave-Division-Multiplexing (WDM)-based DCN architecture that is low-cost, scalable, and configurable, for meeting the communication requirements of future data centers.&lt;br/&gt;2. Develop dynamic reconfiguration algorithms for changing the network topology in response to changes in traffic conditions, in order to reduce the communication load on the network.&lt;br/&gt;3. Investigate the use of passive optics in order to reduce energy consumption, and compare different architectural alternatives in terms of energy consumption.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed architecture has the potential to dramatically change the way that DCNs are designed, significantly improving their scalability, robustness and energy efficiency. In addition, this investigation will include: (1) dissemination of the results through journal and conference publications to advance the field; (2) incorporation of new theory and algorithms developed through this work into advanced graduate classes; (3) development of experimental projects for undergraduate students; (4) technology transfer to industry (including potential early adoption by an industry partner) and (5) training of graduate and undergraduate students.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    The rapid growth of data center size and traffic have raised the need for scalable, efficient data center networks, and optical interconnects is a promising technique to meed the demand of a network with low-latency, high throughput and scalability. In particular, Optical Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM) technique gives the possibility to build data centers comprising millions of severs.  This project developed a WDM-based Reconfigurable Hierarchical Optical Data Center Architecture (RHODA) that can accommodate increasing data center size demand and dynamic traffic patterns.  RHODA, is a novel two level hierarchical WDM-Based scalable Data Center Network architecture, which is based on the interconnection of high speed equal sized clusters of Racks. The RHODA  data center network(DCN) is hierarchical to increase scalability by grouping racks into clusters, while the cluster membership can be reconfigurable through optical switches to improve the reconfigurability. Intra-cluster network provides ability of heavy-traffic communication among the racks within the same cluster, and the use of arrayed waveguide grating router (AWGR) gives the reconfigurability for the clusters to accommodate varying traffic patterns. For inter-cluster network, optical space switches and Wavelength Selective Switches (WSSs) provide a reconfigurable topology to fit in varying traffic.  This project developed the RHODA architecture, and associated network algorithms for reconfigurable cluster membership and inter-cluster network connectivity.  Simulation results demonstrated significant preformance improvement over existing architectures, in terms of supported throughput and communication delays.
