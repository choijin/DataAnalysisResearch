<AbstractNarration>With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) and Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities (CRIF) programs, Professor Frank McDonald from Emory University and colleagues Lanny Liebeskind, Craig Hill, Huw Davies and Christopher Scarborough have acquired a high intensity single crystal X-ray diffractometer. X-ray diffraction is a powerful tool to investigate the arrangement of the atoms, the microscopic structure, of solid materials. An X-ray beam aimed at a small crystal will produce a diffraction pattern which is analyzed to determine this underlying atomic structure. This knowledge is fundamental to understanding their properties and developing improvements. Advances in the intensity and ability to focus the X-rays have made modern diffractometers, such as a high intensity diffractometer, essential for research. The applications of X-ray structural data ranges across fields from chemistry to biology, materials and medicine, to applications such as developing better pharmaceuticals, electronic devices, catalysts for bioremediation processes and understanding the mechanisms of enzymes. The diffractometer is used in student research activities as well as instruction. It is a general tool to prepare the next generation of scientists. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels, especially in areas such as (a) developing catalysts and characterizing catalytic intermediates; (b) developing oxidation catalysts based on first-row transition metals with redox-active ligands; (c) exploring fundamental properties of polyoxometallates (POMs) widely used in applications such as corrosion prevention; (d) preparing catalysts for dehydration reactions; (e) structurally characterizing synthetic materials; (f) determining the stereochemical configuration of biologically active materials; (g) determining conformation and molecular orientation of molecular catalysts on electrode surfaces; (g) studying peptide nanotube orientation and (h) studying charge density of biologically active coordination compounds.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ With this grant from the National Science Foundation - Major Research Instrumentation Program, Emory University has acquired a high intensity microfocus dual source X-ray diffractometer, for determining the structure of new chemical compounds generated in research and educational activities.    X-ray diffractometry of single crystals provides unambiguous information on the connections between atoms and the three-dimensional nature of these connections.  This powerful method has some limitations on the size of crystals suitable for analysis, and the stability of the crystalline substance while it is bombarded with high-energy X-rays.  However, the NSF-funded diffractometer has state-of-the-art technology for highly focused beam intensity, permitting analysis of microcrystalline samples that cannot be studied with older diffractometers.  Moreover, the time required for data collection with the new diffractometer is much shorter, diminishing the possibility of crystal decomposition during analysis.   Since the installation of the new diffractometer in 2017, the instrument has been heavily and nearly continuously used.  The Emory X-ray crystallography core facility has determined more than 1000 single crystal structures during the grant period.  To date, 26 peer-reviewed publications have appeared describing results obtained with this instrument.  Based on current usage, the number of publications based on X-ray crystal structure data will likely climb steeply in the coming years.  Intellectual merit:  The new diffractometer supports a broad range of research activities in chemistry, ranging from structural characterization of new catalysts and biomaterials, to confirming the chemical structures of new compounds with beneficial biological activity, some of which have future prospects for drug development.  X-ray diffraction analysis is particularly valuable in establishing the three-dimensional shape of chemical compounds, including mirror-image compounds (enantiomers).  X-ray diffraction complements other techniques such as magnetic resonance spectroscopy and mass spectrometry, especially for metal-containing catalyst structures.  In this field, precise information on the shape of the catalyst is critically important to understand how these new catalysts selectively promote only one pathway for chemical reactivity in preference to all other possibilities.    Broader impacts:  The user group includes not only Emory University research scientists, but researchers from many other academic institutions in metro Atlanta and the southeastern United States, ranging from other major research universities to primarily undergraduate colleges.  Researchers at chemical and pharmaceutical companies have also obtained crystal structures of proprietary compounds using this diffractometer.  Furthermore, this instrument contributes to the scientific education and professional training of Emory University students.  In addition to expert use by chemistry graduate students, even undergraduate chemistry majors analyzed new crystalline compounds which they have synthesized in a practical laboratory course, by using this diffractometer.
