<AbstractNarration>This project aims at fundamental development of tropical combinatorics as well as its applications.  Combinatorics is the art and science of distilling a complex mathematical structure into simple attributes and developing from this a deeper understanding of the original structure.  Tropical mathematics, named after Brazilian mathematician Imre Simon of Sao Paulo on the Tropic of Capricorn, is a young area of mathematics arising from a number system with a pair operations: addition and maximum, instead of the more traditional pair of addition and multiplication.  Tropical mathematics has applications in a wide range of areas including mirror symmetry, computational algebra, optimization, statistics, phylogenetics, and economics. The solutions of algebraic equations and inequalities are the main objects of interest in algebraic geometry; likewise the solutions of tropical algebraic equations and inequalities are the main players in tropical geometry.  There is a precise relationship between algebro-geometric objects and their tropical counterparts, so tropical mathematics provides new insights into classical problems as well.  It also provides a natural language and a new perspective for understanding deep and sometimes surprising connections between different mathematical entities.  This project will make contributions to the foundation of tropical geometry, focusing on the combinatorial structures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main geometric objects of study in this field are tropically convex sets and tropical algebraic sets, which can be constructed analogously to the usual convex sets and algebraic sets, but using the max-plus algebra. The investigator will study relationships between various combinatorial structures associated to an algebraic set, namely, its tropical variety, its algebraic matroid, and its Chow polytope.  She will develop Ehrhart theory for enumeration of lattice points in tropical polytopes. In the other direction, the investigator will use tropical point of view to study classical objects in combinatorics and convex geometry. She will continue developing an approach to polytopes and triangulations based on tropical geometry and will investigate the relationship between the cone of positive semidefinite matrices and affine buildings. On the computational front, new algorithms for computing tropical varieties will be developed using numerical algebraic geometry, which has become one of the most powerful tools in algebraic geometry due to its highly parallelizable nature and advancements in numerical computations. These new methods will be useful for problems concerning polynomial systems which are ubiquitous in mathematical models in science and engineering.  Specific applications include finding competitive equilibrium prices in product-mix auctions and discovering causal relationships between random variables in probability.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  This project aims to develop interactions between tropical geometry and combinatorics. Tropical geometry is a piecewise linear shadow of algebraic geometry, and combinatorics is the study of discrete structures. In particular, the research focus is in three areas:  (1) Polytopes and Convexity (from linear algebra)  (2) Curves and Varieties (from non-linear algebra)  (3) Applications in statistics and economics.   During the award period I completed ten research articles, 7 of which have been accepted for publications.  They span algebra, geometry, combinatorics, with applications in causal inference and auction theory in economics.  I have given over 30 presentations on these research results.   I was a research member in the MSRI program on Geometric and Topological Combinatorics in 2017 and a research member of the ICERM semester on Nonlinear Algebra in 2018.  My two PhD students also participated in these programs, partially funded by this award.   I graduated one PhD student who is now a postdoc at TU Berlin, and I have been supervising three more PhD students.  I also graduated two Masters students and supervised 12 undergraduate students on independent research projects.     I co-organized around ten conferenced workshops, including a summer school on mathematical economics at the Hausdorff center in Bonn and the yearly Meeting on Applied Algebraic Geometry at Georgia Tech. I served at the research group leader at two workshops (Women in Commutative Algebra at Banff and Macaulay2 workshop at IMA in Minneapolis).  I was a local organizer of the SIAM conference on Applied Algebraic Geometry in 2017.  I was a founding member of leadership team of the Intown Atlanta Math Teachers Circle.  I am currently the program director for the SIAM activity group on Algebraic Geometry.     I am an Editor in Chief of Journal for Combinatorial Theory Series A and an associate editor of Journal of Software for Algebra and Geometry and Algebraic Statistics (journal).
