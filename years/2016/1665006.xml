<AbstractNarration>This award provides funding to help defray the expenses of participants in "The Twentieth Riviere-Fabes Symposium" that will be held April 28-30, 2017, on the twin-cities campus of the University of Minnesota. The bulk of the support is directed at graduate students and postdocs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This annual conference, of which the 2017 meeting will be the twentieth rendition, honors the mathematical legacies of the late Nestor M. Riviere and Eugene B. Fabes by focusing on recent developments in analysis, especially in the field of partial differential equations. The 2017 program will feature four principal speakers (Manuel del Pino, Philip Isett, Sylvia Serfaty, and Luis Silvestre), each of whom will deliver a two-hour lecture. The program allows ample time for informal discussion among the participants. More details about the symposium are forthcoming on http://www.math.umn.edu/conferences/riv_fabes/.</AbstractNarration>

The titles and abstracts of the lectures are below, more materials (including slides from the talks) are available at https://math.umn.edu/rivi%C3%A8re-fabes-2017/abstracts  There were over 40 supported participants, mostly graduate students and postdoctoral associates. Philip Isett A Proof of Onsager?s Conjecture for the Incompressible Euler Equations  Abstract: In an effort to explain how anomalous dissipation of energy occurs in hydrodynamic turbulence, Onsager conjectured in 1949 that weak solutions to the incompressible Euler equations may fail to exhibit conservation of energy if their spatial regularity is below 1/3-H&ouml;lder. I will discuss a proof of this conjecture that shows that there are nonzero, (1/3-epsilon)-H&ouml;lder Euler flows in 3D that have compact support in time. The construction is based on a method known as "convex integration," which has its origins in the work of Nash on isometric embeddings with low codimension and low regularity. A version of this method was first developed for the incompressible Euler equations by De Lellis and Sz&eacute;kelyhidi to build H&ouml;lder-continuous Euler flows that fail to conserve energy, and was later improved by Isett and by Buckmaster-De Lellis-Sz&eacute;kelyhidi to obtain further partial results towards Onsager's conjecture. The proof of the full conjecture combines convex integration using the "Mikado flows" introduced by Daneri-Sz&eacute;kelyhidi with a new "gluing approximation" technique. The latter technique exploits a special structure in the linearization of the incompressible Euler equations. Sylvia Serfaty Mean-Field Limits for Ginzburg-Landau vortices  Abstract: Ginzburg-Landau type equations are models for superconductivity, superfluidity, Bose-Einstein condensation. A crucial feature is the presence of quantized vortices, which are topological zeroes of the complex-valued solutions. This talk will review some results on the derivation of effective models to describe the statics and dynamics of these vortices, with particular attention to the situation where the number of vortices blows up with the parameters of the problem. In particular, I will present new results on the derivation of mean field limits for the dynamics of many vortices starting from the parabolic Ginzburg-Landau equation or the Gross-Pitaevskii (=Schrodinger Ginzburg-Landau) equation. I will also discuss the situation with disorder and related homogenization questions. Luis Silvestre Integro-differential equations and their applications.  Abstract: Integro-differential equations have been a very active research topic in recent years. In these talks, we will start by explaining what they are and reviewing some basic results related to general problems. Then we will move on to some applications of these results to problems of mathematical physics. In particular, we will discuss some recent regularity estimates for the Boltzmann equation. Manuel del Pino Singularity formation in critical parabolic problems  Abstract: We deal with construction and stability analysis of blow-up of solutions for parabolic equations that involve bubbling phenomena, corresponding to gradient flows of variational energies. The term bubbling refers to the presence of families of solutions which at main order look like scalings of a single stationary solution which in the limit become singular but at the same time have an approximately constant energy level. This phenomenon arises in various problems where critical loss of compactness for the underlying energy appears. Specifically, we present construction of threshold-dynamic solutions with infinite time blow-up in the Sobolev critical semilinear heat equation in the n-dimensional space, and finite time blow up for the harmonic map flow from a two-dimensional domain into the sphere.
