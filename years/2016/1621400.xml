<AbstractNarration>Professional development is crucial to supporting early childhood teachers' ability to design and implement lessons that promote young children's science literacy as envisioned by the new Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS). Yet few studies have examined the impact of professional development on early childhood teachers' science knowledge and skills and in turn, how changes in teachers' knowledge and skills relate to student learning. Set within the context of a diverse district in the New York City Public Schools, this professional development project engages a sample of kindergarten and 1st-grade teachers in a series of Saturday workshops. During the workshops teachers work individually and together to design and test new lesson plans that enhance teachers' abilities to help young children think and act like a scientist. Moreover, teachers work individually and together to construct lessons that connect science content to young learners' cultural backgrounds, interests and prior knowledge. This project is important intellectually because it adds to the knowledge base of how to engage young children in scientific inquiry. In practical terms, the project offers teachers a set of field-tested outcomes and products demonstrating how to effectively embed science-learning experiences into early childhood curriculum, instruction and assessment. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Discovery Research K-12 program (DRK-12) seeks to significantly enhance the learning and teaching of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) by preK-12 students and teachers, through research and development of innovative resources, models and tools. Projects in the DRK-12 program build on fundamental research in STEM education and prior research and development efforts that provide theoretical and empirical justification for proposed projects. This project uses an iterative process where teachers work on their own and collaboratively in Professional Learning Communities (PLC). Over the course of 2 years, these PLCs: (1) collaboratively design, field test and refine science-integrated lessons before implementing them in their classrooms; (2) participate in face-to-face and virtual meetings with other participating teachers and research project staff; and (3) receive mentoring and support to further reinforce their learning for NGSS teaching. Pre- and post-project measures will assess the professional development program's impact on 10 kindergarten and 10 first-grade teachers who serve a diverse array of 200 students in one of the nation's largest public school systems.  Specifically, the project will examine: (a) teachers' lesson plans; (b) implementation of their lessons in the classroom; (c) samples of student work; and (d) students' learning behaviors. Qualitative and quantitative measures will be used to determine the project's anticipated outcomes which include: the characteristics of effective professional development for early childhood teachers; improved NGSS- based knowledge, skills and dispositions of kindergarten and first-grade teachers; and improved student science learning. In this way the project has the potential to catalyze new approaches to STEM learning, teaching and assessment at the early childhood level.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Project Outcomes Report The two-year exploratory study, Facilitating Teachers and Young Children?s Science learning through Iterative Cycles of Professional Development, examined the impact of professional development on teacher knowledge for NGSS-based teaching and, in turn, its impact on the tri-dimensional science learning of their students as described in the Framework for K-12 Science Education (National Research Council; NRC, (2012) and the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS; NGSS Lead States, 2013). Three main research questions guided the study: (1) Do teachers who participated in the professional development program increase their knowledge about the NGSS for teaching?; (2) Do teachers who participated in the professional development program implement science lessons integrated with NGSS-based disciplinary core ideas, crosscutting concepts and engineering practices?; and (3) Do students of teachers who participated in the professional development program demonstrate improvement in their science learning behaviors as envisioned by the NGSS? Twenty teachers who taught K-2 grades were recruited from four elementary schools to participate in the exploratory study. All of the schools were located in a high-need school district in New York City and enrolled students from diverse backgrounds, the majority of whom were English Language learners. The teachers participated in a three-cycle professional development program that consisted of 26 sessions, each lasting 80 minutes. Over two semesters (spring 2017-2018) they were offered opportunities for active individual and collaborative engagement in both in-person and asynchronous experiences pertaining to teaching and learning as envisioned by the Science Framework for K-12 Science Education and the Next Generation Science Standards. The research team?s professional development theory of action was that teachers will improve their knowledge and skills for NGSS-based teaching and their students will demonstrate learning behaviors consonant with the NGSS when they are provided with opportunities that actively engage them individually and collaboratively to: (a) understand how disciplinary core ideas, crosscutting concepts and science and engineering practices are integrated in the early childhood curriculum; (b) understand the types of instructional and assessment strategies that promote NGSS-based teaching and learning; (c) apply their understanding of NGSS-based teaching and learning to the analysis of practices of other teachers as well as their own; and (d) gain insights about teaching strategies that enable children to demonstrate science learning behaviors indicative of tri-dimensional learning. A pre-post PD research design was used to examine impact of the professional development program and included questionnaires, video lesson recordings, checklists, written records, field notes and exit slips after PD sessions to address the research questions of the study. The results of a pre-post PD comparison data analysis from a Teacher Knowledge about NGSS for Teaching Questionnaire showed gains in teacher knowledge in the domains of lesson planning, classroom teaching, and classroom assessment. However, the results from a pre-post comparison data analysis from a Science and Engineering Practices Checklist found no significant differences in teachers? skill in implementing science lessons integrated with NGSS-based disciplinary core ideas, crosscutting concepts and engineering practices nor in their students? engagement in science learning behaviors indicative of tri-dimensional learning. The outcomes from the exploratory study offer three useful insights for researchers and professional development providers in early childhood education to build teacher capacity in science teaching for tri-dimensional learning: (1) offer greater professional development opportunities for teachers to use questioning and feedback strategies in their use of NGSS-based teaching strategies that are likely to advance in the moment change in their students? tri-dimensional science learning; (2) use observation tools that do more than document presence or absence of teachers? and students? behaviors indicative of tri-dimensional science learning. In addition, observation tools should seek to distinguish: (a) qualitative differences in teacher-student interactions in terms of the cognitive and metacognitive levels of questions teachers use to engage students in tri-dimensional science learning; (b) the nature and quality of the follow- up feedback teachers give to students? responses; and (c) the subsequent adjustments in one or more domains of curriculum, instruction and assessment that teachers make following students? responses to their questions. Intellectual Merit The finding of significant change in pre-post professional development comparison data of teacher knowledge for NGSS- based teaching adds to the knowledge base about the importance of professional development in enhancing teacher knowledge about the NGSS for teaching in early childhood education. Broader Impact Enhancing teacher knowledge about the NGSS for teaching is a necessary factor in building the capacity of teachers to teach for the improvement in students? science learning including those from historically underrepresented groups. The outcome of this study is an important first step in that direction.       Last Modified: 10/23/2019       Submitted by: Eleanor Armour-Thomas]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
