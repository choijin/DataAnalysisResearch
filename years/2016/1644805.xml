<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to develop a functional ink formulation process, which would be scalable, economical and effective for printed electronics. Developed manufacturing processes would be low cost while resulting in high performance functional inks suitable for printed electronics market.  Electronics devices are constantly getting smaller, thinner and sleeker. Newly designed electronics devices therefore require new methods of manufacturing components such as electrical boards. The printed electronics market can offer benefits that conventional circuits cannot. Additionally, other application areas for these functional inks can include touch screens, printed circuit boards, display panels, marketing displays/packaging, RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) tags, wearables, and sensors. Therefore, commercial potential of our functional inks would be to transition from conventional electronics manufacturing and allow the customer to reap economic benefits related to printing manufacturing process using specifically tailored functional printed electronics inks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project is focused on the formulation of functional inks suitable for printed electronics. The uniqueness of this formulation approach is to create specialty inks that can easily transition into existing printing systems and equipment such as screen-printing, flexo, and gravure. Proprietary ink manufacturing processes allow for functional nanoparticles to be efficiently made into high performance, low cost functional inks and coatings. The proposed technology uses a single stream of raw materials that can be used for one functional ink and then with simple alterations, ink can be tailored for specific printing process (screen, flexo, gravure). Traditionally, inks are made and optimized for each printing process separately. This ink formulation process could allow for applications ranging from replacement of traditional electronic circuits, interactive displays, wearables and new interactive packaging/labeling. The unique functional ink formulation technology offers a way to use conventional printing processes to economically manufacture electrical components such as batteries, transistors, and sensors which can then be designed into simple circuits and printed on flexible substrates such as plastic or paper.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ NSF Outcome Report  NSF-ICORPS allowed "Team Ink" to familiarize ourselves with the printed electronics (PE) industry through 100+ interviews. Team Ink set out to clarify what value we bring to printers, end users and others in the printed electronics ecosystem.  In order to reach the goals our team needed to define its ecosystem and understand it through personal interviews of experts, buyers, ink makers, printers and production engineers using functional inks. In order to be successful and efficient, NSF-ICORPS taught us to learn the specific job titles that were relevant to the PE industry. Early in the process we defined specific experts, their daily jobs and their influence on decision making. Our team reached the goal of 100+ interviews but realized the interview process needs to continue in order to understand the needs of the industry, to create network of partners and define our product. Out initial hypothesis was "Team Ink focuses on the manufacture and sales of inks and ink formulation consulting services of high performance functional inks for printed electronics." With the help of the teaching team and the intensive interview process, we understood the need to specifically approach people in testing and validating positions and quantify how much time we are going to save to these engineers by providing ink with uniform performance.  Uniform performance results directly in to a quicker time to market.  At the end of our 7 weeks with the ICORP program, our hypothesis had evolved substantially to "Team Ink provides process ready inks to help Testing and Validating Engineers by reducing product development time by 50 % enabling them to beat their competition to market by 30%." In addition to our business thesis we were able to address our value proposition as: "Process ready inks have the power to improve time to market by 30%."  In order to be efficient with the interview process while being time sensitive our customers were asked a set of questions that we drafted prior the meeting. Questions were in line with the weekly I-Corps teachings and helped our team to understand the landscape of the printed electronics industry in relation to functional inks. Through the questions, our team was focused to understand shortcomings of the current ink manufacturers, ink quality, ink reproducibility/batch to batch consistency, etc.  Further questions were also prepared so our team would understand the pricing strategy, ink delivery times and additional services provided by ink makers such as ink workshops and training.  Team Ink approached small (&lt;50 employees) as well as large (&gt;100 employees) companies. We were trying to understand what happens to a sample of functional ink when requested by these companies. Our goal was to comprehend people?s role when it comes to material screening and testing, device printing and testing. At the start of the ICORP journey, we did not understand the titles of these people, or what job activities they are responsible for. Therefore, the first few interviews helped us to better understand who were the experts in this field with the decision making power. Once we had a better understanding of the landscape and people, we used our personal contacts and LinkedIn to approach these people in timely matter. Soon into the program we realize that we have to become politely aggressive to reach goal of 100+ interviews while obtaining meaningful information pertaining our goals.  At the end of the 6 weeks, we evaluated the feasibility of starting a company based upon our ICORP results.  Our team was formed by 4 women, out of which 3 had doctoral degree and one about to defend hers, all at various points in our personal and professional paths. Regardless of the presence or absence of a real market need, we realized that the individuals that participated in the ICORP program were NOT the correct ones to form a company.  As of now we still continue to interview potential customers and other individuals in the ecosystem, with the intent of addressing the above questions listed.  We hope to find the correct market "pull", and at that time, have further discussions about company formation and bringing in the right individuals to round out the team.  ICORPS program helped us to focus, narrow down our efforts and reach for ink goals.       Last Modified: 01/05/2018       Submitted by: Margaret Joyce]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
