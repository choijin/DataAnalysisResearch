<AbstractNarration>Stars seem reluctant to form in galaxy dark matter halos.  This is a puzzle.  To help solve it, the team will study the stars in a vast array of dark matter halos.  They will use optical and near-infrared data to measure the mass of the stars in galaxies and also between the galaxies in groups and clusters.  The measurements will be used to test theories that claim to have solved the puzzle.  Undergraduates will be heavily involved in the research.  The PI and his undergraduates will host hands-on events for the public.  They will advertise the events at schools in Albany, New York that serve underrepresented groups.  The PI will develop learning activities for undergraduates and high-school students and teachers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The team will study the light from stars in dark matter halos, on the scales of galaxies, groups of galaxies, and clusters of galaxies.  Their goals are to (1) measure the relationship between stellar masses and halo masses; and (2) constrain the total baryon fraction in massive dark matter halos.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ RUI: Stellar Mass Content of Galaxy Dark Matter Halos  Intellectual Merit  Galaxies, collections of tens to hundreds of billions of stars, are the building blocks of the universe. One of the key goals of modern science is to understand how galaxies formed, and what happens to them over the 14 billion-year history of the universe to change and evolve.  In this project, we study galaxies at the centers of galaxy groups and clusters, regions in space where hundreds and even thousands of galaxies agglomerate because of the gravitational pull of large amounts of unseen dark matter. These "central galaxies" rank among the most massive galaxies in the universe; however, it is not yet known how central galaxies become so massive and how their formation depends on the amount of surrounding dark matter.  This award has supported the Principal Investigator's participation in a new, state-of-the-art survey of the sky called the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys (Legacy Surveys for short; see https://www.legacysurvey.org).

Broader Impacts  The broader impacts portion of this project focused on two key areas: undergraduate (college) students and science teachers.  Over its lifetime, this project provided high-impact research experiences and training for 16 Siena College undergraduate students and one high school student. Among these, nine students, or 53%, have been women and/or minorities, both of whom are traditionally under-represented in academia and in the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) private sector.
