<AbstractNarration>NON-TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION: The demand for alternative energy sources has significantly increased in the past decade. Ceramics have revolutionized modern technologies such as electric vehicles, and more importantly renewable energy storage through the use of rechargeable electrochemical energy storage systems that couple chemical and electrical processes to convert the chemical energy to electric current. Sodium (Na) intercalation ceramics play a critical role in enabling possible use of rechargeable Na-ion batteries as the key large-scale energy storage systems. The high natural abundance and broad distribution of Na resources offer significant cost advantages. Yet Na ion batteries have not reached their full potential; therefore, it is imperative that high energy and power density materials are developed to further improve the technology. This project aims at discovering new high performance materials as well as exploring the interfacial science and defect engineering in ceramics. By taking a systematic approach using a suite of powerful analytical tools paired with first principles computational modeling, it is possible to identify the fundamental mechanisms in new ceramic materials for energy storage and conversion, in this case, sodium ion storage materials. Investigating and improving ceramic cathode materials for sodium ion batteries provides vital exposure to the next generation of research scientists through outreach activities for local underrepresented high school students with an interest in the materials science and engineering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TECHNICAL DETAILS: During the electrochemical process, structural changes due to first order and second order phase transformations that affect the system's electrochemical performance are noticeable in the voltage profile. In addition, subtle yet critical changes occur at the electrode-electrolyte interfaces, limiting the lifetime of any ceramic materials used for energy storage. This research is significantly improving the understanding of both these structural phase transformations and surface/interface modifications, and at the same time is exploring their effects on ion transport and charge transfer in sodium ion intercalation compounds. Various types of surface modification are being carried out including carbon coating, sol-gel coating, and atomic layer deposition coating on sodium intercalation ceramic materials. Advanced surface probe techniques are being applied to find the changes in surface/interface structure and chemistry in sodium electrochemical cells. The objectives of this work are to determine: 1) structural factors that promote enhanced sodium ion mobility; 2) interfacial effects on ion transport and charge transfer; and, 3) effects of defect (dislocations, substitutional elements, and oxygen vacancies) on stability and reaction kinetics. This study obtains key knowledge that will propel the development of new sodium ion storage ceramic materials for future energy storage and conversion systems. Furthermore, active recruitment of underrepresented minority students is carried out at precollegiate, undergraduate as well as graduate levels. The project enables students to receive advanced instrument training at various national laboratories and shared University of California system user facilities and present their findings at conferences, thereby broadening participation of underrepresented students and highlighting their research.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Grid storage is becoming an increasingly important part of a sustainable and safe grid. Grid storage requires an inexpensive, safe, and relatively energy dense energy storage solution. Sodium ion batteries (NIBs) have shown great promise for grid energy storage applications as an alternative to conventional lithium ion batteries. To enable NIBs for grid storage, sodium storage in sodium intercalation ceramics need to be improved. However, the sodium storage and loss mechanisms in these materials is not fully understood, which inhibits our ability to design better materials. Our work has led to an in-depth understanding of the dynamic processes in sodium ceramic materials and through that, an improvement in their electrochemical capacity and retention.</p> <p>To understand the mechanisms of sodium storage in ceramic materials, proper characterization tools need to be used to explore both the surface and the bulk of these materials. We used advanced characterization tools such as x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to explore surface species and solid electrolyte interface (SEI), and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) and x-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) to explore the sodium interactions in the bulk and the redox&nbsp; mechanisms of oxygen and transition metals in these materials. Using these tools along with electrochemical measurements, we found that the capacity retention of sodium ceramics can be improved using transition metal substitution and surface coatings. Specifically, Li substitution in Na<sub>x</sub>Ni<sub>1/3</sub>Mn<sub>2/3</sub>O<sub>2</sub> stabilizes the structure during electrochemical cycling, while a thin coating on that same material improves the interface interactions with the electrolyte. Additionally, we found that we can increase the capacity of sodium ceramic materials by adding transition-metal vacancies into the ceramics and by controlling the cooling rate during synthesis. Transition metal vacancies enabled anionic redox, in addition to cation redox, to be utilized in Na<sub>0.78</sub>Ni<sub>0.23</sub>Mn<sub>0.69</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. Moreover, controlling the cooling rate during the synthesis of Na<sub>2/3</sub>Fe<sub>1/4</sub>Mn<sub>3/4</sub>O<sub>2</sub> leads to an increase of the capacity by (i) controlling the shape of the meso-structure, (ii) lowering the surface impurities, and (iii) reducing the cell resistance.</p> <p>Recent research for this project has focused on understanding the redox mechanisms of Na<sub>0.8</sub>Li<sub>0.12</sub>Ni<sub>0.22</sub>Mn<sub>0.66</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and Na<sub>2/3</sub>Fe<sub>x</sub>Mn<sub>1-x</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (x=1/4, 1/3, 1/2) synthesized with a co-precipitation method. XAS was utilized for both these projects and the understanding gained can help design high capacity cathodes with good retention for grid storage Using optimized ceramic cathode materials, full cell configurations with hard carbon are being explored and crosstalk mechanisms are being analyzed. This NSF project has advanced the understanding of the sodium storage mechanism and interface reaction of sodium ceramic cathode materials towards improvement in their electrochemical performances.</p> <p>This NSF project has also had a significant impact on outreach to underrepresented communities and the education of the general public on energy storage and materials science. Every summer, we have had two high school students, from the Tijuana area in Mexico, perform research in our lab and learn about energy storage through the ENLACE program. Additionally, every summery we work with the Institute of the Americas to teach middle school students about electrochemistry through hands-on experiments, such as lemon batteries and electroplating coins. We demonstrated online videos to educate the general public on energy storage and materials science. Specifically, we worked with Science Nation to make a video on sodium ion batteries titled ?Batteries of the future made with salt?
