<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to provide a new class of soft, flexible, nonabrasive sensing elements which provide precise temperature readings to positively impact the health and mobility of diabetic patients. The principle impetus of this research is to focus primarily on advanced diabetic patients who suffer from nerve damage to their feet. These patients cannot feel their feet, leading to two important and related results. First, they are at high risk for an increased number of undetected ulcerating injuries from tissue damage produced by walking (friction) or standing (pressure).  Second, since these injuries are undetected and unfelt, there is a decreased urgency by the patient to seek medical care.  Delays in medical intervention further exacerbate injuries and complicate treatment, leading to an economic burden associated with foot ulceration estimated at $15 billion annually. More importantly, the 5-year mortality rate after first ulceration (40%) approaches mortality rates from heart failure (50%). The key need for a simple and cost-effective ulcer-prevention paradigm is a safe, easy-to-use foot monitoring system with temperature-sensing capability with a remote readout. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project utilizes an innovative approach to develop a non-invasive sensing system that will provide the ability to constantly monitor skin temperature.  Skin temperature has been shown to be a predictive indicator of foot-ulcer development and can additionally be used as a measure of wound healing.  A simple system enabling early detection of imminent skin ulceration subsequently reduces further tissue damage, decreasing limb amputations and saving financial, medical and emotional resources. The proof of concept sensor is designed to reside daily in a patient?s shoe to record temperatures while the patient experiences damaging activity such as walking or standing, alerting the patient to impending tissue injury. The sensor can also reside daily in a patient?s medical-treatment cast, providing a constant readout of skin temperature indicating tissue healing, allowing for out-patient monitoring and decreasing repeated visits to medical facilities for checkups.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   The goal of the project is to develop a comfortable, precise temperature sensing element which can be directly integrated inside the shoe insole to constantly monitor the diabetic foot health The wearable textile-infused graphene sensors would provide intimate, conformal, and comfortable contact with topographically complex skin surfaces and non-invasive real-time monitoring of skin temperatures that cannot be accessed using a complicated detection tools or inconvenient imaging methods.  Major activities include (1) exploring the use of graphene-based sensor on flexible substrates that would be integrated onto the existing insole prototype (2) developing the system of a Bluetooth-enabled microcontroller for data collection as well as a smartphone app that provides notification to patient and podiatrist (3) integrating the hardware and software components into a minimum viable product solution for usability testing by both patients and healthcare providers and (4) planning the 100 patient pilot with hospitals for patients outcome validation.  The primary objective of this pilot study is two-fold: (1) To improve understand of user perception of diabetic foot care practices and technological tools used in the daily management of diabetes and monitoring of foot health via a connected device and a companion mobile application and (2) To clinically evaluate whether or not the use of the system affects patient outcomes.
