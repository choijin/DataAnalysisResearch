<AbstractNarration>This award provides support to the 10th annual Graduate Climate Conference (GCC), to be held at the University of Washington's Pack Forest Conference Center, October 28-30, 2016. The goal of the GCC is to provide a discussion forum for graduate students undertaking research on climate processes over an array of disciplines, with topics including atmosphere/ocean dynamics, biogeochemical cycles, clouds and aerosols, cryosphere processes, climate feedbacks, paleoclimate, regional climate, climate impacts, science-based climate policy, and human impacts.  This is a unique setting, bringing together graduate students in a environment organized exclusively by graduate students to discuss current research in climate science. The collegial, single-session format is designed to expose graduate students studying a single aspect of the climate system to the research that other graduates are doing in all aspects of the climate system. The meeting allows graduate students to familiarize themselves with the breadth of climate science as well as the enormous range of tools available to help answer complex questions. The goal is to better prepare graduate students for scientific inquiry in a world that increasingly demands interdisciplinary approaches. Approximately 90 graduate students selected through a competitive process will attend the GCC. NSF funds will be used to provide travel and subsistence for 40 students from US institutions.</AbstractNarration>
