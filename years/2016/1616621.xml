<AbstractNarration>The Cyanobacterial Workshop presents a unique opportunity to facilitate productive communication between researchers from multiple disciplines, all sharing a common interest in cyanobacteria either as the direct subject of their research or as experimental models to investigate fundamental scientific questions. The major objective of the workshop is to provide a readily accessible venue for young scientists (graduate students and postdoctoral fellows) to present the results of their research efforts, and formally and informally discuss their work with leading members of the community. The Workshop will provide support for the attendance of young scientists, with an emphasis on increasing the participation of women and minorities under-represented in the field; the diversity of topics and technical approaches presented at the Workshop will provide a stimulating multidisciplinary environment for junior and senior scientists alike. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cyanobacteria are major contributors to the global oxygen, carbon, and nitrogen cycles and are increasingly used as platforms for biotechnological innovation for the development of "green" biofuels, chemical feedstocks, and high value products. The Cyanobacterial Workshop is enriched by the intersection of disciplines ranging from metabolic engineering to microbial ecology, and themes include Molecular Responses to Stress; Photosynthesis; Physiology and Metabolism; Biotechnology and Synthetic Biology; Differentiation; Environment and Ecology; Regulation; Phylogeny and Evolution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is supported jointly by programs in Cellular Dynamics and Function, and Systems and Synthetic Biology.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The 12th Cyanobacterial Workshop,   Tempe AZ from May 18-21st, 2016  The 12th Cyanobacterial Workshop was held in Tempe AZ from May 18-21st, 2016.  It facilitated intense and productive communication between researchers from multiple disciplines, all sharing a common interest in cyanobacteria either as the direct subject of their research or as experimental models to investigate fundamental scientific questions such as photosynthesis. The overarching objective was to provide a relatively inexpensive venue for graduate students and postdoctoral scientists to present the results of their research efforts, and formally and informally discuss their conclusions with members of the community. As discussed below, this objective was met very successfully. Despite their small microbial size, cyanobacteria play an immense role in our planet?s ecology, producing a large fraction of the oxygen we breath and play a crucial role in basic research that has applications in agriculture and biotechnology.  Cyanobacteria are oxygenic photosynthetic bacteria with an enormous diversity of ecological specializations, metabolic potentials, and morphological characteristics. From a global perspective, cyanobacteria are major contributors to the global oxygen, carbon, and nitrogen cycles.  Importantly, they remain powerful model systems for basic research in photosynthesis, nitrogen fixation, cellular metabolism, and gene regulation.  Moreover, cyanobacteria are increasingly utilized as platforms for biotechnological innovation for the development of ?green? biofuels, chemical feedstocks, and high value products.   The goal of the meeting provided a venue where scientists at all stages in their scientific careers could come to together to present their latest findings and share practical information ranging from explaining/demonstarting new technologies to different career opportunities.  With nearly 150 participants, this meeting fostered interdisciplinary interactions which is becoming increasingly important in current scientific research.  Originally focusing on molecular biology, the Cyanobacterial Workshop has become increasingly enriched by contributions from disciplines ranging from metabolic engineering to microbial ecology. The main themes highlighted for the Cyanobacterial Workshop were ultimately determined by the nature of the composition of the abstracts submitted, but drew on themes of Phylogeny and Evolution; Molecular Responses to Stress; Photosynthesis; Physiology and Metabolism; Biotechnology and Synthetic Biology; Differentiation; Environment and Ecology; Regulation.  Overall, the diversity of topics and technical approaches provided an extremely stimulating multidisciplinary environment for junior and senior scientists alike.  In terms of the Broader Impacts, we developed an innovative mechanism for organizing scientific meetings, that has, to the PI's knowledge not been described before.
