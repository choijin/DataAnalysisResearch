<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to improve data security by preventing eavesdropping on a communication channel. This project takes into consideration the location of potential eavesdroppers and fading channel signals to prevent unauthorized access to communication. The project will enhance information security by providing a technology that uses less computation power, while insuring longer battery life, to secure communication.  The project provides an alternative choice for securing communication by not relying on traditional encryption, which sometimes has been vulnerable to attacks. The potential application of this I-Corps project includes, but is not limited to: financial sector, military, government research institutions, healthcare, and other security-sensitive applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project utilizes a combination of signaling and coding techniques to provide security against eavesdroppers by not relying on a secret pair of keys that traditional cryptography schemes are known for. This technology uses a combination of channel codes and physical location of eavesdroppers to prevent the eavesdroppers from gaining access to the communication wave.  The research for this project enhanced security by using a lower probability of message detection and error correction technique at the physical layer of the internet model. The technology adds bits to messages and ensures that the messages cannot be decoded by eavesdroppers.  More specifically, the technology exploits degrading signals, noise, interference, and localization techniques to provide secure communication. The proposed technology uses less computation power than traditional approaches and is thus a great fit for biological sensors. This scheme achieves information confidentiality, integrity and authentication.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The University of Toledo (UT) was awarded an I-Corps grants to address the potential market for a technology that exploits Channel State Information (CSI) at the physical layer to introduce secrecy. The project was comprised of the PI Jared Oluoch; Entrepreneurial Lead Abdulsahib Albehadili, and Mentor Stuart Bertsch.  The intellectual merit of the project was a proposed technique that makes it impossible for an eavesdropper to decode a message by exploiting the temporal and spatial variations of the wireless communication network. The long-term goal of the project was to collaborate with Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) to create new devices and products with stronger security. The novelty of the proposed technique is that it targets the physical layer where the hard-wire, raw bit communication takes place.  The broader impacts of the proposed technology would be to secure communication at the physical layer thus protecting financial and healthcare institutions from loss of data due to security breaches. Initial interviews before the nation-wide customer discovery suggested potential market for the technology.  We conducted more than 100 interviews nationally from end users, wireless security experts, engineers at automotive companies, and OEMs. Some of the interview questions we asked end users in the customer discovery were as follows:  Do you use wireless networks regularly? What concerns you about wireless networks as it relates to privacy and security of information? How secure do you feel your wireless network is in protecting patient data?   For the design engineers at automotive companies, we asked the following questions.  Who do you buy from? How much time do you spend developing security software for the autonomous vehicle? How many solutions do you look at when making a make or buy decision? What would make you happy in order to buy a new solution in the future? Do you work with a certified integrator?   In developing our business thesis, we answered the following question. Who are our potential customers? We found out they are: automotive manufacturers, third party vendors of automotive equipment, and insurance companies.  The business hypothesis for our technology was this: Our technology saves design engineers at automobile companies? time, insurance, and money.  Our value proposition was that the technology reduces the possibility of a hacker gaining access to the communication system of a vehicle thus preventing theft of vehicles. Moreover, it prevents malicious vehicles from sending false alarms to other vehicles within their communication range thus reducing road traffic accidents and fatalities.  Why? Unauthorized access to driver-assisted technology leads to loss of revenue and reduces customer confidence in (Chrysler, Ford, GM?s) vehicles.     We developed a simulation framework that demonstrated that our technology is robust. We collaborated with an OEM in Ohio to explore the possibility of designing chips that embed our technology. We applied for funding from NSF AIR TT program to enable us get the financial resources to design prototypes for the technology.  However, we did not get the anticipated funding.  We are currently working on additional simulation platforms to predict the bit error rate and the performance of the technology under practical assumptions such as fading. The customer discovery process allowed us to confirm that there is a potential market for the proposed technology.       Last Modified: 02/05/2018       Submitted by: Jared Oluoch]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
