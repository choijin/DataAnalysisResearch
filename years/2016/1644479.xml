<AbstractNarration>As part of its overall strategy to enhance learning in informal environments, the Advancing Informal STEM Learning (AISL) program funds innovative resources for use in a variety of settings. This conference proposal represents the first phase of a larger three-phase participatory research project that will use communities of interest as a vehicle for solving problems of common concern about designing youth-based STEM programs. It will set the stage for research over the next 10-25 years about the long-term impact of a variety of youth programs on STEM learning and career aspirations. Through a virtual format, the Association of Science-Technology Centers will bring together two representatives from ten long-standing youth programs, experts in the field of out-of-school time youth programming, and researchers to collaboratively develop a program profile template for measuring the impact of youth programming. The program profile template will help identify specific characteristics that will capture the influence of youth programs on their participation in out-of-school STEM activities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The program profile template will be the main outcome from the conference. It will serve as the foundation for designing long-term impact studies that support the needs of program staff interested in improving youth programming in informal environments. It will also allow program staff and researchers to document and share intellectual capital, compare goals and features across programs, and support network efforts among informal agencies worldwide. The program profile template will be shared online through informalscience.org, the Association of Science-Technology Centers' communities of practice networks, and through other out-of-school-time national organizations.</AbstractNarration>

The Roads Taken project aims to provide knowledge that can be used by both youth program practitioners and researchers in a variety of institutional settings. For this reason, participation by practitioners, researchers, and other stakeholders was critical.  This first of the three phases in the Roads Taken project allowed the team to convene STEM and out-of-school time STEM professionals and researchers to prototype the Program Profiles process and gain an understanding of the tool?s strengths and weaknesses.  Lessons learned from the conference are summarized here and a detailed in the full conference report, Roads Taken &ndash; Long-term Impacts of STEM Youth Programs Virtual Conference Report, available at http://www.informalscience.org/roads-taken-long-term-impacts-stem-youth-programs-conference  Lessons from the Process  The virtual conference format allowed for a diversity of participants when travel cost and time for a face-to-face conference would have been prohibitive. The smaller breakout sessions allowed for the greatest input by participants. The format of two separate conference sessions with the task of completing a Program Profile between the two worked well for achieving our process goal. All organizations were able to complete their profile by the deadline with minimal input from project leaders. Input from the participants provided valuable insight for revising the template to ensure that multiple perspectives will inform future research.  Lessons from Prototyping the Program Profile  In conference break-out discussions, we learned that several additional fields should be considered for the Program Profiles:  Spectrum of Expertise in the Program: Participants wanted Program Profiles to indicate a range of expertise in the program related to strategies as well as the stage of development. Associated Programs: Some institutions had more than one program with prolonged engagement for underserved youth, often involving separate programs for middle-school age and high-school age participants.  Relationships beyond the Program: Participants reported that it would be useful for programs to share both internal and external opportunities for authentic work provided outside the program itself. Recruitment Methods: Revised Program Profiles need to include a description of recruitment and selection processes; that is, how youth find out about the program, apply to the program, and are selected to participate.  Funding and Financial Information: Participants reported that financial information can be sensitive with institutions preferring for some things to be shared only in aggregate.  Staffing: Participants asked for more information on (1) patterns of seasonal staffing changes, (2) youth participants per adult, and (3) youth per mentor.  Information Management, Evaluation, and Research: Conference participants suggested additional items focused on: program management and tracking alums, evaluation methods and studies, and research or long-term studies of participants after leaving the program. Alumni Relations and Engagement: We learned that alums provide role models for current participants, create a network in colleges and universities for current youth participants to connect into, and may provide the job resources for current participants.     Working with representatives from institutions that have long-term (10-25 year) youth programs, all of which grew out of the YouthALIVE! initiative, not only provided a history lesson for those unfamiliar with YouthALIVE!, but also brought them together virtually to network and learn from each other.
