<AbstractNarration>Postdoctoral Fellow: Dr. Chris A. Hamilton&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposal number: 1612862&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology for FY 2016, Broadening Participation of Groups Under-represented in Biology in partnership with the Tribal Colleges and Universities program in the Directorate for Education and Human Resources. The fellowship supports a research and training plan for the Fellow to engage in research and training that will increase the participation of groups underrepresented in biology.  The title of the research plan for this fellowship to Dr. Chris A. Hamilton is "Broadening Participation of Native Americans into Collections-Based Research: Testing Hypotheses on the Hawkmoth-Bat Evolutionary Arms Race." The host institution for this fellowship is The University of Florida and The Florida Museum of Natural History (FLMNH), and the sponsoring scientists are Dr. Akito Kawahara and Dr. Charles Cobb.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Fellow's research focuses on the evolution of morphological diversity in hawkmoths, a species-rich group of insects. This research enhances our understanding of how evolutionary pattern and process produced Earth's diversity, a key question in biology. Hawkmoths are large, charismatic moths that are strong, fast fliers, with a diverse array of forewing shape variation and body size, yet few studies have investigated the drivers of this spectacular morphological diversity. Between 50-60 million years ago, major evolutionary lineages of echolocating bats emerged, along with a large radiations of the Macroheterocera, a group of moth species that includes the hawkmoths. The Fellow is testing the intriguing but unexplored hypothesis that differences in hawkmoth wing shape and body size are associated with the diversity of their primary nocturnal predators - bats. This idea challenges the conventional hypothesis that moth diversification was driven by plant evolution (because plants are their food source). Across the approximately 1,500 species of hawkmoths, anti-bat traits can be found which include ears keen to a bat's ultrasonic echolocation and ultrasound-producing organs that "jam" bat biosonar. The fast flight of hawkmoths, also thought to be an anti-bat trait, likely provides the ability to escape predators and cover large distances as adult hawkmoths seek out food for themselves or host plants for their larvae. These extended periods of flight would render hawkmoths vulnerable to predation by bats, putatively providing a strong selective force that led to evasive anti-bat traits, diverse body sizes, and wing shapes able to support acrobatic evasive flight; however, no one has tested this hypothesis in a phylogenetic context.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project promotes the participation of Native American students in biology by using exciting research questions and an interactive learning approach to characterize hawkmoth wing shape, investigate the historical evolutionary sequence of anti-bat traits, and test for correlations between these traits and extant diversity. The Fellow is engaging middle and high school students from The Chickasaw Nation of Oklahoma, by utilizing museum collections at the FLMNH to answer fundamental hypotheses regarding patterns of diversity - effectively linking two of NSF's missions: increasing minority participation and increasing the utility of biological collections. This collaborative research introduces the students to the usefulness of natural history collections (students gather morphometric data on hawkmoth wing shape and body size), demonstrates how researchers can use these resources to answer fundamental biological questions, and sparks students? interest in evolution. In addition, Chickasaw Nation students are being exposed to their own cultural history during summer trips to the FLMNH; during this time they work in the collections, assist in DNA extraction and preparation for sequencing of hawkmoth species, and importantly, discover the history of their Chickasaw ancestors through interactions with archeological artifacts.</AbstractNarration>

The program uses the exciting bat-moth evolutionary arms race to get students out into nature, collect specimens (see photo), and teaches them how to participate in DNA extraction, prep work, and high-throughput sequencing with an Oxford Nanopore MinION (a miniature handheld sequencer ? see photo). Following sequencing, students take the assembled sequences, identify the CO1 barcode, and use BOLD (the largest repository of Lepidoptera barcodes) to determine the species they have collected. The students seemed to really enjoy the program, with some more interested in the field-work, while others enjoyed the genomics and coding focus. The outcomes of this outreach are being prepared to be submitted as a manuscript in STEM outreach/teaching. The success of this project is going to be employed in my new position at the University of Idaho, which has a significant percentage of my job description that is focused on STEM outreach with indigenous communities across Idaho.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From a research perspective, the fellowship allowed me to work in a group of organisms and questions (i.e., the bat/moth evolutionary arms race) that had interested me for a long time. During this research, I have been able to produce data looking at a number of questions across the Bombycoidea, a charismatic superfamily of moths that include the hawkmoths and silk moths. This research has produced a ?backbone? of evolutionary relationships of the superfamily Bombycoidea, a project that has investigated the evolutionary relationships of the Saturniidae subfamily Arsenurinae and an understanding of their wing shape evolution, an evaluation of evolutionary correlates of body size across the Sphingidae, used specimens in museum collections to understand the directional evolution of bat bite locations on moth wings, and produced a species-level phylogeny (evolutionary relationships) of the Saturniidae genus&nbsp;<em>Coloradia</em>, a high altitude, pine-feeding moth susceptible to rapid changes in climate, and a species-level phylogeny of the Sphingidae genus&nbsp;<em>Xylophanes</em>, a hyperdiverse genus of neotropical hawkmoth with fascinating biogeography and host-plant evolution. Additionally, I have designed specific lightboxes for photographing specimens at the FLMNH (see photo), and nearly 1500 specimens were photographed for morphological analysis, as well as nearly 400 specimens across other Bombycoidea families have had their DNA sequenced, to understand their evolutionary relationships. What we are finding is that the bat/moth evolutionary arms race between bats and bombycoid moths (in particular hawkmoths and silk moths) is one of the most fantastic evolutionary stories on the planet. The research opportunities provided by this PRFB fellowship have been instrumental to furthering our understanding of predator/prey interactions and allowing us to answer the questions about why species look the way they do, and why do they do what they do.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 07/03/2019<br>      Modified by: Chris&nbsp;A&nbsp;Hamilton</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1612862/1612862_10423663_1562127349213_kids_at_light--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1612862/1612862_10423663_1562127349213_kids_at_light--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Children at light"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1612862/1612862_10423663_1562127349213_kids_at_light--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Children at light"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Chickasaw Nation of Oklahoma children collecting moths at a light.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Chris Hamilton</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Chris&nbsp;A&nbsp;Hamilton</div> <div class="imageTitle">Children at light</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1612862/1612862_10423663_1562127454387_MinION--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1612862/1612862_10423663_1562127454387_MinION--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Portable genomics lab"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1612862/1612862_10423663_1562127454387_MinION--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Portable genomics lab"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">The portable lab I developed during this fellowship.
