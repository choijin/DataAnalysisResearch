<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project targets the fabrication of X-ray focusing devices for high photon energies in the range from 10 keV to &gt;100 keV, necessary for imaging, microtomography, and elemental and structural analyses of materials in spectral ranges and at resolutions unavailable today. Their primary use is in high-end synchrotron radiation facilities and in X-ray microscopes with X-ray tubes sources in specialized industrial and research environments. They form a special class of high-value consumables, with a functional life time of ~2.5 years, with capabilities to address the global market segment worth about $1M today for low and average performance diffractive focusing devices, to more than $4M, if the unprecedented performance devices will be developed. Availability of such focusing devices will enhance the scientific understanding of structure of matter at the nano-scale and the interplay of structure and functionality for applications ranging from drugs development to materials science, nano-electronics, biosciences, forensics, battery and energy research, investigating terrestrial soils or cosmic dust, the kinetics of ultra-fast chemical reactions, advanced catalysts, and others. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this project is twofold. First, the innovative method of fabrication is a combination of top-down and bottom-up processing. It includes the atomic layer deposition onto batch-fabricated cylindrical silicon precursors of sequences of low and high absorption and refractive index materials, with well-controlled layer thicknesses varying from few nm to micrometers according to the Fresnel zone rules, followed by polishing the wafer to form membranes with focusing devices embedded into them. Hundreds of zone plates can be produced on one wafer, minimizing the processing costs per device. Second, the method is extendable towards depositing sequences of more-than-two material layers, which enables the fabrication of step-wise graded index kinoforms ? devices with single foci and of ultimate diffraction efficiency. Phase I will address these issues by effectively assessing the capabilities for individual key processes and will prove the fabrication feasibility, while Phase II will deal with the fabrication and testing of prototypes with long runs of atomic layer deposition processes, as necessary for functional devices.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Manipulating matter and structure at atomic to several-nanometer length scales can lead to completely new material properties, drug principles, and device functionalities, as well as more energy efficient and cleaner ways of production. Yet, it is imperative to image and analyze the properties of matter and devices at the nanoscale to understand the underlying causes for their altered characteristics. This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project proved the feasibility of batch-producing groundbreaking X-ray focusing devices capable of unprecedented resolutions of 5 nm and possibly better, with spectral ranges from 10 keV to more than 100 keV. Such high-energy X-ray beams are mainly produced in synchrotron radiation facilities, but can also be produced with X-ray tubes. &nbsp;The demand for such high-energy X-ray sources is highlighted by the massive amounts of spending on new X-ray facilities worldwide and on advanced laboratory sources. Many synchrotron sources are currently undergoing costly upgrades to enable higher resolution X-ray microscopy via higher coherence and higher brilliance beams.&nbsp; Similarly, several companies are developing specialized X-ray tube sources with high brilliance microstructured anodes for the same purpose.&nbsp; However, all of these new sources lack adequate lenses to take maximal advantage of their beam quality for applications requiring focusing. Traditional Fresnel zone plate lenses are fabricated by high resolution electron beam lithography and etching or electroplating. The resolution limitation comes from the size range and aspect ratio of the zone plate nanostructures, required to be sub-10 nm and more than 100:1, respectively. The current fabrication techniques are at the limits of capabilities and life cycle ripeness, with little perspective for improvements. By contrast, the technology developed in the present project is completely disruptive, was proven to easily meet and overtake the devices requirements for current and future X-ray sources, and has the potential to dominate the market for many years to come.</p> <p>Figure 1 displays our innovative fabrication method, which starts from etching cylindrical pillars into silicon and applying a sidewall smoothing procedure.&nbsp; The method continues with atomic layer deposition (ALD) of a sequence (&ldquo;nanolaminate&rdquo;) of low and high absorption and refraction index materials around the pillars, with well-controlled layer thicknesses varying from few nm to micrometers according to the Fresnel zone rules.&nbsp; These layers form the diffractive lensing structures, without the use of costly and performance-limiting electron beam lithography or etching. Next, by applying a filling (Cu) material and polishing the wafer, we form membranes with focusing devices embedded into them as shown in Fig. 2a. Figure 3(c) shows a silicon wafer containing thousands of devices produced by our method.&nbsp; It illustrates how zone plates can be batch-produced this way on one wafer, thus minimizing the processing costs per device. Potential hurdles of the method, including the fabrication of very smooth, &ldquo;perfect&rdquo; cylindrical precursors and the deposition of high/low refractive material with precisely controlled layer thicknesses for the diffractive lenses, were successfully overcome. The roughness of cylindrical precursors&rsquo; sidewalls after smoothing was measured as 0.61 nm (rms) and nanolaminate layers down to 5 nm thicknesses were achieved as seen in Fig 2b. Integration of the various individual fabrication steps into one robust fabrication sequence was proven and adequate metrology techniques were established for each fabrication step.</p> <p>The final results are shown in Figures 3a and 3b.&nbsp; They show Si dies, each containing one or several 21-mm-thick Si membranes, with dozens of embedded, nanolaminate devices. &nbsp;During Phase I, the fabricated nanolaminate devices contained limited numbers of layers and served as test objects for the processing and integration steps.&nbsp; However, during Phase II, we will produce fully functional zone-plate devices by using long runs of ALD with the procedures refined during Phase I. Configurations and target characteristics for the future prototype devices have been established from extensive customer discussions to determine the needs of major X-ray equipment manufacturers as well as scientists from synchrotron and free electron laser X-ray facilities.</p> <p>Finally, it is important to mention that the technology is still young, with tremendous potential for future developments.&nbsp; The method is extendable towards depositing sequences of more-than-two material layers, which enables the fabrication of step-wise graded index diffractive devices (&ldquo;kinoforms&rdquo;) with single foci and of ultimate diffraction efficiency. Additionally, refinement of the sequential deposition processes, combined with the use of higher order foci or composite zone plate architectures, has the potential to extend the imaging and focusing resolution down to as low as 1 nm. In principle, such high-resolution imaging could enable studies such as the measurement of crystalline deformations around single atom impurities.&nbsp; Lastly, our zone plates can be integrated into silicon-based devices combining useful features such as actuation/positioning, scanning, beam monitoring and close loop adaptive focusing. We are in discussion with customers to learn the relative value that they place on these features, so that we may guide our research to achieve maximal commercial value.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 02/13/2018<br>      Modified by: Nicolaie&nbsp;A&nbsp;Moldovan</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1648219/1648219_10466607_1518540320123_Fig1f--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1648219/1648219_10466607_1518540320123_Fig1f--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Fig. 1.
