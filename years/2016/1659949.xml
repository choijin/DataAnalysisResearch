<AbstractNarration>1659949 - Ydstie&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant is to provide partial support for US-based young faculty and graduate students to attend the 2017 Foundations of Computer Aided Process Operations (FOCAPO) / Chemical Process Control (CPC) Conference that will be held in Tucson, Arizona, from January 8 to 12, 2017. The FOCAPO/CPC Conference has a focus on examining where the field of process control and operations is heading in relation to Big Data, Cyber Physical Systems, the Internet of Things, Optimization, and Machine Learning. The organizing committee, which consists of distinguished researchers with a broad range of skills in process systems engineering, will provide for a vibrant and diverse atmosphere that fosters exchange of ideas on research and education. It is anticipated that approximately 15 US-based young faculty and 30 graduate students will receive partial travel support to attend this conference.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:&lt;br/&gt;The continuing and rapid development of computer hardware and software systems enables advances in the areas of Cyber-Physical Systems, the Internet of Things, Big Data, and Data Analytics by integrating virtual and physical entities through information networks. Furthermore, ubiquitous computation, almost infinite data storage capabilities due to the migration from dedicated servers to the ?cloud?, and new algorithms for optimization and machine learning offer new opportunities for research and development in the area of process systems engineering and control&lt;br/&gt;The Conference will bring together researchers from academia and industry working in the area of process systems engineering.  The following topics will be explored:&lt;br/&gt;1. The Internet of Things, Big Data, Communication, Machine Learning and Large Scale Computations across the domains of control and process operations.&lt;br/&gt;2. Emerging technologies, areas of research and non-traditional application domains.&lt;br/&gt;3. Integration of strategic, tactical, and operational decisions through modeling, optimization, and control in dynamic systems with uncertainty and stochastic perturbations.&lt;br/&gt;4. Education and workforce development in a rapidly changing global environment.&lt;br/&gt;5. Future directions for industry implementation and academic research.&lt;br/&gt;The conference will provide a unique forum for academic researchers and industrial practitioners to assess the current status of research in this field and discuss future directions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:&lt;br/&gt;The US-based conference participants supported by this grant will have the opportunity to network with leading researchers in the field of Chemical Process Systems Engineering and Control, and to exchange ideas about the current status and future directions in research and education. They will benefit from state-of-the-art reviews and presentations by leading experts and by debating controversial points with their peers. The Conference will provide an opportunity for interaction and cooperation among industrial and academic researchers. This will be especially beneficial to the young researchers and could positively influence their professional development. The Conference will also include workshops on Model Predictive Control, Process Operations, and Machine Learning.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Project Summary  The 2017 FOCAPO/CPC conference was organized in Tucson AZ, Jan 8-12, 2017. The theme of the conference was Bringing Research to Practice and Practice to Research. There were over 200 participants from industry, government labs, and academia.  The conference reviewed current developments and identify future directions in areas of process operations and process control. The conference started Sunday, January 8, 2017 with parallel workshops on Model Predictive Control and Process Operations, followed by a joint workshop on Machine Learning. The conference proper started with a plenary lecture by Dr. Patrick Kennedy, Founder of OSIsoft, and continued with a welcome reception in the evening. The remainder of the conference had a parallel/joint format, with parallel morning and early afternoon sessions. Joint oral sessions and discussions took place Monday through Wednesday in the afternoon. Joint poster sessions were organized along the same themes and allowed for technical discussions and networking into the evening. Wednesday afternoon was dedicated to an industry-led discussion on workforce development. This session was followed by the conference banquet. Thursday morning was dedicated to the identification of future research directions through panel discussions and an ideation session. NSF funding provided support for travel expenses for young faculty, post-docs, and Ph.D. students who otherwise would find it difficult to secure funds to attend the conference.     Intellectual Merit  The conference brought together about 225 industry and university researchers and application engineers in the area of process systems engineering to assess what has been accomplished during the past five years and to examine where the field of process control and operation is heading in relation to Big Data, Cyber Physical Systems, the Internet of Things, Optimization, and Machine Learning.  The following topics were be explored:  The Internet of Things, Big Data, Communication, Machine Learning and Large-Scale Computations across the domains of control and process operations. Identify emerging technologies, areas of research and non-traditional application domains. Integrating strategic, tactical, and operational decisions through modeling, optimization, and control in dynamic systems with uncertainty and stochastic perturbations. Education and workforce development in a rapidly changing global environment. Future directions for industry implementation and academic research.   The results from the conference have been published on-line and in a special issue of Computers and Chemical Engineering.     Broader Impacts  The merging of the operations and controls is evident in industry and academia as process data, to an ever-increasing degree, is integrated with real-time decision-making, driven by changing markets. There are a large number of unsolved theoretical and practical problems to address as the historically separate fields of control and operations come together. Some of these problems are highlighted through initiatives such as the Smart Manufacturing Innovation Institute. One major outcome of the conference was that we identified technology gaps as these fields merge. Researchers from each sub-field came together to learn from each other and stake out new directions through discussions following the invited oral and poster presentations, discussion panels, and workgroup studies.
