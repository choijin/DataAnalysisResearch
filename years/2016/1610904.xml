<AbstractNarration>The electronic and magnetic devices that currently enable rapid information processing and massive data storage are formed in part using metallic structures with dimensions approaching 100 nanometers.  Often these devices function due to an applied flow of electrons, and this charge flow generates heat.  In many cases this heat limits the performance of these tiny devices and prevents gains in technology.  This project aims to explore ways to simultaneously avoid or exploit this heating by study of thermal effects in a particular nanoscale metallic magnetic device known as a non-local spin valve.  These devices are already known to allow generation of flows of angular momentum, or spin, in a metallic nanowire with no associated charge flow.   However, their operation usually requires large applied electron flows in other elements of the device.  The main motivation of this work is to provide the transformative knowledge of thermal effects in these devices that could eventually allow operation with only applied heat, eliminating the charge flow altogether.  This will enable simplification and further size reduction in future devices that could significantly advance data storage and other technologies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The metallic non-local spin valve is an invaluable, though still not thoroughly understood, device for producing and studying pure spin currents. The use of charge currents to produce spin currents in the NLSV was achieved ~15 years ago, and these sensors are poised to play an important role in near-term magnetic recording. However, the electrical injection of spin causes significant heating and thermoelectric effects that strongly affect the performance of the sensors are not yet well characterized and understood. The demonstration of spin injection in the non-local spin valve via purely thermal effects is of even greater interest. These very recent and novel measurements point the way toward implementation of such sensors without the large charge current, which offer many advantages for the ever smaller and more sensitive sensors or more efficient sources demanded by the information technology community.  This project takes advantage of unique expertise in creating and measuring thermal gradients and in measuring Seebeck and Peltier effects in nanoscale systems to understand and control heat and spin flow in metallic nanomagnetic devices. The unique ability to directly measure the thermal properties (thermal conductivity, Seebeck, and Peltier coefficients) of the thin film constituents of nanoscale devices using micromachined thermal isolation platforms is a central focus of the project. By removing the bulk substrate from beneath a nanoscale device or thin film, the uncertainty in the direction of heat flow is dramatically reduced, modeling the structure via finite element methods becomes much simpler, and engineering the thermal gradients applied to the nanoscale structures is possible. Specific tasks include: 1) Understanding interface and materials dependence of the spin-dependent Seebeck effect and the absolute Seebeck effect, 2) the Search for magnon-drag contributions, 3) Studies of thermoelectric effects and the spin injection in "zero substrate" devices, and 4) Thermally engineering response of sensors via external thermal gradients.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[Generation of heat in the tiny wires and elements that form modern nanoelectronics remains a limitation on building faster computers.  New strategies to avoid or use this heating are needed to continue advances in complexity of computational tasks.  The overlapping fields of spintronics and spin caloritronics aim to develop these strategies by harnessing the information-carrying ability of the electron spin, and understanding the related effects of heat on this angular momentum.     Our project focused on a particular aspect of this interaction in a nanoscale circuit called a non local spin valve (NLSV) being explored for magnetic sensing and switching technologies.  This device uses magnetic nanowires as sources of angular momentum flow, that travels in a nonmagnetic material and is detected some distance away by another ferromagnetic nanowire.  The ability to generate the angular momentum flow makes these tools powerful probes of fundamental materials physics and device efficiency.     The project had outcomes in both Intellectual Merit and impacts beyond the specific field of spintronics and spin caloritronics. These are outlined below.    Intellectual Merit:    Explored thermal effects in tiny magnetic circuits that may one day play an important role in magnetic sensing and nanoelectronics applications. Clarified the different roles of thermal phenomena that cause flow of pure angular momentum (or spin) associated with electrons, and those that also generate flow of charge. Developed powerful techniques for quantifying these effects by building sub-micron circuits on suspended thin membranes. Developed tools to understand the thermal gradients in these thin membranes, that are essentially two-dimensional from a thermal standpoint.   These tools in turn allow determination of the size of these thermally generated effects as a function of temperature, providing information useful in a broader range of experiments.    These results were disseminated in talks and posters at conferences and university seminars, and in 2 papers already published and a number of others in various stages of the editorial process at the end of the funded period.    Broader Impact:    Technical training of two PhD students (one defended in 2016 and one to defend in 2020) both of whom are from groups traditionally under-represented in physics and engineering.  Development of infrastructure for a broader range of experiments performed with e-beam lithographically patterned circuits on suspended membranes.  Outreach activities included conference planning and organization (both of smaller local conferences and contribution to large conferences such as the APS March Meeting as a Focus Topic organizer for GMAG and a range of service to the Magnetism and Magnetic Materials conferences including Program Chair in 2019). Public engagement activities included interviews and talks to engage the broader DU and Denver communities such as the DU "Engaging Ideas" series, public talks at DU alumni events, and appearances on local TV news.
