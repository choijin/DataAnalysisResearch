<AbstractNarration>Some emergency department (ED) patients experience long delays in being transferred from the ED to a bed within the main hospital, a phenomenon called ED boarding. While ED boarding can be caused by surges of demand in the ED, it also can be caused by operating policies in the hospital wards where the patient needs a bed. To properly understand ED boarding, it is necessary to take a broader view, looking at the rest of the hospital in addition to the ED itself.  The problem of ED boarding and other patient flows in hospitals can be modeled as multi-class networks of queues. Accordingly, this research will develop new ways to analyze complex data-driven queueing network models in healthcare.  This research will draw on the extensive experience with queueing network models to reduce congestion and improve the efficiency of manufacturing, computer and communication systems.  The queueing network models needed in healthcare are more complicated because they require (i) classifying patients and resources, with priorities, and (ii) accounting for time-varying arrival rates and complicated stochastic dependence in the patient flows.  Healthcare presents a new opportunity for fruitful applications of these queueing network models because the models can be fit to healthcare patient flow data, which are rapidly becoming available.  In undertaking this research, the PI remains committed to helping to develop new researchers from traditionally under-represented groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will develop new tractable data-driven analytical approximations and simulation methods for time-varying multi-class queueing network models.  New approximation methods will combine the recently developed robust optimization with established approximations for stochastic processes based on heavy-traffic limits and partial characterizations of stochastic dependence, such as indices of dispersion.  A new robust queueing (RQ) formulation is proposed for exposing the performance impact of the time dependence and stochastic dependence in the flows. The new RQ formulation is based on the cumulative rate and variance of each flow for each class, represented as the total input of work as functions of time. The research will investigate if the new RQ optimization is effective and tractable; i.e., if it can indeed expose the impact of the time dependence and stochastic dependence on the performance of the queue.  The impact of priorities also will be studied. Computer simulation will be used to evaluate the approximations and also directly as a performance analysis tool.  This research will investigate new simulation methods for these time-varying models, including a new rare-event simulation method for the time-varying single-server queue. The methods will be tested by experiments with simulation and system data.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ As illustrated by the long-standing problem of emergency department (ED)  boarding, i.e., the long delays some patients experience in being transferred from the ED to a bed within the main hospital, managing congestion in healthcare requires viewing the full system as a multi-class network of queues; e.g., the ED boarding depends on operating policies in the main hospital wards as well as in the ED's themselves.  Fortunately, there is considerable experience with queueing network models because they already have been used to reduce congestion and thus improve the efficiency of manufacturing, computer and communication systems.  However, the networks of queues arising in healthcare have their own special character. the queueing network models in healthcare are complicated because they require  (i) classifying patients and resources, with priorities, and (ii) accounting for time-varying arrival rates and complicated stochastic dependence in the patient flows.  On the other hand, there is a new opportunity for fruitful applications of these queueing network models because they now can be combined  with healthcare patient flow data, which is rapidly becoming available.   In response, this research developed new ways to analyze complex data-driven queueing network models in healthcare. Research success should help improve quality of healthcare and reduce cost.  This research developed new tractable analytical approximations and simulation methods for these challenging new time-varying multi-class queueing network models.  New approximation methods were developed by combining robust optimization with established approximations based on indices of dispersion and heavy-traffic limits.  A new robust queueing (RQ) formulation was developed to expose the time dependence and stochastic dependence in the flows.  The new formulation includes the rate and variance of each flow for each class, represented as the total input of work, as functions of time.  Completed research showed that the new RQ optimization is effective and tractable; i.e., that it can be used to expose the impact of the time dependence and the stochastic dependence on the performance of the queue.  The effectiveness of new algorithms was studied by computer simulation.  Simulation was used both to evaluate the approximations and also directly as a performance analysis tool. New simulation algorithms were developed to investigate new simulation methods for these time-varying models, including a new rare-event simulation method for the time-varying single-server queue.  Some methods were  tested by experiments with simulation and healthcare system data.  Much more needs to be done, but significant progress was completed.
