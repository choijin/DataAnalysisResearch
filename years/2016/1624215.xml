<AbstractNarration>Collaborative Research: Research Initiation Grant in Engineering Education: Development of Innovation Capacity in Engineering Students through Virtual Internships&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The foundation for this Research Initiation Grant in Engineering Education is to understand whether the use of an immersive learning environment (epistemic game) can increase the ability of engineering students to develop innovative product designs. Innovation is a key 21st Century Skill and is important for allowing the United States to retain its competitive edge within industry. It is also a skill that can set engineering students apart when it comes time for them to seek a position within industry. The epistemic game being tested creates a virtual work environment for students, which allows them to actively participate in a product design company, interact with group design members, complete tasks for their virtual manager and gain input from consultants within the company on whether their design is meeting the needs of the company. Students will also interact with end use customers for their design which will help them develop a better understanding of the role customer input plays in the product design process.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Research Initiation project will provide a unique opportunity for the PI to determine the effectiveness of epistemic games as an instructional tool for teaching engineering students about product design. This project will also provide a great opportunity for the PI and the graduate student involved to learn more about qualitative and quantitative research techniques in education and how these can be applied to measure innovation within product design. It is anticipated that this project will allow for the PI to make new connections with other researchers within the engineering education field that will lead to future projects exploring the coupling of innovation and game based instructional tools.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This Research Initiation Grant in Engineering Education provided the opportunity to study the role that customer focus groups can have on engineering students' design process within an epistemic game environment.  Epistemic games are activities where students are immersed in the role of an individual within their career field.  As part of this project, students served the role as engineering interns for a product design company called Nephrotex.  In this role, they were required to work in teams with one another, receive input from key stakeholders within the company and create the design of a hemodialysis membrane which could be used for the treatment of individuals impacted by kidney failure.  This grant enabled the students to get exposure to customers through a customer focus group that was included as part of the epistemic game.  Over the course of the grant, we studied how the inclusion of the customer focus group impacted the designs that were being generated by the students.  In particular, we were interested in whether the students spoke about their design process differently when they were exposed to customers and if this changed their approach to the design.  We also investigated whether students were capable of creating a design that was innovative in nature when working within this simulated design environment.  Intellectual Merit:  Innovation is a critical skill for students that are entering into the workplace today.  This project provided the opportunity to identify whether a simulated working environment (epistemic game) could be used to help students create innovative designs given that the environment they are working within is more constrained than a traditional working environment.  In addition, the exposure that students were able to get to customers, through the inclusion of customer focus groups, provided a new opportunity to teach students about the important role that a customer can serve in product development.  We observed that students appeared to change the way they thought about customers as they moved through this process and developed a better view of the diverse types of customers that have an impact on product design.  Alongside this development, they also were still capable of producing very high quality designs.  Broader Impacts: This project provided the opportunity to learn more about how epistemic games can be used to teach students about product design and innovation.  Although games have been used in diverse instructional settings for a number of years, there is still a need for additional information on how this approach to teaching can benefit students in the classroom.  This project was also beneficial in its ability to train a new generation of engineering education researchers that will be interested in undertaking further work in this field.  In particular, this project has involved the work of three different undergraduate students, one graduate student as well as the development of the Principal Investigator as an engineering education researcher.  The results from this study are currently in the process of being published in conferences and journals that align with the focus areas of this work so that they can benefit the greater engineering education community.
