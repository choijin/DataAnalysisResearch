<AbstractNarration>This project will develop a virtual department across four partner campuses to provide computer science education to students at campuses that are individually too small to support this kind of department.  The new department will focus on the analysis of "big data" - large sets of computational and observational data - that are becoming increasingly prevalent in STEM.  Cyber-learning techniques such as recorded lectures, archived materials, blog participation, and active learning approaches will be combined to offer a set of classes in big data science spanning meteorology, environmental science, biology and chemistry. By combining students from different campuses into the same courses, problems with minimal resources and limited potential enrollments on the individual campuses can be overcome.  In particular, the project will focus on developing courses in biology and earth science, areas where students are not attracted by traditional computer science classes.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will develop a flexible, blended learning model and effective learning assessment tools that can be implemented across multiple disciplines and institutions. The major goals and corresponding objectives of the project are to:&lt;br/&gt;1) Develop and implement high quality and relevant Computational and Data-Enabled Science and Engineering (CDSE) courses in mathematical modeling, data mining, genomics and bioinformatics, and problems in atmospheric and hydrospheric science using active learning and research-based teaching methodologies that promote inter-institutional and interdisciplinary collaboration. &lt;br/&gt;2) Use innovative web-based technologies, to develop and implement learning assessment tools to gauge achievement of students from diverse backgrounds and contexts. &lt;br/&gt;3) Develop, implement, and test an expanded CDSE pedagogical network in which resource sharing allows institutions of all sizes and types to consistently and sustainably offer CDSE coursework. &lt;br/&gt;Instructors from different campuses will be paired in a peer teaching/peer review model for course design and implementation.  Including pairs of instructors from different institutions ensures that (1) each instructor will gain the knowledge and experience to teach a new course that is originally developed by the other instructor; and (2) the courses are thoroughly reviewed and revised by peers. The coalition will share its discoveries in building inter-institutional teaching efficiency, undergraduate research opportunities, and learning assessment via online networks, new coalition partners, conferences, and publications.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[      The NSF project entitled "Engaged Student Learning Coalition for Undergraduate Computational Data-enabled Science &amp; Engineering Education" was led from Adams State University in the period January 2017 through December 2020. The overarching motivations for the project were to solve STEM educational barriers at small institutions, especially in courses requiring big data, and to provde the Computational and Data-Enabled Science and Engineering (CDSE) training essential for a complete undergraduate STEM education. &#8232;The IUSE project created a coalition of four institutional partners [Adams State University (ASU), Alamosa, CO; Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University (ERAU), FL; Hampden-Sydney College (HSC), VA; Bethune-Cookman University (BCU)] who&#8232; collaborated to integrate CDSE coursework into the undergraduate curriculum and embed authentic research experiences based &#8232;on a Course-based Undergraduate Research Experience (CURE) pedagogical model. The creation of virtual departments consisting of coalitions of institutions built the teaching efficiency, research opportunities, and capacity to offer CDSE degree programs and student enrollments to sustain them.  Major activities included three goals: (1) Revising and Improving Courses Developed in Precursor NSF Grants, (2) Developing New Courses, (3)  Expanding the Network of Participating Institutions.  These goals are accomplished through activities and objectives as shown in the attached image. The  goals and activities all occurred and were in support of the project's objectives, all of which have been successfully attained. Courses have been improved, new courses developed, and the network of participating institutions significantly expanded in addition to various presentations and publications made during the period of this effort. An additional and unanticipated broad impact resulting from our project efforts was creation of the Master Degree Program in Data Science (MSDS) at ERAU, which in two years recruited 14 students.  The project made a dramatic impact on the ability of a variety of institutions, including those that serve traditionally underserved students, to provide education on topics forming the forefront of current research that they otherwise would have been unable to provide.   The project also enabled student access to the high-performance computing resources necessary to pursue hands-on research in these topics. The dramatic impact of the project on students is made clear in the two videos, created by Abe Rosenberg (an ASU alumnus hired by Dr. Ikle) for the NSF-sponsored STEM for all video hall showcases in 2019 and 2020. Those videos are at https://stemforall2019.videohall.com/presentations/1423 and https://stemforall2020.videohall.com/presentations/1733 respectively.   The adoption of the use of intelligent tutoring systems in the CDSE courses is a new practice that is bringing innovations to learning at coalition institutions. The datasets produced by the project are designed to be available for public use. The research publications have been published in Open Access journals or available without an access fee.  The students that engaged in authentic research, be it through the courses or through independent apprenticeship, learned a great deal about data analysis and presentation as well as  how to disseminate results to a broad audience.  These skills will serve these students well in the development of their careers.  As collaborating faculty develop capacity to author courses that use intelligent tutoring systems it will be possible to include these resource in the family of Open Learning Initiative (OLI) courses available at http://oli.cmu.edu as .  The primary direct student-centered outcome was refinement of methodologies beyond synchronous remote instruction. The project has been instrumental in improving the ways in which we offer remote classes and in understanding the benefits of synchronous versus asynchronous modalities. The project provided insights into effective cyber-learning and teaching strategies that promote diversity within the STEM workforce. Students benefitted from new courses and learning assessment strategies as performance data and student and faculty input drove course improvement.
