<AbstractNarration>One of the four key recommendations of the Nuclear Science Advisory Committee's 2015 Long Range Plan (LRP) included increasing investment in small-scale and mid-scale projects and initiatives that enable forefront research at universities and laboratories. The LRP also encourages education and workforce development as well as research and development into state-of-the-art tools and techniques for nuclear science. This project, the development of a particle physics detector at Chicago State University and California Polytechnic State University, will enable the transfer of knowledge from an international collaboration of world-class physicists and engineers at Europe's Large Hadron Collider (LHC) to our universities. This will provide unique opportunities to train undergraduate students in electronics, detection techniques, laser technology, data analysis, and instrumentation interface. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Fast Interaction Trigger Detector (FIT) proposed here is an instrument that meets specific requirements as the Minimum Bias trigger for one of the particle detector systems (called ALICE) at the LHC: (a) The capability to discriminate beam-beam interactions with a 99% efficiency for the collisions generated by the LHC at a rate of 50 kHz for Pb-Pb collisions and a rate of 200 kHz for p-p and p-Pb collisions. (b) The capability to provide a start signal for the rest of the ALICE detectors (Level 0 trigger) with a time resolution better than 30 ps. In addition to these design parameters, the FIT detector will provide the following measurements: (a) Charged particle multiplicity (b) Interaction reaction plane (c) First measurement of the collision vertex position. FIT will also be the key detector to provide direct feedback to the LHC. It will be the first of the ALICE detectors to be turned on to perform beam tuning and monitor online luminosity. These characteristics, not available in any instrument provided by a vendor, require the development of a unique instrument at the vanguard of trigger detectors for high energy nuclear and particle physics.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The ALICE experiment at the CERN Large Hadron Collider explores the behavior of matter at very high density, corresponding to conditions a fraction of a second after the Big Bang.  ALICE collects data from collisions of lead nuclei at the highest energies achieved in a laboratory using the most advanced detector technology developed for physics research.  Funding for this project was used to develop the ALICE Fast Interaction Trigger (FIT) detector upgrade, based on fast MCP-PMT photon sensor technology.  The FIT detector is one of the most crucial components of ALICE because it enables all other data collection for the most interesting collision events.  Undergraduate student participants developed technical skills in hardware testing and software development for simulations that are easily transferable to the industrial workforce.  They had the opportunity to collaborate with scientists and engineers from all over the world, expanding their professional networks and exposing them to other cultures and professional experiences.  A peer-reviewed publication on the performance of MCP-PMT photosensors in strong magnetic fields will inform future detector development projects and could enable new commercial technology applications.  Results from ALICE that rely on the FIT detector will be published in many articles that will provide a deeper understanding of the primordial composition of matter and shed light on the cosmological evolution of the universe.
