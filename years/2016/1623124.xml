<AbstractNarration>The Extracting Salient Scenarios from Interaction Logs (ESSIL) project proposes to develop a new type of educational technology to support students' learning about complex systems from their participation in a multi-person immersive simulation.  Many important challenges we face today as a society -- including responding to climate change, managing global economies, city planning, disease outbreaks -- are "complex systems" problems, meaning that important phenomena in each (for instance trends in weather, stock bubbles, traffic jams, disease transmission) result not from a single cause, but because many small causes combine together. Participating in a simulation has the potential to help students understand the principles of complex systems, but because different principles surface depending on how each simulation unfolds, it can be difficult for teachers to adjust their lesson plans on the fly to highlight the principles that emerge in a given simulation run. To address this challenge, ESSIL will develop methods to create "automatic salient recaps," as a way to help learners and their teachers make better sense of simulations. These recaps, which will be automatically generated, provide a story of "what happened" in the simulation in a way that both helps students remember their experience and reveals important scientific principles. Teachers and other facilitators will use these recaps, along with an accompanying discussion guide, to support productive learning conversations about the scientific principles incorporated in a simulation. The recaps will be developed for a large-scale immersive simulation installed at the New York Hall of Science (NYSCI), potentially improving the educational experience of thousands of daily visitors.  The capabilities developed to produce them have widespread applicability, because logs of student interactions are routinely produced by many educational systems.  The project is supported by the Cyberlearning and Future Learning Technologies Program, which funds efforts that will help envision the next generation of learning technologies and advance what we know about how people learn in technology-rich environments. Cyberlearning Exploration (EXP) Projects explore the viability of new kinds of learning technologies by designing and building new kinds of learning technologies and studying their possibilities for fostering learning and challenges to using them effectively. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The immersive simulation context for the project is Connected Worlds, an embodied, multi-person ecology simulation at NYSCI, with pedagogical goals around sustainability and systems thinking. Using logs from groups of students interacting with Connected Worlds, ESSIL will construct selective recaps of their experience that both are personally salient to them (by including memorable details of their experience) and have explanatory coherence (to enable their discussion of important interconnections in the simulation's underlying model). Artificial Intelligence-based methods will be developed to 1) identify salient changes in the state of the simulation during  student interaction and 2) construct qualitative models of causal chains that could have led to these changes. These qualitative models will be used to generate salient recaps and discussion guides based on them, which will be provided to teachers whose classes are visiting NYSCI. The effectiveness of the innovation will be investigated by comparing visiting students' conversations with and without ESSIL-generated discussion supports and by interrogating their resulting models of the Connected Worlds system through concept maps.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The research focus of ESSIL, an interdisciplinary project combining research in AI and the learning sciences, was to develop methods that support the analysis and visualization of student interactions with museum-based immersive simulations. ESSIL worked with data from groups of students interacting with the Connected Worlds (CW) immersive ecology simulation at The New York Hall of Science.

The simulation system records the plants, animals and water levels in each biome across time. The simultaneous actions of multiple participants result in complex responses from CW, enabling investigation of student learning of systems thinking and causal reasoning.  Our research efforts focused on  identifying boundaries between periods of stable water flow to support reasoning about causes of changes in the biomes; designing ways to help teachers and students identify effects of students’ actions on system dynamics; and, generating multiple visualizations of the state of the simulation to support student engagement with systems thinking.   The rich causal relationships in CW, simultaneous participation of many group members, and changing dynamics make it difficult to determine the causes of changes in CW from observation alone. ESSIL addressed this challenge by developing methods to automatically segment into a set of periods the effects of students’ activities on the CW environment. Each period  represents stable dynamics of water flow in the system (e.g., increased or decreased water flow to the jungle). The boundaries between periods indicate major changes in these dynamics. A complex session is thus broken into smaller periods that are more readily understood.  We hypothesized that such segments would constitute "human interpretable time periods", and the visualization of these periods would support students and teachers in understanding the effects of students actions on the simulation.   Outcomes of the ESSIL’s AI research efforts include the following:  Supporting the generation of relevant summaries of CW system dynamics: These summaries aim to assist teachers in effectively engaging students in discussions about their experiences with CW. We employed unsupervised machine learning (ML) algorithms to build models for segmenting multidimensional time series into time periods. These models were used to segment the simulation-log time series data into a set of human interpretable periods representing students’ interactions in the system. The initial ML approach required choosing in advance the number of periods. Subsequently, we investigated use of Bayesian non-parametric methods to jointly learn the number of periods along with other model parameters.  Figure 1 provides an example of an inferred period sequence, showing periods' differences in the amounts and rate of water flow to each biome. Empirical investigations showed this visualization helped people identify distinct periods of student activity.  Developing a system integrating CW data with visualization methods:   This integrated interactive visualization system enabled analysis of students’ activities at three levels of granularity as shown in Figure 2: an animation of a "birds eye view" of students’ activities and their effect on the environment; charts of the numbers of plants and animals in each biome; and the salient periods inferred by the AI algorithm. Students and teachers can choose biomes and query for changes in their water levels across time. The system needed to be efficient so students and teachers could discuss the outcomes of student CW  activities soon after they completed interacting with CW.  One especially interesting outcome from this system was that when 5th graders saw these visualizations, they could remember much that transpired during their visit from looking at the video and graphs.  We were especially pleased to discover that students did not have trouble reading the graphs or coordinating the various representations.  An important difference from prior research showing student difficulty in reading graphs may be that these graphs represent the students’ own work.  Addressing  the "interpretability problem" for immersive simulation settings, a major ML challenge: We compared human interpretability of the output of the ML models by (1) selecting a set of models that segmented CW state changes into coherent periods of time; (2) designing tests for computing an interpretability score representing how well a model’s output aligns with people’s expectations for CW state; (3) empirically evaluating different models in a user study.  Figure 3 shows a sample "forward simulation" test; it presents people with a number of plausible model outputs and asks them to select the one they think the model produced. We found that a model using a fully Bayesian approach excelled, performing well on both statistical optimization and human-interpretability optimization measures.
