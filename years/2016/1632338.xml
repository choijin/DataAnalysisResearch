<AbstractNarration>This project conducts a natural experiment to ask how inequality arises out of an unstratified economy, and which traits preadapt certain individuals and groups to differentially succeed under economic diversification. Rapid social and economic change offer many new opportunities that are of possible benefit to individuals. However, adopting new modes of social organization and ways of making a living are also risky because traditional knowledge may be inadequate when evaluating the costs and benefits of pursuing unfamiliar behaviors. This situation is widespread in many societies encountering new markets. This process, which is currently poorly understood, is of particular importance because social and wealth inequality emerge as a result of market access. Thus, here we seek to learn, when novel opportunities are introduced, why are some individuals and families better able to take advantage of the situation, while others try and fail or continue to rely on traditional and conservative lifeways?  The negative impact of income inequality is of growing concern both in both the popular press and academic literature because of its associations with quality of life indicators, including patterns of health, education and aging. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To answer the question of how inequality emerges within a group of people, and to address broader concerns regarding its negative impacts, University of Utah researchers Drs. Karen L. Kramer and Ryan Schacht will work with a group of rural Maya. This study population provides an ideal opportunity to explore the emergence and consequences of inequality for two key reasons: 1) the Maya have only recently had regular access to wage labor and economic markets and are just beginning to show signs of inequality in wealth, health, and education; 2) working with the Maya helps the researchers to account for many of the confounding factors that confuse a clear interpretation of associations between inequality and negative outcomes in the West. The researchers will test the hypothesis that risk orientation is a key determinant for the emergence of inequality. The central prediction is that preexisting variation in kin and non-kin network size affects risk orientation and subsequently facilitates the differential accumulation of wealth (land, consumer goods, cash, education, health) by some more than others. The project integrates a network and risk sensitivity approach to study decision-making under diversifying socioeconomic conditions. Their research findings will offer insight not only to the consequences looming for many small-scale societies currently undergoing economic and wealth transitions, but also to industrialized populations experiencing ever increasing levels of wealth inequality.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Research motivation &amp; question   Economic development has transformative effects on small-scale societies worldwide. To the people living in those societies, however, new ways of making a living, spending time and investing in children also introduces a classic risk management problem. New opportunities may offer benefits, but leaving behind the old and committing to the unfamiliar also have hidden costs and uncertainties. This situation is widespread among contemporary small-scale societies as they encounter the market economy, schooling and alternative livelihoods for the first time, and arose throughout the human history as decisions were made about which technologies, resources and strategies to retain and which to replace. How individuals and families vary in their adoption of new behaviors is what motivated this project, and has led to a better understanding of why responses differ and the effect on society as a whole when some make changes while others maintain the status quo.  In the Maya study community located in a remote, rural area of the Yucatan Peninsula, Mexico, a paved road built in the early 2000s initiated sweeping economic development. The road introduced access to mechanized farming and permitted crop surpluses to be transported to market, children to schools, and adults to wage labor jobs outside the village. The market integration that followed interrupted an otherwise stable way of life. For example, Maya parents face new decisions about family size and how to invest in children &ndash;whether to send them to school and forgo their time and agricultural contributions to the household, whether to leverage debt and invest in mechanized farming, or to become a wage laborer, abandon farming and commit to buying food. This circumstance offers a natural experiment to observe how people navigate reproductive and economic decisions on a quickly changing landscape.  Project outcomes  Project aims and intellectual merit build on the strengths of longitudinal data, utilize risk sensitivity and analyses of variance and take a multilevel approach integrating individual, network and community-level data to study economic and reproductive decisions under market integration.  1) We found that the early stage of market integration is best characterized by uncertainty (payoffs to new opportunities are unknown). When faced with new ways of making a living, some families redouble their efforts in what they know well while others take advantage of new opportunities. This is the case for both economic and reproductive decisions.  Here we find that some parents continue to depend on traditional rules of thumb, using what they know about the number of children they can support under their traditional economy and have large families, while others forego their children’s labor, have fewer children, find ways to generate capital and send their children to school.   Although Maya women adopted family planning as it became available, they initially did so at the end of their reproductive careers, which had no effect on family size. Rather parents hedge their bets, and wait almost a decade before they are confident that committing to smaller families will be beneficial.    2)  At the level of Maya society, economic and reproductive responses are associated with increased inequality. Variation in wealth, status, education, sharing group size and fertility within the population all significantly increased over the past 20 years. This swing is significant because it gives the foothold for social stratification and inequality to emerge at many levels.  3) Analyses suggest that cultivating a diverse set of traditional and new economic activities has higher financial returns and larger households are better able to diversify.  Thus, moderate levels of fertility appear to maximize economic outcomes, whereas families that are too small or too large are less diverse and economically successful. This helps to resolve why fertility often stalls at moderate levels.   4) Economic development is often assumed to erode local networks and indigenous language use. However, we find an unexpected and positive association between the two. Bilingualism is maintained because each language provides complementary network functions. The Maya maintain traditional networks while folding in new network relationships, and add Spanish to their indigenous language repertoire.   Broader impacts  The broader impacts of this study to the public have included: 1) a program of community outreach, training and participation among indigenous Maya in Yucatan, Mexico; 2) fostering academic and nonacademic relationships across the U.S.&ndash;Mexico border; 3) disseminating study results to Maya community members, local schools and health clinics; 4) documenting critical land features valuable in preserving traditional cultural knowledge;  5) developing methods to articulate climate change and traditional cultural knowledge; 6) presenting project findings to regional leaders and non-academic audiences in Mexico; 7) making anonymized data publicly accessible to scholars and institutions; 8) reporting findings in academic journals and at national and international conferences.
