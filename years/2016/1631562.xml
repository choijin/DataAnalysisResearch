<AbstractNarration>The purpose of this project is to support the participation of a select group of US-based PhD students in the doctoral consortium at the 2016 International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI). IJCAI is a premier conference in Artificial Intelligence (AI), drawing wide domestic and international participation, including many top researchers. In particular, the doctoral consortium seeks to broaden the participation of underrepresented groups in this field of research, and we expect to have diverse participation in terms of gender, ethnic background, academic institution, and geographic location. In addition to technical exposure, this experience will give students the opportunity to interact with a broad range of researchers and educators involved in the AI field. This will help the students to become members of the international community of scholars, and to develop into the global scientists that are needed for the future. In the longer term, having engaged and informed scientists will help advance science and high-tech industry in the US.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The wide variety and significance of the topics typically presented at IJCAI, in both the technical program and the doctoral consortium, will provide a great opportunity for students to share, exchange information, and learn from each other and from the best in the field. Participation in a conference is a great motivator for graduate students, and we expect the IJCAI doctoral consortium will generate additional long-term interest among graduate students in pursuing a research-oriented career in artificial intelligence.  Doctoral consortium participants will also have the opportunity to receive feedback on their doctoral research from established scientists who will serve as mentors throughout the proceedings.</AbstractNarration>

IJCAI is a premier conference in Artificial Intelligence, drawing wide domestic and international participation, including many top AI researchers. The doctoral consortium was held before the start of the main conference to enable the students to participate in all aspects of both the conference and the doctoral consortium. The doctoral consortium included other students from non-US universities, who were not funded from this grant.  The doctoral mentoring consortium consisted of a full day of activities, including:  An invited talk by Laura Hiatt (Naval Research Lab, Washington, DC) on "Talking about Research"  A panel discussion on academic, industrial, and government careers in topics related to artificial intelligence.  The Career Panel consisted of Sven Koenig, Professor, University of Southern California; Jimmy Lee, Professor, The Chinese University of Hong Kong; Doina Precup, Associate Professor, McGill University, Canada; and Laura Hiatt, Naval Research Lab, Washington, DC.  Brief "lightning talks" by each of the 42 students who participated in the doctoral consortium (including 24 US-based students)  In order to participate in the doctoral consortium, students had to apply and be accepted by a review panel.  Their application consisted of: an extended abstract on their thesis work, a curriculum vitae, and a personal statement. Only students registered as a full-time student at a higher education institution in the US, as certified by a signed letter from the institution, were eligible for funding under this grant. Student applications from underrepresented groups and from students in smaller programs who do not have the same mentoring and networking opportunities as students in larger programs were particularly encouraged. The major outcome is that the doctoral consortium helped in building a broader professional community among the students and other participants, and provided career mentoring.  In particular, students had the opportunity to network with other peers and more senior researchers, affording opportunities for scientific collaboration, constructive feedback on their thesis work, experience presenting and discussing research, and career development.
