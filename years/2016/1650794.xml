<AbstractNarration>a technical description &lt;br/&gt;This proposal is to catalyze a new collaborative effort with Prof. Matthew Hall of the University of Nottingham, UK, to imitate biological systems such as vascular network in human/animal skin and engineer stabilized soils as thermoregulatory building elements. Prof Hall is a leading researcher on stabilized soils, who has access to unique facilities required to study hygrothermal behavior of soils. Research conducted by his group has opened up the possibility of engineering stabilized soils to control their hygrothermal properties. The PI?s recent work on biomimetics and Prof Hall?s research on hygrothermal behavior of stabilized soils complement each other, and together they would bring synergistic value to long-term research on this theme.&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this new collaborative effort lies in how a passive thermoregulatory behavior of stabilized soil could be transformed to an active behavior through biomimetic design of soil samples using plant fibers. Through an understanding of the microcirculation in skin enabling the differences between tissue and blood temperatures to be reconciled, and regulation of body core temperature through manipulation of heat production and losses, stabilized soil will be engineered to mimic the highly-evolved skin systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;a non-technical explanation &lt;br/&gt;The new scientific direction facilitated by this CNIC project will have broad impact in three dimensions: i) it will develop a formal basis for the sustainable practice of engineering construction using natural materials (soil- and plant-based), ii) it will imitate the energy efficiency of biological systems to engineer soils as active thermoregulators, and iii) it will open up a new interdisciplinary dimension to engineering education.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project brings together a group of researchers from diverse disciplines from both sciences and engineering to address the most pressing themes of our current times &ndash; energy efficiency, sustainability, and natural and environmentally friendly materials. The purpose of the project was to build synergy of ideas and research infrastructure to develop a roadmap for major research plan on using bio-inspired techniques to bring energy efficiencies into the human-built environment.    One of the most desired aspects of civil infrastructure is to be able to control heat transfer in the building components (ex. Interior and Exterior walls) during both cold and warm seasons.  The intellectual merit of this project lies in the fact that biological processes demonstrated in the natural world, especially in plant leaves and animal skin, provide not only inspiration but also a framework to engineer stabilized soils as wall materials for effective thermoregulatory behavior.  Seed studies reveal that the heat transfer through stabilized soils could be investigated for active control using established methods in botany, zoology, biomedical, and mechanical engineering disciplines.  The project has taken the bold initiative of closing the gap between sciences and engineering disciplines with thermal behavior as the link.  It is conceivable that the project will lead to development of cost-effective and sustainable materials and methods in building construction.  It is equally conceivable that it will lead to commercial ventures on natural building materials engineered to actively control heat transfer.
