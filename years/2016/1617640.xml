<AbstractNarration>Machine-learning algorithms enable pattern recognition from data that are too complex to model analytically. This pattern recognition is of fundamental importance in diverse domains. These algorithms are becoming an essential part of embedded systems that find use in infrastructure, environmental monitoring, personal health monitoring, energy management, food supply chain, assembly lines, etc. This research has the potential to enable significant advances in such systems by enabling highly energy-efficient on-sensor inference to be performed. With its plans for involving students from underrepresented groups, industrial engagement, outreach to the broader public, and online distribution of tools, it is expected to have a broad impact.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The aim of the proposed work is to explore the energy savings achievable by embedded signal-processing inference systems through random projections. Random projections have previously been employed in the context of compressive sensing to reduce system energy. We have found that when random projections are used to compress Nyquist signals, the compression mechanism is far more robust, while offering the possibility of two orders of magnitude system energy savings.  We term this mechanism compressed signal processing.  We propose work on bringing this concept to fruition through new methodologies and signal-processing architectures. In addition, we propose the use of genetic programming and error-aware inference to tackle the nonlinear signal-processing problem.  We plan extensive evaluations of the system-level energy-accuracy tradeoffs the proposed mechanisms offer.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Internet-of-Things (IoT) is beginning to have a wide impact across various sectors of the economy.  Traditionally, data are collected in an IoT system from various sensors and then transmitted to the edge devices and the cloud where machine learning models are trained and used to provide inference. This process, unfortunately, consumes too much energy and bandwidth.  Hence, it is not sustainable.  Recognizing this, researchers have begun to push intelligence downwards from the cloud to edge devices.  Since many edge devices are energy-constrained, this means new approaches to energy-efficient inference need to be developed.  This was the goal of this research project.  The project resulted in several new methodologies in this domain.  Some examples are: energy/memory/latency-efficient neural network synthesis, incremental training of neural networks, introducing hidden layers in the control gates of long short-term memories (LSTMs) to make them more accurate and energy/latency-efficient, augmenting feature space with semantic space data for improving classification accuracy, understanding the physical/mental/emotional states of an individual through wearable medical sensors (WMSs), using WMSs for diabetes diagnosis (both Type I and II) on an edge device, convolutional autoencoder based transfer learning, use of random projections for energy efficiency, using genetic programming for feature computation, etc. These methodologies significantly extend the state-of-the-art in the respective research areas.  Eight PhD students (four females) and nine undergraduate students (two females) were trained in this exciting area of research.  Their work resulted in several journal articles.  The results were disseminated to the wider public through various invited talks. Some of the results have been licensed to a company for commercialization.  The students also did technology transfer through their summer internships at various companies.        Last Modified: 10/19/2020       Submitted by: Niraj K Jha]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
