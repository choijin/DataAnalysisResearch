<AbstractNarration>Like every novel technology, piezoelectricity has contributed to important scientific achievements to Acoustic Emission (AE) and ultrasonic sensor technology, but there still are technical limitations that need to be resolved. The concept of the technology proposed originated from the feedbacks from professionals expertizing on structural integrity monitoring in Non-destructive Testing (NDT) industry as well as several discussion with former doctoral students dedicated to relevant research areas. The proposed piezoelectric-nanocompostie based acoustic/ultrasonic transducer array technology has great potential to resolve several of the performance limiting issues. In addition, due to the high cost of traditional sensors and the requirements in terms of sensor volumes, an alternative and more affordable transducer technology is urgently needed for design teams in relevant technology companies. Modern acoustic and ultrasonic sensing technologies are able to supply an enormous amount of information of health conditions of aging civil infrastructure to avoid a catastrophic failure, thereby making an important impact on the public safety and economical investments. The technology proposed will expedite a wider employment of acoustic emission or ultrasonic transducers on objects of unique geometries or in special working conditions, while allowing substantial cost reduction and shortening the design-cycle due to superb adaptability of the piezo-composites processes. Therefore, with the new piezo-nanocomposite technology introduced, it is reasonable to anticipate a marketing expansion in different categories of business, such as NDT provider and wearable medical electronics companies. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The key objective of this program is to develop piezoelectric elastomer or thermoplastic nanocomposites that are amenable to additive manufacturing of flexible or 3D conformal transducer array prototypes for detection of acoustic emission or ultrasonic signals. One of the most popular applications relying on the utilization of acoustic emission is to determine if cracks are growing at the interior of a structure or to monitor its degree of deterioration. However, oftentimes, it is very difficult and costly to achieve an accurate or even accessible measurement readings on tested objects because of some certain special technical requirement, e.g. unique geometry or frequency selection. The proposed technology facilitates  low-cost volume production of acoustic emission or ultrasonic transducer arrays that are well tailored for structural health monitoring of concrete, steel, and composite structures and rotating machinery. In this I-Corps program a commercial assessment of will be conducted on a new piezo-nanocomposite material technology that enables customized design, molding or additive manufacturing (3D printing) and ease of deployment of a new class of flexible and/or 3D conformal acoustic and ultrasonic transducer arrays.</AbstractNarration>

Through the participation and guidance of the I-Corps curriculum, we develop our technology disposition and identify the possible entrepreneurship opportunities by using the business model canvas (BMC), which is the cornerstone. Therefore, the biggest goal for us is to statue and polish the (BMC) through the process of falsifying/validating a number of different hypotheses in each blocks of contents such as value propositions, customer segments, channels, etc. We proposed our innovation as piezoelectric elastomer or thermoplastic nanocomposites that are amenable to additive manufacturing of flexible or 3D conformal transducer array prototypes for detection of acoustic emission or ultrasonic signals. We target various markets where our technology will potential be used for making profit, such as ultrasound transducers, non-destructive testing (NDT) equipment, and wearable electronics. And the goal is to investigate whether or not the technology will offer any commercial impact. We also narrowed our focus to non-brittle soft transducer probe that conforms to any surface shape with better coupling and bandwidth for non-destructive testing with easier installation and longer lifetime than current devices. We performed more than 100 interviews with professionals who are involved in NDT field, from technical persons such as technician, project engineers to NDT device end users. We found that the value proposition we brought was a promising asset. With enough data information from the interviews, we also sketched the customer archetypes which is very beneficial for us to understand what customers think and why they would buy our products. In the meantime, more interviews were performed looking for developing partnership, for example, the manufacturer of our device and distributor. We also prioritized the importance of each partnership which was very important for us to know an objective relationship while cooperating with them. Another outcome offers a better understanding and guidance of the future research on piezoelectric materials to not only make a scientific impact, but also to foster potential commercialization that will be more widely beneficial to the society. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 10/27/2016<br>      Modified by: Jing&nbsp;Wang</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1606755/1606755_10405173_1477622107754_IMG_3106--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1606755/1606755_10405173_1477622107754_IMG_3106--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Our I-Corps Team"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1606755/1606755_10405173_1477622107754_IMG_3106--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Our I-Corps Team"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Our I-Corps Team holding a key meeting during weekend.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Image taken by Jing Wang (PI)</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Jing&nbsp;Wang</div> <div class="imageTitle">Our I-Corps Team</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1606755/1606755_10405173_1477621981745_acardia--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1606755/1606755_10405173_1477621981745_acardia--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Longest interview"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1606755/1606755_10405173_1477621981745_acardia--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Longest interview"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">The longest and most informative interview.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Image taken by Jing Wang (PI)</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Jing&nbsp;Wang</div> <div class="imageTitle">Longest interview</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1606755/1606755_10405173_1477621856172_404971c0-7a30-427b-9328-7b5599a9ea71--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1606755/1606755_10405173_1477621856172_404971c0-7a30-427b-9328-7b5599a9ea71--rgov-800width.jpg" title="First-day interview"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1606755/1606755_10405173_1477621856172_404971c0-7a30-427b-9328-7b5599a9ea71--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="First-day interview"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">An interview during kick-off meeting</div> <div class="imageCredit">Image taken by Jing Wang (PI for this project)</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Jing&nbsp;Wang</div> <div class="imageTitle">First-day interview</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
