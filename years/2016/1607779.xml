<AbstractNarration>Non-Technical&lt;br/&gt;Electrons are fundamental particles that have spin, mass, and charge.  The understanding of electronic energy levels has been crucial to understanding chemistry and the development of solid-state materials, such as semiconductors, which have enabled technologies such as computer chips, light-emitting diodes, and solar cells.  The logic elements in today's computer chips rely on controlling electron charge and encode information as the presence or absence of charge currents and voltages, but encoding information using electron spin polarization has applications for quantum information processing and potential advantages for improving the speed, efficiency, and energy consumption of logic devices.  Electron spins, however, also interact with nuclear spins, and this can be an undesirable source of noise or, if we can understand it better, a pathway for controlling electron spin polarization.  The PI will use optical measurements with pulsed lasers to characterize how these spin interactions depend on material strain and other parameters.  This research will improve the scientific understanding of these interactions and help us figure out how to control them.  The results of this research have the potential to advance multiple scientific and technological areas, including semiconductor physics, device engineering, materials science, magnetism and quantum information.  The research will provide valuable training to student researchers in a wide range of techniques, including semiconductor device design and fabrication, optical and electrical measurements, data acquisition and analysis and communicating results through scientific presentations and publications.  The proposed outreach and education activities will seek to increase public engagement with recent developments in science and technology and to encourage the participation of underrepresented groups in scientific careers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research will investigate electron and nuclear spin interactions in low-dimensional semiconductor heterostructures.  Controlling the interactions between electron and nuclear spins is of great importance for applications such as classical and quantum information processing, but the understanding of the coupled electron-nuclear spin system is incomplete.  Recent experiments on strained quantum dots have revealed unexpected phenomena, including nuclear spin locking, nuclear magnetization at zero magnetic field, and the anomalous Hanle effect.  These phenomena have been variously attributed to the effects of quantum confinement, mesoscopic size, and strain, but it is difficult to separate these effects in quantum dots and establish the underlying physical mechanisms.  The proposed measurements on strained and unstrained quantum wells will elucidate the role of quantum confinement, carrier localization, reduced symmetry and dimensionality, and spin-orbit effects on electron-nuclear spin interactions.  The nuclear polarization will be monitored using ultrafast pump-probe and spin noise optical techniques capable of sensitively measuring small changes to the nuclear spin polarization.  The proposed research will advance scientific understanding of the physical origins of recently-observed phenomena in strained quantum dots and address open questions about the coupled electron-nuclear spin system and its interaction with light.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Electrons are fundamental particles that have spin, mass, and charge.  The understanding of how to control the motion of electrons in semiconductor devices led to the development of computer chips and solar cells.  The logic elements in today?s computer chips rely on encoding information based on the presence or absence of charge currents and voltages, but encoding information in the direction and magnitude of electron spin polarization could enable quantum computing and new devices that have better speed, efficiency and less energy consumption than existing technology.  However, electron spins also interact with nuclear spins, and this can be an undesirable source of noise, or, if we can understand it better, a pathway for controlling electron spins.  In this project, the researchers used optical measurements with pulsed lasers to both produce and measure electron spin polarization and how the electron spins were affected by nuclear spin polarization.  Interestingly, the direction of the nuclear spin polarization changed so that the nuclear spin polarization was along the magnetic field when the field was decreased and in the opposite direction when the field was increased.  The magnitude of the nuclear spin polarization also increased and decreased with applied magnetic field so that it seemed to track the size of the electron spin polarization, which was largest at the magnetic fields that produced a full number of electron spin precessions in the time that it took for the laser to produce another optical pulse (every 13.1 nanoseconds).  The measurements also showed that the results were affected by the precise field history and that interruptions in field sweeps, like pausing the sweep at a particular magnetic field, could produce different results.  This system has a feedback effect, because changes to the electron spin polarization cause affect the nuclear spin polarization, which, in turn, changes the behavior of the electron spins.  This behavior was simulated on a computer, taking into account the relevant physics of optical spin pumping, spin precession in a magnetic field, the optical Stark effect, and the contact hyperfine interaction, and these numerical results show good agreement with the experimental results.  The Intellectual Merit of the research is that it advanced scientific understanding of the coupled electron-nuclear spin system and its interaction with light.  The results have the potential to impact knowledge in semiconductor physics, device engineering, materials science, magnetism and quantum information.  The Broader Impacts of the research is that it could enable the development of spin-based classical and quantum information processing and provided valuable training to student researchers in semiconductor device design and fabrication, optical and electrical measurements, data acquisition and analysis and communicating results through scientific presentations and publications.  A talk on magnetism and nanotechnology was give as part of the popular Saturday Morning Physics series at Michigan and was recorded and distributed on public television and on the internet through iTunes U.
