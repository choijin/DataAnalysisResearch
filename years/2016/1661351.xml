<AbstractNarration>The rapid expansion of massively-parallel sequencing (MPS, or "next-generation sequencing") technology has revolutionized molecular microbial ecology by making the detailed analysis of complex communities over time and space a tractable research pursuit for small research groups. While the advent of MPS methods has allowed microbial ecologists to ask meaningful questions with ever-greater precision, it brings significant challenges to individual small laboratories struggling to manage megabytes or even gigabytes of data. This project will sustain the web service VAMPS (Visualization and Analysis of Microbial Population Structures, http://vamps.mbl.edu), which removes the need for individual research groups to make the considerable investment in computational infrastructure and bioinformatic support otherwise necessary to process, analyze, and interpret MPS data for microbial ecology. VAMPS is a free, open-source database-driven website that allows researchers using MPS data to analyze the diversity of microbial communities and the relationships between communities, to explore these analyses in an intuitive visual context, and to download analyses and images for publication. Any web-capable device can be used to upload, process, explore, and extract data and results from VAMPS, and the VAMPS development team is available to assist in all aspects of data processing and analysis. VAMPS encourages researchers to share sequence and metadata, and fosters collaboration between researchers of disparate biomes who recognize common patterns in shared data. VAMPS currently hosts more than 200 projects encompassing more than 5000 datasets and over 250 million sequence tags, is used by nearly 1000 investigators from around the world, and has supported at least 15 NSF-funded projects. VAMPS provides unique educational opportunities through its combination of data from a variety of environments, its integration of sequence cluster-based and taxonomy-based analytical and visualization tools, and the instruction provided by project developers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;VAMPS is designed for visualization, exploration, and analysis of amplicon tag data in a comparative context. Sequence data and associated metadata can be uploaded directly by users or by sending data to the VAMPS project team; MPS reads can be automatically quality filtered and assigned to both taxonomic structures and to taxonomic-independent clusters. These can then be linked to metadata and compared using a wide variety of analytical and visualization tools. Each result is extensively hyperlinked to other analysis and visualization options, promoting data exploration and leading to a greater understanding of data relationships. A major strength of VAMPS is that researchers can compare not only datasets within their own projects but can compare these with datasets from projects such as NSF-funded Long Term Ecological Research projects, the International Census of Marine Microbes, the Human Microbiome Project, and hundreds of other individual projects. The project will support: 1) Active releases of QIIME, OTU clustering methods, oligotyping, and other methods as authors release new versions. 2) A VAMPS administrator to support users in uploading and trimming data and the use of the many VAMPS visualization and analysis tools, exporting data for other analytical methods and images for publication, and facilitating collaborations and adding new portals. 3) Incorporation of new publicly available data. Projects of particular interest include the Earth Microbiome Project, the American Gut Project, and Terra Oceans that have or will have data that would benefit the research community if made available through VAMPS. 4) Adapting analysis capabilities to other appropriate genes as requested by the community. 5) Hardware and software maintenance and data storage. All results of the project can be found at vamps.mbl.edu.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The rapid expansion of sequencing technologies with the concurrent drastic drop in costs has revolutionized molecular microbial ecology by making the detailed analysis of complex communities over time and space a tractable research pursuit for small research groups.  The ability to generate 107 reads from 100 samples for a single project with relative ease brings with it many downstream complications.  Beyond the computational resources and skills needed to analyze data, it is difficult to compare datasets, which may represent spatial or temporal gradients, changes to a community in response to nutrients or stress, or the response of a biota to its host, in an intuitive and interactive manner that leads to hypothesis generation.  This project sustained the web service VAMPS (Visualization and Analysis of Microbial Population Structures, http://vamps.mbl.edu).  VAMPS is a free, open-source database-driven website that allows researchers using data from massively-parallel sequencing (MPS, or "next-generation sequencing") projects to analyze the diversity of microbial communities and the relationships between communities, to explore these analyses in an intuitive visual context, and to download analyses and images for publication.  Key outcomes of the award include:  1. Conversion from the original VAMPS website (vamps.mbl.edu) to VAMPS2 (vamps2.mbl.edu).  VAMPS2 uses node.js code design refactoring for improved maintainability, modularity, and portability.  The speed of real-time analyses is significantly improved over VAMPS, particularly the ability to analyze many datasets simultaneously.  The new user interface represents considerable input from our many users and includes the ability to more easily manage multiple visual analyses, the ability to save projects (sets of datasets and taxonomies), and the ability to select between alternate taxonomies.   2. Extensive search and selection options to navigate the 1,000+ projects and 200,000+ datasets in VAMPS2.  Users can:      a) select projects or datasets by owner (user), portal, name, partial name, or key word;      b) select datasets based on metadata criteria, environmental source, or amplicon target;      c) select datasets over a specified geographic range;      d) find all datasets containing a designated taxon;      e) find all occurrences of a sequence or similar sequence using BLAST.  3.  Creation of ten data portals for "meta projects" including the Coral Microbiome Project; the Census of Deep Life; the Human Microbiome Project; the International Census of Marine Microbes; Microbial Inventory Research Across Diverse Aquatic Long Term Ecological Research Sites; Microbiology of Built Environments; and the Plastisphere.    4. Improved data submission tools, including Django API for sequence and metadata cleaning and confirmation.  5. Extensive improvements to the VAMPS2 database, including switching database code to MariaDB, removing obsolete tables, cleaning data and data structures, and extensive normalization.  This has resulted in improved response times despite a drastic increase in database size.  6. The new VAMPS2 database can store metagenomic data (ie data is not constrained to regions of the small subunit ribosomal RNA gene).  This represents a significant advance in our goal to expand VAMPS services.  In addition to multiple regions of bacterial, archaeal, and eukaryotic samll subunit amplicon target regions we have added as proof of principle ITS1 and more than 30 fungal ITS1 datasets.  Development of new tools to fully analyze metagenomic data is outside the objectives and resources of this project but will be pursued by other means.  7. The VAMPS database can be accessed directly via API using instructions available here: https://github.com/hsosik/MBVL/tree/master/prototypes/vamps_api_interaction  At the conclusion of the project, VAMPS contained records of more than 430 million unique sequences representing more than 6 billion amplicon reads, from nearly 215 thousand datasets organized in more than a thousand different projects.    Each year of the award hundreds of new users registered to use VAMPS.  In addition to project leads submitting data to the site this includes dozens of users per project that use the site to collaboratively analyze their data.  Beyond these, more than a hundred new users each year register to use publicly available data for research and education.  Portals to metaprojects such as "the human microbiome" or "the plastisphere" facilitate the use of VAMPS as an educational tool.   VAMPS has been used in the MBL Advanced Training Course STAMPS (Strategies and Techniques for the Analysis of Microbial Population Structure), which trains ~60 graduate students, postdocs, and PIs each year in methods of metagenomic sequence analysis.   VAMPS is used in the University of Chicago undergraduate course Microbes Across Environments, taught every fall at the MBL since 2017.  VAMPS is particularly effective in introducing non-majors and others without extensive bioinformatic training to concepts of microbial community analysis.  Beginning in early 2020, the MBL began a program of immersion experiences for secondary school students.  VAMPS was used as an easily accessible tool for microbial community analysis that required no computational experience.  Though this program has been curtailed by the pandemic we expect it to continue and for VAMPS to be a critical tool in the microbiome component.
