<AbstractNarration>The Chemical Synthesis Program of the Chemistry Division supports the project by Professor Rodrigo B. Andrade. Professor Andrade is a faculty member in the Department of Chemistry at Temple University.  He is developing new chemical reactions to quickly build complex nitrogen-containing molecules.  The overarching goal is to maximize the efficiency by which complex, three-dimensional molecules are prepared by using new reagents and reactions discovered in his laboratory.  Such an approach reduces the time, energy, and cost associated with synthesizing complex molecules composed of carbon and nitrogen atoms.  Many such molecules are biologically active, and so they can be employed as molecular probes to better understand biochemical pathways or as therapeutics to be used in medicine.  Beyond the training of undergraduate and graduate students, including those from underrepresented groups, the broader impacts of this project touch the fields of organic chemistry (e.g., total synthesis, synthetic methodology), chemical biology, molecular biology, biochemistry, and medicine.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;N-Sulfinyl metallodienamines (NSMDs) have emerged as powerful asymmetric synthons for chemical synthesis.  The focus of this project is to determine both the mechanism and scope of reactions using acyclic NSMDs with a variety of electrophiles, which logically builds from previous efforts on arene-fused congeners.  Specifically, in Aim 1 the researchers are studying the scope of the reactions of acyclic NSMDs with electrophilic olefins to afford cycloadducts through a Domino Michael/Mannich (formal Diels-Alder) process.  In Aim 2, the research group is applying optimal reaction conditions determined from Aim 1 toward the step-efficient, asymmetric total syntheses of complex Iboga alkaloids (+)-catharanthine, (+)-coronaridine, and (+)-ibogamine.  In Aim 3, the research students are systematically investigating the reactions of NSMDs with aldehydes (vinylogous aldol) and imines (vinylogous Mannich). In Aim 4, researchers are probing the reactions of NSMDs with electrophilic oxygen and nitrogen sources to access alpha-functionalized N-sulfinyl imines, which can be further modified to access chiral building blocks for organic synthesis.  Computer modeling is used in all mechanistic analyses.  Professor Andrade has demonstrated a strong commitment to the inclusion of undergraduates, particularly from underrepresented groups, in his research activities.</AbstractNarration>
