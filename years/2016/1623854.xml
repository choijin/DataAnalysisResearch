<AbstractNarration>Auctions are an important mechanism used to allocated goods and raise revenue. Oil-lease and spectrum auctions raise large amounts of revenue for the government and have been the focus of much economic research. Many of these auctions are for goods which have an uncertain value which is the same for all bidders (e.g., the amount of oil in a lease). Traditional theoretical models assume that bidders have the same amount of information concerning the value of the good. However, this assumption ignores the fact that often bidders may be asymmetrically informed, which has been empirically shown to affect bidding behavior. Understanding how asymmetries in bidders' information affects their bidding behavior is important for predicting the revenue an auction will generate and for designing auctions to increase the revenue they raise. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PIs expand the traditional auction framework to allow for bidders to differ both in their estimates of a good's value and the precision of their estimates. They study how bidding behavior changes when bidders can and cannot observe the precision of opposing bidders' information. In many sealed-bid or online auctions, the identity of opposing bidders is hidden and each bidder may not be perfectly informed about how precise his opponent's information is. With the rise of internet auctions, however, sellers have a large degree of control of the information bidders possess about one another. How much information about bidders' characteristics an auction designer should release is an important consideration when designing auctions and is one that has not previously been studied. The current research project shows how sellers can optimally design the release of this information. By studying the impact of changing how much information bidders possess about one another, the PIs find a new avenue by which auction design can improve revenue generation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The theoretical predictions show that publicly revealing the precision of each bidder's information decreases the expected revenue an auction will generate. This finding suggests that controlling how much information bidders have about each other is an important factor to consider when designing auctions. &lt;br/&gt;The PIs seek to answer the following question by performing a series of experiments: how do bidders behave when they know that their information about the good is more (or less) precise than other bidders? How do their bidding strategies change when they do not know the precision of their opponents information? The proposed study intends to answer these questions, which will contribute to a better understanding of how much information to disclose in auctions. This experiment will provide a better understanding of how to implement information design into auction formats.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This project studied how to optimally design auctions. Auctions are a widely used method for allocating goods and generating revenue, both in the private and public sphere. The purpose of this project was to understand how revealing information about bidders to their opponents affected auction revenue. We looked at a situation in which some bidders may be experts who have better information about the value of a good. Theoretical results show that revealing whether or not an expert is present leads to a decrease in auction revenue. We test this prediction experimentally by having subjects perform in auctions in which they can see whether other bidders are experts or auctions where they are uninformed. Although subjects to do not predict exactly as theory predicts (a common finding in experimental auctions), the qualitative predictions of the theory are broadly supported. We find that bidders react to information about their opponents as theory predicts, decreasing their bids when one their opponents is an expert, and that disclosing information on other bidders decreases revenue. Additionally, we find that subjects that perform better when bidding as experts also bid closer to the theoretical predictions when biding as a non-expert. This finding shows that subjects who understand the auction better are more likely to predict as theory predicts. In a real-life situation where such bidders with a better understanding are more likely to participate, this provides even stronger evidence in favor of the theory. Our experimental results coupled with the theoretical model provide support for auction designs which don't let bidders see their opponents (such as those held online). This simple and easy to implement recommendation can lead to large increases in auction revenue. Given auctions widespread use, this design feature can lead to important societal benefits by improving auctions.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 08/30/2018<br>      Modified by: Andrew&nbsp;A&nbsp;Mcclellan</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
