<AbstractNarration>In this study, investigators seek insight into human responses to climate change in marine environments. In particular, they wish to understand patterns of El Niño intensity and frequency in the past, and how this influenced past human populations. As archaeologists, the investigators are well-suited to understand complex long-term human-environmental dynamics using climatological records and the material record from archaeological sites. El Niños influence human populations through changes in weather, often in the form of heavier rains and larger storms along the southwest coast of the United States, and an increase in sea surface temperature (SST). This change in SST is particularly relevant because it is accompanied by decreases in marine productivity, which often leads to large scale death of marine life along the west coast of the United States and South America. This severely affected the diet of past coastal populations who derived a large proportion of their food from the ocean. Today, El Niños can cause a collapse of fishing industries. This study will refine methods for using elements of the archaeological record to reconstruct El Niños and long-term patterns of SST in the past.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A team of researchers led by Dr. Christopher Jazwa will take advantage of the current extreme El Niño and collect SST data and California mussel (Mytilus californianus) shells that contain a record of elevated water temperature. The oxygen isotope in the calcium carbonate that makes up the outer layers of California mussel shells is influenced by SST at the time it is deposited. This layer is deposited in bands over the lifetime of the mussel, so it is possible to use this signature to reconstruct patterns in SST through time. In this project, investigators will be traveling to Santa Rosa Island, CA, to collect SST data and living mussels in January, March, May, August, and November of 2016. By collecting samples and data during the El Niño and the summer/fall immediately afterward, it should be possible to obtain a signature of elevated SST in the isotopic signature of the shells. Because El Niños are difficult to predict in advance, it is essential that the researchers travel to the field quickly once the appropriate signature has been confirmed. The sampling location is adjacent to archaeological sites with evidence for at least 7500 years of human occupation. These sites include abundant evidence of fishing and shellfishing, including mussel shells. The methods developed in this study can be directly applied to mussels from archaeological collections for three purposes: 1) track past patterns in El Niño cycles; 2) determine long-term patterns in SST; and 3) assign individual shells to particular seasons during the year to understand seasonal movement of past human populations. Fieldwork and laboratory sample processing will be done with the assistance of undergraduate and graduate students, aiding in their education and development as archaeologists. Finally, research will be done in part to satisfy the goals of Channel Islands National Park to inventory the valuable cultural and environmental resources that are present there.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The purpose of this RAPID project was to travel to Santa Rosa Island during and immediately after the extreme 2015-2016 El Ni&ntilde;o to collect <em>Mytilus californianus </em>(California mussel) shells. The data that has been derived from a subset of these samples and a larger data set that will be obtained from the rest will allow us to refine the use of stable oxygen isotope (d<sup>18</sup>O) measurements of shell carbonate from mollusks to reconstruct past variability in climate and human responses to these changes. Sea surface temperature anomalies from the 2015-2016 winter were among the highest in recorded history and collecting shells at that time provided a unique opportunity to develop a powerful tool for paleoclimate studies.</p> <p>Samples were collected from the mouth of La Jolla Vieja Canyon on the south side of the island (Figure 1) in March, May, August, and November 2017. During each collection period, we harvested 50 mussels, removed the meat, and cleaned the shells in the field. All samples were then brought back to the laboratory at Pennsylvania State University to be further cleaned, sampled, and sent away for analysis. We also deployed a water temperature logger in the intertidal region next to the sampling location to measure hourly fluctuations in local water temperature. A pilot data set of 330 measurements of mussel carbonate from shells collected in January, March, and May was generated as a part of this project as a proof of concept test to observe the El Ni&ntilde;o in the isotopic signature. The results of this preliminary study are promising and, as is customary following a RAPID award, the PI has submitted a full senior research grant proposal to the NSF Archaeometry program to conduct a full study of the shells collected in 2016 and 2017.</p> <p>The data collected as a part of this project reflect patterns in sea surface temperature consistent with the strong El Ni&ntilde;o. Not only was sea surface temperature during the winter months unusually high, but it actually increased during January 2016 (Figure 2). During January of a typical year, sea surface temperature is cooler and decreases. This is reflected in the oxygen isotopic record from mussels collected for this pilot study (Figure 3). Nearly all samples collected in January demonstrate increasing calculated sea surface temperature (decreasing d<sup>18</sup>O). Samples collected in March and May also reflect this trend progressively further from the final growth of the mussel. Furthermore, samples collected in March and May both reflect the large variations in sea surface temperature that occurred in March 2017. These findings are all consistent with the hypothesis that El Ni&ntilde;o events can be observed in mussel shell carbonate.</p> <p>The second objective of this study was to begin to refine methodologies for assigning mussel shells to a specific season of death. This has archaeological implications for assigning shells to a season of harvest, and when taken in aggregate, allows archaeologists to infer season of habitation of archaeological sites with shell deposits. The use of stable oxygen isotopic measurements for this purpose is becoming more common in archaeological studies of coastal sites. However, it has not yet been tested with modern samples with known season of harvest. The data from this study suggest that samples from shells harvested in January, March, and May can be distinguished from their isotopic record (Figure 3).</p> <p>The next steps of this study will be to 1) analyze a larger sample of modern mussel shells collected as a part of this project and during the subsequent year to refine methodologies for observing El Ni&ntilde;os in the isotopic signature and assigning season of harvest; and 2) test archaeological samples from near the test site to reconstruct past patterns of El Ni&ntilde;o frequency and human responses in their patterns of settlement and subsistence. This study is broadly applicable to other earth sciences and issues associated with human resilience to changes in climate. This work also addresses the impacts of human occupation of a coastal landscape on the local ecology of the region. By understanding how people altered the coastal ecosystem in the past, we can better understand the dynamics of these systems. Additionally, this project included survey for archaeological sites in the interior of Santa Rosa Island. This work was done in collaboration with Channel Islands National Park to help them to achieve their mission to inventory and assess cultural resources within the park.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 02/20/2017<br>      Modified by: Christopher&nbsp;S&nbsp;Jazwa</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1623514/1623514_10407603_1487638279977_Figure_1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1623514/1623514_10407603_1487638279977_Figure_1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 1"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1623514/1623514_10407603_1487638279977_Figure_1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 1"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">California?s northern Channel Islands, with the sampling location at the mouth of La Jolla Vieja Canyon on Santa Rosa Island indicated.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Christopher Jazwa</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Christopher&nbsp;S&nbsp;Jazwa</div> <div class="imageTitle">Figure 1</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1623514/1623514_10407603_1487638361911_Figure_2--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1623514/1623514_10407603_1487638361911_Figure_2--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 2"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1623514/1623514_10407603_1487638361911_Figure_2--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 2"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Average daily sea surface temperature data for the 2015-2016 El Niño event.
