<AbstractNarration>PI:  Johnson, Blake   &lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: 1650601 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Organs for transplantation, such as kidneys, are in short supply.  Good measures that predict the health status of organs targeted for transplantation are not available. The current approach is not objective.  This project will use current state of the art methods to make devices that will be attached to live kidneys in a special apparatus for obtaining important measurements using sensors that will be fabricated as part of the project.  The goal is that such measurements will take the guess work out of the health assessment of the organ transplantation procedure.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The goal of the proposed project is to fabricate a conforming and flexible sensor that will be adaptive to ex vivo organ surfaces (the porcine kidney in the experiments) for obtaining electrical impedance data, and measure biomarkers in perfused fluids using a microfluidic arrangement. The project will use advanced fabrication approach of 3D structured light scanning and extrusion-based additive manufacturing methodology for fabricating conformal (form-fitting) microfluidic organ biosensors.  This sensor-based identification of biomarkers and impedance signatures in superficial tissue matrix is expected to correlate with organ health. The project will provide an educational opportunity by creating a two-week workshop which will train students in biomedical device manufacturing. Educational benefits will be assessed through a faculty-judged BIO-Maker fair.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The ability to integrate microfluidic devices with native complex biological architectures, such as explanted and transplanted organs, has the potential to shift the paradigm for the study and analysis of biological tissue as well as the preservation of donor organs. The primary finding of this project was that biomarkers of organ transplant quality, specifically kidneys, could be obtained non-invasively through an organ-conforming microfluidic device.  3D printing and 3D scanning technologies enabled fabrication of organ-conforming devices using gels and elastomeric materials.  Computational studies were used to identify the optimal parameters for operating the device in various transplantation settings, including preservation using traditional cold storage and machine perfusion systems.  We found that molecular species were spontaneously transferred from the organ cortex to the conformal microfluidic device in the presence of fluid flow through the organ-conforming microchannel.  The profile of molecular species in the organ-conforming microfluidic stream was dependent on the organ preservation conditions.  Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) studies revealed conformal microfluidic devices isolate clinically relevant metabolic and pathophysiological biomarkers from whole organs, including heat shock protein 70 (HSP-70) and kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1), which were detected in the microfluidic device as high as 409 and 12 pg/mL, respectively.  Overall, these results show conformal microfluidic devices enable a novel minimally invasive ?microfluidic biopsy? technique for isolation and profiling of biomarkers from whole organs within a clinically relevant interval.  The ischemic history of explanted organs (e.g., cold storage) could also be identified by molecular cluster analysis of Raman spectra collected from the microfluidic biopsy samples.  This achievement could shift the paradigm for whole organ preservation and assessment, thereby helping to relieve the organ shortage crisis through increased availability and quality of donor organs.  Ultimately, this work provides a major advance in microfluidics through the design and manufacturing of organ-conforming microfluidic devices and a novel technique for microfluidic-based analysis of whole organs.
