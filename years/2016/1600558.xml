<AbstractNarration>The Regional Center for Nuclear Education and Training (RCNET) provides programs in nuclear energy, nuclear environmental management, and nuclear life and plant science. RCNET brings a history of curriculum solutions and professional development to a growing nuclear community; offering best practices in areas including cross-training, nuclear culture immersion, soft skills development, and the embedding of emerging technologies (including nuclear processes in manufacturing) into the college classroom. Through this award, college nuclear programs will have increased industry involvement and more sustainable programs, which will result in better placement and graduation rates. RCNET addresses critical workforce, environmental, political, and economic concerns. Nuclear technology is embedded into multiple disciplines and is crucial to the present and future of the United States' technical fields. Nuclear energy powers over 19% of the United States, is an integral part of the Navy, and is a critical element in space exploration. Nuclear isotopes are used to diagnose and treat a spectrum of medical conditions, including cancer. One-third of all environmental management sites have a nuclear component. Nuclear technologies are even used in a wide variety of manufacturing applications. These nuclear industries account for more than 2.6 million jobs and $120 billion toward the United States Gross Domestic Product. With an aging population, natural attrition, and expected job growth, there will be over 65,000 high-paying nuclear career opportunities by 2030. By coordinating and supporting a broad network of nuclear training facilities, capable of meeting the United States industry's needs, RCNET eliminates the risk of a serious shortage in highly trained nuclear technicians. RCNET will accelerate the implementation of new nuclear technologies and facilities (ultimately facilitating the United States' quest for energy independence); assist with the development of a domestic supply of medical radioisotopes; provide for a cleaner, safer nation; and strengthen our nation's manufacturing initiatives. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Regional Center for Nuclear Education &amp; Training (RCNET) is focused on the development and sustainability of a highly technical workforce pipeline for the nuclear fields of power generation, environmental management, and life and plant sciences. The six key goals are: 1) Expand and maintain a learning repository with comprehensive standardized curriculum for power generation, environmental management, and life and plant sciences; 2) Increase academic and career pathways for students and technicians across nuclear STEM fields; 3) Develop, promote, and broaden partnerships between industry and academic institutions to increase articulation, college completion and career placement; 4) Develop and provide access to best practices in hands-on training, affective domain instruction, and emerging technologies through professional development; 5) Create and disseminate educational material to increase awareness of nuclear academic programs and careers; and 6) Promote and increase the number of under-represented populations in nuclear STEM fields.</AbstractNarration>
