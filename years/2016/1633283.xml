<AbstractNarration>With recent advances in technology, it is now possible to measure and record significant numbers of features on a single individual.  The volume, velocity, and variety, the "3Vs", of Big Data pose significant challenges for modeling and analysis of these massive datasets.  For example, to understand cancer at the genetic level, researchers need to detect rare and weak signals from thousands, or even millions, of candidate genetic markers obtained from a limited number of subjects.  Existing methods typically assume that the number of subjects is very large, an assumption often violated in practice.  The main goal of this project is to develop efficient methods for extremely large-dimensional, small sample size data.  The methodological advances will be extremely valuable in addressing Big Data challenges in different areas such as medical research, bioinformatics, financial analysis, and astronomic image analysis.  Efficient software packages and algorithms to implement the proposed methods will be developed and made publicly available.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The key innovative idea motivating this research is viewing a high-dimensional problem from a novel packing perspective, which allows the number of variables, p, to be arbitrarily large and the number of observations, n, to be finite.  The proposed research will systematically investigate three fundamental problems under this "finite n, arbitrarily large p" paradigm: (1) asymptotic theory of spurious correlations, (2) fast detection of low-rank correlation structures, and (3) detection boundary and optimal testing procedures for detecting rare and weak signals.  This research will transform the current asymptotic framework, transitioning from the regimes of "large n, small p" and "large n, larger p" to the regime of "finite n, arbitrarily large p".</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ With recent advances in technology, it is now possible to measure and record significant numbers of features on a single individual. The volume, velocity, and variety, the "3Vs", of Big Data pose significant challenges for modeling and analysis of these massive data sets. When supported by this grant, the PI, working closely with his collaborators and students, advanced theoretical researches of non-parametric statistics in the area of sufficient dimension reduction, high-dimensional inference using multiple testing, non-parametric empirical Bayesian statistics and non-parametric testing, developed novel statistical methods with a great potential to be applied to address various issues arsing from big data such as astronomical data and genetics data. These areas of research are briefly summarized as following:     (i) When facing with a regression problem in the big data analysis, one usually starts with reducing the dimension without losing important information. Tremendous literature on sufficient dimension reduction focuses on developing non-linear algorithm to address various issues. In a serious work by the PI and his collaborators, a framework is provided to analyze the phase transition phenomenon of sliced inversion regression, global hypothesis testing for the multiple index models, and regression analysis via Lasso-SIR.     (ii) Many important issues requiring immediate attention to statistical researchers arise due to the complex of big data. Among these issues, the (a) group structure and (b) dependence are the two requiring immediate attention. The prevalent existence of group structure in practice impose two challenges such as heterogeneity among the testing statistics and hierarchy among the testing hypothesis. The PI has developed a serious work on the Group Assisted TEsting method (GATE) which has successfully incorporated information provided from the group structure.     When facing with dependence, we put the framework under the regression setting and introduced a perturbation based method (Gaussian Mirror) to control the false discovery rate. The perturbation could successfully alleviate the dependence and substantially improve the power of testing method. Additionally, it has the advantage of being robust by its nature.     (iii) When facing with a large number of parallel inferential problems, parametric/non-parametric empirical Bayesian methods are proven to be successful in borrowing the information across all the problems when performing simultaneous multiple testing and simultaneous estimation. A F-modeling based method for non-parametric estimation of the variances was introduced and investigated. It has a strong potential to be used to handle the heterogeneity among the big data analysis.     Together with his students and collaborators, the PI has also developed methods for algorithms of Multi-Arm Bandit which could be naturally connected to the online FDR control, testing the uniformity of a continuous random variable, testing for independence of multiple variables. Based on the projects that are supported by this grant, various statistical software and packages have been developed and made available to the public, including Binary Expansion Testing for Exploratory Data Analysis (BETEDA, Java based software with GUI interface), Sparsed Sliced Inverse Regression via Lasso (LassoSIR, R Package), Group Assisted Multiple TEsting (R Package), Binary Expansion Testing (BET, R Package) and Gaussian Mirror for High-dimensional Controled Variable Selection (GM, R Package). The Package CLAT is developed and will made available via github soon.         When supported with the grant, the PI and his collaborator has developed an efficient algorithm for testing the independence of two continuous random variables. A US patent (US 10,296,555) is granted for this invention.       Last Modified: 12/12/2020       Submitted by: Zhigen Zhao]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
