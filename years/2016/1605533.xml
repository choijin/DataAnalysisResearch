<AbstractNarration>1605533 - Dunn-Rankin&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Currently, 90% of worldwide energy utilization comes from the combustion of fossil fuels, and this use is not expected to decline worldwide for the foreseeable future. Consequently, improvements in combustion performance to increase fuel efficiency and reduce the emission of harmful pollutants are important.  The classical fire triangle shows that for sustained combustion to occur, heat, fuel, and a supply of oxidizer must be present; a reduction of any of these can make a flame burn less robustly, which may result in a decrease in temperature, an increase in flame fluctuations, and ultimately flame extinction. Interestingly, sometimes these nearly extinguished flames exhibit the highest combustion performance (i.e., high efficiency and low emissions).  Since water is commonly used to extinguish unwanted flames, it is important to determine if just the right amount of water can potentially produce high performance near-extinction combustion.  In addition, some next-generation fuels have very high water content that can naturally produce this same near-extinction behavior.  The proposed research explores the role of water when it is introduced as a fuel side reactant in a non-premixed flame. The broad scientific and technical impact of this work includes an improved understanding of combustion chemistry of systems that incorporate water naturally or artificially to manipulate the combustion process.  The project is of great value to undergraduates, graduates, and international scholars interested in sustainable energy; it will incorporate research participation for students at all levels, as well as opportunities to extend professional collaborations. The project will also broaden the participation of underrepresented minorities in STEM fields and as part of the NSF-funded Louis-Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (LSAMP).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The technical focus of the work is to explore the role of water, over a range of pressures between 1-50 atm and operating conditions, in diffusion flames using a co-flow jet and counter-flow burner configuration. This work will look specifically at flame extinction due to the addition of water, which significantly reduces flame temperature and also dilutes the fuel-air mixture.  Measurements include flame temperature and concentrations of important radical species involved in inhibiting combustion. The methods for measuring temperature will include thermocouples, thin filament pyrometry, and Coherent anti-Stokes Raman spectroscopy (CARS). Qualitative measurements of OH and CO will employ planar laser induced fluorescence. Experimental results will be compared with computational fluid dynamic calculations and with detailed chemical kinetics calculations for both atmospheric and high pressure conditions.  The combination of experiments and calculation will expose comprehensively the role of water in controlling combustion.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Project Outcomes Report  Combustion (the sustained heat releasing reaction of fuel and oxidizer) is a phenomenon with dual personality.  On one hand, it is a process that has been credited with human advance (from the cooking of food to the industrial revolution) and on the other is responsible for damage (wildfire) and polluting the environment (including air toxics and greenhouse gases).  Understanding and controlling the process of combustion is therefore of immense importance, and this research is one of the small contributions to toward these goals.  In particular, we study the heavy addition of water to fuel in an attempt to reduce emissions of nitrogen oxides and particulate soot.  The understanding of the combustion behavior in such a fuel-diluted configuration and whether water acts as a special diluent with respect to others (such as carbon dioxide - CO2 - or nitrogen) is relevant in the combustion of methane hydrates, emulsified fuels, gel fuels, and undried biomass, or the behavior of pool fires developing from LNG or oil on water, and steam-assisted flares for the reduction of emissions.  Intellectual Merit: In general, water and carbon dioxide are viewed as inert tools for fire suppression.  Water is dumped on forest fires and CO2 is used in fire extinguishers.  But in the heat of flames both of these species participate actively in the chemical reaction.  This participation is not well-understood, particularly when it occurs at high pressure.  We use a small burner with fuel flowing through a central fuel tube and air flow surrounding it, as shown in Figure 1.  The flame is very similar to a standard candle flame, as shown in Figure 2.  The bright glowing line above the flame is a carbon fiber used to measure temperature.  Figure 1.  Schematic of the simple burner used in the experiments.  Figure 2. Small candle-like flame typical of the experiment.  The sequence of our studies were: (a) study the flame with water addition at 1 atmosphere; (b) study the flame without water addition as a function of pressure; and (c) study the flame with water addition as a function of pressure.  Figure 3 shows what happens to the flame as water is added.  This figure filters out the bright light from the small tip glowing with incandescent soot. Note that the flame dims and finally blows out as water is added, but the flame can burn even with there is 70% water in the fuel.  Figure 3.  Chemiluminescence (light from the flame) showing how the flame changes as water is added at 1 atmosphere pressure.  Figure 4 shows what happens to the flame without water addition but as the pressure rises.  The flame narrows and the tip brightens as soot incandescence grows.  The flame height remains constant as is predicted by classical combustion theory.  Figure 4. Chemiluminescence showing how the flame changes with pressure.  Figure 5 shows the final step (c) with the change in the flame with both water addition and pressure.  This final figure is computational, as validated by experiments, so it shows only half the domain.  Figure 5.  Computational study showing how a highly diluted (65% water) flame varies with pressure.  The findings show that flames can carry a very large fraction of water and still burn, and that most diluents behave the same except very near the extinction limits for the flames.    Broader Impacts: The broad potential scientific and technical impacts show how to use water to improve combustion (reducing smoke and emissions) across a wide variety of situations.  In addition, high-pressure combustion findings inform the combustion community on phenomena that are distinctly different in these regimes.  Many activities for human resource development and broadening participation in STEM are closely associated with this project.  Graduate students are involved in an intellectually and culturally diverse community of peer scholars, as international visiting researchers (China, France, Italy) participated in the research activities, providing all researchers an intensive international collaboration.  The project also provided a rich environment to broaden participation of underrepresented minorities in STEM fields.  More than six such students participated on the project as part of independent study, in a summer pre-freshmen preparatory program, as a summer research experience, including travel to research conferences, and the CAMP UC-systemwide undergraduate research conference.  In total, the project provided an intensive research contribution to 3 Ph.D. students, 3 M.S. students, 10 undergraduate students, and 10 visiting scholars.  The impact of such experiences permanently changes scholars for the better.             Last Modified: 12/31/2020       Submitted by: Derek Dunn-Rankin]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
