<AbstractNarration>This project will advance efforts of the Innovative Technology Experiences for Students and Teachers (ITEST) program to better understand and promote practices that increase students' motivations and capacities to pursue careers in fields of science, technology, engineering, or mathematics (STEM) by engaging in hands-on field experience, laboratory/project-based entrepreneurship tasks and mentorship experiences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project, Preparing African American Males for Energy and Education (PAAMEE), is an ITEST Strategies project designed to expose, motivate and prepare African American males for technical careers and post-secondary education in the Power Generation and Renewable Energy industries. The project will engage 240 Metropolitan Detroit African American males, grades 10-12, in project based out-of-school time science and engineering activities that teach concepts related to the production and storage of energy. Using a cohort model, students will engage in STEM educational programming, college readiness and youth mentoring over a 15 month period. In addition to technical concept mastery, students will be meeting business professionals, entrepreneurs and university students pursing degrees in science and engineering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The major content areas of the program includes project based engineering and leadership courses, career exploration activities, and a community service opportunity. Each course will be structured to meet the learning needs of high school students. Courses will rotate throughout the campuses of Detroit Area Pre-College Engineering Program with partners located in the Detroit Metropolitan Area, Michigan State University (Lansing, MI) and Michigan Technological University (Houghton, MI) A key aspect of the program is to provide the opportunity for student participants to engage in academic and technical work in the university environment. The program will conduct a mixed methods research study to directly address three guiding research questions: 1) What coherent sets of experiences effectively and efficiently support student competency, motivation and persistence for productive participation in the STEM-related workforce today or in the future. 2) What roles might business and industry workforce members play in motivating students to become aware of, interested in, and prepared for careers in the STEM-related workforce? 3) Given the shifting demographics reflected in our current classrooms and in our country, what are effective and productive ways to ensure broadening participation by engaging divers underrepresented populations in STEM programs and careers?</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   The Preparing African American Males for Energy and Education (PAAMEE) program focused on one primary research question - What individual and combined structural support components of the PAAMEE program influence the sustained motivation, engagement, science efficacy and science leadership skills of AfricanAmerican males?  The PAAMEE research model was designed to extend existing theoretical frameworks regarding key program components for the successful engagement of African American males in the energy sector. We anticipated that new knowledge generated from the research would have implications for the way programs utilize quantitative data and qualitative ethnographic data to design future out-of-school time (OST) science and engineering programs.  The outcomes of this program resulted from a number of activities that took place throughout this research project, including:    STEM courses focused on power generation and renewable energy (PG &amp; RE) topics taking place over an 18-month period for 8-week terms twice per year led by instructors at:   Lawrence Technological University   University of Michigan Ann Arbor   Oakland University     Pre/post tests to measure student growth in academic proficiency in STEM subjects   End-of-course attitudinal surveys to measure student attitudes towards program experiences   Residential summer camps at Michigan State University and Michigan Technological University   Internship opportunities with local leading energy providers including DTE Energy, Consumers Energy, and Walker Miller Energy Services   Financial stipends for early cohort PAAMEE participants   Focus groups with program participants   Experiential field trips to large national conferences celebrating and honoring the outstanding work of racial and ethnic minorities in STEM fields   These activities below resulted in the impact below:   OST STEM program providers will revise and improve their curriculum by increasing the amount of independent activities and introducing the application of real work scenarios regarding renewable energy efficiencies.   Future DAPCEP program curriculum will: continue teaching students how concepts are applied in every-day life with interactive projects, include fewer lectures, and ensure students have opportunities to partner with other students when engaging in application projects.   Multi-year programs will add an additional experiential field-trip component. Following BEYA conference trips from Michigan to Washington D.C., students reported they learned a great deal from the professional development workshops and valued the networking opportunities with professionals/corporations in the STEM fields.   Mentorship was a successful component of the PAAMEE program and we will be incorporated as a permanent feature in multi-year programs. Graduate students and young professionals in the STEM fields mentored students throughout the program and supported student growth and success in the program.   Corporate partnerships and relationships with industry practitioners will be leveraged to offer students paid internships. These opportunities provided students with a short-term goal to work towards and offered students the chance to use knowledge acquired in programs in a real-world setting.   Incentive activities, including distributing financial stipends to students, will be further researched to surface stronger evidence of their impact on student engagement. Findings from qualitative data and focus group feedback indicated that while financial incentives do encourage student participation in the program, the effects are limited to the short-term achievement of requirements for the active course. Analyses did not source enough data to conclude that long-term participation through-out the 18-month program was tied to financial stipends.   Program providers will explore cohort models where students are given the opportunity to engage with their peers over a longer period of time. Shared experiences with peers resulted in students expressing a sense of kinship that brought a depth to the program not experienced in other OST programs. Students said, "The group activities and sharing rooms on trips forced me to communicate and get out of my comfort zone"; "I have a whole new group of friends that I am thankful for."
