<AbstractNarration>The Spectrum Sharing Radio Challenge (Spectrum-ShaRC) is an international student challenge aimed at stimulating and encouraging students to engage in research and innovation in the field of cognitive radio and spectrum sharing. The challenge runs from October through June 2016.  This project will provide travel grants to support student travel for the top eight US-based Spectrum-ShaRC teams to participate in the final round of the challenge to be held at Blacksburg, Virgnia. Radios developed by the student teams are scored and ranked based on criteria that include the ability of the student-developed radios to transfer data quickly and accurately, adapt to interference from other radios, and avoid interfering with other radios in a dynamic radio environments. Participants will also have the opportunity to attend the symposium and summer school at a reduced registration rate. The symposium offers keynote speeches, technical presentations and tutorials on a variety of topics including mathematical methods and software for use in wireless research and research-to-technology transfer from which the students will benefit. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The challenge encourages students to develop innovative solutions that will enable safer and more reliable spectrum sharing. The developed tools for running the challenge as well as the results produced by the participants will be valuable for research and education. Results will be published in the Spectrum-ShaRC challenge report and it is expected that portions of the challenge, tools and outcomes will be published in scholarly articles and used in tutorials and university lectures.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The major goals of this grant were to provide travel support for students participating in the Spectrum-Sharing Radio Challenge and to help support administrative work related to the challenge.  This grant supported three competitions:  two for graduate and  undergraduate engineering students and one for high school students.   The competitions helped the students to learn more about the range of  frequencies of electromagnetic waves used by cell phones, Wi-Fi, and  other kinds of radios to transmit voice, data, and video.  Some of these  frequencies are also used by military and police radars and other types  of systems.  This range of frequencies is known as the radio frequency  spectrum.  The students also learned about ways that radios can share  these frequencies better to improve service to users of wireless  devices.  Radio transmitters can interfere with one another if they are located too close together or use the same frequencies, but many radio frequencies are not used most of the time, even in busy areas.  Because so many frequencies are lightly used, it is possible to provide much faster data rates or serve more users, while maintaining good performance for vital systems like military radars.  To do this, radios can share frequencies in a way that gives the most important systems a higher priority than other radios.  In the Spectrum-Sharing Radio Challenge, graduate and undergraduate engineering students competed to program pairs of radios to send and receive data even if another radio started to transmit on the same frequencies that the students’ radios were using.  For example, the students could program their radios to stop transmitting briefly, possibly many times per second, to listen for other signals.  If the students’ radios detected another signal, they could quickly tune to new frequencies and use the new frequencies to send and receive data.   The high-school students read and watched videos about wireless communications and competed by operating pairs of radios using a web page that let them control the radios and see how fast the radios were able to send and receive data.  Some of the high school students may study engineering, and all of them had an opportunity to become better informed users of wireless technologies.  The challenge organizers provided a moving obstacle course of radio signals to test the students’ ability to program or operate their radios. To do this, the challenge organizers programmed other radios to start and stop transmitting, increase and decrease their transmitting power, increase and decrease their transmitting frequencies, or to "hop" or rapidly tune from one frequency to another.  Students who participated in the challenges learned things that could help them develop new ways to use and share the radio frequency spectrum to provide better and faster service to more users in more places.  The radios that the students used and the radios that the challenge organizers programmed are in one of the buildings on the Virginia Tech campus and are part of an experimental system or testbed called CORNET.  The radios can be connected to one another using cables and can also transmit and receive over the air using antennas.  All of the students who participated in the final phases of the competitions met faculty and students at Virginia Tech and learned more about CORNET and other resources at Virginia Tech that can be used for research on wireless communications and related topics.  The grant provided travel support for 10 students from US universities to participate in final phases of the Spectrum-Sharing Radio Challenge at Virginia Tech in 2016 and 2017. Seven students, including two female students, were supported in 2016 to compete in the final phase of the 2015-16 challenge and three students were supported in 2017 to compete in the final phase of the 2016-17 challenge.  Students from universities in other countries also participated, with support from a different grant.  The grant also helped Virginia Tech host a high-school level challenge in 2019 and prepare to host future challenges that could include nationwide remote interactive competitions.  Motorola Solutions Foundation and Ettus Research as well as several organizations that are part of Virginia Tech also helped to support the Spectrum-Sharing Radio Challenge.  CORNET and the software used in the challenge were developed with support from Virginia Tech and other organizations including the National Science Foundation.
