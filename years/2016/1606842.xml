<AbstractNarration>With this award, the Chemistry of Life Processes Program in the Chemistry Division is funding Dr. Nicholas Silvaggi from University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee to study how protein structure affects its function. In particular he is studying an enzyme known as MppP which reacts with molecular oxygen to add a hydroxyl group into the amino acid arginine. What is most interesting about MppP is that, while its structure closely resembles that of several other related proteins, its chemistry is very different. By studying MppP the PI is learning how to make educated guesses about the functions of the many uncharacterized proteins uncovered in genome sequencing. In addition, understanding how MppP works is improving understanding of natural products biosynthesis and the processes by which existing enzyme structures are adapted to perform new functions. As part of this project the PI is also developing the PX Lab experience, a program designed to give exceptional students from area high schools an immersive experience in modern structural biology research. The students are working as a team with their teachers, and supervised by the PI and his graduate students, to clone, express, purify, crystallize, and determine the structure of a fluorescent protein. In this way, the research being done in the lab is also training teachers and tomorrow's scientists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The non-proteinogenic amino acid L-enduracididine (L-End) is a component of a number of bacterially-produced natural products. The pathway for the production of L-End from arginine is thought to involve some unique enzymatic activities, but the reactions catalyzed by the three biosynthetic enzymes, MppP, MppQ and MppR, are unknown. Recent findings show that MppP is a previously unknown class of oxygenase that requires only PLP and molecular oxygen to insert an oxygen atom into an unactivated C-H bond. This is an unprecedented activity for a PLP-dependent enzyme. The objective of this work is to understand how MppP catalyzes this reaction and which structural features account for its unusual activity.Ppre-steady state enzyme kinetics, together with kinetic isotope effects, NMR spectroscopy, and mass spectrometry are being used to probe the catalytic mechanism. Structural features of MppP required for its hydroxylation reaction is being identified by X-ray crystallographic and enzymes kinetics studies of mutant forms of MppP, both alone and in complexes with ligands. The outcome of the research is detailed mechanistic information about how MppP carries out its reaction, which is helping understand how evolution has modified the Type I aminotransferase fold to perform a new catalytic function. These outcomes are expanding knowledge of PLP-dependent enzymes, specifically, of enzyme structure-function relationships, as well as improving the accuracy of protein function predictions.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The pathway for the production of L-enduracididine (L-End) from L-arginine is thought to involve some unique enzymatic activities, but the reactions catalyzed by the three biosynthetic enzymes MppP, MppQ and MppR, are unknown. Our initial discovery that MppP used molecular oxygen to oxidize an unactivated C-H bond identified an unprecedented activity for a pyridoxal 5&rsquo;-phosphate (PLP)-dependent enzyme. The objective of this work is to understand how MppP catalyzes this reaction and which structural features account for its unusual activity. Our central hypothesis, based on our preliminary structural and biochemical characterization, is that specific residues near the PLP stabilize a quinonoid intermediate capable of 1-electron reduction of dioxygen. Because the reaction proceeds even in the presence of EDTA, is not affected by cosubstrates, and there is no evidence of additional organic cofactors in UV-Vis spectra or the crystal structure, we propose that MppP is the first example of a PLP-dependent hydroxylase/deaminase. The rationale for these experiments is that the L-End biosynthetic pathway appears to use an unusual set of enzymatic activities for the formation of heterocycles in natural products. Understanding this chemical logic will improve our understanding of natural product biosynthesis, enzyme structure and function, and the processes by which existing protein folds have evolved to catalyze different reactions. Some of the major findings of this work are that the oxygen atoms from the molecular oxygen used in the reaction are not incorporated into the fully oxidized 4-hydroxy-2-ketoarginine (4HKA) product. We also learned that the mixture of 4HKA and 2-ketoarginine (2KA) products results from partial oxidation of the substrate, L-Arg. In other words, the full 4-electron oxidation happens in 2 steps, with each step consuming one molecule of dioxygen. Interestingly, we also discovered that the N-terminus of the protein is, somewhat unexpectedly, critical for the full oxidation activity. In addition to broadening the field of PLP-dependent enzymes, this work trained 5 graduate students and 4 undergraduates. These data have been published in one peer reviewed article and been presented in 8 conference presentations as well as 3 doctoral dissertations. Another 4 peer-reviewed journal articles are nearing submission at the time of this writing. Our involvement with the SMART Teams program over the course of this project has exposed approximately 35 high school students to the process of scientific research. Several of these students have gone on to pursue graduate degrees in STEM fields.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 04/14/2020<br>      Modified by: Nicholas&nbsp;R&nbsp;Silvaggi</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
