<AbstractNarration>Cost-effective nanolithography technologies are increasingly needed for realizing scalable manufacturing of commercially-viable devices based on emerging nanostructures, such as nanoelectronic components in computer chips, nanoscale memory cells (or media) that can result in improved data storage capability, and photonic nanostructures for improving the power efficiency of solar cells. Recently, nanoimprint lithography has been adopted by the industry as an important candidate nanomanufacturing technology for patterning such nanostructures. Despite its advantages such as low processing cost, high patterning resolution, and high throughput, the current nanoimprinting systems suffer from nanoscale defects, which have seriously limited process yields and significantly hindered industrial applications. This Grant Opportunity for Academic Liaison with Industry (GOALI) award will seek to establish new nanomanufacturing methods capable of reducing or eliminating such defects. The research topics span over multiple disciplines of science and engineering including nanomanufacturing, electrostatics, hydrodynamics, simulation, and process characterization. These disciplines will be integrated to provide interdisciplinary knowledge to a broad range of people including K-12 students and educators, undergraduates, graduates, and students from underrepresented groups. This project will also involve collaboration with industry to ensure the technologies developed are scalable and commercially relevant.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Currently, nanoscale gas bubbles trapped in imprint resist films are one of the most serious defects that affect the yields of manufacturing-grade nanoimprint systems. The research team's preliminary study demonstrates that the formation of such nanoscale defects is mainly attributed to surface pinning of resist spreading edges at the nanostructures or contaminants on the mold-substrate interfaces. However, there is still a lack of effective methods to eliminate such detrimental pinning effects and resulting gas defects. In this project, the research team aims to close this knowledge gap by creating and investigating a new light-curable nanoimprint technology based on nanoscopic electrohydrodynamic effects, which is anticipated to improve resist filling characteristics, significantly reduce or eliminate nanoscale gas defects, and therefore greatly enhance the yields of imprinted nanostructures over large areas. In particular, they will construct molecular dynamics models for investigating the effects of electrohydrodynamic forces on the dynamic evolution of nanoscale gas defects; build an electrohydrodynamic force-assisted nanoimprint system for determining and testing defect-free nanomanufacturing mechanisms; and combine modeling and experimental data to refine the simulation models.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p class="Default">The nanoscale gas bubble defects and other contamination features trapped in the resists seriously degrade the yield of the nanoimprint and nanoprinting systems for manufacturing high-quality nanostructures and devices. Neither the research community nor the industry has made enough progress to fully understand the formation mechanisms of such defective features and develop new nanomanufacturing processes capable of reducing and even eliminating such defects. In this NSF-sponsored project, the PIs and Seagate Technology (STX) Corporation have been collaborating to build an interdisciplinary university-industry team to create a new integrative nanoimprint and nanoprint system, which can improve resist filling characteristics and therefore significantly reduce or eliminate nanoscale gas defects, as well as demonstrate nanomanufacturing (or nanofabrication) of functional devices based on emerging nanomaterials. This project has linked fundamental academic research and transformative defect-free nanomanufacturing of functional devices in industrial applications. From 08/2016 to 12/2020, the collaborative research team has finished a series of sub-goals: (1) constructed nanofluidics and electrohydrodynamics (EHD) models, which can quantitatively simulate the formation processes of nanoscale gas defects and analyze the effects of EHD forces on the dynamic evolution of such defects at nanoscales (Fig. 1); (2) created molecular dynamics (MD) models, which can provide scientific insights for understanding the defect evolutions in terms of the molecular interactions; (3) leveraged the obtained knowledge to create a new integrative nanoimprint and nanoprint tool with extended lithography capabilities; (4) demonstrated the fabrication of a series of functional devices using the established integrative nanoimprint/nanoprint tool, including bit-patterned media (BPM) devices, nanoscale organic thin-film transistors (nano-OTFTs), memories, emerging neutral network devices as well as energy storage devices (e.g., microscale Li-ion batteries).</p> <p class="Default">&nbsp;</p> <p class="Default">Intellectual Merits:&nbsp; This NSF-funded project has resulted in a transformative impact on the development of new nanoimprint and nanoprint-based manufacturing tools and processes, and also advanced the scientific/technical knowledge for dealing with (or harvesting) lithography-induced defects and physical/chemical effects on device substrates. In addition, this project has demonstrated the manufacturing of a series of new function devices, as listed below: (1) cost-effective nanomanufacturing of nanoscale organic thin-film-transistor (OTFT) arrays, in which we demonstrated poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) OTFT arrays with channel length of 66 nm, which exhibits highly consistent On/Off ratios up to ~ 10<sup>6</sup> (Fig. 2); (2) nanoimprint/nanoprint-based manufacturing of 2D material devices with reduced defects (Fig. 3); (3) dispensing- and rubbing-induced site-selective growth (RISS) of 2D-material-based device patterns, which are important byproducts of this project and have enabled nanoimprint-based manufacturing of memristive devices and microscale Li-ion batteries (Fig. 4 and Fig. 5).</p> <p class="Default">&nbsp;</p> <p class="Default">Broader Impacts: This work has also broadly contributed fundamental knowledge in the areas of (1) computational fluidic dynamics; (2) nanoscale and microscale mechanics and fluid mechanics; (3) nanomanufacturing of new neuromorphic and energy devices. In terms of education and outreach outcomes, this project has involved the participation of students from a broad range of backgrounds and disciplines. Since the beginning of this project, this project has involved the participation of three undergraduate students into the research activity. They were admitted through the University of Michigan's Undergraduate Research Opportunity (UROP) and Research, Innovation, Service and Entrepreneurship (RISE) programs. UROP is one of several education/research initiatives created to improve the retention and academic achievement of underrepresented students on the University of Michigan campus. UROP students are usually involved into the cutting-edge research activity during the regular academic terms. In the RISE program, undergraduate students get the opportunity to work alongside renowned faculty members in research facilities on cutting-edge projects that potentially impact our society. Students can participate in a RISE project individually with a Mechanical Engineering professor. These UROP and RISE students have made significant progress in understanding nanofluidic mechanisms responsible for the formation of nanoscale gas bubble defects in nanoimprint processes, as well as exploring new applications of our nanoimprint approaches for manufacturing nanoscale organic and 2D-material devices. For the graduate education, this project has already initiated the thesis works for three Ph.D students. All three Ph.D students have successfully graduated by Summer 2020. In addition, one new Ph.D candidate student was admitted to work on this project until the end of the project. Furthermore, the nanofabricaton knowledge created in this project has enable two new chapters for ME599 course - Introduction of Nanofabrication and Nanomanufacturing Technology.</p> <p class="Default">&nbsp;</p> <p class="Default">&nbsp;</p> <p class="Default">&nbsp;</p> <p class="Default">&nbsp;</p> <p class="Default">&nbsp;</p> <p class="Default">&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 04/28/2021<br>      Modified by: Xiaogan&nbsp;Liang</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1636132/1636132_10451471_1619665893305_Fig1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1636132/1636132_10451471_1619665893305_Fig1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Nanofluidic and EHD Analysis of Nanoimprinted Material Flows"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1636132/1636132_10451471_1619665893305_Fig1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Nanofluidic and EHD Analysis of Nanoimprinted Material Flows"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Constructed nanofluidics and electrohydrodynamics (EHD) models, which can quantitatively simulate the formation processes of nanoscale gas defects and analyze the effects of EHD forces on the dynamic evolution of such defects at nanoscales</div> <div class="imageCredit">Xiaogan Liang</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Xiaogan&nbsp;Liang</div> <div class="imageTitle">Nanofluidic and EHD Analysis of Nanoimprinted Material Flows</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1636132/1636132_10451471_1619665709971_Fig2--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1636132/1636132_10451471_1619665709971_Fig2--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Nanoimprint Process for Making OTFT Arrays Free of Air Void Defects"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1636132/1636132_10451471_1619665709971_Fig2--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Nanoimprint Process for Making OTFT Arrays Free of Air Void Defects"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Cost-effective, defect-free nanomanufacturing of nanoscale organic thin-film-transistor (OTFT) arrays, in which we demonstrated poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) OTFT arrays with channel length of 66 nm, which exhibits highly consistent On/Off ratios up to ~ 10^6</div> <div class="imageCredit">Xiaogan Liang</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Xiaogan&nbsp;Liang</div> <div class="imageTitle">Nanoimprint Process for Making OTFT Arrays Free of Air Void Defects</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1636132/1636132_10451471_1619665971417_Fig3--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1636132/1636132_10451471_1619665971417_Fig3--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Defect Control in Nanoimprint/Nanoprint-Produced 2D Material Structures"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1636132/1636132_10451471_1619665971417_Fig3--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Defect Control in Nanoimprint/Nanoprint-Produced 2D Material Structures"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Nanoimprint/nanoprint-based manufacturing of 2D material devices with reduced defects</div> <div class="imageCredit">Xiaogan Liang</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Xiaogan&nbsp;Liang</div> <div class="imageTitle">Defect Control in Nanoimprint/Nanoprint-Produced 2D Material Structures</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1636132/1636132_10451471_1619668619340_Fig4--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1636132/1636132_10451471_1619668619340_Fig4--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Inkjet-Dispensing-Based Lithography for Manufacturing Microscale Li-ion Batteries"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1636132/1636132_10451471_1619668619340_Fig4--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Inkjet-Dispensing-Based Lithography for Manufacturing Microscale Li-ion Batteries"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">dispensing-induced site-selective growth (RISS) of 2D-material-based device patterns</div> <div class="imageCredit">Xiaogan Liang</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Xiaogan&nbsp;Liang</div> <div class="imageTitle">Inkjet-Dispensing-Based Lithography for Manufacturing Microscale Li-ion Batteries</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
