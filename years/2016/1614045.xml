<AbstractNarration>Nanoparticles are used in personal care products and industry. They also form naturally from mining. The release of nanoparticles into aquatic ecosystems is rapidly increasing and receiving attention due to the potential environmental and human health risks. However, little is known on the risks that influence toxicity of nanoparticles.  In collaboration with Dr. Shosaku Kashiwada, an expert in the field of environmental nanoscience, at the Research Center for Life and Environmental Sciences at Toyo University, this project will determine the fate of nanoparticles through an aquatic food chain from insect to fish.  The uptake of metal nanoparticles from sediments and its potential impacts on the aquatic food web is not fully understood.  This missing information is crucial as many fish species feed on sediment dwelling insects. Importantly, understanding the transfer of metals to fish will provide a resource for the public and policy makers to determine the risk of consuming fish from metal contaminated environments and the economic implications. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Zinc-nanoparticles are the focus of this research because of the high concentrations of zinc at metal-contaminated sites in the U.S. and in Japan. Zinc is also a significant contaminant of concern to regulatory agencies in both countries. Applications in applied ecotoxicology, gene expression and bio-imaging will be used to measure the trophic transfer of zinc nanoparticles in sediments in the laboratory.  The proposed research is a novel approach for the growing practice of using gene expression to answer ecological questions. A field colonization experiment will also be conducted at a site impacted by metal contamination to identify the insects tolerant to metals and to quantify metal transfer up the food chain.  The field study will fill in knowledge gaps needed to model the fate of metal nanoparticles in the aquatic food chain while addressing broad ecological questions about the usefulness of species traits in predicting effects of environmental stressors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award under the East Asia and Pacific Summer Institutes program supports summer research by a U.S. graduate student and is jointly funded by NSF and the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[Mining activities contribute to the release of metal-nanoparticles and fine-sediment into aquatic ecosystems, and are raising concerns about the potential environmental and human health risks.  Metals may influence reproduction, growth, and survival of aquatic life and ultimately impact ecosystem recovery at mining sites. However, there is little information on how fine-sediment influences the toxicity of metal-nanoparticles on aquatic insect communities.  The two main objectives of research conducted at Toyo University, Research Center for Life and Environmental Sciences, were to determine the impact of metal-contaminated sediments on benthic invertebrate communities and understand the fate of metal-nanoparticles through an aquatic food chain from insect to fish. The uptake of metal nanoparticles from sediments and its potential impacts on the aquatic food web is not fully understood. This missing information is necessary as many fish species feed on sediment dwelling insects. First, we used field colonization experiments to understand the how aquatic insect communities respond to metal-contamination and fine sediments, and how much of the insect community in Japan will contribute to the transfer of metals up the food chain.  We also used this data to understand how species traits respond to contaminants across broad geographic scales by comparing U.S. and Japan experimental field data.  Next, we measured chironomid larvae mortality, emergence, and uptake of zinc-nanoparticles from stream sediments and then to medaka fish.   Laboratory experiments showed that although low concentrations of zinc nanoparticles may not result in high mortality, there may be implications on emergence of larvae to adult stages.  Our results also suggest that more work should be done on fate of metal nanoparticles in the environment, particularly in sediments.  Zinc nanoparticles may be less available of uptake in the sediments, however we observed these insects exposed to high sublethal concentrations to be smaller and more emergence of chironomids at lower concentrations.    For the field study, we found greater impacts of metal-contaminated fine-sediments on aquatic insect communities and this remained in-line with field studies conducted in the United States, with greater effects of metal-contamination on early colonizing benthic invertebrates.  Chironomids were more tolerant to metal-contaminated fine sediments in Japan, however for comparisons of sites in the United States we used species traits. We discovered that traits were better for understanding impacts of metal-contaminated sediments across geographic spatial scales than taxonomic descriptions.  Particularly morphological traits and traits that describe feeding groups and habitat preferences were most important for distinguishing between treatments with and without metal-contaminated fine sediments.   This research can help aid our understanding of the impacts of mining activities on global species occurrence.  The use of species traits has been receiving more attention in applied ecotoxicology and this study is one of few that uses field experimental approaches to study impacts of contaminants on trait composition across continents.  By using experimental field and laboratory applications we can inform the public of impacts of disturbances on the environment.  Contaminants can be harmful to the public that consume aquatic organisms and use water for recreation.  This research may help to provide a more comprehensive picture on the impacts of contaminants and landuse practices on the health of aquatic ecosystems.
