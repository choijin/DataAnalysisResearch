<AbstractNarration>This Phase II project aims to help address the achievement gap for English Learners, who consistently average 21% below native English speakers on reading scale scores starting in 4th grade and are twice as likely to drop out of school. Eighty percent of teachers believe that materials for English Learners are sub-standard, which contributes to this gap. The project provides an online crowd-authoring and sharing platform that gives K-6 language teachers the tools to meet their unique instructional needs on demand. It is the first and only platform to enable practicing teachers to rapidly build digital language lessons and interactive games that align to their specific requirements, without any technical know-how. The platform provides built-in rich media resources that adhere to best practices based on the cognitive theory of multimedia learning. Any teacher may access these open educational resources at no cost, provided they make their own creations available for public reuse, revision and remixing. The project seeks to understand the dynamics of collaboration and quality assurance for interactive content at a massive scale. Crowd-authoring can invest educators with the power to transform language learning into a field that is highly responsive to the evolving needs of educators and learners.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Phase II project will pioneer mass customization of interactive games and media in the field of second language acquisition. The project aims for teachers to create 175,000 custom digital lessons and interactive games using media resources provided by the project. Phase II will develop four new types of games that improve language acquisition using audiovisual experimentation, realtime chat with artificial intelligences, and a new technology that transforms visuals and narratives composed by students into grammatically accurate text and audio. Phase II will integrate these innovations into a crowd-authoring and quality assurance system capable of scaling to 100,000 new teacher-made learning objects per month. By giving language educators tools to rapidly create, share and customize content to meet their precise needs, the project seeks to significantly improve learning outcomes. Phase II will implement real-time formative assessment reports for teachers to evaluate student experiences and issues with the custom teacher-made interactive content. A controlled full-year, multi-site educational impact study will measure whether the project affects vocabulary acquisition, comprehension, grammar and sentence formation, and whether any skill gains transfer to other contexts. It will also reveal deep data insights about the process by which K-6 students acquire a second language.</AbstractNarration>

Students learn through interactive activities and collaboration with built-in multisensory learning supports. In Phase II, an independent evaluator funded by NSF found that just 30 minutes per week of Speak Agent over a 12-week period accelerated science language acquisition among low-income 2nd graders in Manor, Texas by 210%.

This platform has been used to create more than 112,000 learning objects, most of them open-license, meaning that educators may freely reuse, revise, and remix them. "Learning objects" are lessons, interactive games and activities, vocabulary sets, visuals, videos, and other items that are organized into an online library. The research team at Speak Agent, Inc. has curated this library of classroom-tested, interactive resources and has built a sustainable business that is enabling this curation to continue beyond Phase II. The Speak Agent platform has been implemented at three of the nation's 50 largest public school districts at the elementary and middle school levels. Many more districts and schools are adopting the technology platform for the 2019-2020 school year.</p> <p dir="ltr"><span>The Phase II SBIR project is also impacting the field of STEM language acquisition. The R&amp;D team has developed a unique approach that aligns, for example, to the Next Generation Science Standards and the eight science practices. Improvements in academic language acquisition can have a significant impact particularly on STEM fields, where the language is a barrier to learning the content and concepts. Four-fifths of students, according to the ACT Benchmark, are unprepared to succeed even in a 101-level college STEM course. This applies not only to English Learners and low-income students, but also to the general student population. To augment the technology component, professional development resources were also produced as part of this project. These are already helping educators to better integrate academic language best practices into their daily practice and to become more effective STEM teachers at districts across the USA.</span></p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 05/06/2019<br>      Modified by: Benjamin&nbsp;L&nbsp;Grimley</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1632488/1632488_10448908_1557175412168_Game-collage--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1632488/1632488_10448908_1557175412168_Game-collage--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Game Collage"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1632488/1632488_10448908_1557175412168_Game-collage--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Game Collage"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">A collage of several of the interactive game and activity templates, most developed during Phase II.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Speak Agent, Inc.</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Benjamin&nbsp;L&nbsp;Grimley</div> <div class="imageTitle">Game Collage</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1632488/1632488_10448908_1557175593823_EBBJoAnnLeleck2018CLEARED--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1632488/1632488_10448908_1557175593823_EBBJoAnnLeleck2018CLEARED--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Speak Agent in Action"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1632488/1632488_10448908_1557175593823_EBBJoAnnLeleck2018CLEARED--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Speak Agent in Action"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Students at JoAnn Leleck Elementary using a Speak Agent group activity.
