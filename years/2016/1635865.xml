<AbstractNarration>Nanoscale materials are found in many consumer products to serve as particle reinforcement in a polymer matrix; the material system is called a polymer nanocomposite. One such example is the use of nanoscale silica particles in tires to improve fuel economy. Choices of material combinations are often determined through trial and error experiments.  This research grant will enable the design of polymer nanocomposites via an informed approach using computational modeling and experiments, resulting in a simple tool to predict compatibility as a function of material types and processing conditions. Potential applications for polymer nanocomposites include solar cells, sports equipment, medical devices and aerospace structures.  The project will involve several female undergraduate students through a program at the University of Cincinnati as well as high school students through the University of Dayton Summer Honors Institute and the Minority Engineering &amp; Technology Enrichment Camp.  Long-standing relationships with Ethiopian universities will be leveraged via grants through the NSF Partnerships for Enhanced Engagement in Research (PEER) program. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Multicomponent polymer mixtures such as nanocomposites are among the most commonly used polymeric materials, but there is a significant gap in the understanding of how hierarchical structure develops in such systems. This research tests the hypothesis that it is possible to accurately determine a parameter controlling filler dispersion in a polymer matrix, and to employ this parameter in a toolbox to predict optimized structure and performance. The approach couples a pseudo-thermodynamic analysis of binary mixtures to obtain a pseudo-second order virial coefficient which quantifies binary enthalpic interactions, and which relates to a coarse-grained potential. This parameter will be employed in mesoscale simulations to predict optimal compositions, processing conditions, dispersion and/or segregation of components in complex blends, correlation functions and correlation lengths for fillers. These features can also be experimentally determined in separate x-ray and neutron scattering measurements. Therefore, the researched work involves three novel components: 1) tabulation of pseudo-second order virial coefficients using scattering and determination of potential functions for simulation; 2) dissipative particle dynamics  simulations of binary, ternary, quaternary mixtures using potentials from part 1; 3) x-ray and neutron scattering, microscopy, dynamic mechanical and rheological measurements to verify simulation results. The outcome of our approach is a practical solution to compounding issues, based on a mutually validating experimental and simulation methodology.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>A major advancement of science in the past twenty years has been the understanding that nanometer size structures can offer enhancement of properties such as in polymer nanocomposites. While polymer nanocomposites can be complex research materials, they also include commodity materials such as paints, inks, and reinforced elastomers used in tires. Many of these nano-composites were serendipitous discoveries. However, advanced manufacturing of these materials relies on understanding the structure and processes that lead to enhanced properties. The chief limitation of polymer nano-composites is dispersion of nanoparticles. Dispersion at the macroscopic scale can be determined optically. &nbsp;On the nano-scale, quantification of dispersion is a challenging problem. &nbsp;Tools that can observe on the nano-scale, such as transmission electron microscopy, do not provide sufficient averaging over macroscopic length scales. &nbsp;We have turned to small-angle scattering of X-rays and neutrons at national user facilities (Argonne (APS) and Oak Ridge (HFIR/SNS) National Laboratories) to quantify dispersion and structuring of average nano-particles over macroscopic scales. This has resulted in a quantitative measure of nano-dispersion as a function of particle size, and topology, as well as processing and chemical treatment. We can use this quantification of nano-dispersion and structure as input to coarse-grain computer simulations to explore the possibilities of chemical modification and processing for nano-composites.</p> <p>An outgrowth of these studies has been a new understanding of the multi-hierarchical assembly of molecular clusters into useful commercial products. For instance, inkjet ink is composed of organic nanoparticles in water with a non-ionic surfactant (detergent). In this case, the dispersion, on a nanoscale, is controlled by the surfactant which governs clustering of the nanoparticles into primary particles. Depending on the size of these solid primary clusters, the structure of aggregates (like nano-dust bunnies) can grow and branch with small clusters leading to highly branched large aggregates, and larger primary clusters leading to weakly branched, smaller aggregates. The aggregate structure and the drying conditions and shear during the printing process control the formation of a network of aggregates that percolates to macroscopic dimensions and dominates the optical scattering (luster) and mechanical integrity of the printed ink. Controlling dispersion on the scale of nanoparticles is the tool that can be used to modify the resulting print quality through an understanding of this hierarchical assembly. Similar sequences of multi-hierarchical emergence are important to a variety of commercial materials such as paints and stains, tires, and even shampoo and conditioners. &nbsp;We have worked with Bridgestone, Goodyear, Sun Chemical, Procter &amp; Gamble and other companies in finding applications for this type of multi-hierarchical emergence.</p> <p>Figures 1, 2, and 3 show some of the results of collaborative work with Bridgestone and Goodyear. Figure 1 shows cryo-transmission electron micrographs of carbon black nano-aggregates in polybutadiene elastomer.&nbsp; The second micrograph shows networks of clustered nano-aggregates.&nbsp; In Figure 2, The clusters percolate under semi-dilute conditions to form a micron-scale network. At small scales, clusters of carbon black nano-aggregates form above the overlap concentration which influence tire behvior at highway speeds. At large scales, these clusters percolate to form a micron-scale network which impacts curb strength and tear resistance. Figure 3 shows the results of this clustering and network formation in dynamic rheology (top and right axis and squares and circles) and scattering (left and bottom axis and green and blue curves). The weak -2.2 slope on the blue semi-dilute scattering curve is an indication of micron-scale network formation (associated with tear resistance). At high frequency the dilute and semi-dilute rheology (red circles and black squares) scale with the filler concentration.&nbsp; At low-frequency the Hookean elastic and flow points (solid and open squares) are parallel indicating network formation. This work is the first direct comparison of structure and flow in nanocomposites.</p> <p>The multi-hierarchical approach has also found use in developing alternatives to expensive silver inks for printed electronics. &nbsp;Doped titania inks were developed in collaboration with students and faculty at the University of Sheffield in the UK for production of screen-printed soil moisture sensors.
