<AbstractNarration>Shale gas exploration and extraction through hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling, have come to comprise a major component of the American energy supply. Social scientists have documented the enivronmental controversies and local resistance that sometimes accompany these practices, as well as the movements calling for more sustainable and environemtnally benign forms of energy. But less attention has been paid to communities that favor petroleum development.  That is the subject of the research supported by this award, which will be undertaken by University of Colorado doctoral student, Gregorio Ortiz, under the supervision of anthropologist, Dr. Jerry K. Jacka. The researchers ask: How do communities that support fracking engage with the environmental discourse against it? How do people in such communities understand their place within environmental discourse and are these conceptions affected by their support of extractive development?  Is local extractive development, in turn, affected by the sensibilites of local communities? Findings from this research will fill critical gaps in scientific understanding of the social and environmental impacts of resource extraction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will be conducted around the on-going development of the Eagle Ford Shale in south Texas. The region is an appropriate site because it has a long history of petroleum development and natural environmental challenges, such as drought. The oil boom of the 1970s and 1980s shaped the area's recent history even though it did not always lead to infrastructural development nor improved livelihoods. Consequently, the subsequent resource "bust" has affected local livelihoods in complex ways, which makes the study of why local residents support further petroleum development particularly interesting. Ortiz will focus on the communities of the Middle Rio Grande Development Council of Governments in south Texas. He will use a mix of social science methods beginning with archival research; semi-structured interviews with both governmental and non-governmental local and state representatives whose work engages the petroleum industry; and participant observations and interviews with petroleum industry workers. He will then move on to in-depth ethnography, participant observation, and surveys in two local communities. Data collection activities will include interviews, focus groups, and local land and resource mapping. The researcher will highlight how environmental concerns do and do not inform development policy and projects, and if and how perspectives on the environment have changed since the development of the Eagle Ford Shale began.  Findings from this study will contribute to the development of more complete social science theory about the relationship between development, energy, and environmental judgment. Findings may also inform development of community-appropriate energy policy.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>I successfully completed my principal dissertation fieldwork in December 2017 and returned to the University of Colorado, Boulder, to begin analyzing my data and writing my dissertation. The National Science Foundation Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement Grant for research entitled &ldquo;Uneven Development and Environmental Subjectivities in the Eagle Ford Shale, South Texas&rdquo; primarily funded my dissertation fieldwork. During my fieldwork I interviewed more than 70 local and regional residents and met with dozens more. My goal with this dissertation is to analyze how residents of south Texas, who have a long history of resource extraction and development, engage with the rapid development of the Eagle Ford Shale. More specifically, this dissertation will look at how Cotulla, Texas, a predominantly Mexican American community with a rich history of political and economic struggle, navigates the intersection of their cultural past and resource future. The history of south Texas is a dense and complex one characterized by the dominance of evolving political-economic systems&mdash;missionization, farming, ranching, hunting, and now energy. For Mexicans and Mexican Americans, much of this history is one of prejudice and poverty. Wealth has historically been concentrated in a minority of the region&rsquo;s population&mdash;the Anglo population&mdash;while racial/ethnic tensions fueled social and political segregation until as recent as the 1970s. The early 1970s saw the rise of a political revolution in Cotulla that was deeply inspired by the Civil Rights Movement. The <em>La Raza Unida </em>Party<em>,</em> led by some of Cotulla&rsquo;s most educated and boisterous youth, permanently altered the political landscape. This generation of leaders remains very active in their community. More important, the political narrative of the movement they helped create is the foundation to the community&rsquo;s perspective of its future. After generations of economic and political hardship, communities like Cotulla see the Eagle Ford Shale as an opportunity to develop, materially and non, in ways that have been historically inaccessible. This dissertation seeks to assess how this cultural pursuit by Cotulla intersects with the anthropological literature on fracking, development, and political ecology. South Texas is still a highly rural landscape dependent on hunting and ranching. The discourse surrounding the economic opportunities of oil and gas stand in stark contrast to the discourse seen in other rural shale gas regions in the country; that is, drilling and fracking is often not<em> </em>discussed in the frame of controversy as seen in New York, Pennsylvania, North Dakota, or even in San Antonio and Dallas. Rather, for many in Cotulla, resource extraction is seen as symbiotic with the natural environment&mdash;their ecology incorporates oil and gas. It is my objective to demonstrate in this dissertation how the cultural and political-economic history of south Texans informs the role that the environment plays in this development. I have given two oral presentations based on my fieldwork findings thus far. The first presentation was with the University of Colorado Energy Club as an invited speaker and was entitled, "Culture and Development on the Eagle Ford Shale." The second oral presentation was at the 2018 Society for Applied Anthropology meeting in Philadelphia and was entitled, "Perceptions of Development: History, Memory, and Politics on the Eagle Ford Shale." Both presentations received high praise and I expect publications, both academic and non, to be equally productive.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 05/14/2018<br>      Modified by: Gregorio&nbsp;Ortiz</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
