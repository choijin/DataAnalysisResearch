<AbstractNarration>The proposed effort consists of increasing awareness amongst Iowa State University faculty about opportunities in research, education and outreach that engage individuals with disabilities.  This objective will be achieved by through a series of three workshops on campus that will cover national and local perspectives and highlight opportunities, case studies and best practices in this arena.  Persons with disabilities are severely underrepresented in the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields of study.  This group consists of an entire population of lifelong problem solvers.  Engaging them into the STEM educational pipeline and the STEM workforce is to the benefit of national interests. The efforts of the workshop will contribute to faculty development at Iowa State University by enhancing their understanding of 1) diversity and inclusivity with respect to persons with disabilities and; 2) opportunities, resources and best practices in engaging persons with a wide range of learning abilities.  Consequently the project stands to broaden participation of under-represented groups in STEM, broaden the research and education portfolio at Iowa State University and contribute to STEM workforce development for the nation.  Finally, the dissemination of findings from the workshops will help educate broad communities in the state and nation on these topics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed effort is to increase awareness amongst Iowa State University faculty about opportunities in research, education and outreach that engage individuals with disabilities.  This will be achieved through a series of three on-campus workshops: 1) Research and Outreach, focusing on technical research that addresses challenges faced by persons with disabilities; 2) Universal Design I, introducing the concept of making educational environments and products more inclusive for all students, staff, faculty and visitors and; 3) Universal Design II, which will feature presentations by faculty and staff who have implemented universal design into their courses and a tutorial of existing resources at Iowa State.  The findings, observations and recommendations from the workshops will be disseminated through publicly available websites at Iowa State University and via presentations/publications at ASEE national conferences and the Iowa NSF-EPSCoR annual meeting in Summer 2016. The workshops cover research aimed at 1) providing technical solutions to challenges faced by persons with disabilities and; 2) tools used for enabling access to instruction for students with a wide range of learning abilities.  The proposed effort will also contribute to faculty development at Iowa State University by enhancing their understanding of 1) diversity and inclusivity with respect to persons with disabilities and; 2) opportunities, resources and best practices in engaging persons with a wide range of learning abilities. Consequently the project stands to broaden participation of under-represented groups in STEM and broaden the research and education portfolio at Iowa State University.  Finally, the dissemination of findings from the workshops will help educate broad communities in the state and nation on these topics.</AbstractNarration>
