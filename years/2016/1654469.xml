<AbstractNarration>The ever increasing need for a robust and reliable infrastructure for the curation, storage and sharing of research data has been identified across multiple disciplines. While the needs of different research communities will vary, there are many issues which the Civil, Mechanical and Manufacturing Innovation communities will have in common for data infrastructure. This award supports a workshop which brings these communities together to identify these needs, learn from the success of communities whose data infrastructures are further advanced, and plan for paths forward in establishing the tools, resources, and culture shifts needed to bring open sharing of research data to the broad engineering community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop supported by this award will highlight the key issues that must be addressed to realize the full impact and use of big data on the research areas represented in the Division of Civil, Mechanical and Manufacturing Innovation (CMMI) at the National Science Foundation. The community will convene to (1) develop an overall strategy and short term research agenda for capturing and sharing large volumes of data (2) recommend methods and techniques for making large data sets available and usable by the CMMI research communities (3) forge interdisciplinary research teams that can develop prototype platforms for CMMI research communities and (4) suggest best practices for NSF data management plans. Approximately 60 members of the community, including both junior and senior researchers, data scientists, library scientists, and members of the scientific publishing community will convene in Arlington, VA at NSF Headquarters.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Materials Research &amp; Data Science (MRaDS) Conference was held Sept. 25-27, 2017 at the Institute for Bioscience &amp; Biotechnology Research, University of Maryland, Rockville, Maryland.  The Conference was cohosted by the National Institute of Standards and Technology, its Center of Excellence for Hierarchical Materials Design (CHiMaD), a collaboration of Northwestern University, University of Chicago, and Argonne National Laboratory, as well as the Institute for Materials (IMat) and IDEAS:MD3 at Georgia Institute of Technology.  The two-and-a-half-day Conference brought together over 90 materials researchers in key materials industries, such as aerospace, automotive, and pharmaceutical sectors, government, and universities including graduate students, post doctoral fellows, representatives from major materials centers and data projects in the US and internationally, as well as representatives from the Subcommittee of the Materials Genome Initiative (SMGI) for the US National Science and Technology Council (NSTC) Committee on Technology (DOD, DOE, NIST, NSF, ONR).  The 2.5-day meeting aimed at early adopters included three plenary talks, ten focused panel discussions, andtwo poster/plug-in demonstrations.  The key impacts of MRaDS have been in three primary areas.  The first impact has been two follow-up meetings building upon best practices demonstrated and discussed at MRaDS:   High-Throughput Experimental Materials Collaboratory (HTE-MC) Workshop, held on 2/28/18 &ndash; 3/2/18 in Gaithersburg, Maryland.  Machine Learning in Science and Engineering 2018-Materials Science Track, to be held on 6/6-8/18 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.  A second impact has been expanded participation in the Materials Resource Registries? federation.  At the Research Data Alliance (RDA) Plenary 11 held 3/21-23/18 in Berlin, Germany, the final report with recommendations was delivered and a joint meeting of the Materials Science Interest Group and the Photon/Neutron Interest Group was held for the adoption of the Materials Resource Registry software by the Photon/Neutron communities.    The third impact of MRaDS has been development on a common Materials Vocabulary.  The Research Data Alliance (RDA) Interest Groups on Materials Science, Photon/Neutron, and Vocabulary Services are working together to find common ways to configure Semantics Assets for Materials Science.  A late May teleconference call will be held to begin discussions and make plans.       Last Modified: 05/10/2018       Submitted by: Peter W Voorhees]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
