<AbstractNarration>This grant supports travel of a diverse group of approximately 30 dissertation-stage students at US institutions to participate in an international doctoral consortium with distinguished research faculty.  The Organizational Communication and Information Systems (OCIS) doctoral consortium at the 2016 Academy of Management (AoM) meeting in Anaheim, California, will be one and a half days of talks and interactions among OCIS students and researchers.  The doctoral consortium provides students with feedback on their work from other students and faculty members, allowing them to enhance their own dissertation research proposals. Additionally, because of the diversity of the business sub-disciplines and communities involved in the AoM conference, the consortium will allow students to establish research connections beyond their own disciplines. Consequently, participation will allow students to develop a better understanding of the different research communities, which will facilitate their participation in future inter-disciplinary research. In the past, the OCIS doctoral consortium has been a successful venue at which students can take major steps toward becoming professional researchers.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The OCIS division at the annual AoM meetings provides a leading international forum for the presentation and discussion of research and practical issues related to the use and impact of information and communication technologies in organizations and society. The intellectual merit of this travel grant is that it provides a forum for doctoral students to exchange insights and receive feedback and guidance in order to enhance the quality of their dissertation research, establish new research collaborations, and develop a greater awareness of ongoing cutting-edge research in the field of organizational communication and information systems.</AbstractNarration>

The doctoral consortium that was supported by this NSF grant took place on Friday, August 5<sup>th</sup> and Saturday, August 6<sup>th</sup> 2016. The major goal of the doctoral consortium was to provide mentoring and social networking opportunities for students who are at the dissertation phase of their doctoral studies in the field of information systems and communication. Both of these objectives were accomplished.</p> <p>At total of 26 students attended the doctoral consortium. Five well-renowned faculty from research universities served as faculty mentors.</p> <p><strong>Major Activities</strong></p> <p>Topic Round Tables: Students were organized into five breakout groups; each headed by one faculty mentor. The groups were organized around dissertation topics that dealt with phenomena of common interest including: digital platforms and crowdsourcing, entrepreneurship and digital innovation, and social media and online social movements. The students spent three hours presenting and discussing their dissertation work, identifying key challenges they were facing with their work, and exchanging feedback and suggestions with the faculty mentor and other students in their group.</p> <p>Method Round Tables: Students were organized into five breakout groups; each headed by one faculty mentor. The groups were organized around specific analytical techniques students were employing in their dissertations, including: text mining, experiments, ethnographies and multiple case studies. The students spent three hours discussing the key challenges they faced with their data, analysis, and interpretation of results. They received feedback from the faculty mentor as well as from other students in their groups.</p> <p>Research Area Round Tables: Students were organized into five breakout groups; each headed by one faculty mentor. The groups were organized around specific research domains covered by their dissertations. The objective of this session was for students to discuss phenomena of interest, ongoing developments, and future prospects for the broader domains covered by their dissertations (i.e., more broadly than their specific topics). The discussion was intended to help students exchange ideas about future research possibilities. The students spent one hour in this session.</p> <p>Faculty Mentor Panel: The faculty mentors participated in a one-hour panel during which students had an opportunity to ask any questions about the academic profession, including navigating the job market, getting their research published in premier journals, and establishing research collaborations.</p> <p>Networking: Students had two opportunities for networking with each other and with faculty members. First, a joint dinner was held with a select group of junior faculty (i.e., assistant professors who were at least 2 years past graduation from their doctoral programs but were not yet tenured). This gave the students an opportunity to interact with faculty who had recently traveled the same road and could provide insights on the job search, starting a new job, and life as a junior faculty member. Second, the doctoral consortium hosted a social reception during which students presented posters of their dissertation research. Faculty from the broader OCIS community were invited to come and view the posters and interact with the students. Students received feedback on their dissertation research and established connections with members of the OCIS community.</p> <p><strong>Impacts</strong></p> <p>Seven months after the doctoral consortium, a survey was sent out to students who participated. Students were asked to rate the value they derived from various aspects of the doctoral consortium.
