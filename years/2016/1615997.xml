<AbstractNarration>This program will study the clustering properties of galaxies with the primary goal of testing dark energy models. "Dark energy" is the name given to the mysterious cause of the accelerating expansion of the universe. Broader impacts include training of graduate students.  In addition, the PI will work on improvements and extensions of the existing Sloan Digital Sky Survey-IV Plates for Schools program. The simulation and mock catalog tools developed will be publicly released and have application to other science investigations using several existing and future spectroscopic sky surveys. The software developed for the analysis of multiple dark energy and modified gravity models will be publicly released. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigators will use eBOSS galaxy survey data and produce mock galaxy catalogs to examine 3D clustering statistics with goals including distinguishing among dark energy models, testing statistical homogeneity with the observed large-scale structure, improving systematic weights, and improving the realism of mock catalogs by including tidal fields.</AbstractNarration>
