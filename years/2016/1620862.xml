<AbstractNarration>User behavior is a critical element in the success or failure of computer security protections.  The  field of Human Security Informatics (HSI) combines security informatics and human-computer interaction design to learn how the design of a human-computer interface can affect the security of a computer system. This research project is contributing to the scientific foundations of HSI by modeling how multitasking users behave when making security-critical decisions.  In particular, the researchers are modeling user behavior when the users are engaged in typical PC-based mobile messaging with security concerns such as phishing or spam.  The project is evaluating how well the models capture the impact of incentives and interventions on user security behaviors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project extends the cognitive modeling (CogM) architecture to characterize and improve user security decision-making and behaviors. Focusing on cognitive constructs in the ACT-R and Soar architectures, it models the multi-tasking application and security activities with varying cognitive traits and security constraints, through representations of productions and information chunks, as well as their utility and activation calculations. An analytic user model not only describes a problem in making a security decision, but also can explain why and how it happens for incentive and intervention selection. Moreover, CogM models and empirical user testing comparatively study common and advanced users in typical messaging applications, regarding security mistakes and efficiency in task completion. This project is focused on establishing the principles for analytically modeling user cyber behaviors and bridging the gap from understanding security behaviors to effectively improving security performance.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This project was concerned with the fundamental issue of user behaviors when security attacks occurred. The goal of this project was to gain a better understanding of the theoretical aspects of user behaviors and to develop novel techniques that might help us a better understanding of user behaviors when users encountered phishing attacks. For this purpose, we developed and implemented two different experimental studies, where participants took part in our experiments on site and in a lab-contained environment and online through Amazon Mechanical Turk, respectively. We also designed questionnaires for the two studies and a set of email including phishing email from the real world with some necessary modifications for personal information protection. We further developed software tools to collect experimental data including participants&rsquo; basic background information, time measurement, mouse movement, and their answers to survey questions. By using the collected data, we analyzed what factors, such as intervention, phishing types, and an incentive mechanism, play a key role in user behaviors when phishing attacks occur. The challenge of this research was a small dataset with a large number of features. To address the challenge, we developed a method to reduce the number of features from 109 to 16 by using the Pearson correlation coefficient technique and the stepwise method. Moreover, we developed a machine-learning method to classify the experimental data by using the cross-randomized feature selection and a10-fold cross validation method. In the proposed framework, we classified participants into two classed: &ldquo;Good&rdquo; and &ldquo;Poor&rdquo; based on the performance of participants in the experiments. Our data analysis showed that intervention and an incentive mechanism played a significant role in user behaviors.
