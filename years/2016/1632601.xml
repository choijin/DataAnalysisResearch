<AbstractNarration>After World War II, science began to drive the development of new consumer and military technologies.  The proposed research will focus on the history of academia-industry scientific research collaborations. It will deepen our knowledge of how science was conducted in the post-war era. This proposed investigation will illustrate the common ground between academic and industrial scientific interests. By doing a historical study of these relationships the proposed research will provide a thorough understanding of how academia and industry have formed successful collaborations in the past. By focusing on historical cases in which universities and businesses crafted partnerships, the proposed research identifies historical models that can inform contemporary research policy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The proposed research will advance our historical understanding of how and why academia and industry collaborated to support scientific research during the Cold War. Historians have previously investigated university-industry collaborations to show how some of them supported American military interests during the Cold War and at times steered their research towards economic and military interests. This proposal will do a broader survey of institutions in order to situate existing understanding of academia-industry partnerships within a larger, knottier story about American science, technology, academia, and industry. The proposed research will develop case studies through historical research in university, foundation, and corporate archives. These studies will help answer the questions of 1) the extent to which the motives driving industrial investment in science were contingent, and less rigid than is sometimes assumed, and 2) the degree to which individual institutions had agency to determine the shape and direction of their research programs and the character of their institutional partnerships.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In 1951 James P. Adams, the University of Michigan provost, told a campus audience: "In due time historians will attempt to characterize the era in which we live as a part of the history of our civilization. As they view it in retrospect, they may see a number of distinguishing features, but I venture to suggest one which will be clearly discernible. It is an age of invincible surmise." He was wrong. Historians of science have looked on the early Cold War as an age of anxiety. It was an era jittery with nuclear fear, its denizens cowed by the threat of McCarthyism.  This project explored the ways in which Adams nevertheless seized on an important feature of the early Cold-War era. I examined how universities and businesses formed research collaborations after World War II. Some such stories are well known. At Stanford and MIT, military funding dramatically changed campus research cultures, encouraging commercial collaborations that unfolded within the military-industrial complex. This is the "Cold War university" that Rebecca Lowen, Stuart Leslie, and others describe so well. But other institutions followed a different pattern, one that better accords with Adams?s vision of his own time.  The University of Michigan eschewed government and military funding for its postwar nuclear research program&mdash;the Michigan Memorial&ndash;Phoenix Project&mdash;which doubled as a memorial to those in the university community killed in World War II. Concerned that the federal government would monopolize nuclear research, Michigan turned to its alumni and to businesses to fund this program, which provided seed grants to faculty studying nuclear physics, chemistry, medicine, engineering, and even food science, as well as to those confronting the challenges of a nuclear culture in history, sociology, anthropology, and law.   Approaching industry as a way to protect freedom of academic inquiry made sense within the distinctive culture of early&ndash;Cold War America, and similar attitudes guided industrial collaborations at other universities, e.g. the University of Chicago, which funded its Basic Research Institutes, the offshoots of Manhattan Project work, almost exclusively with industrial patronage for a decade and a half.  My research placed these stories in a national context, through additional archival research at Columbia University, Oregon State University, the University of Pennsylvania, the Hagley Library, the University of Texas, Purdue University, and Carnegie Mellon University.
