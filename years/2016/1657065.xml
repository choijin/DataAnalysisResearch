<AbstractNarration>This doctoral dissertation research project will integrate glacial geology, detailed ice-margin mapping, &lt;br/&gt;and high-resolution geochronology to assess the influence of climate and topography on the extent and retreat &lt;br/&gt;of a marine margin of the Cordilleran Ice Sheet is southeastern Alaska.  This project will provide new &lt;br/&gt;insights into the processes that control the stability of marine ice-sheet margins.  It will yield a direct &lt;br/&gt;chronology of a western Cordilleran Ice Sheet retreat along a marine margin, thereby facilitating &lt;br/&gt;reconstructions of this part of the ice sheet and adding to knowledge about the spatial and temporal &lt;br/&gt;relationships among climate, topography, and ice-sheet extent.  This project will generate new insights into &lt;br/&gt;the processes that control the stability of marine ice sheet margins and provide empirical constraints to &lt;br/&gt;improve predictive models of the ice sheet-climate system.  In addition, the project will provide direct &lt;br/&gt;evidence of ice-free conditions in previously proposed coastal ice-free areas along the Pacific Rim of &lt;br/&gt;North America that will have important implications for analyses of human migrations into the Americas.  &lt;br/&gt;Project results will be incorporated into an outreach program conducted in concert with the Buffalo Museum &lt;br/&gt;of Science that synthesizes current research in geography, paleoclimatology, anthropology, and paleontology &lt;br/&gt;to educate the public about the causes and consequences of changing environmental conditions.  As a Doctoral &lt;br/&gt;Dissertation Research Improvement award, this award also will provide support to enable a promising student &lt;br/&gt;to establish a strong independent research career.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Marine ice-sheet margins, including those in present-day Greenland and Antarctica, are thought to be highly &lt;br/&gt;sensitive to climatic variation, but the effects of environmental change on marine ice sheet margins are &lt;br/&gt;still poorly understood.  During the Last Glacial Maximum (roughly 26,000 to 19,000 years ago), the &lt;br/&gt;Cordilleran Ice Sheet covered much of western North America, stretching from southern Alaska to the &lt;br/&gt;Pacific Northwest of the U.S.  Relatively little is known about Cordilleran Ice Sheet behavior during this &lt;br/&gt;time period, particularly along the west coast where it terminated in the ocean.  This project will focus on &lt;br/&gt;three sets of research questions concerning the behavior of the western Cordilleran Ice Sheet during and &lt;br/&gt;following the Last Glacial Maximum:  (1) How extensive was the Cordilleran Ice Sheet in southeastern Alaska &lt;br/&gt;during the Last Glacial Maximum, and did any areas of southeastern Alaska remain ice-free? This question will &lt;br/&gt;be addressed using cosmogenic exposure dating of the beryllium-10 isotope bedrock and boulder surfaces in &lt;br/&gt;previously proposed ice-free areas.  Together with detailed mapping of the paleo-ice margin from publicly &lt;br/&gt;available topographic data and aerial imagery, exposure ages from these locations will allow the doctoral &lt;br/&gt;student to reconstruct the maximum extent of the western Cordilleran Ice Sheet.  (2) What was the timing and &lt;br/&gt;pace of retreat of the western Cordilleran Ice Sheet?  Cosmogenic beryllium-10 dating of rock surfaces along &lt;br/&gt;coast-to-inland transects will be used to resolve this question, which has implications for basic &lt;br/&gt;understanding of the sensitivity of marine-terminating ice sheets to climate change.  (3) What environmental &lt;br/&gt;factors, such as ocean warming, atmospheric warming, and sea-level rise, influenced ice-sheet retreat?  The &lt;br/&gt;retreat chronology developed in this study will be correlated with existing climate and sea-level records to &lt;br/&gt;test the hypothesis that ocean warming was the primary factor influencing marine ice-sheet collapse in &lt;br/&gt;southeastern Alaska.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Historical and current observations of glaciers around the world reveal a rather alarming view: almost everywhere around the planet where glaciers exist, they are in the process of melting away. As our record of observation lengthens, the global-scale pattern just becomes more clear. Among the various types of glaciers taking part in today?s global-scale deglaciation, marine-terminating glaciers will potentially become the most important contributor to near-term global sea-level rise. Marine glaciers have the ability to partially float and physically break apart &ndash; a process that when combined with more simple melting from the warmer atmosphere, can lead to their virtual disintegration. We studied the problem of marine-terminating glacier retreat by generating a timeline of marine glacier retreat in Southeast Alaska during the end of the last Ice Age. This time period in Earth history was characterized by a rapidly warming climate &ndash; both atmosphere and ocean. Thus, be scrutinizing the spatial pattern and timing of retreat of a paleo-ice sheet in a marine setting, we hope to increase the scientific community?s understanding of such glaciers and their response during periods of global warming.     We used a geological dating tool, referred to as cosmogenic 10Be exposure dating, to the Ice Age recession of ice in Southeast Alaska for the first time. We generated 27 new ages from glacial landforms that were created by Ice Age glaciers during their collapse from the coast to the inland mountains.  The ages reveal the time period of glacier recession in this part of the world; we can compare the timing of glacier retreat here with end-of-Ice-Age glacier retreat at other regions around the globe.  This information helps not only to compare the rates of marine glacier retreat with those glaciers that melted off of land areas not in contact with the sea, but also assess glacier retreat in Southeast Alaska alongside independent records of climate change, such as records of ocean warming.
