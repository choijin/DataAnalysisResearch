<AbstractNarration>With this award, the  Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program in the Division of Chemistry is funding Professor Sourav Saha of  Florida State University to develop new strategies and receptors that can not only discriminate anions on the basis of their electronic properties, but also capture and release the target anions in a reversible fashion under the influence of electrons and light. Anions and cations are ubiquitous, and have diverse structures, properties, and functions. Some play important roles in biological, chemical, industrial, and environmental processes, while others are toxic and pollutants. For these reasons, it is important to regulate these charged species with high precision and selectivity. Selective ion receptors  can provide scientists with systems that are recyclable, reusable, and better suited for applications in environmental protection. The graduate, undergraduate, and postdoctoral researchers working on this project will gain an array of scientific knowledge and technical expertise, from synthesis to molecular recognition. Integrated outreach activities are directed at local schools, the public library, and at students from Florida Agricultural and Mining University, an HBCU institution.  Through these efforts, Dr. Saha plans to engage young and underrepresented students in hands-on experiments to motivate them to consider the pursuit of careers in science.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The goal of this research is to develop new strategies to (i) discriminate anions on the basis of their electronic properties, (ii) capture anions and cations simultaneously in a cooperative fashion, and (iii) bind and release ionic guests in a reversible fashion under the influence of electrons and light. To discriminate anions in aprotic solvents, the Saha research team is exploiting the ability of ð-acidic naphthalenediimide (NDI) receptors to accept electron(s) from strong Lewis basic anions, form charge-transfer complexes with less basic anions, and engage in anion?ð and CH···anion interactions with charge-diffuse anions. To overcome the ion-pairing effect that weakens the binding interactions between ionic guests and receptors, tweezers-shaped, ditopic ion-pair receptors are being developed by tethering two terminal NDI units with folded linkers that can bind cations. The hypothesis is that cation binding at the linker units should facilitate anion binding between the two overlapping NDI units and vice versa. During biphasic extractions, these ditopic receptors should selectively extract salts that contain less hydrated charge-diffuse anions from aqueous to organic medium, while the more hydrated hard anions should remain in water. NDI-based cationic metallacycles are being constructed to capture large charge-diffuse anions inside their cavities through anion/NDI interactions. The metal ion corners should mitigate the ion-pairing effects. The reversible redox chemistry of the NDI units and the tendency of their reduced forms to expel anions offer a new approach to release the captured anions from these receptors upon chemical, electrochemical, and/or photochemical reduction.</AbstractNarration>

See: Saha, S. Acc. Chem. Res.2018, 51, 2225-2236. We have developed a heteroditopic ion-pair receptor R3 consisting of two &pi;-acidic NDI units tethered by a bis-imine linker having a centeral pyridine ring that simultaneously bind cation and anions in a cooperative fashion. Upon chelating a ZnII or CdII ion with the three N-atoms on the linker unit, R3 adopted a U-conformation and two such folded molecules interlocked around a shared metal ion to form a [R3&bull;MII&bull;R3]2X- ion-pair complex, in whcih the charge-diffused anions (e.g., X- = TfO-, ClO4-, and BF4-) were sandwiched between the two overlapping NDI arms of each R3 molecule. Upon extraction of the chelated metal ion from the ion-pair complex, R3 unfolded, releasing the guest anions. R3 did not fold into a U-conformation, nor did it bind any guest anionin the absence of a coordinating guest cation. Thus, the cation-induced folding and interlocking of two R3 molecules facilitated anion binding between the two overlapping NDI units in an allosteric fashion. See: Org. Lett.2018, 20, 962-965. We have assembled a tetrameric metallacycle [Pd(dppp)(DPNDI)]4&middot;8TfO (dppp = 1,3-bis(diphenyl-phosphonium) propane), DPNDI = N,N’-di(4-pyridyl)-1,4,5,8-naphthalene diamine) and demonstrated its anion recognition and exchange capabilities. The metallacycle underwent anion exchange in a single-crystal to single-crystal fashion without undergoing any structural changes. See: Cryst. Growth Des.2019, 19, 6017-6022. We have constructed a honeycomb-shaped novel metal-organic framework (MOF-74) featuring a &pi;-acidic NDI ligand equipped with two salicylate groups. Upon intercalation of electron rich planar tetrathiafulvalene (TTF) guests between the DSNDI ligands, a characteristic TTF/NDI charge transfer absorption band appeared at 900 nm and the electronic band gap of the TTF-doped material narrwoed to 1.5 eV, which was ca. 1 eV narrower than that of the pristine MOF. This study demonstrated how complementary guest intercalation altered the electronic and optical properties of MOFs. See: ACS Appl. Mater. Interfaces2017, 9, 32413-32417. We have constructed an intrinsically conducting new 3D MOF [Ag2(HATHCN)(TfO)2]n using a highly &pi;-acidic 1,4,5,8,9,12-hexaazatriphenylene-2,3,6,7,10,11-heaxacarbonitrile (HATHCN) ligand. The charge/partial electron transfer from the TfO- anions to &pi;-acidic HATHCN ligands caused a paramagnetic HATHCN&bull;- radical anion character, while the staircase-like [-Ag+-HATHCN-]&infin; chains having good metal&ndash;ligand orbital overlap and &pi;-conjugation facilitated charge movement through the framework. Consequently, the MOF displayed a narrow band gap (1.35 eV) and promising electrical conductivity (ca. 10-4 S/cm). This work presented a new strategy to construct intrinsically conductive 3D frameworks by exploiting the dual metal coordination and anion&ndash;&pi; interaction capabilities of HATHCN ligand. See: ACS Appl. Mater. Interfaces 2020, 12, 40613-40619.   Broader Impact: I have mentored three graduate students (one female, one graduated with PhD), two undergraduate students (one African American), and one high school summer intern in my laboratory. We published several high-impact papers and presented them at ACS national and regional meetings, international conferences in Japan and Singapore, and to general public at a local cafeteria under the Clemson’s ‘Science on Tap’ program.
