<AbstractNarration>Professors Morteza G. Khaledi and David C. Muddiman of North Carolina State University are supported by the Chemical Measurement and Imaging (CMI) Program in the Division of Chemistry to investigate the use of newly discovered supramolecular liquids called Perfluoro Alcohol Induced Coacervates (PFAIC) for enhanced selective extraction and enrichment of membrane proteins from biological matrices.  Membrane proteins are the most important cell surface membrane constituents.  They act as highly-selective cellular receptors and gatekeepers, regulating the traffic of critical nutrients and energy in and out of the cells.   Solubilization, extraction, and enrichment of membrane proteins from biological samples into aqueous solutions suitable for further analysis - a critical step for the characterization of the individual proteins and for understanding their cellular function - is an area of considerable challenge in contemporary bioanalytical chemistry and molecular biology.  The project promises to tackle this challenge and provide new avenues for the identification of membrane proteins and hence advance our understanding of cellular function and life processes. In the course of conducting the project, graduate and undergraduate students will gain valuable skills in bioanalytical separation technologies, proteomics and mass spectrometry.  Plans are also established, through a partnership with the Kenan Fellows Program of the Kenan Institute at North Carolina State University, to involve high school teachers in summer research and in the development of high school curriculum materials in the general areas related to this research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The overarching objective of the proposed research is to explore the use of Perfluoro Alcohol Induced Coacervates (PFAIC) for enhanced selective extraction and enrichment of membrane proteins from biological matrices.  The proposed research is organized into four specific aims: (1) to achieve an understanding of the principles of extraction of proteins in PFAIC systems through systematic studies of partitioning patterns, extraction efficiency and enrichment factors of proteins with different structural and physico-chemical properties and  PFAIC systems with different chemical composition; (2) to investigate general strategies for enrichment of membrane proteins into PFAIC phases; (3) to investigate the effectiveness of PFAIC for pre-fractionation, extraction and enrichment of membrane proteins  in shot-gun bottom-up proteomics analysis of yeast as a model biological sample; and (4) to explore the possibility of inducing coacervation of lipid bilayers in cell membranes and concomitant solubilization of the membrane bound proteins.</AbstractNarration>

A) Study of Novel Fluoroalcohol-Induced Liquid-Liquid Systems  We have discovered that addition of a small amount of polar fluorinated alcohols, namely trifluoroethanol (TFE) or hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP), to water-based solutions of specific reagents in water, for example; detergents, lipids, other polar organic solvents, alkyl urea, and crown ethers would result in formation of two separate phases in water.

This phenomenon seems to be nearly ubiquitous and is observed in aqueous solutions of amphiphilic reagents. Amphiphilic reagents are molecules that are composed of both polar and nonpolar groups.  In the first part of this project, we studied the formation of three types of FATPS depending on different classes of "amphiphilic reagent": 1) Detergent-based liquid-liquid systems, 2) Lipid (fat) based liquid-liquid systems, and 3) Organic solvent-based liquid-liquid systems.  In detergent based systems, we used molecules called surfactant (detergents) similar to those found in soap and shampoos.

B) Application of Liquid-Liquid System in Protein and Peptide Separation (Proteomics)  The potential use of these FATPS is extraction and enrichment of compounds of interest in chemical and biological samples.  The identification and study of the proteins in biological samples using analytical methods is part of a large-scale study called proteomics. We investigated the application of FATPS for separation, enrichment, and solubilization of proteins and peptides in proteomics analysis. Mixtures of Proteins and peptides mixtures can be fractionated into the two separate phases in FATPS and then analyzed using advanced analytical methods such as liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LCMS).

Overall, the novel FATPS facilitates the analysis of complex biological samples significantly and improves the detection of the challenging membrane proteins at very low concentrations in cells.
