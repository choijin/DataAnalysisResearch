<AbstractNarration>This study will trace genetic changes over a 3000 year period to understand the evolution of domestication in sunflower.  Understanding how the complex suites of traits associated with domestication are assembled over time is a central but empirically challenging question in evolutionary biology and a topic of critical importance to agriculture, conservation, and human health. Adaptations frequently involve the coordinated change of multiple morphological, physiological, or behavioral characters, and this pattern is especially true with respect to the transformation of wild plants into crops. Domesticated approximately 5000 years ago by Native Americans, this important staple crop has a rich archaeological record and extensive genomic resources. Using cutting-edge DNA sequencing methods, a dataset reflecting the time series covering the domestication period from ancient through contemporary DNA will be developed. The research can provide new perspectives on agriculture and trade by early Native American cultures. Trainees gain international experience at the Centre for GeoGenetics in Copenhagen. A high school genomics curriculum will be developed through a summer internship program at the National Museum of Natural History that directly engages high school students in scientific discovery through initial sequencing of a new plant genome.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Genome-wide studies of ancient DNA have been made possible by recent technological advances and provide a unique opportunity to reconstruct the historical genetic sequence of multi-trait adaptation. By following the timing and order with which beneficial genetic changes, and by inference changes in domestication traits, accumulate, the DNA dataset obtained will address a core debate over how fast domestication proceeded and test key predictions from evolutionary theory. Several hundred candidate domestication genes identified through genomic diversity and gene expression studies will be followed over an archaeological time series covering the domestication period.  Using cutting-edge solution-based sequence capture methods to vastly enrich recovery of specific sequences, several hundred of these genes will be genotyped over a time series using sunflower archaeological remains covering the domestication period. By combining this genotypic information with knowledge of gene function, the project will determine which traits evolved earlier during domestication than others and whether those traits share common features. Through integrating the ancient DNA data with existing data on effect sizes, the project will test whether variants associated with large differences in phenotype predominantly appear early or late in the adaptation process. Sunflower is an important crop today, is divergent from its wild relative in many traits, and this genetic study provides a unique opportunity to investigate how and under what conditions different evolutionary forces and genetic phenomena influence the timing and order of beneficial substitutions affecting an integrated set of traits</AbstractNarration>

Understanding how such complex adaptations emerge over time is a central question in evolutionary biology, and examining DNA obtained from archaeological samples provides a unique opportunity to reconstruct the historical genetic sequence of adaptation. By employing recent advances in DNA sequencing technologies that facilitate ancient DNA research, we have traced the genetic changes that occurred as sunflower was domesticated over the past 4000 years. Native American farmers transformed sunflower from a branchy, bushy, wild plant species with many small disks and seeds into a staple crop that produces one large disk with large seeds from an unbranched stem. Sunflower has a rich, well-studied archaeological record that traces this increase in seed and disk size over time, as well as extensive resources for establishing the role of specific genetic changes in this divergence. We assembled a time series of archaeological samples and used a combination of radiocarbon dating, modern and archaeological genome sequencing, and gene expression approaches to understand the genetic history of sunflower domestication.

Isolation of DNA from the archaeological samples was successful, particularly from kernels, and we often obtained high proportions of sunflower DNA rather than contaminating DNA from bacteria or fungi. Although other samples did have poor DNA preservation, we were able to effectively enrich and sequence genes of interest even from these samples using short RNA baits we designed. Analysis of DNA sequences revealed that substantial portions of the genetic diversity in present in wild sunflower were lost both early in the domestication process and during modern breeding. Our data were also consistent with a single origin of domesticated sunflower in the Eastern and Central United States, and we did not find support for a second center of domestication in Mexico.&nbsp;We also found that the dominant chloroplast genome sequence changes multiple times over the last 4,000 years within the Ozarks, suggesting the primary cultivars grown by the local cultures inhabiting this area may have been repeatedly replaced over time. Analysis of gene sequence and expression differences between modern domesticated and wild sunflower varieties highlighted several hundred genes with variants favored during domestication by Native American farmers, including genes related to seed oil biosynthesis, plant growth hormones, and flowering time regulation. We also investigated the common marshelder, a wild species in the sunflower family related to an extinct North American crop.
