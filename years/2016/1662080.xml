<AbstractNarration>Enzymes from thermophilic organisms are often more suitable for applications in biotechnology because they are thermostable and have optimal activities at high temperatures.  This project will use novel experimental and computational approaches to define the molecular basis for these highly useful properties.  Ultimately, these studies will provide important information for the selection of enzymes that are stable and optimally active at high temperatures and for the engineering of such enzymes for applications in biotechnology.  This project will contribute to the training of undergraduate and graduate students and will be incorporated into outreach efforts to the public. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The elucidation of molecular principles that render proteins more stable under extreme conditions such as high temperatures has been subject of a large body of research.  Earlier work suggested that thermophilic variants of enzymes have more polar interactions or more H-bonds or increased hydrophobic interactions, better packing of hydrophobic core or some combination of them.  Other studies showed that some of these properties were not applicable to many other mesophilic to thermophilic comparisons and more subtle and distributed effects and dynamic properties of proteins may play a significant role in attaining thermophilicity.  Sequence-based comparisons also failed to explain the basis of thermophilicity and so far no clear and unifying explanation has emerged.  This project aims to determine dynamic and thermodynamic properties that separate thermophilic enzymes from their mesophilic counterparts by dissecting the effects of protein dynamics and solvent reorganization on the enzyme ligand interactions.  To do this, thermophilic and mesophilic variants of the same protein (aminoglycoside-N3-nucleotidyltransferase) will be used; these variants have minimal differences in the primary sequence.</AbstractNarration>

Another goal is to determine thermodynamic parameters that are specific for thermophilic enzymes and distinguishes thermostability and thermophilicity from each other.    Thermodynamics of enzyme-aminoglycoside interactions and effect of solvent on thermodynamic parameters of the formation of enzyme-aminoglycoside complexes were determined with wild type (WT),  and two thermostable variants (D80Y and T130K).  Studies of thermodynamics of enzyme-ligand interactions revealed a significant difference in the thermodynamics of D80Y-aminoglycoside complexes relative to WT and T130K which have identical thermodynamic parameters for enzyme-aminoglycoside complexes.

Moreover, the solvent reorganization was found to be the major contributor to the formation of enzyme-aminoglycoside complexes of WT and T130K, this was not the case with D80Y. These findings are now published in Biochemistry.   We have, in collaboration with Dr. Cuneo of St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital, determined crystal structures of WT and T130K in apo-, binary- and ternary-complexes with ligands and reaction products. These studies showed that a low-barrier hydrogen bond (LBHB) facilitates binding of aminoglycosides but does not participate in catalysis and breaks before the catalytic cycle. We call this "catch and release" mechanism, which represents a new variation to nucleotidyl transfer reactions.   AAC-VIa shows the narrowest substrate profile relative to two other aminoglycoside N3-acetyltransferases (AAC-IIIb and AAC-IIa) that catalyze the same reaction and have identical structures with AAC-VIa. We used X-ray and neutron diffraction to determine structure of AAC-VIa with and without substrates and reaction products. These studies revealed that a LBHB formation with selective aminoglycosides affects catalytic turnover rates up to 30-fold with respect to those enzyme-aminoglycoside complexes that no LBHB is observed.   The effects of solvent reorganization on the thermodynamics of enzyme-ligand complexes of three variants of ANT are published in Biochemistry, 2019.  Another paper describing structure of AAC-VIa and demonstrating the presence of LBHB is published in Science Advances, 2018.  A paper describing role of LBHB in substrate selectivity is published in Angewandte Chemie, 2019.  In addition to peer-reviewed publications, the findings from this project were presented at several conferences in the form of oral presentations and posters.
