<AbstractNarration>This project at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee (UWM) aims to develop a sustainable and scalable model for transforming engineering capstone/senior design courses into an experiential multidisciplinary technology entrepreneurship capstone course, Product Realization 2.0 that is strongly coupled with co-curricular or extra-curricular student entrepreneurial programs (campus wide) and powered by regional industry partners. The Product Realization course was initially designed to give students real world, project-based experience while offering industry sponsors access to engineering talent and innovative solutions. This project will explore whether or not stakeholders (including students and sponsors) will find value in a structure that trains students and exposes industry sponsors to a broader set of entrepreneurial thinking skills. The project is moving towards a course that will have the following key curricular elements: (a) customer discovery and lean launch, (b) design thinking, and (c) product design with an emphasis on low-resolution prototyping and multiple iterations. The course would have to have another dimension: professional development for sponsor-mentors. We will explore various levels of mentor engagement and training, ranging from straightforward project management processes to incorporating mentors into a teaching team. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Product Realization course can contribute significantly to innovation in engineering and multidisciplinary education, will promote new curricula and pedagogy, and will provide a platform for engaging students and sponsors in a different way. The product has potential appeal to regional industry and can connect with an innovation and entrepreneurship experiential curriculum at UWM. Through various innovation networks, such as the I-Corps Site regional network of five universities, the National Innovation Network, Pathways to Innovation Network and University Innovation Fellows Network, the proposed model can be scaled up nationally.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project aimed at developing a sustainable and scalable model for transforming engineering capstone/senior design courses into an experiential multidisciplinary technology entrepreneurship capstone course, Product Realization 2.0, that would be strongly coupled with co-curricular or extra-curricular student entrepreneurial programs (campus wide) and powered by regional industry partners.   The Product Realization course was initially designed to give students real world, project-based experience while offering industry sponsors access to engineering talent and innovative solutions; we watned to explore whether or not stakeholders (including students and sponsors) would find value in a structure that trains students and exposes industry sponsors to a broader set of entrepreneurial thinking skills.  We wanted to move towards a course that would have the following key curricular elements: (a) customer discovery and lean launch, (b) design thinking, and (c) product design with an emphasis on low-resolution prototyping and multiple iterations. The course would have to have another dimension: professional development for sponsor-mentors.  We wanted to explore various levels of mentor engagement and training, ranging from straightforward project management processes to incorporating mentors into a teaching team.  Getting outside the building - we have conducted more than 100 customer discovery interviews with:  Engineering managers/directors (16) Humar resource managers (25) Corporate leadership (6) External recruiters (4) Engineers (13) Interns in engineering firms (7) Engineering students (2) Instructors of capstone courses (10) Career service directors in academia (6) Academic leadership/administration (7)   The key objective was to test our business model built around the initial concept of a University-industry collaborative platform for entrepreneurial experiential learning and open innovation.   This is what we have learned:  It?s not about the project, it?s all about Engineering Manager/Director geting the talent (22/29 engineers) Development of talent within the organization wasn't a pain point (38/44 managers) The focus of discovery has to be shifted from engineering- to HR managers who most keenly feel the pain...and who would pay for our product. Recruiting and training budgets are spread across the organizational units (4/7 large companies). Matrix decision making: buy-in from multiple stakeholders to sell the idea to VP leader with budget authority. There is pain and money in finding the right hires (22/28 HR managers). For inexperienced hires, companies place a high value on a professor recommendation (34/44 hiring managers) - but it is not scalable. Everybody in engineering companies want to address diversity problem, but nobody has a great solution (35/48 engineering- and HR managers). Everybody hates career fairs (22/28 HR managers, students and hiring managers). Getting the first internship is the hardest (6/9 engineering students). Demonstrated skills are valuable to companies ... and students (20/32 HR and engineering managers).   Based on the evidence, the value proposition of our business model has changed to:  "We help engineering companies identify talent, and students get their first internship, through a sponsored experiential interview that demonstrates targeted skills."   The minimum viable product - an experiential interview - would consist of two parts:  Curriculum for an experiential interview (team-based design challenge for prospective hires) Live resume annotation / skill assessment software platform                Last Modified: 09/11/2017       Submitted by: Ilya V Avdeev]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
