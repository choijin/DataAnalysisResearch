<AbstractNarration>This project increase the accessibility of scientific knowledge by creating  a cross-referenced repository of scientific assertions, metrics and indicators of research impact and trends, and tools for accessing and exploring scientific knowledge. The project expands the scope of the study of scientific knowledge by directly addressing the integral role of uncertainties and discrepancies in understanding and communicating scientific knowledge. The observatory tracks how a scientific assertion evolves over time in the scientific literature. The project advances the capabilities of the study of scientific knowledge by providing references so that researchers can routinely and systematically compare and evaluate metrics and algorithms designed to capture the impact of scientific contributions. The increased accessibility of scientific knowledge improves research productivity as well as the understanding of science and relevant policies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project represents scientific knowledge as a semantically organized and adaptive network of scientific assertions, structures of reasoning and argumentation, and relevant evidence extracted from the growing body of scientific literature. Extracted concepts, semantic relations, and argumentative structures are synthesized across scientific publications using techniques from machine learning, computational linguistics, quantitative studies of science, and visual analytics. In addition, uncertainties and discrepancies associated with scientific assertions and their impacts are identified and cross-referenced in the repository so as to keep track of their evolution over time. Existing and newly developed metrics and indicators of research impact are linked directly to assertion-level evidence and patterns.  The observatory serves as a sustainable platform for researchers and tool developers to access scientific knowledge and relevant resources for conducting their own studies and evaluating the quality of new metrics and algorithms in the broad context of the science of science and innovation policy research.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Scientific knowledge advances as new discoveries are made, new perspectives are adopted, and new methods are developed. A fundamental need for researchers and a wide variety of stakeholders across all disciplines is to be able to maintain a good understanding of the state of the art in research as we constantly update our current knowledge. Our research sheds new light on scientific knowledge in terms of the nature and dynamics of uncertainties associated with scientific propositions, also in the form of scientific claims and findings. The novel uncertainty-centric conceptualization is critical to the assessment of the degree of consensus or the lack of it, which is fundamental to scientists and decision and policy makers whose decisions rely on the underlying knowledge and the quality of the synthesis of evidence.&nbsp; The novel conceptualization leads to a new framework of methodology and computational tools to enable us to assess the epistemic status of our knowledge more accurately and more cautiously than before. The framework also provides a flexible and extensible basis for improving several other aspects of accessing the scientific knowledge, for example, in detecting emerging trends by incorporating innovative metrics of uncertainties, in better understanding the underlying mechanisms of scientific discovery and how scientists choose research questions.</p> <p>In addition to the fundamental conceptualization and the framework, our research made several specific contributions so that other researchers may utilize our tools and apply and extend the underlying methodology. For example, we introduced new ways to measure three types of uncertainties based on text in natural languages in scholarly publications, namely, epistemic uncertainty, hedging, and transitional uncertainties. These are the most common types of uncertainties found in scientific literature. Epistemic uncertainties capture conflicting and contradictory views and interpretations of the same underlying scientific propositions. This category also contains inconsistent, unknown, and other forms of uncertainties due to the lack of consensus in the state of the art. The uncertainty itself is an integral part of scientific knowledge. In other words, scientific knowledge consists of scientific propositions and corresponding uncertainties at a particular point of time. The value of our work is to open a computational and explanatory framework to study the structure and dynamics of scientific developing in this more accurate and realistic context.</p> <p>We include several images to illustrate some of our work in this context. For example, the boundary-spanning mechanism has been studied by researchers of scientific discovery for many years, but our work reveals how this mechanism is in action through a visual analytic lens and we provide tools that can be applied to topics such as Nobel Prize winning research as well as other topics of interest. We have also significantly refined the techniques to collect the most representative and most efficient bibliographic data about a field of research or a topic of research with our cascading citation expansion, which is a process that can iteratively expand a collection of articles. The efficiency of the process means that it finds the most representative data with the smallest size. Scientometric studies are quantitative studies of science and there are many of them across scientific disciplines. Many of them were conducted without taking into account the role of uncertainty. We have made relevant computational tools available for everyone to use and explore scientific knowledge collectively. Our tools can be applied to several the most widely used sources of scholarly publications, ranging from the Web of Science, Scopus, to Dimensions, the Lens, and Microsoft Academic Graph. The methodology and techniques from our project can be applied and used to reanalyze many of the existing studies so as to update our understanding of the underlying scientific knowledge.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 11/01/2020<br>      Modified by: Chaomei&nbsp;Chen</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1633286/1633286_10455505_1604262605950_after-DCA_v679e3395--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1633286/1633286_10455505_1604262605950_after-DCA_v679e3395--rgov-800width.jpg" title="The boundary-spanning mechanism of Nobel Prize winning research"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1633286/1633286_10455505_1604262605950_after-DCA_v679e3395--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="The boundary-spanning mechanism of Nobel Prize winning research"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">This visualization reveals the boundary-spanning mechanism detected from a single publication, which led to its Nobel Prize 40 years later.
