<AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A  non-technical description of the project test explains its significance and importance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is to help students easily identify themselves as science or engineering professionals and increase the proportion of the local population, dominantly minorities, who pursue science and technology careers. Experience has demonstrated that students are most engaged in technical fields when they can participate in active, hands-on learning around problems with application to their local community. The focus of the effort is in marine science, which has local relevance to both the environment and the economy of the U.S. Virgin Islands. The project will use interventions at three crucial stages: middle school, high-school-college transition, and master-PhD transition, to engage students with specific active-learning and research-oriented programs. Community partners comprise a wide-ranging local organization that leverages the resources of other successful collaborations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A technical description of the project&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will create a transferable model that uses innovative partnerships among universities, governmental and non-governmental organizations, a professional society, and businesses, to create a local backbone organization with a shared vision for change and common success metrics to broaden participation in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). This project addresses the critical challenge of building scientific identity to increase interest and engagement of underrepresented minorities in STEM fields in the U.S. Virgin Islands. The plan includes targeted interventions at three significant times in the student career pathway (middle/high school, early college, and graduate school) that comprise: (1) field experiences in the marine sciences for middle/high school students, (2) early field research experiences for college freshmen and sophomore students, (3) bridge programming to a Ph.D. partnership with Pennsylvania State University, and (4) an intensive mentoring program. The model is grounded in social innovation theory through a framework that meets the five conditions for collective impact: common agenda, shared measurement of data and results, mutually reinforcing activities, continuous communication, and backbone support.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The overarching goal of the Supporting Emerging Aquatic Scientists (SEAS) Your Tomorrow Program at the University of the Virgin Islands, was to create a model for broadening participation in STEM that used innovative partnerships, support programming, and targeted interventions, to build scientific identity and increase interest and engagement in the marine sciences by U.S. Virgin Islanders. It created a marine science career pathway program including: (1) field experiences in the marine sciences for middle and high school students, (2) early field research and professional experiences for college students in marine science fields, (3) bridge programming to the Ph.D. focusing on coral reefs and partnering an HBCU (UVI) with an R1 institution (Pennsylvania State University), and (4) cross-cutting, intervention support programming that included (a) mentoring, (b) individualized planning, and (c) family programming to support student success at critical juncture points. From December 2016 to May 2020, a total of 105 youth aged 8-18 participated in the Youth Ocean Explorers and Junior Ocean Explorers Programs on the islands of St. Thomas and St. Croix, 99% of whom were from underserved and underrepresented groups in STEM (as defined by race ethnicity, gender, and socioeconomic status). Twenty Youth Ocean Explorer students were open-water SCUBA-certified through partnership programs with local dive shops. These programs employed 22 near-peer mentors (high school and graduate students, all of whom were from underserved or underrepresented groups in STEM). A total of 10 undergraduate students from the University of the Virgin Islands (UVI, a Historically Black College &amp; University), participated in 6-week early career summer research and professional experiences with 6 territorial partners (Virgin Islands Department of Planning &amp; Natural Resources Division of Coastal Zone Management, Virgin Islands Marine Advisory Service (the extension arm of the University of Puerto Rico Sea Grant Program in the U.S. Virgin Islands), The Nature Conservancy, Ocean &amp; Coastal Observing Virgin Islands, National Oceanic &amp; Atmospheric Administration Coral Reef Conservation Program, UVI&rsquo;s Center for Marine &amp; Environmental Studies). All undergraduates were from underrepresented or underserved groups in STEM and two students were retained across years in 2081 and 2019. Two students graduated with B.S. degrees in Biology and Marine Biology from UVI, and one is now enrolled in UVI&rsquo;S Masters of Marine &amp; Environmental Science (MMES) program. Eleven UVI MMES students participated in an 8-week summer research program at Pennsylvania State University (PSU), the Bridge to the Ph.D. Program. All of these students were from underrepresented and underserved groups in STEM. Ten of 11 Bridge Program alumni have successfully defended their UVI M.Sc. theses as of May 2020. Four Bridge to the Ph.D. Program alumni are now enrolled in Ph.D. Programs, including two who self-identify as Black or African American, and one who self identifies as Native American. Five other alumna are employed in marine science positions, three of which are based in the U.S. Virgin Islands, building local expertise in marine science fields. Project results have been shared widely, including 19 presentations at national conferences and local meetings. Key to program sustainability, the SEAS Your Tomorrow Program leveraged $200k in additional funding to support program activities through other federal grants, donations from private businesses, and support from local family and community foundations. In 2019, the program grew to become the SEAS Islands Alliance, 1 of 8 Alliances awarded by the National Science Foundation, which expands programming and opportunities with new partners in Puerto Rico and Guam until 2024.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 09/26/2020<br>      Modified by: Kristin&nbsp;R&nbsp;Wilson Grimes</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1649300/1649300_10460702_1601129937550_IMG_6352--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1649300/1649300_10460702_1601129937550_IMG_6352--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Zola Roper"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1649300/1649300_10460702_1601129937550_IMG_6352--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Zola Roper"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Bridge Program alumna, Zola Roper (2019), examines microplastics collected from beach sediments on St. Thomas.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Kristin Grimes</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Kristin&nbsp;R&nbsp;Wilson Grimes</div> <div class="imageTitle">Zola Roper</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1649300/1649300_10460702_1601130237856_IMG_6214--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1649300/1649300_10460702_1601130237856_IMG_6214--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Kyle Jerris"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1649300/1649300_10460702_1601130237856_IMG_6214--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Kyle Jerris"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Bridge Program alumna, Kyle Jerris (2018), collecting beach sediments on St. Thomas, VI.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Kristin Grimes</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Kristin&nbsp;R&nbsp;Wilson Grimes</div> <div class="imageTitle">Kyle Jerris</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1649300/1649300_10460702_1601130574325_IMG_1018--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1649300/1649300_10460702_1601130574325_IMG_1018--rgov-800width.jpg" title="2017 Bridge Program students"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1649300/1649300_10460702_1601130574325_IMG_1018--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="2017 Bridge Program students"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">2017 Bridge to the Ph.D. Program students at UVI's Center for Marine & Environmental Studies research dock, St. Thomas, VI.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Kristin Grimes</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Kristin&nbsp;R&nbsp;Wilson Grimes</div> <div class="imageTitle">2017 Bridge Program students</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1649300/1649300_10460702_1601131507278_IMG_0122--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1649300/1649300_10460702_1601131507278_IMG_0122--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Naomi Huntley"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1649300/1649300_10460702_1601131507278_IMG_0122--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Naomi Huntley"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Bridge Program alumna, Naomi Huntley (2019) is now enrolled in a Ph.D. program at Pennsylvania State University.
