<AbstractNarration>Computational Mathematics, in general, and Numerical Analysis and Scientific Computing (NASC), in particular, are now well-recognized as providing a "third mode" of scientific investigation, complementing traditional theoretical and experimental approaches.  While the successes of NASC in both basic science and industry are many, one class of problems that remains challenging are those with rapid changes in the simulated quantities, such as arise with boundary and interior layers in fluid dynamics and other disciplines.  This grant supports US participation in an international workshop and short course on "Numerical Analysis for Singularly Perturbed Differential Equations", to be held on the campus of St. Mary's University in Halifax (Canada), from July 25-29, 2016.  NSF funds will allow US-based participants to benefit from learning both the basic tools in this area and the state-of-the-art, developing new collaborations with researchers from Canada and abroad. The PI will prioritize support for participants from underrepresented groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Problems with boundary and interior layers arise in many areas of scientific and industrial simulation, including mathematical biology, fluid dynamics, and electromagnetics.  Efficient parameter-robust simulation tools are needed in these fields to support the ever-increasing complexity of applied problems of interest to scientists and engineers.  Broadly, these problems can be categorized as ``singular perturbation problems", where a small parameter is identified that controls the width of these critical layers.  In the limit as these parameters approach zero, nearly all standard discretization and mesh-refinement strategies fail to yield robust error control; thus, a specialized subfield of NASC has arisen to address efficient and robust simulation of singularly perturbed differential equations. This two-day short course will focus on finite-difference and finite-element discretizations on fitted-layer meshes, as well as adaptive mesh refinement strategies for these problems. The remainder of the workshop is aimed at collaborative research sessions among workshop participants to apply these tools to real-world problems.  There are many opportunities for broader impacts of the proposed short course and workshop, including the development of new interdisciplinary research connections.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The 2016 AARMS-CRM-NSF Workshop on Numerical Analysis of Singularly Perturbed Differential Equations was held from July 24-29 at St. Mary's University in Halifax, NS.  The workshop was attended by 22 participants, from Canada (including 11 from Atlantic Canada), the United States, Europe, and China.  This grant supported the participants from US institutions.  A two-day short course (with both lectures and computing sessions) was led by Dr. Niall Madden from the National University of Ireland,Galway.  The third day of the workshop consisted of presentations by three speakers who subsequently led ``breakout sessions'' (detailed below).  The final two days of the workshop consisted of breakout sessions interspersed with plenary lectures, by Dr. Madden, Prof. Natalia Kopteva (University of Limerick), Prof. Torsten Linss (University of Hagen), and Prof.\Martin Stynes (Beijing Computational Science Research Center).   Three breakout sessions were led by Prof.\Andrew Bernoff (Harvey MuddCollege), Prof. Adriana Dawes (Ohio State University), andProf. Alan Lindsay (Notre Dame University).  Each speaker first presented a problem (or class of problems) where singularly perturbed behaviour occurs and rigorous numerical analysis is needed to shed better light on the application of choice.  The plenary lecturers facilitated these breakout sessions by posing questions about the applications at hand, and offering insight and advice into possible research directions.  Prof. Bernoff led a breakout session focused on diffusive signaling problems, such as the stamen of a flower waiting to catch a grain of pollen, a lymphocyte waiting to be stimulated by an antigen to produce antibodies, or an anteater randomly foraging for an ant nest to plunder. Each of these problems can be modeled as a diffusive process with mixed boundary conditions. The agent (pollen, antigen, anteater) finding its target (stamen, lymphocyte, ant nest) is then modeled by a first passage time problem for the distribution of the time when a particle executing a random walk is absorbed.  The group discussed several possible strategies for simulation of these systems, and formulated a finite-difference method for attacking the problem that cleverly removes the initial condition singularity by subtracting off the analytical solution known in free space.  The breakout session led by Prof. Dawes was focused on understanding the consequences of a small parameter limit in a biologically motivated model of protein levels in cells exposed to an external, spatially graded, signal.  One immediate direction suggested was to use geometric singular perturbations to analyze the model, which consists of coupled DEs. This analysis is currently being followed up on by a graduate student. The group also devised alternative geometries for the model in order to simplify further analysis. A particularly successful reorganization resulted in a circular array of cells with periodic boundary conditions. Numerical simulations were carried out on the original model to better understand the behavior of the model under the small parameter limit.  Interesting insights that are now being pursued include that the initial conditions strongly influence the pattern of cell fates, despite the imposed signal, and that the small parameter strongly dictates whether any patterns can form.  The breakout session led by Prof. Lindsay  focused on efficient and accurate simulation of sharp interfaces arising in elastic contact problems. These moving interfaces are boundary layers of associated nonlinear parabolic differential equations, centered around points in 1D and closed curves in 2D. The session discussed monitor function and element-marking approaches to generate moving meshes that track the interface motion. Efficient time discretization strategies, which incorporate analytical solution features, were also discussed, as were related free-boundary problems and their behavior.  A collaboration in this direction was begun between Prof. Lindsay and Prof. Haynes at MUN, and a focused mini-workshop on these problems will take place in 2017.  This project supported participation of students, postdocs, and junior and senior researchers from the United States. Through this project's support, the workshop stimulated interactions between related researchers from the United States and other countries, including theorists and experimentalists from applied mathematics and computational science.
