<AbstractNarration>The Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO) has detected gravitational waves from binary black holes, verifying Einstein's predictions and opening an entirely new window onto the universe.  Gravitational waves are very small, so searching for them presents great challenges in data analysis, mathematical techniques, and computation on top of the technical challenges of building and operating the instruments.  A theoretical understanding of the sources of gravitational waves, such as neutron stars and black holes, can also help guide searches as well as learn about these objects from the results of the searches.  Both the data analysis and theory work under this award will help transform LIGO from a prototype instrument into a tool for exploring physics and astrophysics, including the possibility of exotic particle phases and the complicated microphysics of matter under the most extreme conditions.  A continuous wave signal in particular will give a direct view into the otherwise inaccessible interiors of neutron stars.  As they spin down over the years, these stars can tell us about the properties of matter under the most extreme conditions since the Big Bang: supernuclear densities, relativistic speeds, superconducting and superfluid at a hundred million degrees.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports the implementation of matched filtering searches of Advanced LIGO data for continuous gravitational waves based on the Texas Tech group's code used in Initial LIGO publications; and supports development of that code to improve sensitivity and efficiency, allow more continuous gravitational wave searches, and isolate instrumental artifacts.  Specific science goals are (1) directed searches for young non-pulsing neutron stars, (2) narrow-band searches for known pulsars with unusual gravitational-wave frequencies, (3) detector characterization focusing on narrow spectral lines, and (4) theoretical guidance and interpretation of searches for continuous gravitational waves, particularly from neutron-star r-modes.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This award contributed to the most sensitive searches yet of Advanced LIGO data for a variety of gravitational wave signals.  The biggest news was the first detection of a binary neutron star merger, accompanied by a gamma-ray burst and other electromagnetic waves all across the spectrum.  This merger yielded spectacular results ranging from tests of Einstein's theory of gravity to a view of the creation of heavy elements to constraints on the nature of matter under the most extreme conditions in the modern universe.  Einstein checks out so far, most gold and platinum is formed in neutron star mergers rather than in stellar cores, and the stiffness of superdense matter is yielding insights into terrestrial nuclear physics.  This award also contributed to the most sensitive searches yet for continuous gravitational waves from isolated young neutron stars.  Although no continuous signals were found, these searches honed techniques which one day will yield even more information on the properties of gravity and matter under extreme conditions.  In addition to supporting work influencing a wide variety of areas of astronomy and physics, this work trained four young people (one of whom is a minority) for careers as data scientists, teaching them skills which are portable to a wide variety of jobs. One postdoctoral scholar went on to a career training scientific programmers after mentoring graduate students under this award, and the other is heading for a career analyzing major league sport statistics to improve team performance. The whole group helped spread the word on LIGO's exciting discoveries to the general public, including through http://www.ligo.org.
