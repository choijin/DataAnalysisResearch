<AbstractNarration>In correspondence with global warming and fast expansion of human activities in coastal waters, it is now becoming urgently needed to advance our modeling capabilities to a level of direct, high-fidelity simulation of many emerging, real-world, multiphysics, multiscale coastal ocean flow problems. Examples of these problems include oil spill at bottom of oceans, tidal energy extraction in coastal waters, etc. Currently, essentially there is no model at this level of simulation. The objective of this project is to develop computational methods and an unprecedented computer modeling system, which will be not only applicable to such problems but also a new platform to study many other problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In particular, a geophysical fluid dynamics model and a fully 3D fluid dynamics model are integrated via domain decomposition and two-way coupling into a single modeling system, in which the former captures mesoscale [O(10) km - O(10,000) km], background ocean currents and the latter resolves sub-mesoscale [O(1) m - O(10) km], complicated, local phenomena. The objective will be realized via three tasks: 1) Methods and algorithms with regard to solution accuracy, computational efficiency, and transmission condition. 2) Numerical experiments on the methods and algorithms, their validation in test problems, and a showcase application. 3) Development of a robust, efficient software package of the modeling system. The educational component aims at increasing awareness of students, especially those from underrepresented groups, on new computational problems and necessity for new methods of their solution, stimulating their interest in numerical algorithms and model development. The activities of this component include a series of seminars, teaching material development, etc.</AbstractNarration>

Intellectual Merit   The Back and Forth Error Compensation and Correction method (BFECC) was originally developed by  the PI and his collaborator for solving the convection of flows more accurately. It has been  further developed in this project as a general purpose method to improve the interpolation  accuracy on irregular meshes conveniently. BFECC method basically calls any linear  interpolation subroutine 3 times to make it a more accurate local 3rd order interpolation  method. The PI and his collaborators have successfully developed this method for the  interface interpolation between two ocean flow models which can handle smoothly varying  irregular grids. They also developed a strategy for it to interpolate between meshes of  different sizes and find a case when it can't achieve its theoretical order of accuracy  (but still reduces the error) which provides useful guidance in applications.

Preliminary results on 1D Burgers' equation is very good. Application on multi dimensional  conservation laws on unstructured meshes will explored.

Broader Impacts  The BFECC interpolation method shows significant improvement on the accuracy near the interface area  in 3D multi-component fluid simulations. Since the procedure doesn't mind the choice of underlying  low order methods, some very simple methods can be used which will make the numerical method on even  3D non uniform meshes very simple and easy to implement, and will be able to extend to higher  dimensions in which the reduction of complexity and implementation difficulty will be more and more  significant.

This work for shallow water equations paves the way to real applications because it can conveniently convert a well regarded general-purpose method to one efficient for shallow water problems involving complicated geometry and mesh, such as river flows, lakes, ocean flows etc.       Last Modified: 12/18/2020       Submitted by: Yingjie Liu]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
