<AbstractNarration>Recent research has shown that microorganisms can be very important to their eukaryotic hosts, by providing nutrition or contributing to host defense against enemies, such as pathogens or predators.  In many cases, however, hosting a bacterial symbiont imposes a physiological cost on the host organism, resulting in reduced growth or reproduction in the presence of the symbiont.  Further, these costs may be more pronounced in some habitats than others, causing natural selection to act in eliminating symbiont-containing hosts from the population.  In this project, the investigators are studying the relationship between the marine bryozoan invertebrate, Bugula neritina, and its uncultured symbiont.  The symbiont produces natural products with activity against cancer, Alzheimer's disease, and HIV.  Interestingly, these compounds also are distasteful and protect larvae from predators, indicating that this symbiotic relationship is defensive in nature.  Along the East Coast of the US, the investigators have found a much higher proportion of individuals that have the defensive symbiont at lower latitudes, while the symbiont is absent in individuals collected at higher latitudes.  This pattern is consistent with the theory that higher predation pressure exists at lower latitudes.  Other environmental factors, such as temperature, can also vary over a wide geographical area, and may also play a role in influencing the relationship.  In this project, the investigators will evaluate the ecological and environmental parameters that influence the distribution of a defensive symbiont, including predation pressure and temperature.  Defensive symbionts represent another level of ecological complexity, and likely play an important role in structuring marine communities.  This study will provide insight into how environmental factors can influence host-symbiont interactions and drive partner co-evolution.  Furthermore, the bioactive products have pharmaceutical potential, and understanding how environmental factors influence the relationship between B. neritina and its symbiont may improve bioprospecting for novel compounds that could be developed into drugs.  The educational outreach component of this project will include development of a biodiversity module for the Georgia State University mobile outreach laboratory that interacts with K-12 students throughout the state of Georgia.  In addition, both PIs will be involved in the development of a "citizen-science" project with high school students in Virginia to document B. neritina populations and reproductive patterns. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this research, the investigators will determine the ecological and environmental parameters that influence the distribution of a defensive symbiont in the marine bryozoan, Bugula neritina.  The goal of this research is to determine the mechanism that results in the defensive endosymbiont being restricted to hosts that inhabit lower latitudes.  This pattern of symbiont distribution could be the result of differing levels of costs and benefits at different latitudes: where predation pressure is low, the costs of hosting the symbiont outweigh the benefits, and aposymbiotic individuals outcompete their symbiotic conspecifics.  In areas of higher predation, the defensive benefit outweighs the cost, and symbiotic individuals have higher survival rates than their undefended, aposymbiotic conspecifics.  An alternative, but not mutually exclusive hypothesis, is that symbiont growth is inhibited at higher latitudes, where it is not as beneficial, and growth is induced in areas of higher predation.  Specific goals are to determine if (1) a biogeographical cline in predation pressure corresponds to a gradient of symbiont frequency associating with the host, (2) symbiotic hosts have a higher fitness at low latitudes, and aposymbiotic hosts have a higher fitness at high latitudes, and (3) symbiont growth is promoted at low latitudes and inhibited at high latitudes.  A combination of field and laboratory-based experiments will be conducted using ecological and molecular biology techniques.  Bioactive compounds produced by symbionts of marine invertebrates can mediate multi-trophic interactions and potentially influence benthic community structure.  There has been almost no research, however, on how ecological and environmental parameters influence the distribution of marine defensive endosymbionts.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Microbial symbionts can be important for the survival of their animal hosts by contributing to host nutrition of defense.  The marine invertebrate, Bugula neritina, possesses a bacterial symbiont that produces bioactive compounds that are distasteful to animals that prey on the host; interestingly, these compounds have been studied for their anticancer, anti-Alzheimer’s disease, and anti-HIV properties.  While the B. neritina is found in coastal environments around the world, not all of the colonies possess the microbial symbiont.  In this project, we investigated the role of environmental factors, such as temperature, salinity, and predation pressure, on the distribution of the symbiotic bacterium and its animal host along the East Coast of the United States.  We found that factors like latitude, and average temperature were important in the distribution of the symbiont in colonies, with more colonies that live at lower latitudes and higher temperatures possessing the symbiont.  Conversely, we also found that populations in close proximity can be significantly different from one another, suggesting that local pressures also impact these populations.  It is unclear how the symbiont is lost in individual B. neritina colonies, so we measured relative symbiont levels in colonies grown at different temperatures and in the presence of predators.  We showed that colonies grown in these different conditions had symbiont levels close to that of their parents while they are younger, but as they get older, the symbiont levels change in an unpredictable way.  All in all, neither temperature nor predation pressure seem to be the cause of these changes, and these data show a high level of plasticity in the symbiotic state of the offspring.  In addition, while symbiont titers are highly variable in B. neritina colonies, the presence of the symbiont impacts the other microbes that associate with B. neritina.  Taken together, it appears that the interaction between B. neritina and its symbiont is highly variable.           Last Modified: 11/24/2020       Submitted by: Nicole B Lopanik]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
