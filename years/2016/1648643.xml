<AbstractNarration>This grant will help support the travel costs for U.S. Ph.D. students to attend the International Workshop on Algorithmic Foundations of Robotics (WAFR).  WAFR is a high-level, single-track, international workshop that brings roboticists and theoretical computer scientists together.  The conference attracts an international crowd that includes academics, industry workers, entrepreneurs, and funding agency leaders. The meeting environment allows participants to exchange ideas, interact with leaders in the field, meet up-and-coming scientists, network, develop collaborations, and generate new ideas on the leading edge of robotic technology.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    The Workshop on the Algorithmic Foundations of Robotics (WAFR) is a multi-disciplinary single-track workshop with submitted and invited contributions on advances on algorithmic problems in robotics. It has been held every other year since 1994 and has an established reputation as one of the  most important venues for algorithmic work related to robotics.            The topics of interest to WAFR are very broad because the focus is on algorithm development and analysis rather than specific problems or applications. Topics of interest include fundamental algorithmic issues, such as complexity, completeness, machine learning, probabilistic reasoning,  and new programming paradigms, to name a few. Papers were also encouraged on topics from applications of robot algorithms to important or new domains, such as manufacturing, legged locomotion, distributed robotics, human-robot interaction, surgical robots, intelligent prosthetics, and brain-controlled robots. Furthermore, robot algorithms are being applied in domains beyond the traditional scope of robotics, for example, computational biology, computer animation, sensor networks, etc.        One of the most important aspects of WAFR is its informal atmosphere, which allows a frank exchange of new, previously unpublished ideas. In particular, WAFR has been an occasion for graduate students to meet and interact with more senior researchers who many times are not accessible to students at the much larger major robotics conferences. Career development through interaction with senior researchers (including not from their home institutions) as they can provide them with constructive feedback on their research and career plans.      This grant enabled increased student participation by supporting part of the travel costs for eighteen student participants of WAFR 2016.
