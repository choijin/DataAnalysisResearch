<AbstractNarration>The Department of Computer Science at the University of Houston proposes a Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) site program in the area of Data-Centric Computing. This is a three-year program in which each year a group of ten students is selected nationally, with emphasis on underrepresented cohorts in Computer Science. In order to provide greater focus, the topics are all in the area of Data-Centric Computing. We have proposed a variety of projects arranged around this theme. Topics include Cybersecurity (Phishing Detection, Network Intrusion Detection, and Privacy), Text and Video Mining, and Bioinformatics.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this REU program is to expose undergraduate students, through carefully selected topics, to data science research methodologies. The participants will acquire experience in conducting research through their involvement in the research on their individually assigned topics, under the guidance of a faculty mentor. This exposes young researchers to core principles of research, namely objectivity and verifiability. Participants will also be introduced to specific research methods, literature review, and ethics in science and technology, and acquire writing and presentation skills. Additionally, participants will learn about career opportunities, the graduate application process, and survivals skills in graduate programs. In this way, the program serves the national interest, by contributing to the progress of science, through the results obtained by the undergraduate students in this program and in the future, when the students enroll in graduate programs and conduct further research.</AbstractNarration>
