<AbstractNarration>The Differential Algebra and Related Topics (DART) VII conference will be held at the CUNY Graduate Center and City College, 09/30-10/04/2016, in New York City. The subject of differential algebra concerns the study of differential and difference equations from an algebraic point of view. The study of these types of equations has many applications outside of mathematics, including biology (population dynamics and cellular biology), chemical reactions, and physics. The aim of the conference is to bring together researchers who develop theory for these types of equations and those who develop algorithms for working with them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The DART international conference series started in 2000 and has become an annual activity in the recent years. This research area includes differential and difference Galois theories, differential and difference elimination, symbolic computation in commutative algebra and algebraic geometry, and model theory. The conference will foster the new interactions between researchers in differential and difference algebra and researchers in model theory, algebraic geometry, and commutative algebra. Special attention will be paid to mentoring the participants who are junior researchers. Additional information can be found at the conference website: http://qcpages.qc.cuny.edu/~aovchinnikov/DART7/index.html</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  Summary   This grant supported DART VII, the seventh in a series of major international conferences on Differential Algebra and Related Topics; and partially supported follow-up research and training activities.   DART VII was held at the CUNY Graduate Center and at Hunter College, 09/30-10/04/2016. It included 28 presentations and a poster session, and attracted about 60 participants.   The research and training activities were held at the CUNY Graduate Center and at Baruch College, 04/07-09/2017. This included 2 research presentations by senior mathematicians, 5 practice job talks by junior researchers, 20 one-on-one career-mentoring meetings between them, and a panel discussion about all aspects of academic careers.   Intellectual Merit   The scientific focus of this project was the integration of the algebraic theory of differential and functional equations with model theory, number theory, and computational mathematics. More than a third of DART VII participants report starting new collaborations and/or reinforcing old ones at DART VII, including new interactions among model theory, algebra, and computation.   At least a dozen research projects were started, advanced, and/or completed at DART VII. Some of these projects make progress towards designing and implementing algorithms for solving systems of low-order differential equations in a small number of variables; such systems often occur in applications to physics, biology, and environmental science. Others investigate the way solutions of a differential or functional equation might be algebraically related to each other or to elementary functions, proving broad classification theorems. Yet others seek solutions of particular important equations such as the Painleve differential equations; or look for algebraic functional equations satisfied by particular interesting functions, such as the generating series for a random walk.   Broader Impact   The organizers made a special effort to nurture and support the next generation of mathematicians at these meetings, and to include both women and under-represented minorities. The DART VII speakers are impressively diverse: 10 of the 28 presenters are from under-represented groups. Almost a third of the DART VII participants were students or postdocs, and a third of the talks were given by junior researchers.   The research and training activities were a part of a series of 5 such meetings organized by the PIs in 2016 and 2017.
