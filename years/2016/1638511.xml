<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will be seen across a broad number of applications. These applications include virtual reality and video games, as well as, physically interacting with computer-aided design (CAD) or medical models; creating interactive chemistry models; experiencing physics simulations; bringing engineering curriculum for STEM (Science Technology Engineering Math) training to life; and better connecting a surgeon to a medical procedure during minimally invasive surgery. Imagine if instead of interacting with a CAD or molecular model with a computer mouse, it was inexpensive enough that you could use the developed haptic device to grab the model within a 3D environment and pull on it to feel the strength of fasteners or molecular bonds. While these interactions can already be portrayed with desktop interfaces like Novint?s Falcon force feedback device, our technology could do this at a much lower price point and could also be used in large workspace applications like playing video games or exploring in VR a home living room. This project will also contribute to the understanding of the human perception of touch. This project relates to the technology area of ?Human Assistive Technologies and Bio-related Robotics? and the consumer electronics market segment. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to meet the market demand for intuitive, immersive, and inexpensive haptic technologies. This demand has been fueled by the renewed interest in virtual reality (VR) with the availability of inexpensive 3-dimentional (3D) head-mounted displays (HMDs). Current haptic interfaces are either too expensive and have limited workspaces or are too crude to portray force/torque interactions. The company hypothesizes that it can create an ungrounded haptic motion controller that can emulate force feedback at a price that will be viable for consumer virtual reality. This research will utilize tactile shear feedback within the handle of a game controller interface. Actuators within the controller will apply friction and shear forces to the user?s hand, which will in turn be driven based on simulated interaction forces from a VR physics engine. This will create an integrated haptic experience that will connect the user to the virtual environment.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Tactical Haptics exhibited its NSF-funded touch feedback technology in the National Science Foundation (NSF) booth at the USA Science and Engineering Festival in April, 2016 with the objective of engaging K-12 students to gain interest in careers in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM).  Tactical Haptics prepared hands-on virtual reality (VR) demos of virtual elasticity and inertia for attendees to experience along with the use of these physical phenomenon within interactions in a space-based first-person shooter game demo. This was conveyed via an efficient 5-minute hands-on demo.  These demos showed conference attendees how a basic understanding of math and physics can be the foundation of innovative virtual reality experiences.   As a pre-amble to the demo, personnel from Tactical Haptics engaged participants while they waited in line, starting with the question, "why do you like playing games?" This was done to engage participants, who agreed that "interaction" and "stimulation" was what the enjoyed about gaming. When asked what was missing from gaming, most agreed that the sense of touch was underrepresented, which created a segue to discuss our developed touch feedback, how it works (by applying tangential shear and friction forces through the handle of our device that mimic what the user would naturally experience if they grasped the virtual objects with their own hands), and the underlying physical phenomena that we?d show them in our hands-on demos.  Tactical Haptics gave demos to and directly engaged with over 200 attendees (primarily K-12 students) over the 3-day Festival, most which chose to wait 45+ minutes to have an opportunity to try our physics-driven VR demos. The demos were a hit with students and parents alike, and will hopefully serve to inspire interest in STEM subject matter and careers as a result.
