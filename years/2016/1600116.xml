<AbstractNarration>A permutation is an arrangement of objects in some order: cards in a deck, atoms in a linear polymer, physical or historical events in a chronology. This award supports research into the understanding of permutations from a mathematical perspective, in particular permutations involving large numbers of objects. Powerful new techniques at the interface of combinatorics and probability allow the large-scale study of the behavior of ensembles of permutations. Experience with other large combinatorial objects has led mathematicians to expect them to behave in certain predictable ways. As a result, when such permutations arise in nature and do not have the predicted properties, scientists know to seek a hidden explanation. For example, this involves the study of the significance of the order of genes on a chromosome, and the knowledge of the behavior of ensembles of large random permutations may tell geneticists when to look for a pattern.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;New discoveries have made it possible to learn much more about the nature of large permutations. In particular, the space of permutations of all sizes can be completed by limit objects that are probability measures on the unit square with uniform marginals. By maximizing a certain entropy integral, one can, in principle, find the limit object that describes nearly all permutations with certain given properties. The proposer and his collaborators will be using both analytic and experimental techniques to exploit this variational principle. One important objective, barely begun, is to plot the landscape of permutations with two fixed pattern densities and determine, for each feasible point, the number and character of the corresponding permutations.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    The PI and his collaborators want to better understand structures called permutations, which are ubiquitous in mathematics and statistics.  A permutation can be thought of as a way of re-ordering the numbers from 1 to n; each permutation has characteristics that can be described by fractions called "pattern densities."  We wanted to know: what does a typical permutation look like that has given pattern densities?     To answer this, we turned to limit objects called "permutons" and showed that certain ones of these---those that have largest "entropy"---capture the shapes of typical permutations.  These permutons can sometimes be found mathematically but more often are the result of computer experiments.  We were able to find permutons, one way or another, that describe important classes of large permutations and also exhibit interesting behaviors like phase transition.     Permutons have turned out to be quite useful in describing phenomena that create random permutations.  One example arises in the study of sorting networks, in which a list of items is reversed by interchanging adjacent items one at a time, efficiently but randomly.  Experiments suggested that the permutation reached by such a network at the halfway point conforms to a certain disk-shaped permuton, and this was confirmed by the recent work of a PhD student at the University of Toronto.    Another example arises from random walk on a line.  Successive positions of such a walk constitute a permutation described by a certain X-shaped permuton, which, surprisingly, does not depend on exactly how the steps are taken.    A great deal is still not known about random permutations, but the method of finding high-entropy permutons to describe them seems now to be on the way to becoming a standard approach in mathematics and statistics.
