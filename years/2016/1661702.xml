<AbstractNarration>This award is being made jointly by two Programs- (1) Instrument Development for Biological Research, in the Division of Biological Infrastructure (Biological Sciences Directorate), and (2) Nano-Biosensing, in the Division of Chemical, Bioengineering, Environmental and Transport Systems (Engineering Directorate). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Non Technical Description:&lt;br/&gt;Researchers at Northwestern University, and the University of Miami will develop an instrument to produce nanoarrays of biologically active probes. This new tool will produce combinatorial arrays of oligonucleotides and oligopeptides with sub-micrometer feature diameters over large areas (10's of square centimeters). The work will achieve order of magnitude improvements in feature size, production rate, and cost over current technologies providing access to fundamental biological experiments that could not otherwise be undertaken, including new ways to measure gene or protein expression at the single cell level. The development is a highly interdisciplinary effort which combines chemistry, materials science, engineering, and nanotechnology. Project activities will also include summer internships for undergraduates from minority-serving four year colleges, and a range of other outreach activities involving the Museum of Science and Industry in Chicago to promote scientific awareness, and with Breakthrough Miami to create internship opportunities for high school students from financially disadvantaged communities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Description:&lt;br/&gt;An instrument to create ultradense patterns of biologically active molecules will be developed to model the spatial and chemical complexity of biological systems or create arrays for determining gene or protein expression at the single-cell level. The goal of the proposed activity is to combine new surface chemistries with new instrument capabilities to make a go-to tool for the in situ synthesis of combinatorial arrays of oligonucleotides or oligopeptides with feature size and shape control over square centimeter areas The Nanosizer is enabled by two breakthrough advances to recently emerge from the Mirkin and Braunschweig groups, namely 1) the development of massively parallel pen arrays that are individually addressable by light, thereby combining the advantages of massively parallel pen arrays with photolithography (near- and farfield), and 2) new surface immobilization chemistries and photochemistries for the rapid printing of molecules onto surfaces. This project combines these two features into an automated platform that can photoactivate a surface with individually addressable tips, expose it to a range of reagents, and repeat for several cycles to create spatially encoded combinatorial arrays or nanopatterns of biologically active molecules on surfaces. When the appropriate instrumentation milestones are reached, initial filings of patent applications will be made through institutional commercialization offices, and partnerships will be sought with instrumentation manufacturers. Early dissemination of the research findings will occur through conferences followed by full reports in scientific journals. When milestones of significant public interest are reached, institutional public relations offices will be contacted to produce a press release. CAD drawings for photomasks for preparing tip arrays and microfluidic cells will be made available on the websites of the PIs so researchers can implement the Nanosizer on existing AFMs.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Spatially-encoded microarrays of biologically active probes have emerged as ubiquitous tools for studying the genetic basis of disease, drug efficacy, intracellular signaling, and cell differentiation. There is a pressing need to develop new tools for creating biomolecular microarrays that can print smaller features, increase the number of different probes in a pattern, and decrease both printing cost and printing time. Among the different biological probes, DNA microarrays containing the whole human genome (~40,000 genes) have proven particularly useful. They remain prohibitively expensive (~$3,000 for a 12-array chip), however, and protein and glycan array technologies are far less commonly used because of difficulties involved with immobilization chemistry and library diversity. Microarray technologies are thus subject of considerable research effort ? more than 30,000 peer-reviewed articles containing ?microarrays? as a topic have been published in the last four years. The most common microarray fabrication strategies are pin-printing, ink-jet printing, and photolithography. Pin-printing and ink-jet printing are limited in&nbsp; the number of different probes that can be deposited in a single array. Photolithography is prohibitively expensive and requires multiple printing steps that cannot be implemented in a standard laboratory environment. To address these limitations in printing technologies, we have developed a new printing platform that provides the resolution and precision of photolithography (~1-?m feature diameters) with the ink compatibility and affordability of pin and ink-jet printing. This printer operates by combining surface photochemistry, microfluidics, mask-less photolithography, and piezoactuation to create microarrays that have more features, in a smaller area, and with greater potential probe-diversity than any current microarraying platform.</p> <p>Over the project period, we have created three different versions of the printer, each one incorporating new capabilities. The first iteration incorporated a basic microfluidic cell that permitted the flow of monomer solutions into a reaction, which, upon irradiation through a polymer-pen array, generated patterns composed of two different compositions of brush polymers, and with feature diameters of tens-of-microns (<strong>Figure 1A</strong>). The second version, substantially improved the microfluidics, incorporating an upstream chaotic mixer that delivers the desired composition onto the reaction droplet, which flows by capillary action underneath the beam-pen array (<strong>Figure 1B</strong>). Using the beam-pen array was also an improvement that permitted reducing the feature size to &lt;1-?m. The last version of the printer, substitutes the beam-pen array as light channeling element by a digital micromirror device (DMD) containing more than 750,000 individually addressable micromirrors (<strong>Figure 1C</strong>). The last version also incorporates an air-free chamber to carry out oxygen and water sensitive reactions.</p> <p>With the first version of the printer we demonstrated the ability to create multiplexed polymer brush patterns (<strong>Figure 2A</strong>), although we were unable to create patterns with more than two different ink compositions. The second version permitted the fabrication of multiplexed microarrays of many different alkene-labelled fluorophores and with ~1 ?m feature diameter (<strong>Figure 2B</strong>). The printer has been recently improved by incorporating a DMD and an air-free chamber, which have enabled the printing of polymer brush patterns controlling the height of the brushes and their composition at each position of the pattern (<strong>Figure 2C</strong>), enabling arrays with thousands of different ink compositions, thereby accomplishing the major project goal.
