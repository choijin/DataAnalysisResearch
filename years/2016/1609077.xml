<AbstractNarration>Nontechnical description: The interaction of light with matter capable of light absorption and emission is of fundamental and long-standing scientific and technological interest. This interaction can be enhanced by using miniature optical cavities made of two mirrors, in which light repeatedly bounces back and forth while traversing the absorbing medium. This structure forms the basis of the laser. Organic dyes, commonly used for making lasers, exhibit particularly enhanced behavior when placed in ultrasmall optical cavities, often exemplified by unusually large color changes. This project addresses nonlinear optical effects in optical cavities smaller than the wavelength of light, in which the aforementioned enhancements are particularly strong.  The optical cavities coupled with the special optical materials exhibiting these exceptionally strong interactions can be dynamically controlled, and, as a result, the optical performance of these systems. The phenomena addressed in this project have potential applications in optical information processing and communications, and in such technologies as holographic displays. The graduate and undergraduate students involved in this project are also involved in mentoring and outreach programs for students from underrepresented groups in the inner cities in northeast Ohio.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical description: Ultrastrong coupling between photons and excitons in microcavities containing organic dyes and semiconductors has been recently observed at room temperature.  The unusually strong interactions dovetail with the robust nonlinear optical responses of the same materials. This provides a new and promising hybrid material for photonics. This project explores the nonlinear optical properties of organic materials as active elements in nanoscale low-Q optical cavities in the regime of strong and ultrastrong photon-exciton coupling of cavity polaritons. In this regime, the physics of quantum cavity electrodynamics describes significant changes in the spectral dispersion of the composite structure. Contributions to the AC Stark effect is the focus of studies implying particular attention to spectral response of the nonlinear optical interaction and manipulation of the spectrum by varying the cavity resonance, for example, by angle tuning. Well-studied organic glass forming nonlinear optical materials incorporated into metal mirror cavities of low-Q are being investigated, experimentally and theoretically, in a number of cavity configurations to determine their nonlinear optical response for the optical Kerr effect, third harmonic generation and photorefraction.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The main focus of nonlinear optics is to understand and manipulate how matter interacts with strong electromagnetic fields; so, it is no surprise that its development nearly coincided with the invention of the laser in the 1960?s. This   nuanced understanding of light-matter interactions has led to a plethora of new and interesting applications utilizing the ability to change the color of light (frequency conversion) as well as direct and control light using light. Technology based on nonlinear optics is now ubiquitous in the laser industry with applications in information technology, both classical and quantum.  New phenomena and applications are constantly emerging.  These new areas of science and technology depend on the development of improved and tailored materials that permit and enhance these nonlinear interactions.  Early on, organic materials that are characterized by highly delocalized electric charges have been shown to exhibit exceptionally strong and tunable nonlinear optical properties.  Our project aims to understand and exploit these highly performant materials in novel nanoscale devices.  By capturing light between two metal reflectors on either side of a film whose thickness is well below the wavelength of light, cavity polaritons are formed.  These are emergent particles that have dual properties of light and matter, and so make possible novel quantum and optical phenomena. Cavity polaritons can exhibit ultralow threshold laser action as well as enhance a variety optical and chemical interactions.   Our project has shown a nearly 300-fold enhancement in the nonlinear optical response of these structures compared to the constituent organic films, that is, organic films minus the reflectors.  Our studies were aimed at characterizing the spectral aspects of the nonlinear optical response and to achieve a fundamental understanding of their origin.  The two main studies involved frequency conversion by third harmonic generation, where infrared light was transformed to visible light by the polariton structure, and the intensity dependent refractive index, where light is used to control light.  In both cases, we used combinations of classical and quantum physical theories to qualitatively and quantitatively understand the origin of the nonlinear optical processes.  In the case of third harmonic generation, we were able to show through a combination of classical theories of trapped light with quantum theories of materials how the nonlinear optical spectrum emerges from the alterations of existing quantum theory peculiar to the polariton states.  Likewise, we were able to show in great detail how three quantum mechanical states of the organic material combined with intense trapped light leads to a shift of the polariton spectrum thus leading to a new way of controlling light with light.    Our results provide a deeper understanding of the physical processes underlying the nonlinear optical responses.  This understanding will help guide chemists, physicists, and engineers toward improved materials and structures for nonlinear optics and applications in the laser and information industries (classical and quantum).  This work lays the foundation for our own and others? future work in new materials and complex polariton structures exhibiting heretofore unobserved phenomena with potential transformational impact on emerging technology.
