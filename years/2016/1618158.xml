<AbstractNarration>Society increasingly depends on numerical software, which uses finite&lt;br/&gt;precision arithmetic to approximate the reals and necessarily&lt;br/&gt;introduces approximation and error. Cyber-physical systems are&lt;br/&gt;ubiquitous and rely on numerical software. Anti-lock breaks and&lt;br/&gt;medical devices such as haptic control systems for remote surgery are&lt;br/&gt;two such examples. Numerical errors in these systems can be&lt;br/&gt;disastrous.  Toyota suspects such errors contributed to its costly&lt;br/&gt;acceleration problem; the Ariane 5 rocket exploded due to an overflow&lt;br/&gt;in its inertial reference system; and scientists have had to retract&lt;br/&gt;papers from prestigious journals (e.g., Nature). Techniques and tools&lt;br/&gt;for improving numerical software reliability are critically needed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project explores practical techniques to test and analyze&lt;br/&gt;numerical software.  It focuses on the two most fundamental sources of&lt;br/&gt;numerical errors: uncaught exceptions, and numerical stability and&lt;br/&gt;accuracy. The proposed techniques are centered around symbolic&lt;br/&gt;execution and guided testing, and domain insights are used to develop&lt;br/&gt;principles and heuristics to make the techniques practical.  This&lt;br/&gt;project considers three main dimensions: (1) problem formulation and&lt;br/&gt;analysis strategies, (2) constraint solving, and (3) implementation&lt;br/&gt;techniques. It aims at advancing the state-of-the-art in engineering&lt;br/&gt;robust numerical software to help avoid costly, dangerous errors.</AbstractNarration>
