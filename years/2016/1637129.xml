<AbstractNarration>SES-1637129&lt;br/&gt;Ho-fung Hung&lt;br/&gt;Daniel Thompson&lt;br/&gt;Johns Hopkins University  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inequality has increased in the United States and other rich countries over the last four decades. Scholars seeking to explain these trends have given much attention to deindustrialization and globalization, but a related trend, financial sector growth, is understudied. Finance is the largest source of corporate profits in most rich countries, but the sector employs few and has high earnings dispersion. Looking beyond the financial sector itself, social scientists have argued that financial sector influence has led to rising inequality within non-financial firms and declining redistribution in welfare states. To understand the relationship between finance and inequality, this dissertation will examine across 18 countries and over 40 years the effects of financial sector growth on five distributional outcomes: wage inequality, unemployment, tax progressivity, income transfers, and net inequality. This dissertation will contribute to academic scholarship on comparative inequality and comparative politics, in which few works have examined financial sector growth. It will also contribute to public debate on the causes of rising inequality as well as public policy on issues related to inequality and redistribution.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The project will investigate the association between financial sector growth and inequality as well as the mechanisms through which this relationship takes place. Theoretically, the project draws on macro-comparative political economy, power resource theory, and institutional analysis, and it potentially will offer contributions to each theoretical perspective. It combines two methodological approaches. First, a statistical analysis will examine distributional outcomes in 18 countries over a period of 40 years. These will be used to identify general patterns and associations and frame the relationships for closer study. Second, qualitative, historical case studies of the United States, Germany, and Sweden will examine more closely the causal processes and intervening variables that link financial sector growth and rising inequality, while accounting for these countries' variation in institutional context. This more detailed causal analysis can improve understanding of the statistical associations identified in the quantitative analysis.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project has sought to understand why, in most of the advanced economies of the world over the last 40 years, income inequality has increased and secular levels of unemployment have been elevated. The project proposed to examine the role of the growth of the financial sector and related business services. It draws on recent research in sociology on "financialization", a term used to refer to the growing importance of the financial sector, financial actors, and financial motives. The project extends this literature, arguing that the financial sector has created a small set of highly-compensated jobs within the sector itself, but the growth of this sector has not spilled over to other sectors. In turn, it is hypothesized that financial sector growth has increased unemployment levels and made overall income distribution more unequal.   A major activity of the project was the co-PI?s attendance at the 2016 LIS Data Center Data Users? Workshop in Luxembourg. The LIS Data Center produces high-quality income inequality data that is comparable across countries. The LIS workshop trains data users in the effective use of these specialized data and especially how to build queries with the LIS proprietary data access tool.  Combining LIS inequality data, cross-national employment measures, data on financial sector size, and many control variables, the research shows that financial sector growth has been an important determinant of cross-national levels of inequality and unemployment, worsening both outcomes. The effect of financial sector growth has been larger than other existing explanations, such as globalization, technological change, and changing labor market regulations. Financial sector growth is associated with not only growing market-based inequality from wages and financial income, but also declining redistribution through taxes and transfers. Another important finding is that financial sector growth has mediated the relationship between real interest rates and employment outcomes. Low interest rates now have a smaller effect on employment than in the 1970s and 1980s.  The results from the project have been disseminated at social science conferences, and articles reporting the main findings are under review at sociology and public policy journals. The findings can inform decision making on industrial, social, and labor market policy by highlighting the role that major compositional changes have played in rising inequality and persistent unemployment.  While recent policy debates have focused on labor market regulations, globalization, and technological change, this project shows that financial sector growth has had a larger role.
