<AbstractNarration>Dr. Michael Heckenberger (University of Florida) and Brazilian colleagues will conduct research to study the scale and organization of terminal pre-Columbian complex societies in the Upper Xingu region of the southern Amazon.  The research builds on prior NSF-supported archaeology, which provided clear evidence of large, densely settled pre-Columbian populations and regional organization in two integrated clusters of walled towns and non-walled villages, ca. 1250-1650 CE, within a 1,200 kmÂ² study area.  This project will provide important new data on the techno-economic systems and the resource base of production systems associated with the large, sedentary pre-Columbian populations, including forest and wetland management systems.  These systems not only altered forest conditions but may have helped maintain or even expand forest in this mosaic area of transitional tropical forest.  It is suggested that semi-intensive land use practices in production landscapes associated with primary food and industrial crops were concentrated in cluster core areas and high working forests dominated in peripheral areas.  Rather than predominantly slash and burn agricultural practices or open field farming that denude forest, it is suggested that pre-Columbian groups of the region practiced hybrid systems that involved forest to forest conversion across the region, which helped maintain and expand forest species across the region, even during the period ca. 1250-1650 CE when settlements reached their maximum size and integration in clusters. The research informs debates on pre-Columbian population levels and human impacts in the Amazon, notably the maximal degree of anthropogenic influence on pre-industrial Amazonian forest ecosystems in the southern Amazon transitional forests and dynamics of coupled human-environmental systems in relation to climate change, sustainability and cultural heritage. It articulates with scientific and public interests in sustainability, including multi-scalar and multi-cultural collaborations in large projects and public anthropology developed through participation, partnership and education in Brazil and the USA.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Heckenberger and his team will examine putative off-site production areas situated between major terminal pre-Columbian towns and villages and compare these settings to settlement areas and putative areas of non-production standing forest areas, in terms of soils and forest cover.  The team includes archaeology, paleoecology and ethno-ecologists and continues a successful participatory research program that involves international collaboration and engagement with local indigenous communities. Four months of fieldwork, including training and collaboration workshops, will focus on off-site soil sampling in 45 discrete areas, as well as general ethnoecological characterization of forest vegetation in each area. Additionally, wetland testing is proposed to collect well controlled samples of pollen, micro-charcoal, and other remains, to provide a picture of local vegetation in areas of large settlements and broader regional patterns.</AbstractNarration>

The Upper Xingu has figured prominently in debates on the long-term impacts on the environment, as one of the first examples of dense settled populations and semi-intensive land use in the southern Amazon.  This region is also well known globally due to the precipitous decline in tropical forests due to agropastoral development across the southern Amazon arc of deforestation, which has been exacerbated by the coupled process of regional aridification and forest fires resulting from climate change.

In the Upper Xingu. Over the past five years, over 80% of the forested areas have been impacted directly by fire and over 50% have burned multiple times.    This project has revealed remarkably similar technologies and cultural practices among descendant indigenous communities, notably the Kuikuro and related communities that reside in the indigenous territory (Territorio Indigena do Xingu).  It has documented the expansion and integration of regional societies in well-planned clusters of major settlements ca. 1200-1300 CE, at the height of the Medieval Warm Anomaly in eastern Amazon.  This raises the possibility that regional changes associated with the emergence of these densely settled Pre-Columbian may have been in part related to similar changes in regional hydroclimate, including fire, which prompted the creation of fire control mechanisms, such as partitioning land use and the creation of fire breaks, such as roads, major ditches and internal divisions within settlements.  Similarly, constructions in wetland areas adjacent to settlements, particularly in areas vulnerable to forest fires, also provided control and buffering mechanisms for fire and water regulation, as well as sophisticated semi-intensive systems of natural resource management.  This project provides the clearest example from Amazonia of the nature and scale of regional populations in the centuries immediately prior to European conquest and the extensive human modifications of forest areas and ecosystemic biodiversity in the region.  The project documented the overall extent of the regional socio-cultural system in late Pre-Columbian times, which extended over 40,000 square km.  It also documents significant variation within this overall area, most notably the linear orientation of discrete clusters of major settlements in core areas of the basin, surrounded by an extensive peripheral area composed of smaller and less dense settlements.  In the Kuikuro study area, the orientation of both settlements in clusters, which comprise small, integrated polities within the regional peer-polity system, likewise show a linear settlement orientation along the river bluff margin, which is a pattern widely recognized along the Amazon and its major tributaries.  Within the Kuikuro study area, this project focused on characterization areas outside of settlement that today are covered in closed tropical forest and comparison of these to forests that have grown over ancient settlement areas.  This was achieved through a combined archaeological, geospatial analysis and GIS, geochemical and paleobotanical analysis, and the indigenous knowledge of descendant communities.  This revealed significant variability in land use practices in relation to three primary forest types that are the result of past land use practices.  This included forest areas defined by highly modified Amazonian dark earth (ADE) deposits associated with major settlements, known as egepe forest by the Kuikuro, areas of less modified anthropogenic soils, called egepe tse, which are located along river bluffs and were areas of semi-intensive production, and the vast areas of closed forest, known as itsuni, which show highly variable but less intensive land use.
