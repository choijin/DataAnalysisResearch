<AbstractNarration>Adaptive optics (AO) is a technique used in astronomy to correct distortions in the incoming light collected by optical systems (i.e. telescopes in astronomy) due to the effects of the atmosphere through which the light passes.  AO has applications to fields outside of astronomy for example ophthalmology/vision science.  The proposed interdisciplinary workshop will bring together scientists and engineers from a variety of fields that use AO for unique discussions. These types of in person collaborations are essential for evolving the science and for growing the avenues of communication between the various disciplines.   The proposed workshop will also train the next generation of scientists and engineers by providing exposure to the multi-disciplinary AO field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal is for an AO-specific workshop that will be included as one of eight topical meetings held as part of the Imaging and Applied Optics conference, to be held 25 - 28 July 2016 in Heidelberg, Germany.  The workshop entitled Adaptive Optics: Methods, Analysis, and Applications will bring together researchers from various communities that use AO to discuss new developments in the field and novel applications of adaptive optics. Topics will include AO systems/component technologies, wave-front correction optics, control algorithms, and signal processing electronics used in AO implementations.  The proposed workshop is directly relevant to current and future development of NSF astronomical facilities and programs.</AbstractNarration>
