<AbstractNarration>Title: Collaborative Research: Understanding Ion Solvation Effects in Nonaqueous Oxygen Electroreduction Reactions&lt;br/&gt;Bryan D. McCloskey/ Venkatasubraman Viswanathan&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: 1604927/1604898&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Of all battery chemistries currently being explored to power next-generation electric vehicles, metal-air (O2) couples possess some of the highest known theoretical specific energies and volumetric energy densities.  In particular, the aprotic nonaqueous Li-O2 battery has recently received significant attention because of its superior specific energy. Yet many of the challenges facing Li-O2 battery development remain unsolved.  One of these challenges involves understanding the link between electrolyte composition and the discharge/charge electrochemical processes. The proposed research will address the fundamental dependence of the Li-O2 electrochemistry mechanism on both cation and anion solvation, thereby providing a better understanding of how to improve the performance of high-energy nonaqueous Li-O2 and other metal-O2 batteries.  If successful, Li-O2 batteries could advance and accelerate the adoption of electric vehicles for reduced emissions, improved efficiency, and domestic energy security.  The PIs are committed to broad dissemination of their results. As such, they will develop online video modules to make publicly accessible the prospects of this exciting new area of energy storage. The online modules will be structured for simple incorporation into energy and electrochemical system courses, including those taught by the PIs.  The PIs will also develop a broader and more engaging educational content on electrochemistry/batteries with a vision to run a massive online open course.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The overall objective of the proposed research is to elucidate the effect of ion solvation on the fundamental oxygen electrochemistry in nonaqueous electrolytes, with a particular emphasis on oxygen reduction in Li+-bearing electrolytes.  Recent studies have identified the importance of electrolyte composition on both the ultimate oxygen reduction product formed and the mechanism by which it forms. For example, a 2 e- oxygen reduction to form lithium peroxide, Li2O2, is found to occur in nonaqueous Li-O2 batteries, whereas a 1 e- reduction process to form sodium superoxide, NaO2, occurs in Na-O2 batteries.  Furthermore, the Li-O2 discharge mechanism was recently shown to be affected by a delicate interplay between anion and solvent selection, as the Lewis acidity and basicity of both components affected the lifetime of oxygen reduction intermediates in solution. The PIs used this knowledge to improve the discharge capacity (or usable energy) of a Li-O2 battery four-fold. However, the understanding of the complex role of electrolyte constituents (ions, additives, and solvents) on electrode reactions and ion solvation is not complete.  This understanding potentially has far-reaching implications in many other electrochemical systems (e.g., CO2 reduction, Li-S batteries, and other metal-air batteries). The proposed research tasks will leverage unique experimental and theoretical capabilities developed by the PIs to study Li-O2 batteries, including Differential Electrochemical Mass Spectrometry (DEMS) to quantify Coulombic efficiency of batteries employing different electrolyte compositions, and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy to probe cation and anion solvation in these electrolytes.  The theoretical capabilities to describe non-equilibrium charge transport, and solution and surface electrochemistry, will be based on density functional theory calculations.  Through a well-developed theoretical and experimental framework, the PIs will identify novel electrolyte compositions that can trigger solution electrochemistry, thereby improving discharge capacity while maintaining chemical stability.   The PIs will then experimentally link ion solvation effects in the most promising electrolyte compositions to stability and capacity enhancements.</AbstractNarration>

The major outcomes of this project included the following:   - A new mechanism for superoxide/peroxide oxidation during metal-air battery charge was elucidated.

Our results indicated that a transition between different failure mechanisms occurs at a specific oxygen pressure depending on the current density. We believe these results will provide critical insight into future optimization of metal-O2 battery (Li and Na batteries, specifically) capacity and overall performance.  -Recent reports have indicated that due to the lattice matching of iridium and lithium superoxide, iridium based electrodes may promote the stable formation of lithium superoxide over lithium peroxide, even though all prior reports indicate that lithium superoxide is unstable at room temperature.  We therefore studied oxygen reduction in Li-bearing nonaqueous electrolytes at an iridium/reduced graphene oxide (Ir/rGO) electrode in an attempt to understand this new mechanism for stable formation of lithium superoxide.   Two important results were identified in our study of Ir/rGO electrodes when used in Li-O2 batteries: 1) When spectroscopically characterizing discharged Ir/rGO electrodes, Raman peaks previously ascribed to the formation of LiO2 appear only in cells that use poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) binders, and only then if they are not fully dried after preparation under ambient atmosphere. 2) Regardless of the electrode composition employed (binder, catalyst, preparation conditions), we only observe a 2 e-/O2 process and never a 1 e-/O2 process either on discharge or charge. Our results suggest that bulk, stable LiO2 formation via the 1 e-/O2 process is not an active discharge reaction when using Ir/rGO electrodes, and instead care has to be taken to ensure that PVDF degradation products are not mischaracterized as LiO2 in future studies.  - We developed reduced graphene oxide-based catalysts that possess exceptional properties for H2O2 formation during the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). We found that these catalysts have exceptionally high gravimetric activity and selectivity for the H2O2 formation reaction in alkaline environments. To understand why our catalysts possess these excellent properties, we employed a variety of ex-situ and operando spectroscopic techniques to confirm the precise active site within the carbon material.  Ex-situ structural spectroscopic characterization of the catalysts, combined with in-situ Raman spectroscopy measurements, indicated that sp2 hybridized carbon next to ether defects either on graphene basal planes or at graphene edges are the likely active sites for 2 e- ORR.   Similar measurements on synthesized N-doped reduced graphene oxide elucidated the mechanism of 2 e- and 4 e- ORR on these materials, indicating that morphological features (e.g., embedded sp2 carbon size in the reduced graphene oxide basal plane) plays a critical and underappreciated role in 2 e- vs 4 e- ORR selectivity.  These results were disseminated in 8 articles and 7 conference presentations. This grant supported activities of 1 postdoc, 2 PhD students, and 3 summer undergraduate researchers, and outcomes of this research were further integrated into a lecture the PI gave for an undergraduate course at UC.
