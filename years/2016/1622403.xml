<AbstractNarration>The Oso, Washingon landslide of 2014, which resulted in 43 fatalities, and the ash plumes from the Eyjafjallaj√∂kull (Iceland) eruption of 2010, which shut down air travel in Europe, are examples of rare and catastrophic geophysical events. Their rare nature makes such events nearly impossible to forecast, if forecasts are based only on previous observations.  To capture rare events, researchers must rely on complex physical and mathematical models that often require significant computational resources to exercise.  Furthermore, events like these may be best described by a series of different models of different phenomena at different scales. For example, a researcher may need to combine a model of rainfall, a model of slope failure, and a model of sliding debris to create on overall model for a landslide event.  The main objective of this research is the development of efficient statistical and computational strategies to combine such models, thus advancing the state of the art in hazard forecasting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Direct simulation-based hazard assessment would require thousands to tens of thousand of linked, space-time simulations.  Furthermore, to be of most use in hazard assessment, these simulations should be informed and validated by observational data sets, which themselves can range from sparse data (rare events) to massive data (e.g. satellite data), and explored for emerging scenarios.  To complicate the matter, a number of features of the problems of interest are either poorly characterized or unpredictable, and one would like to run the simulation programs at a range of values of each of them; this quickly leads to a perceived need to run a simulation program (which may take hours to complete) for hundreds of thousands or millions of different combinations of parameter values and conditions. There simply is not enough time or enough computing power for such a brute force approach to succeed. To tackle the situation just described, the PIs will continue to develop parallel partial emulators for massive space-time simulator data allowing emulator construction on the adaptive space-time grids commonly used in geophysical simulations, creating smoothers for their output, and enabling the use of reduced input spaces. The PIs will begin the investigation of a strategy for linking multiple simulators via multiple emulators.  A particularly powerful semi-analytic way of linking emulators will be pursued, with a variety of research questions arising centering around the accuracy of the method, as well as the possibility of its implementation in the huge data scenario envisaged for the parallel partial emulator. The PIs will also begin to investigate techniques to extract (nearly) optimal basis sets, data reduction methods, and algorithmic approaches to accelerate the construction of emulators, all of which contribute to a more robust handling of large datasets. These new methodologies will provide tools to rapidly construct probability-based hazard forecast maps for cascading geophysical events. Rapid forecast maps allow end users to perform hazard analysis under a wide variety of aleatoric scenarios. Furthermore this new methodology will enable fast assessment of epistemic uncertainties. This approach constitutes a dramatic improvement in scientifically-based decision support.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Often it is a chain of events that lead to rare, yet catastrophic hazards that impact humans: weeks of exceptionally heavy rainfall make conditions ripe for massive landslides on hillsides scorched by fire; volcanic ash plumes get carried on a windy day causing widespread dispersion and disrupting air traffic. To understand the chance of being impacted by such hazards, we rely on models of the physical system and probe scenarios that lead to these hazardous events.  Then we can explore the chance of being impacted by a rare hazard due to natural randomness.  We can also study the uncertainties inherent in the hazard models, uncertainties due to limited data and imperfect models.  Hazard analysis and uncertainty analysis each are difficult tasks in their own right.  Modeling a chain of events such as fire and rain leading to mudslides requires linking different physical models.  This linking of models compounds the difficulty of both hazard analysis and uncertainty quantification, rendering existing mathematical tools for these purposes -- statistical surrogates of physical models -- rather ineffective. During this project, we developed an efficient and accurate scheme to construct surrogates for linked models, and applied this methodology to a scenario of an ash plume feeding into a wind-driven ash dispersal model.  This approach relies on constructing surrogates for each individual model -- ash plume and ash dispersal --  and combining them into an effective surrogate for the whole of the linked system.  Further, we have started a study of a particularly challenging case, namely when a large numbers of variables from one model feed a second model.  To this end we use a combined strategy for building surrogates for large numbers of variables, which is joined with our strategy for linked surrogates.  Initial applications of this combination are very promising.  Our preliminary findings indicate a strong potential to  develop these ideas further, and to apply them to challenging multi-physics coupled systems that are ubiquitous in engineering applications.
