<AbstractNarration>Testing of urine for molecular content is a powerful tool that a doctor uses in the assessment of a patient's health profile. This procedure is typically done in a laboratory, where the patient must bring the urine sample for testing. Unfortunately, the collection and transportation of the sample can be a time-consuming task, which poses particular di;culty for patients with decreased mobility. Furthermore, kidney health is crucial for quality of life. Unfortunately, health issues like diabetes and high blood pressure are risk factors in the development of chronic kidney disease. This is particularly problematic given the high incidence of obesity that the United States currently is facing. Together, diabetes and cardiovascular disease cost the United States over $370 billions per year. By monitoring kidney function more frequently, its deterioration can be detected early, allowing doctors and patients to make adjustments in treatment and lifestyle to prevent further loss of kidney functions. This is crucial given the fact that, in many cases, kidney function cannot be recovered. Additionally, the alarming rate of chronic kidney disease in adults over 65 years (25%) makes it critical to closely monitor kidney function.  The goal of this I-Corps team is to develop a completely marketable prototype from the above proof of concept that includes the current and the future planned improvements in the project phase.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed apparatus can facilitate the collection, storage and transfer of patients' urinalysis data and reduce the amount of time and resources used by performing urinalyses in a home setting with an automated device. It can also benefit clinics, hospitals and assisted living settings, which can use the capabilities of our proposed device to feed a database with the resulting data.During the customer discovery phase in the I-Corps program, the team will focus in understanding further the key needs of a broader medical population and explore other areas where the technology can be of significant value (e.g., veterinary, sport medicine etc.). Validation and testing of proof of concept in a hospital setting is expected to be completed. Specifically testing at a Family Unit will be completed. Identify deficiencies in terms of user experience, work towards improvements based on feedback and test at small clinics as well as engaging patients.</AbstractNarration>
