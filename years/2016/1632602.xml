<AbstractNarration>This project supports hosting a Global Environment for Network innovations (GENI) Regional Workshop (GRW) on March 7, 2016 at Arizona State University in Tempe, Arizona. The intent of this GRW is to continue to broaden the GENI user community, introducing new educators and researchers in the southwestern US geographic region to GENI. Four GRWs in total are being planned in 2016, one held about every three months (i.e., March (this workshop), June, September, and December), scattered geographically across the U.S.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed GRW will promote innovations in research (e.g., network science, security, services, and applications) and education (e.g., the development of new coursework assignments and projects using the GENI infrastructure). The workshop will enable participants to engage in a range of activities designed to improve their understanding of and expertise in:&lt;br/&gt;1) Resources available for utilizing GENI in undergraduate and graduate education.&lt;br/&gt;2) Utilizing the GENI infrastructure in experimental research, including state-of-the-art developments in wired, wireless, cloud computing, software defined networking, and network function virtualization.&lt;br/&gt;3) Working through a variety of "hands on" tutorials, obtaining network and compute resources at locations around the United States.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop serves as a venue for the exchange of ideas, a discussion of challenges of experimentation in research and classroom settings, and a showcase for technology experimentation on GENI.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Arizona State University (ASU) hosted the first GENI Regional Workshop  (GRW) on March 7, 2016. GENI is a nationwide suite of infrastructure supported by the Nation Science Foundation for experimentation in networking, distributed systems, security, and novel applications. The purpose of the GRW was to broaden the GENI user community, introducing new educators and new researchers to GENI.  The morning of the workshop began with an introduction to GENI.  This was followed by two keynote presentations.  The first had an emphasis on GENI in education.  The second described a "smart cities" initiative between GENI and US Ignite, a non-profit organization seeking to accelerate advances in networking from research to prototype to full-scale smart community and interconnected national deployments.  The afternoon provided two parallel tracks of tutorials, to expose attendees to  some of the capabilities of GENI through "hands on" experience. One track was intended for novices, involving a first experiment using GENI, followed by a tutorial on software defined networking (SDN) applications in GENI. The second track was intended for participants already having GENI experience, and included a tutorial on experiment management in CloudLab, cloud computing infrastructure supported by NSF.  The second advanced tutorial offered a selection of experiments designed and implemented by researchers and students in support of their research or education, on subjects such as network economics, cognitive radio, distributed data processing, queuing theory, and multimedia systems.  Intellectual Merit: The GENI Regional Workshop served as venue for the exchange of ideas, a discussion of challenges of experimentation in research and in the classroom, and a selection of tutorials giving participants hands on experience using GENI.  Broader Impacts: Nearly 10,000 researchers, educators, and students have now used GENI for their research and in their classrooms.  This first GENI Regional Workshop was attended by 76, of whom about half were new to GENI.  Such workshops help broaden the participation of educators and researchers in GENI, expanding and strengthening its community. These events are an important outreach opportunity for educators and researchers. It grows and strengthens the GENI community, which further advances global competitiveness of the United States, contributing towards NSF and national research priorities.
