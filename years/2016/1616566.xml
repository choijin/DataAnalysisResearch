<AbstractNarration>Part 1&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Binary supermassive black holes (SMBHs) should be an inevitable consequence of the growth of massive galaxies through mergers, and the strongest source of gravitational waves in the universe. However, observational evidence for this fundamental phase of changes in galaxy and black hole has remained hard to find due to the small orbital separations of gravitationally bound SMBHs. In this program, the proposers will exploit a theoretically predicted signature of a SMBH binary: periodic changes of the object's brightness over time, caused by a mass accretion rate that is linked to the binary's orbital motion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Part 2&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Theoretical estimates assuming reasonable values for the galaxy merger rates, quasar lifetime, and brightness variations, predict that the recently completed Pan-STARRS1 Medium Deep Survey (PS1 MDS) has the area (80 square degrees), cadence (3 days), baseline (4.2 years), and magnitude sensitivity required to detect a significant number of periodic quasars during the phase of their binary SMBHs's orbital decay cause by gravity waves. In this project the PIs will analyze all 10 PS1 MDS fields, including over 7,000 photometrically-selected quasars. Furthermore, they will exploit the wide area and excellent cadence of the upcoming Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) to use difference imaging to search for active galactic nuclei spatially offset from their host galaxy center, potentially indicative of a recoiling SMBH merger remnant. Both searches will provide benchmark studies for the exciting capabilities of Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST), which will have orders of magnitude larger survey power.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Our NSF AAG program, "The Search for Signatures of Supermassive Black Hole Binaries (and their Recoiling Merger Remnants)", supported two major reearch efforts.  1) The systematic search for periodically varying quasars in the Pan-STARRS1 Medium Deep Survey (PS1) as potential binary supermassive black hole candidates, and 2) the systematic search for offset active galactic nuclei (AGN) in the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) transient alert stream as potential recoiling supermassive black hole candidates.  Both programs relate to the search for the theoretically predicted existence of binary supermassive black holes in the centers of galaxies as a result of the heirarchical build up of galaxies through mergers, and the consequences of the emission of gravitational waves from these systems.  This is a timely topic, in that Pulsar Timing Arrays are close to detecting the gravitational wave-background from merging supermassive black holes in the Universe, and yet we have very few confirmed cases of gravitationally-bound supermassive black holes from electromagnetic signatures.   Our systematic search for periodically varying quasars in PS1 placed important limits on the rate of accreting binary supermassive black holes, as well as used rigorous statistical techniques to test our candidates, as well as candidates from other surveys reported in the literature.  Our search for offset AGN as signatures of recoiling supermassive black holes from the ZTF transient alert stream is yielding several interesting systems, most of which also have intriguing spectroscopic signatures, consistent with the physical picture of an AGN broad-line region traveling at a high velocity with the recoiling supermassive black hole.  Our NSF AAG studies are exciting applications of using optical time domain survey data to probe the demographics of supermassive black holes as they coevolve with their galaxy hosts through cosmic time.
