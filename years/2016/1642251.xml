<AbstractNarration>Computation in all its definitions (Computer Science, Computing, Computational Thinking, etc.) is becoming increasingly significant in STEM and non-STEM disciplines.  Historically, Mathematics has been the discipline seen as required by all other disciplines.  Computer Science faculty are wrestling with determining whether there is a single approach to infusing computation in other disciplines or whether there are many approaches. Coupled with the increased computational ability of students in other disciplines, it is known that interdisciplinary courses are more appealing to underrepresented groups.  Ideally, the Computer Science community would be provided with a set of validated approaches to interdisciplinary education. In order to reach this goal, the community must investigate the educational value of various approaches.  This workshop seeks to begin cataloging experiences to attain that goal.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this collaborative proposal a number of PIs from different college level institutions (research university, technology focused university, four-year engineering college, and four-year liberal arts college) will cooperate on holding a workshop where a number of different approaches to cross-disciplinary education will be investigated.  This workshop will gather a number of faculty who have attempted such courses. The outcome will be a report that outlines approaches to computational interdisciplinary courses.  This report will be made widely available.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The aim of this project was to conduct knowledge-seeking activities towards developing models for partnered teaching of interdisciplinary computer science + discipline X courses at the undergraduate level where X includes a broad set of disciplines, including and, beyond the sciences.  We sought to gather and synthesize knowledge, experiences, and unanswered questions and challenges about preparing and implementing a truly interdisciplinary CS+X course through partnered teaching. The major goals were:  (1) to identify faculty who have designed some flavor of CS+X courses,  (2) to develop and implement a workshop program to bring together these experienced faculty with a set of faculty partners (CS and X) committed to create prototypes to gather knowledge on faculty preparation and resource needs and various models for partnered teaching of CS+X courses, and  (3) to disseminate our gained knowledge and understanding through writing a survey paper based on the workshop discussions and findings.  The PIs we organized a workshop at Olin College of Engineering from October 2-3, 2015, where we brought together 24 faculty within and outside Computer Science for facilitated activities focused on various aspects of teaching interdisciplinary courses. Faculty represented a range of different disciplines in addition to Computer Science such as Music, Biology, Chemistry, Law, and Art. The purpose of the workshop was to gather insights from faculty on various aspects of their teaching and pedagogy.  In order to answer our research questions, we asked each attendee to describe their course through two lenses: the student experience and the faculty experience.  We collected the student experience and faculty experience data through poster templates that attendees filled out at the workshop. The templates served to both organize the participants? responses along relevant dimensions, and provided an artifact that could be shared with other participants during the workshop.    With the data collected, we wrote and submitted a paper as a report of the findings from the collective experience and discussions at the workshop.  The paper titled "How do faculty partner while teaching interdisciplinary CS+X courses: models and experiences" was accepted at Consortium for Computing Sciences in Colleges &mdash; Northeastern Region (CCSCNE 2017), and subsequently published in the Journal for Computing Sciences in Colleges, Volume 32 Issue 6, June 2017 ,Pages 24-33 .   The workshop was an opportunity for college and university faculty to learn more about the various models of CS+X interdisciplinary courses that faculty have employed while partnering with a range of disciplines. The workshop intentionally also provided space to discuss how interested parties can create and support a "community of practice" that would deepen these discussions.   We already know of two instances where the workshop helped stimulate future work in this direction:  1) Two workshop participants (one from CS and another from law) were inspired to submit an NSF proposal to design an introductory CS+law course, that they subsequently taught.   2) Another workshop participant (a CS faculty member) was inspired to think about designing a "bridge course" experience between an introductory computing course and discipline-specific computing, so students from other disciplines have more experience and confidence in applying computing to their disciplines. This participant also submitted an NSF proposal to design a "CS for Insight" course which was offered at their institution.
