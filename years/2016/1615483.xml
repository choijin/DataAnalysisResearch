<AbstractNarration>Galaxies are collections of stars, gas, dust, and dark matter, all held together by gravity.  It is nearly 100 years since American Astronomer Edwin Hubble first showed that galaxies are island universes, containing of billions of stars.  The investigators seek to understand how galaxies form and change over time. Their goal is identifying the star formation processes that produced the wide variety of galaxies observed.  The investigators have selected for special study a set of nearby, gas-rich, galaxies.  These galaxies were found with the Arecibo radio telescope.  These galaxies contain large amounts of neutral hydrogen (HI) gas, the raw ingredient of new generations of stars.  Furthermore, graduate and undergraduate students who work on the project will receive professional development and training in scientific research, technical and mathematical methods, image processing and analysis, and computer programming.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ALFALFA survey is a HI survey aimed at constructing a statistically-complete census of neutral hydrogen gas in the local universe. ALFALFA covers 7000 square degrees of sky and has cataloged 30,000 objects.  This project aims to measure the optical properties of two specific types of ALFALFA sources: Ultra-Compact High Velocity Clouds (UCHVCs), which are neutral hydrogen gas clouds with properties that make them good candidates for nearby low-mass galaxies, and "Almost-Dark" galaxies, which are HI sources with a wider range of possible distances and masses.  Both classes of objects have no clear optical counterpart in existing catalogs, so the objective is to detect and characterize the optical emission from these objects in order to better understand their properties and evolutionary state. To accomplish this objective, the investigator and her students will obtain and analyze deep, wide-field, optical imaging with the WIYN 3.5-meter telescope and One Degree Imager (ODI) of a well-defined sample of UCHVCs and Almost-Dark galaxies chosen from ALFALFA.  The observations will be used to investigate the properties of the UCHVC and Almost-Dark samples and address important questions about how galaxies with neutral gas form and evolve. These questions include: What implications do the UCHVCs have for the ``missing satellites problem''?  What fraction of the UCHVCs have detectable stellar populations?  Are there correlations between the galaxies' environments and locations within the Local Volume and their properties (e.g., the presence or absence of ongoing star formation, their evolutionary phase)?  What is the nature of the Almost-Dark galaxies, and how do their properties differ from ``normal'' galaxies in optical catalogs?  What do the Almost-Dark objects reveal about how star formation takes place in galaxies at the extreme end of the HI mass to optical luminosity regime?  The objects in the UCHVCs sample can also be used to help characterize the Baryonic Tully-Fisher Relation down to very low galaxy masses (less than ten million solar masses) and to probe the chemical evolution of the Universe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigator has made major commitments to the support and mentoring of graduate and undergraduate students, and to the training of students in research.  The investigator will also work with consultants at the Indiana University Center for Innovative Teaching and Learning to revise a large introductory astronomy course for non-majors.  The investigator will use the data taken with optical and radio telescopes in a course to pique student's interest, help illustrate the concepts being taught, and show concrete examples of how modern research is done in astronomy.  Finally, the investigator will work on advancing science outreach and education through her membership on the Board of Directors of the Maria Mitchell Association, a non-profit research, education, and outreach organization that promotes the legacy of America's first female professional astronomer.</AbstractNarration>

Of particular importance is understanding the detailed physical processes that occur in the gas and stellar populations in galaxies - for example, tracing how and where star formation happens, how energy injection into the interstellar medium impacts the surrounding galaxy, how galaxies’ environments affect their evolution, and how galaxies’ chemical compositions evolve over time.  This effort is greatly helped by galaxy surveys that aim to produce an accurate census of galaxy populations and properties.     One such survey was the ALFALFA survey, a radio survey carried out with the Arecibo Observatory that identified more than 30,000 objects with detectable neutral hydrogen gas.  Neutral hydrogen is the raw ingredient that must be present in a galaxy in order for new stars to form.  The research project supported by this grant was a systematic study of the stellar properties of two classes of objects discovered by the ALFALFA survey.     The first set of objects are called Ultra-Compact High-Velocity Clouds (UCHVCs).  UCHVCs are hydrogen gas clouds with properties (sizes, masses, velocities) that are consistent with the expected properties of gas-rich, low-mass galaxies in our local galaxy neighborhood, but which have no detected stellar population in existing optical catalogs.  Objects like the UCHVCs are important because they provide valuable tests of cosmological models and help improve our understanding of the links between normal matter and dark matter.  Our group obtained deep optical imaging observations of the UCHVCs with the WIYN 3.5-m Observatory in order to explore their nature and determine whether they have stellar populations embedded in the gas, which would indicate that they are genuine galaxies.  We identified ten UCHVCs that have significant stellar "overdensities" (collections of stars) within, or very close to, the detected gas cloud. We measured the properties of each object and estimated that they have distances ranging from 300 kpc to 2 Mpc and are extremely gas-rich (very high ratio of gas mass to stellar mass). We are now carrying out spectroscopic observations of these objects with larger telescopes, in order to further quantify their properties and determine whether or not they are indeed genuine, previously-hidden galaxies in close proximity to the Milky Way.   The second class of ALFALFA objects we studied are called "Almost-Dark" galaxies.  Almost-Dark galaxies are objects that are located at a range of distances (tens to hundreds of Mpc), have substantial reservoirs of neutral hydrogen gas (often, amounts comparable to a massive spiral galaxy like our own Milky Way), and are either completely missing from existing optical catalogs or show only very faint optical light emission.  Along with our collaborators, our group obtained and analyzed deep images of two dozen Almost-Dark galaxies, combined them with neutral hydrogen maps and measured the gas distributions and optical properties of several sub-samples of these objects.   Studying the detailed properties of the Almost-Dark galaxies has provided important insights into the physical conditions that are required in order for a galaxy to form stars, and helped us to better understand how galaxy formation and evolution proceed in different types of galaxies and in different environments in the Universe.    We also carried out a number of activities that had a broader impact that extended beyond the research itself. For example, the PI mentored several undergraduate and graduate students over the course of the grant period.  In addition to making major contributions to the project, the students gained scientific and technical training and developed and strengthened a variety of valuable skills, such as mathematical and statistical analysis, computer programming, and problem-solving.

As part of the grant activities, we also developed software that creates deep, combined science-ready images from the wide-field imaging camera on WIYN, the One Degree Imager (ODI).  The software is useful not only for analysis of the UCHVC and Almost-Dark galaxy observations, but for a wide variety of science cases and for other WIYN users from the general community.
