<AbstractNarration>Title: Student Travel Support for 30th European Conference on Object Oriented Programming (ECOOP) &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will support student travel to the 30th European Conference on Object Oriented Programming (ECOOP). The conference will be held in Rome, Italy, in July 2016. ECOOP is the premier conference in object-oriented programming languages and software engineering. Supporting student travel to attend professional conferences and workshops is a very important mission of the NSF. This proposal will target women students and students from underrepresented groups and gives priority to US citizens and permanent residents. The broader significance and importance of the grant relate to the need to broaden participation, provide opportunities for students to receive mentoring from leading members of the object-oriented programming and software engineering research communities, and build the next generation of researchers and knowledgeable practitioners in these important research areas. Apart from the conference itself, several satellite workshops have been arranged, with an impressive array of speakers, many of whom are leading researchers in their areas of expertise. Thus students will have the opportunity to learn state-of-the-art methodologies, be exposed to novel techniques, and interact with senior researchers.</AbstractNarration>
