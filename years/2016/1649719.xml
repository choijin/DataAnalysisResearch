<AbstractNarration>This research will improve the understanding of the formation and growth of very small particles in the atmosphere.  This laboratory study will assess the effects of temperature, relative humidity, and the concentrations of gas phase species to the formation and growth rates of small particles. Graduate students will participate in the project and will be exposed to the use of state-of-the-art instrumentation in atmospheric chemistry.  The research will be applicable to improving models that predict the formation of cloud condensation nuclei in the atmosphere.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is organized around three major themes: sulfuric acid nucleation and growth, biogenic new particle formation (NPF) particularly the role of isoprene, and the role of specific oxidants in NPF.  The following scientific questions will be addressed: (1) How do temperature and RH affect sulfuric acid nucleation rates, especially under conditions such as high temperature and/or RH where ambient NPF is unlikely to be observed? (2) What are the roles of amines and ammonia in particle formation and growth, particularly with regard to particle acidity? (3) How are growth rates in the 2-10 nm size range affected by the types of growth vapors present, especially condensing vs. partitioning organic species? (4) What is the role of isoprene in biogenic nucleation and growth ? does it suppress the NPF process? (5) What are the effects of photochemical and oxidation processes on biogenic NPF, especially the role of low vs. high NOx mixing ratios?</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit  The scientific problem this project addresses is the limited ability of regional and global atmospheric models to predict the impact of new particle formation (NPF) on climate, that is how particles are formed in the atmosphere and how efficiently they grow to become seeds for cloud droplet formation.  Experiments were performed with a dual flow-tube assembly consisting of a nucleation flow tube developed at the University of Alabama, Huntsville and a growth flow tube developed at the University of Delaware.  The two flow tubes could be used in tandem or individually, depending on the specific aspect of particle nucleation and growth being studied.  Experiments were directed toward 1) dependence of temperature and relative humidity on particle nucleation by sulfuric acid, especially under conditions relevant the free troposphere, 2) how these newly formed particles may or may not survive when they are transported downward into the boundary layer, and 3) how quickly these particles grow in the boundary layer when they are exposed to biogenic (monoterpenes) and/or anthropogenic (sulfur dioxide) gases.  The results give insight into nucleation and growth processes that are not fully incorporated into current atmospheric models, and as such they may assist the development of improved models in the future.     Broader Impact  At the University of Delaware, this project supported in part the dissertation research of six Ph.D. students in analytical and physical chemistry.  These students are broadly trained and capable of pursuing a career in areas such as environmental chemistry, industrial analytical chemistry, instrumentation, nanoscience, homeland security, or academia.  Two of the six students graduated during the project period, one is about to graduate, and the other three are newer students still engaged in dissertation research.  The three graduating students moved directly into full time positions with U.S. companies upon graduation.  This project required all six students to work collaboratively with engineering students at the University of Alabama, Huntsville, which significantly sharpened their ability to work with others from different STEM backgrounds.
