<AbstractNarration>The climate in southern Greenland is a key area for reconstructions of the North Atlantic Oscillation, a major pattern of northern hemisphere climate, and is also linked to Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation changes, an important oceanic process controlling north Atlantic climate, which recent studies suggest has been weaker over recent decades than at any time in the last 1000 years.  This is also the region where Norse settlements were abandoned by the early-15th century; many questions still remain about the causative factors. Although climate change is often cited as the reason for settlement failure, this explanation rests on a very poorly constrained scientific foundation and other explanations have also been proposed.   Inferences about climatic conditions in the region often have been derived from far distant sources, generally at high elevations on the Greenland Ice Sheet, where climatic conditions are completely different.  This project will produce records with multidecadal (15-25 year) resolution from the study region, spanning the last 1500-2000 years.  This will be accomplished using new organic geochemical techniques and will contribute to the calibration and understanding of these methodologies.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will partially support a productive young scientist during the formative years of her career.  It will also provide support for the training of a graduate student.  The principal investigators (PIs) will contribute to a University of Massachusetts summer program designed to engage 12 to 18 year old girls, most from under-represented or low income groups, in STEM fields.  The PIs and the supported graduate student will participate in university-sponsored middle and high school teacher training programs.  Finally, undergraduate honors students often participate in the activities of co-PI's lab.  She expects that a number of honors theses and senior projects will result from the research associated with this project.  All of this contributes to development of the nation's STEM workforce.  The project will continue an established international collaboration with French scientists.  The disappearance of the Norse communities in Greenland and its potential linkage to climate change have significant human interest upon which the PIs propose to capitalize.  Their proposed outreach activities include composing articles for popular science magazines and development of a project web site.  It is also anticipated that the PI will continue his productive interactions with the local media, both print and electronic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will generate new high resolution, quantitative records of temperature and hydrology for the past 2,000 years from lakes in coastal regions of southern and southwestern Greenland, an area that has important links to the broader climate dynamics of the North Atlantic.  It also will shed light on climatic fluctuations during the period of Norse settlement in the region. Novel organic geochemical techniques will be used for past temperature reconstruction (branched glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers) and for estimates of changes in evaporation (leaf wax deuterium isotopes) over time.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Norse (Viking) settlers established the Eastern Settlement of southern Greenland in 985 AD and the last documented evidence for their presence there was in the early 15th century. While there is some evidence the area was rapidly abandoned, the question of&nbsp;&nbsp;?Why?? remains actively debated. One popular hypothesis suggests that colder temperatures led to the settlement being abandoned, yet there are no temperature reconstructions available from the inner settlement region itself. To address that, we reconstructed the temperature history using organic compounds produced by temperature-sensitive organisms. These compounds accumulated in sediments at the bottom of a lake adjacent to a former Norse farm. By taking a core of sediment from the lake, we obtained a record going back in time over the last 1500 years.&nbsp;&nbsp;We found that there was&nbsp;no abrupt temperature change during the settlement period.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, using another compound, we found that the region was relatively wet prior to the arrival of the Norse settlers, but then a persistent drying trend set in. A drier environment would have significantly reduced summer grass production, the critical food source that the Norse farmers needed in order to over-wintering their livestock. The drying trend parallels a change in the Norse diet from one based on terrestrial animals to one that relied more on sea mammals. An inability to manage the increasingly dry conditions would have hampered the resilience of the community, possibly leading to instability and eventual abandonment. We conclude that, if climate played a role in the demise of the Norse settlements, it was probably more related to the increasingly dry conditions rather than minor changes in temperature.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 05/04/2021<br>      Modified by: Raymond&nbsp;S&nbsp;Bradley</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1602973/1602973_10418495_1620157206938_IMG_0080--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1602973/1602973_10418495_1620157206938_IMG_0080--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Sediment core being recovered"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1602973/1602973_10418495_1620157206938_IMG_0080--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Sediment core being recovered"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">A core of sediment is retrieved from a lake in southern Greenland</div> <div class="imageCredit">Raymond Bradley</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Raymond&nbsp;S&nbsp;Bradley</div> <div class="imageTitle">Sediment core being recovered</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1602973/1602973_10418495_1620157058077_IMG_1357--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1602973/1602973_10418495_1620157058077_IMG_1357--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Lake 578"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1602973/1602973_10418495_1620157058077_IMG_1357--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Lake 578"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Lake 578 where a Norse farm was established 1000 years ago, and where a sediment core was recovered to study past changes in the climate</div> <div class="imageCredit">Raymond Bradley</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Raymond&nbsp;S&nbsp;Bradley</div> <div class="imageTitle">Lake 578</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
