<AbstractNarration>Amphibians around the world are disappearing at an alarming rate. Many recent declines have been caused by a deadly chytrid fungus called Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd). Bd has recently spread around the world and infects hundreds of amphibian species. This project focuses on understanding the interaction between the Bd pathogen and its amphibian hosts. Specifically the investigators will learn 1) why some amphibian species are devastated by Bd while others are not harmed and 2) why some strains of Bd are more deadly than others. The investigators will conduct an integrative and worldwide study of numerous Bd isolates and a diversity of frog species. Results from this project will help guide conservation efforts be targeted to the most vulnerable species and to areas where Bd will have the most devastating impact. Further the general understanding of host-pathogen interactions resulting from this project can be applied to other systems where wildlife are threatened with new emerging diseases. The project also provides training opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students, with a focus on broadening participation of underrepresented groups. In addition to scientific research, the project will provides education about biodiversity and conservation to the public and local public elementary school children through popular press publications, museum exhibits, and an outreach event called "Save the Frogs Day". &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The researchers in this project have taken genetic, genomic, immunological, and organismal approaches to accomplish their objectives. First, they will use a comparative approach to identify genomic variations in 60 Bd isolates gathered from around the world that vary in infectivity towards various amphibian hosts. Second, they will study variations in in vitro growth phenotypes that they propose directly relate to infectivity. Last, they will examine in vivo and cell culture-based phenotypes, in parallel with host tissue profiling. A key aspect of the third goal is that the applicants have selected 6 congeneric amphibian host pairs (2 species in each of three different genera) that vary in susceptibility to Bd. They will utilize Illumina-based sequencing techniques to obtain genome-wide association studies of the phenotypes of interest. In vivo infection phenotypes such as Bd burden under the common garden conditions tested will be coupled with transcriptomic analysis of host gene expression to evaluate differential responses by susceptible/tolerant hosts. To address this important problem, the investigators have blended evolutionary, ecological and physiological perspectives and this integrative approach promises to bring new insight into this field.</AbstractNarration>

Understanding the biology of the interactions between hosts and pathogens is increasingly important as EIDs increase and rise to the forefront of global concerns. This research focuses on resolving key questions in the infectious disease known as "chytridiomycosis". Chytridiomycosis is a highly lethal fungal disease of amphibians. The pathogen that causes the disease, known as&nbsp;<em>Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis,</em>or&nbsp;<em>"</em>Bd", infects the skin of amphibians and causes death. However, not all strains of Bd are equally lethal. This research investigated how multiple strains of the pathogen differed across geographic origin, over time, and in response to temperature conditions. The project demonstrated that Bd strains from a variety of geographic regions and host species differed in their responses to temperature conditions. In addition, this research showed that if you compare Bd strains that were collected from the same location (e.g., from amphibian sites in Panama), but from different time points, there are no significant differences, suggesting that Bd is just as lethal today as it was over a decade ago. These findings are important because they reveal how infectious disease systems operate in different environments and over time. Furthermore, the results are relevant for helping us predict, and respond to, other emerging pathogens that impact plants, wildlife, and in humans.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The research for this project has broad relevance for the conservation and management of amphibian biodiversity. The investigators worked extensively with conservation agencies (e.g., local governments, aquariums, zoos, and conservation organizations) to generate disease-specific management plans for amphibians. For example, the investigators work collaboratively on scientific advisory boards for Project Golden Frog, a project that aims to reintroduce golden frogs from captive breeding programs back into the wild in Panama. By working with these groups, the investigators' goal was to provide the most accurate and timely scientific information that will help optimize amphibian reintroduction strategies. Thus, the outreach from this project provides science-based conservation recommendations for frogs in this region while also serving as an example for amphibian species that are threatened by disease all around the world.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 09/30/2018<br>      Modified by: Jamie&nbsp;Voyles</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1603808/1603808_10306058_1538329748462_121022_02Pcruentusdead9copy--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1603808/1603808_10306058_1538329748462_121022_02Pcruentusdead9copy--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Frog death due to the disease chytridiomycosis"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1603808/1603808_10306058_1538329748462_121022_02Pcruentusdead9copy--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Frog death due to the disease chytridiomycosis"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Amphibians around the world are threatened by the disease chytridiomycosis, a skin disease that causes death in a wide range of species.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Jamie Voyles</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Jamie&nbsp;Voyles</div> <div class="imageTitle">Frog death due to the disease chytridiomycosis</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1603808/1603808_10306058_1538330020379_fieldwork_JLV--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1603808/1603808_10306058_1538330020379_fieldwork_JLV--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Graduate students at work where amphibian declines occurred."><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1603808/1603808_10306058_1538330020379_fieldwork_JLV--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Graduate students at work where amphibian declines occurred."></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Graduate students collect environmental data relevant for pathogen isolation and laboratory experiments.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Jamie Voyles</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Public Domain</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Jamie&nbsp;Voyles</div> <div class="imageTitle">Graduate students at work where amphibian declines occurred.</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1603808/1603808_10306058_1538330146661_Kidsmeetkermit(1)--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1603808/1603808_10306058_1538330146661_Kidsmeetkermit(1)--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Save the Frogs Day events in Reno, Nevada"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1603808/1603808_10306058_1538330146661_Kidsmeetkermit(1)--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Save the Frogs Day events in Reno, Nevada"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Kids meet Kermit at an annual event for "Save the Frogs" Day in Reno, Nevada.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Tiffany May</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Public Domain</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Jamie&nbsp;Voyles</div> <div class="imageTitle">Save the Frogs Day events in Reno, Nevada</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
