<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is the development of new tools to understand the dynamic behavior of cellular machinery that is disrupted in disease. Unraveling the dynamic aspects of cellular physiology that may be targeted therapeutically requires new technologies capable of profiling the response of entire signaling pathways to pharmacological intervention targeted at single pathway nodes. The availability of physiologically relevant live-cell models that are compatible with visualizing and quantifying the spatiotemporal regulation of disease-relevant signal transduction pathways and cellular machinery will be key to enabling this approach.  The ability to monitor multiple facets of key cancer signaling pathways in this way represents a valuable opportunity to identify potent and selective therapeutic inhibitors of "undruggable" targets, such as the Ras protein, which is a crucial driver of more than 30% of cancers. By enabling development of a robust and scalable high-throughput live-cell assay platform, this technology may reduce the time and cost to pinpoint the mechanism of action and off-target effects of pharmaceutical chemicals, thus delivering new capabilities to rapidly and cost-effectively identify safe and effective therapeutics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This SBIR Phase II project will develop a robust and flexible platform for rapid generation of precision-engineered, multicolor fluorescent cell lines and associated high-throughput microscopy-based assays. This platform contrasts with industry standard methods for developing such cell lines and assays, which are lengthy and inflexible.  The project comprises optimization and execution of four components:  1) Generation of a panel of cell lines compatible with rapid, reliable stable reporter integration; 2) Delivery of a library of approximately 25 multicolor reporters of the Ras/MAPK pathway; 3) Rapid generation and validation of a library of  approximately 100 validated stable reporter cell lines expressing all therapeutically relevant mutations and isoforms of the Ras/MAPK pathway;  and 4) 384-well plate assay development and screening of these Ras/MAPK reporter cells using tool compounds. The project aims to demonstrate the capability of the platform to rapidly pinpoint compound mechanism of action and potential off-target effects by monitoring multiple facets of previously inaccessible biology associated with a critical, high-value oncology target in live cells. The standardized platform established in the course of this project will allow rapid expansion to additional clinically relevant signaling pathways.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The overarching goal of this SBIR Phase II project is delivery of a ?plug-and-play? cell line engineering platform to enable scalable generation of isogenic,multicolor live cell reporter libraries compatible with high-throughput microscopy profiling of complex disease phenotypes and signal transduction pathways. Such a platform will enable interrogation of the molecular and phenotypic basis of disease in live cells at scale to guide the discovery of new medicines.  In the course of our project, we successfully established and optimized a robust cell line engineering platform that enables rapid precision engineering and visualization of multicomponent cellular networks in live cells.  We focused our work demonstrating platform proof of concept in the context of the Ras/MAPK and DNA Damage Response signaling pathways that are implicated in cancer progression.  We demonstrated the improved speed and flexibility of our system by delivering a library of 23 different Ras/MAPK reporter cell lines. In the course of our workestablished novel, robust standardized protocols for reporter cell line production and characterization and demonstrated their extension to an additional DNA Damage related signaling pathway.   In summary, our project enabled us to make key technology advances that are critically enabling for Cairn Biosciences' plans to leverage our tools in support of cancer drug discovery.  Our project has also delivered broader societal impact by enabling more accurate profiling of a high-value cancer signaling pathway by enabling visualizing of dynamic pathway changes in disease-relevant living cells.
