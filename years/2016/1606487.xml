<AbstractNarration>This award is made as part of the FY 2016 Mathematical Sciences Postdoctoral Research Fellowships Program. Each of the fellowships supports a research and training project at a host institution in the mathematical sciences, including applications to other disciplines, under the mentorship of a sponsoring scientist. The title of the project for this fellowship to Kaitlyn Hood is Singularity Solutions for Inertial Hydrodynamics. The host institution for the fellowship is MIT, and the sponsoring scientist is Anette Hosoi.</AbstractNarration>
