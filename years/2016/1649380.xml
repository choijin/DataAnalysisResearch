<AbstractNarration>The Bay Area Regional Collaboration to Expand and Strengthen STEM (RECESS) is a regional, unified STEM continuum effort from preschool through graduate school and career. RECESS is based on successful collective impact efforts in other fields and employs a participatory action research (PAR) approach to broaden participation in STEM. In the PAR framework, youth and their families will help to define the issues and develop expertise about community needs through a shared research process.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;RECESS introduces participatory action research as an innovative element to the collective impact social agency framework. The intent is to determine the extent to which the engagement and involvement of the students and communities targeted can effectively shape the function of the collective impact network of organizations.&lt;br/&gt;During the two year planning phase, RECESS (a) conducts a comprehensive needs assessment and gap analysis; (b) establishes a functioning organization of stakeholders with a common agenda and governance model; and (c) develops a detailed action plan. It is a significant contribution to the body of knowledge on effective and innovative collective impact structures designed to promote STEM education and participation.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  While the Bay Area is one of the most diverse regions in the nation and an international hub for STEAM innovation, there remains a huge gap in the number of underrepresented students entering into STEAM fields. The challenges these students face reflect a flawed system in which people of color are inadequately supported in STEAM education and careers. Historically underrepresented students face a plethora of financial, systemic, and social obstacles that hinder their progress across the educational continuum. The roots of these disparities begin in preschool and are exacerbated by a complex web of structural barriers that continue through college and employment. Without access to educational resources, mentors, financial support and other resources, many underrepresented students face daunting obstacles in their pursuit of STEAM careers.    STEAM EQ (formerly RECESS) seeks to disrupt the interpersonal and systemic barriers that prevent underrepresented students from entering into and excelling in Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts and Math (STEAM) education and careers and broaden participation in STEAM by aligning successful programs and practices, increasing persistence and expanding participation across the Bay Area. STEAM EQ also connects regional and local efforts in ways that collectively address the complexity of systems change needed to increase equity in STEAM education and careers.  The STEAM EQ project succeeded in accomplishing its primary objectives which are as follows: build the will within the community to address broadening participation challenges in STEAM; establish a Leadership Roundtable to serve as the convener and facilitator of partners; expand STEAM learning opportunities and enhanced access to courses, develop and implement an open communications platform to support the spread of effective practices; draft a community plan that includes a common agenda and shared measurement; agree on a governance model for plan implementation; and raise funds and engage new partners to implement STEAM EQ strategy and plan.    Phase one of the project focused primarily on building a common community agenda through a multi-step community and stakeholder engagement process, which is one of the most fundamental and important components of successful community change efforts requiring collective impact. In phase two, major activities focused on aligning successful programs and resources, mapping the system of Bay Area regional stakeholders, identifying service gaps and duplication of effort, committing to a common plan of action, establishing the optimal organizational and governance model to support STEAM EQ as we transitioned from planning to implementation, and identifying common points of data collection. In the final phase, we focused on on fleshing out and implementing our Community Action Plan through the development of tactical plans targeted to each developmental group cradle to career to drive broadening participation results. Additionally, we solidified cross-sector partnerships with over 100 key stakeholders across the Bay Area and formed a high functioning and sustainable governance model for STEAM EQ, including the important milestone of establishing Alignment Bay Area, our backbone organization, as its own 501(c)3 organization.    Through these efforts to broaden participation in STEAM, we hope to open a tremendous untapped pool of talent and provide mid- and high- wage jobs to groups of individuals traditionally excluded from the STEAM workforce and reduce cycles of poverty for underrepresented communities in our two counties.
