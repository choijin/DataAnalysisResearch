<AbstractNarration>Abstract Title: Charge transport in hybrid organic-inorganic halide perovskites&lt;br/&gt;Non-technical:&lt;br/&gt;Hybrid organic-inorganic trihalide perovskites have emerged as one of the most promising contenders for large scale photovoltaic energy generation. These materials exhibit a remarkable set of properties, coupled with low production cost, which led to an avalanche of research on this topic and a commendable growth. Unlike most mature technologies, however, the innovation witnessed in the field outstripped our understanding of basic these materials properties. In addition, the hybrid perovskites contain lead, which represent an environmental hazard, precluding their incorporation in future applications. This project is a collaborative effort between a research group at Wake Forest University with expertise in device fabrication and electrical characterization and a group at University of Utah with knowledge on materials growth, optical and magnetic field effect measurements. The research will focus on the investigation of the electronic processes that limit the operation and stability of hybrid perovskite-based devices; designing and implementing device structures that promote improved performance; and developing lead-free hybrid perovskites. Driven by the anticipated high impact of hybrid perovskite electronics on the US economy and society, this interdisciplinary research program will integrate education by implementing a strong teaching and mentoring component that complements all stages of the research efforts. &lt;br/&gt;Technical:&lt;br/&gt;The research will focus on novel hybrid organic-inorganic perovskites (HTP) single crystals and thin-film growth, structural, optical and electrical characterization, device design, fabrication, and characterization with the following objectives: (i) develop Pb-free hybrid perovskites; (ii) understand the mechanism of charge transport in hybrid perovskite materials; (iii) elucidate the coexistence between the electronic and ionic transport and their contribution to HTP device hysteresis, performance, reliability and stability. The project is structured into three phases. The first phase focuses on the study of charge transport in HTPs using time of flight, space-charge-limited current and FET measurements at various temperatures. In the second phase we will focus on the analysis of bulk and surface defect states by performing Poole-Frenkel and density of states analysis. In the third phase the PIs will disentangle the ionic and electronic contributions to the conductivity in HTP devices using Seebeck effect in the dark and under illumination, and impedance spectroscopy. The PIs and their research groups will continue and expand their efforts dedicated to enhancing the growth of the new field of perovskite electronics by organizing conferences, participating in activities at local science museums, and offering research opportunities to students from local community colleges and high schools.</AbstractNarration>

This collaborative project had the overarching goal of gaining a better basic understanding of the nature and dynamics of charge carriers in 3D and 2D hybrid trihalide perovskite-based devices and incorporate them in high performance devices.     Intellectual merit:  Our team consists of two PIs with complementary expertise in the areas of organic and inorganic electronics: Prof. Valy Vardeny at the University of Utah (UofU) and Prof. Oana Jurchescu at Wake Forest University (WFU). In this project, the two PIs have worked together to design and implement experiments that allowed us to elucidate the fundamental properties of charge carriers and excitons in HTPs, establish the potential and limit of the HTP optoelectronic devices, and provide feedback for developing device architectures with superior performance. In fulfilling the goal of this project, we have also trained undergraduate, graduate students and postdoctoral researchers in the fundamental science that governs the HTP device operation in order to be competitive in their future careers.     The most important outcomes are summarized below.  (1)  We developed the first field-effect transistor based on metal halide perovskite that operates at room-temperature;  (2)  We tuned thin film microstructure and demonstrated ambipolar FETs based on perovskite semiconductors with charge carrier mobilities reaching 10 cm2/Vs;  (3)  We fabricated and tested perovskite FETs in all four possible geometries: bottom-gate bottom-contacts, top-gate top-contacts, bottom-gate top-contacts and top-gate bottom-contacts;  (4)  We found that carrier transport in 3D perovskites is dispersive, which makes the determination of carrier mobility difficult;  (5)  Using the technique of electro-absorption, we determined the exciton binding energy in 2D perovskites to be of order of 200 meV;  (6)  We engineered, fabricated and tested modulators in the THz range based on 2D-HTP;  (7)  We measured the two-photon excitation spectra of photoluminescence (PL) and photocurrent (PC) in perovskite single crystals, and mapped defects on the surfaces of thin films;  (8)  We introduced two solvent-free methods for perovskite processing: one involves melt processing, and the other laser printing;  (9)  We developed high performance photodetectors based perovskite/organic semiconductor bilayers, where the photoresponse is enhanced by over 10 times compared to the perovskite only devices;  (10)  We confirmed the existence of Rashba splitting in 2D HTP using the circular photogalvanic effect.     Broader impacts: This interdisciplinary research program provided an excellent opportunity for the two PIs to train undergraduate students, graduate students and postdoctoral researchers, and to integrate the research results into the courses they teach. Activities were carefully planned to teach them responsive research conduct, shape their ability to present results, and cultivate their community engagement.
