<AbstractNarration>Entrepreneurial firms play an important role in employment generation, economic recovery, and bringing innovation to the marketplace. However, the discussion on the role played by the intellectual capital of the workforce employed by entrepreneurial firms has been limited. Is it the case that the entrepreneurs that succeed are different in their stock of intellectual capital and these differences are manifested and rewarded by the market very early on, or is it that their early advantages and location choices enable them to navigate market imperfections and shocks that hinder less lucky establishments? In this project, we study how the skill-level of entrepreneurial firms in the United States has changed over the past decade particularly in response to competitive shocks. The proposed project can inform what types of entrepreneurs succeed, the specific role played by founders' human capital, and how shocks such as increased competition and technological changes affect entrepreneurial firm outcomes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To understand the drivers of the stock of intellectual capital in entrepreneurial firms, we will assemble a longitudinal database on the skill profiles of entrepreneurial firms. The data will be sourced from establishment level micro-data from a panel of large-scale surveys conducted by the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the skills of employees of start-ups and incumbent firms in over 800 occupations in U.S. over 2005-2013. Using over 10 million establishment-occupation level observations, we will address three primary research questions. First, we will identify the change in the composition of skills of entrants over this period, and factors that are associated with these changes. Second, we will identify environmental shocks and their effects on the intellectual capital and competitiveness of entrepreneurial firms. Finally, we will examine the long-term consequences of founding intellectual capital on firms' subsequent intellectual capital and other outcomes.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Our project provides inputs to policymakers addressing a key aspect of U.S. competitiveness in the global economy.  It highlights issues in the start-up infrastructure in the U.S. and points to an important role for policy.  Business press reports highlight the decline of US entrepreneurship with ominous headlines such as "US economy: Decline of the start-up nation" (Fleming, S (2016) "US economy: Decline of the start-up nation", Financial Times, 4 August 2016), "Why America stopped being a start-up nation" (Smith, N. "Why America stopped being a startup nation", Bloomberg, 20 January 2016), and "A start-up slump is a drag on the economy" (Casselman, B "A start-up slump is a drag on the economy", New York Times, 20 September 2017).  And indeed, academic research has shown that, indeed, firm start-up rates have been in decline from the early. This is a matter of concern because young firms are believed to be the engines of growth and job creation in the economy.  Largely missing from the discussion is an evaluation of whether the decline in entrepreneurship rates is accompanied by a change in the skill type of entrepreneurs, and whether this has long-term consequences. In our work we focus specifically on the skillsets of entrepreneurial firms with five or more employees, and how they have changed through time. Using over 3 million establishment-occupation-level observations from the BLS, we address the following questions:  How have entry rates and the quality of entrepreneurship changed in manufacturing? Has there been a decline in high-skilled versus low-skilled entrepreneurs, or are entrepreneurship levels declining across all skill types? Are there long-term consequences of initial skill at entry &ndash; both in the growth rates of entrants and in their subsequent intellectual capital? How do entrants’ human capital and growth change in response to competitive trade shocks? How do entrants and incumbents compare in their response?   We show that over the 2005-2013 period, there was a decline not only in the number of new businesses in US manufacturing, but also in their size and quality, measured by the tasks which their workforce performs.  New firms are, on average, performing a higher proportion of routine manual tasks and a lower proportion of tasks that require high cognitive skills, such as complex problem solving. Incumbent firms do not show the same decline in average skills. We obtain similar differences with locational and industry controls in our preferred regression models. What is more, the differences between incumbents and entrants are growing over time. This has significant long-term consequences &ndash; we show that the founding stock of human capital in entrants is predictive of their future human capital as well as growth rates over the early life cycle.  The contrast between entrants and incumbents is most stark in their reactions to a competitive threat from Chinese imports. However, while these competitive effects on skills are economically significant, the skill differential between entrants and incumbents would exist even with a total cessation in imports. Thus, the decline in entrepreneurial quality in US manufacturing is only partially responsive to the level of Chinese imports into the country.  At first glance, one might be tempted to view the drop in perceived quality of entrants as a consequence of new technologies adopted by entrants optimally requiring a less-skilled workforce. While we cannot rule this out, it is unlikely to be the case given that new establishments created by incumbent firms, which are likely to be better funded and able to acquire new technologies, do not show similar deskilling.  Our findings are consistent with technological polarisation, whereby incumbent firms upgrade their human capital, and entrepreneurial firms are finding investment opportunities in niches employing less skilled labour. One ray of sunshine is that the polarisation is much less evident in high tech industries.
