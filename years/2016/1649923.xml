<AbstractNarration>Obtaining a "connectome" or map of the wiring of the brain is crucial to understanding brain structure and function, and has been set as long-term goals of several international government-funded initiatives due to the potential benefits for improving health, treating brain diseases, and understanding development. As technologies for sample preparation and microscopy advance, it is becoming feasible to image large sections of brain tissue. However, the vast quantities of data produced with these techniques is far outpacing the ability of neuroscientists to analyze the data. This project will address the data analysis challenge by developing new computational software tools that facilitate use of advanced computing for connectomics studies, in alignment with NSF's mission to promote the progress of science and advance national health, prosperity and welfare.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Understanding the microarchitecture and neuronal morphologies that comprise neural circuitry in the brain is crucial to understanding brain function. This EAGER project aims to build the computational and data infrastructure that is necessary to manage and process large microscopy imaging data sets for connectomics studies, bringing High Performance Computing (HPC) resources into the neuroscience workflow. The project will employ a data model that enables scientists to visualize, interact with, and process data of any size that is stored in any remote location, from USB drives to high-performance parallel file systems. The software infrastructure will furthermore enable automatic mapping of analysis procedures designed by neuroscientists to remote HPC systems. The system will leverage state-of-the-art tools and practices developed in the HPC community, and aims to result in greatly accelerated studies of connectivity in the brain at scale.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Early-concept Grants for Exploratory Research (EAGER) award by the CISE Division of Advanced Cyberinfrastructure is jointly supported by the CISE Division of Information and Intelligent Systems, with funds associated with the NSF Understanding the Brain, BRAIN Initiative activities, and for developing national research infrastructure for neuroscience. This project also aligns with NSF objectives under the National Strategic Computing Initiative.</AbstractNarration>

The software infrastructure that we have demonstrated includes tools for automated ingestion of data coming off a microscope, tools for moving, storing, and accessing data either from remote or local resources, a parallel computing infrastructure allowing processing, alignment, and automated neuron extraction, with each stage connected to remote visualization and interaction software.  With this work we advanced the parallel computing infrastructure connected to the data capture with a new data-flow mapping layer of the software infrastructure, that enables a user to deploy analysis algorithms at scale. This has been deployed as a new scalable runtime system that automates mapping analysis algorithms to different computational hardware, depending on availability, reducing the complexity of developing scaling algorithms that are system-specific. In this new model, data dependencies are encoded in the algorithm, and the system uses these dependencies to generate an execution graph which is mapped to processors of an HPC system, using some underlying runtime. We have mapped some preliminary algorithms to this system. Three versions of the runtime were tested, where the graph was mapped to MPI communicators, Charm++ and Legion.   In addition, we developed a new python software layer that interfaces the OpenViSUS framework with a set of user-defined processing components that can perform operations on the data either interactively or on dedicated computational resources (i.e. local or remote). This framework was deployed as a parallel library that allows fast and simple implementation of visualization and analytic workflows. This abstraction layer introduces two main improvements over prior approaches:   the user does not need knowledge of parallel computing techniques, the underlying communication or threading managed by the runtime;   the same task graph can be executed both locally and remotely via a common interface for interactive processing on smaller desktop-class systems and also at scale on remote HPC systems for larger data or compute-intensive tasks.   We demonstrated the usability, scalability, and performance of our system on three different neuroscience use cases using large-scale non-human primate (NHP) brain 3D microscopy: (1) image processing to improve quality, (2) image stack registration to create a unified view of massive data, and (3) semi-automated neuron tracing using topological features.  In all cases, the results validated the ability to achieve unprecedented scalability in using parallel computing resources for neuroscience applications while making the technology available to scientists who are not HPC experts.
