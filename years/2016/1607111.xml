<AbstractNarration>Synthetic biology holds great promise as a scientific discipline that can answer fundamental biological questions as well as contribute to many practical applications. A key obstacle for this field is the concern about escape of an engineered organism into the environment.  To address this and other concerns, this research consortium that engages  researchers in the US, UK, France and Spain will engineer an independently replicating element (called an episome, which is not integrated into the DNA of the host cell) that consists of non-natural nucleic acids. These episomes will have genetic material based on TNA (threose-based nucleic acid) along with a system that replicates and expresses proteins from the episome. An autonomous TNA-based episome could not be propagated in nature (outside the laboratory)  because TNA precursors do not occur naturally.  The consortium of investigators each will develop specific components to be incorporated into the TNA episome, which will be transferred into a bacterial host. The research project, while high risk, is anticipated to generate high impacts in terms of providing enabling technologies to advance a synthetic biology-inspired bioeconomy. It will also generate insights into the evolution of genetic material. The training potential of this project is exceptional in that the students and junior researchers will gain valuable transdisciplinary and international training.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is to re-structure the central dogma of molecular biology by developing an all-TNA episome based on bacteriophage Phi29 that can replicate in vitro and eventually inside living cells using an orthogonal cellular machinery engineered for this purpose. The engineered system will store protein-coding information in TNA polymers that will replicate independently of the cellular genome. The TNA coding information will be transcribed by an evolved RNA polymerase that can recognize the TNA template and produce natural messenger RNAs for translation into functional proteins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is funded through a transnational funding mechanism between the United States National Science Foundation and European Funding Agencies that are part of the European Commission endorsed Research Area Network in Synthetic Biology. The United States component of this project is co-funded by programs in Systems and Synthetic Biology (Directorate for Biological Sciences) and Biotechnology and Biochemical Bioengineering (Directorate for Engineering).</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This NSF grant was part of the ERA SynBio Program, an international collaboration established to support basic and applied research in the rapidly growing field of synthetic biology. The consortium included the Chaput laboratory at the University of California, Irvine (funded through the NSF) and European collaborators in the UK, Spain, and France (each funded through institutions in their home country). The intellectual merit of this collaborative project was to mimic nature by establishing the enzymes, reagents, and tools necessary to store genetic information in nucleic acid polymers that are synthetic analogs of DNA. Our contributions to the project involved using organic chemistry to synthesize the building blocks (A,C,T,G) for threose nucleic acid (TNA), which is an unnatural genetic polymer created in the laboratory. TNA is a synthetic analog of DNA that is currently being explored as a new type of genetic material for synthetic biology. A second contribution from the UCI team involved developing polymerases that could copy genetic information back and forth between TNA and DNA, thus allowing the transfer of genetic information from natural to synthetic polymers. Both of these objectives were met, and our findings resulted in 17 publications in leading scientific journals. Beyond science and technology, the proposal also resulted in significant broader impact. Funding for this award provided partial support for 10 undergraduate students, 4 graduate students, and 3 postdoctoral students that acquired valuable skills in synthetic biology. These students received significant training in scientific writing and oral presentations, which provides lifelong skills that will allow the students to be successful in their own chosen careers. All of the students associated with this project presented their findings at local, national, and international conferences, including ACS National Meetings and an International Roundtable meeting on Nucleosides, Nucleotides, and Nucleic acids. These opportunities allowed students to network with colleagues in their field, which is critical for career development. In addition, the PI was actively involved in public discussions on synthetic biology, which included serving as a panel member for several open forums on the challenges and opportunities of using artificial genetic polymers in synthetic biology. He is also an active member of the UCI Minority Science Program, which supports the development of underrepresented minorities in the biomedical sciences. Last, many of the students associated with this grant have gone onto successful careers in industry or were accepted into PhD programs at prestigious institutions, including Stanford University and the University of California, San Francisco. This last point demonstrates the success of our student training efforts toward maintaining a productive workforce.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 09/04/2019<br>      Modified by: John&nbsp;Chaput</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
