<AbstractNarration>1604314&lt;br/&gt;Miller, Cass T.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The use of hydraulic fracturing has allowed for the extraction of natural gas from previously inaccessible sources; however, hydraulic fracturing has also raised concerns due to the potential for contamination from migration of fluids from injection sites. The objective of the proposed project is to improve understanding of the physicochemical processes associated with the transport of hydraulic fracturing fluids through porous media and fractured media. This approach will allow a more detailed assessment of the potential adverse effects to the environment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI will investigate the relationship between fluid composition and physical properties, sorption of hydraulic fracturing chemicals to solid media (i.e., proppants and shale), and the flow and transport of multicomponent, non-Newtonian fluids in porous and fractured media. Aqueous solutions of common fracturing chemicals will be characterized with respect to density and rheological properties. Batch tests will be conducted to measure the sorption of fracturing chemicals to relevant solid materials. Micro-models will be used to elucidate fluid flow characteristics on the pore/fracture scale. Flushing experiments will be conducted in one- and two-dimensional, homogeneous and heterogeneous systems. Experiments will investigate the pressure-flow rate relationship for non-Newtonian fracturing fluids with a range of fluid compositions, and the transport of individual species within the fluid. Rigorous theoretical models will be developed in conjunction with the experimental work using the thermodynamically constrained averaging theory framework. The experimental portion of the project will provide a comprehensive dataset at relevant temperatures and pressures regarding: (1) the effect of fluid composition on physical properties, (2) the sorption of hydraulic fracturing chemicals on relevant solid media, (3) the flow behavior of multicomponent, non-Newtonian fluids in realistic porous and fractured media systems, and, (4) dispersion of dissolved species in non-Newtonian fluids. The experimental work will be conducted in conjunction with modeling using the thermodynamically constrained averaging theory approach. This method will result in the development of a macroscale model that is consistent with thermodynamic principles, and which allows for explicit identification of subscale processes and relationships between variables of interest. The development of such a model will greatly improve upon the existing state of modeling such systems, direct further experimental and computational work, and provide a consistent framework with which to better probe the fundamental aspects of complex fluid behavior in porous media. The project will disseminate the finding of the research by developing a web site, holding public forums, and participation in the UNCs Institute for the Environment IDEA program. In addition, the PI will: (1) contributions to education through course content, student research, and science outreach; (2) participation of underrepresented researchers and linkages to minority recruitment programs; (3) broad dissemination of findings in environmental engineering, environmental chemistry, and contaminant hydrology journals; (4) digital archiving and dissemination of unique data sets and video images of experiments; and, (5) expanded ties with international collaborators that work on complementary aspects of multiphase systems. In addition, the physical processes and chemical components chosen for this study are common to environmental remediation applications and will improve understanding of all such systems.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Hydraulic fracturing is a commonly used procedure that involves the injection of a solution under high pressure to facilitate the fracturing of tight hydrocarbon-bearing formations, such as shales.  This fracturing operation improves the permeability, or the ease with which the hydrocarbon can be removed from the formation.  The growth in the use of hydraulic fracturing has greatly improved the usable petroleum resources of US and has led to especially large advances in the proven reserves of natural gas. The displacement of coal fired power production with cleaner natural gas has lowered energy prices, and reduced CO2 emissions.       Hydraulic fracturing also poses potential environmental risks, which are not well understood.  These risks result in part from the nature of the composition of the injected fluids.  Understanding these risks requires an understanding of how these mixtures flow and species are transport in the subsurface environment.   An impediment to developing an improved understanding of the flow of hydraulic fracturing fluids, and the transport of species within these fluids, is the non-Newtonian nature of these systems.  Viscosity is a key factor affecting fluid flow and for Newtonian fluids the viscosity depends on temperature and composition, but it does not depend upon the velocity distribution. Air and water are examples of Newtonian fluids.   Common components to hydraulic fracturing fluids render them non-Newtonian, and the viscosity of these fluids also depends upon the distribution of velocity, or the shear rate.  The scientific understanding of non-Newtonian flow through a porous medium consisting of both a connected pore space and solid skeleton, such as fractured rock or sand, is lacking and common approaches for describing such systems are empirical in nature.  These common approaches require measuring an effective viscosity as a function of composition and flow characteristics.  Since an infinite number of such conditions can exist for a given application, empirical estimates are made, and most approaches simply use a Newtonian flow model with varying viscosities.     This work has resolved these longstanding problems.  Using an approach developed by the principal investigator to develop models for complex systems from first principles, which is known as the thermodynamically constrained averaging theory (TCAT), a new approach to describe non-Newtonian flow in porous media was developed. This TCAT approach can describe such flows based upon characteristics of the porous medium and fluid for a wide range of flow conditions. Validation of this approach has been accomplished for a variety of systems, including those published by others and originally analyzed using traditional empirical methods.      Experimental observations of non-Newtonian flow were also made and simulated using two microscale approaches.  This aspect of the work provided methods to describe non-Newtonian flow through porous medium systems from first principles, which can be used to validate our new modeling approach, or any other approach.  Other important advances from this work included the development of a method to characterize the pore structure of a porous medium based upon its non-Newtonian flow behavior, and observations, and modeling, of how individual species in non-Newtonian fluids are transported in porous medium systems.     Broader outcomes from this work also include the presentation of this work to the general public, use of the work in courses, production of data sets for the use by others, and the education of graduate students.
