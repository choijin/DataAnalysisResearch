<AbstractNarration>Over the past decade, the prevalence of children diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has dramatically risen from 1 in 150 to 1 in 68. Such increases in prevalence foretell greater involvement of these children in the legal system. Yet science-based interview protocols for obtaining accurate eyewitness reports, available for typically developing children, do not exist for children with ASD. This study examines the effectiveness of two current child forensic interview protocols at eliciting accurate and complete eyewitness statements from (verbal) youth with and without ASD, and determines individual difference predictors of eyewitness memory performance. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Children, 9- to 18-years-old, with and without ASD, will participate in a documented event and will later be questioned with one of two forensic interview protocols. Analyses will examine components of protocols that aid or impede accurate reports. This study addresses debates about disability, competence, and law. Moreover, it will expand theoretical understanding of ASD (e.g., self-development theory) for scientists and provide needed empirical information for legal professionals and fact finders to facilitate reaching the truth.</AbstractNarration>
