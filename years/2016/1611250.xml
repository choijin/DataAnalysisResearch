<AbstractNarration>Non-technical Abstract&lt;br/&gt;With the support of the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program, this research team will take a multi-disciplinary and international approach to materials chemistry that trains undergraduate students to synthesize and characterize liquid crystals (LCs) in the context of display applications (LCD). Liquid crystalline materials are liquids or soft wax-like substances in which molecules exhibit some degree of ordering and organization; they uniquely combine fluidity of liquids and molecular ordering found in solid crystals. If molecules forming such materials are polar (have a permanent dipole moment), they can undergo realignment in an electric field resulting in switching of optical properties of the material. Such an electro-optical effect is at the heart of modern liquid crystal display industry, which demands improvements in resolution and speed of switching between screen images. This, in turn, motivates the search for new LC materials, such as those investigated in this project. Thus, a team comprised of the principal investigator (PI), co-PI, an international technical expert and undergraduate co-workers design, synthesize and fully characterize new polar liquid crystals derived from boron clusters. Among the main goals of the project is the development of extensive structure-property relationships in this class of materials, preparation of materials for practical applications, and training of undergraduate students for careers in materials chemistry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Abstract&lt;br/&gt;This basic research project tests the hypothesis that rationally-designed zwitterionic derivatives of inorganic boron clusters, [closo-1-CB9H10]- and [closo-1-CB12H12]- anions, form liquid crystalline phases and are suitable materials for display applications. In this context, a series of zwitterions is synthesized and investigated for their spectroscopic, structural, thermal and dielectric properties using a broad selection of research tools. The experimental work is augmented with theoretical methods that allow the researchers to formulate a detailed understanding of structure-property relationships and to explain the observed results. The detailed multi-dimensional analysis of specific derivatives is expected to contribute to the understanding of the impact of the molecular structure on properties, materials performance, and to the fundamental chemistry and science of liquid crystals.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>&nbsp;</p> <p><em>Outcomes</em>. This grant provided support for high-end research and training in materials chemistry at MTSU. The research resulted in seven publications (+1 submitted and 3 more in manuscript form), seven MTSU B. S. degrees, two Honors theses, and one M. S. thesis in Chemistry. Six short term visiting scientists provided synthetic and crystallography support.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p><em>Broader Impacts</em>. During the project period MTSU undergraduate students were involved in productive research and international collaboration. Seven MTSU undergraduates, three MS students, two faculty members, and six visiting scientists from Poland were involved. One MTSU student traveled to Poland and continued his research for 3 months. All students continued in STEM, including one pursuing a Ph.D. at NC State, another M.S. at University of NC Chapel Hill, and one is pursuing an M.S. at MTSU, 2 in health professional school, and the rest working in industry. Visiting scientists from Poland, most staying for 4 months, shared scientific knowledge and practiced laboratory skills with MTSU students, while improving their English and exchanging scientific practices and cultural experiences (Figure 1). The project also helped to build research infrastructure for materials through support of an X-ray diffractometer and a dedicated crystallographer, as well as an X-ray themed REU program. Outreach demonstrating liquid crystalline behavior and simple electrooptic devices was designed and presented to a wide range of age groups at the Nashville Adventure Science Center, at a local high school, at Nissan Headquarters for regional high school girls, and at MTSU for prospective and current college students (Figure 2).</p> <p><em>Intellectual Merit</em>. This project focused on new liquid crystalline, dielectric, and photonic materials derived from unusual building blocks, inorganic boron clusters. The goal was to gain a fundamental understanding of structure-property relationships affecting liquid crystalline phases and photophysical properties, and their application as additives in LC displays. Some key discoveries involved materials with multiple phases, including a new LC phase with rare organizational order (Figures 3 and 4). Dielectric measurements were run to characterize electrooptical parameters for materials that can be used as high dielectric anisotropy additives for LCD applications.</p> <p>In our efforts to advance knowledge about liquid crystalline (LC) materials, we synthesized and characterized several series of quadrupolar and highly polar liquid crystalline materials.These materials are derivatives of four closo-borane and carborane clusters ([<em>closo</em>-CB<sub>9</sub>H<sub>10</sub>]<sup>-</sup>, [<em>closo</em>-CB<sub>11</sub>H<sub>12</sub>]<sup>-</sup>, [<em>closo</em>-B<sub>10</sub>H<sub>10</sub>]<sup>2-</sup> and [<em>closo</em>-B<sub>12</sub>H<sub>12</sub>]<sup>2-</sup>). Because the [<em>closo</em>-B<sub>10</sub>H<sub>10</sub>]<sup>2-</sup> cluster is easiest for undergraduate students to work with, yet relatively few derivatives were previously known in the literature, we generated many new compounds containing this cluster for a better understanding the structure-property relationships. The derivatives include key intermediates that will allow the organic synthesis of moieties that induce specific liquid crystalline phases. New methods were developed to place substituents in the apical positions that allow molecules with the extended linear shapes necessary to generate LC behavior. One series of derivatives was found to be highly color-tunable based on the variation of pi symmetry groups at each apical boron (see Figure 5). Most of these compounds were also fluorescent in solution, and more unusually, in the solid phase.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>To probe the electronic structures of the photoactive materials, photophysical measurements were carried out. These included quantitative UV/visible spectra, fluorescence, and measurements in a variety of solvents (solvatochromism). Fluorescence was also observed for dilute organic solutions in water (aggregation-induced fluorescence), and property that will be investigated further.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Computational modeling was used extensively to explain and predict chemical and physical behavior of the molecular materials. X-ray structures, provided with NSF-funded instrumentation, helped explain structure-property relationships in the solid and liquid crystalline states.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>The project furthered a longstanding collaborations with powder X-ray expert at University of Warsaw, an electrooptical measurements expert at University of Colorado.
