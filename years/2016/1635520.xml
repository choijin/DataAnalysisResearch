<AbstractNarration>Human society's consistent pursuit of better means of information communication and effective use of it?s energy supplies, requires continual innovation in the underlying technological materials infrastructure. Transformative technologies rely on breakthroughs in their scientific foundations, such as materials and processing. Recently, a number of soft inorganic solids have shown potential for applications in energy conversion and information manipulation, and promising new insight into the physics of exotic states of matter. Theoretical works suggest that reversible mechanical deformations in these materials could lead to either gradual or abrupt shifts of their physical properties. However, these soft materials, particularly, heavy halides and chalcogenides, experience difficulty in utilizing conventional chemical approaches to induce for deformation purpose due to their unique materials structures and atomic arrangement. This work addresses this problem by exploring the possibility of stretching soft but heavy halide and chalcogenide materials through van der Waals epitaxy. The research will introduce a new set of useful optoelectronic, electro-optic, logic and memory materials in the form of strained thin films. Researchers will also pursue educational goals by establishing a 'Graphics for Learning' program, which will train engineering undergraduate students, especially from underrepresented groups, through the graphical presentation of information.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Strain within epitaxial electronic and optical materials has been used to produce desirable materials properties unachievable in the unstrained state. While used to great effect in conventional semiconductors, the introduction of strain into the class of van der Waals bonded compounds has been difficult. The van der Waals compounds formed from elements deeper in the periodic table, termed heavy halides and chalcogenides, may offer new opportunity to strain-modify these materials. This grant looks to synthesize 'soft' and 'heavy' materials as thin films out of the heavier elements via van der Waals epitaxy onto useful substrates under conditions that lead to significant elastic strains within the epitaxial layers. The focus will be on two model materials: the van der Waals solid PbI2 and non-van der Waals solid CH3NH3PbCl3. Several other materials including CdTe, CdS, SbI3 and Sb2S3 will also be studied. The strain magnitude, strain relaxation mechanisms and strain-induced physical properties will be characterized by X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy and angle-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy. First-principle calculations will be employed to elucidate the experimental observations. After establishing a van der Waals nucleation/growth model for halides and chalcogenides, modifications to the synthesis of these epitaxial materials will be directed at achieving elastic strain engineering via the van der Waals epitaxial process. The magnitude and anisotropy of the epitaxial strain and the effect on materials properties will be used to develop a mechanistic understanding of the underlying changes in and behavior of the epitaxial 'heavy' van der Waals materials.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Conventional understanding suggests that van der Waals epitaxial strain in thin film growth is almost negligible for effective elastic strain engineering. By growing soft and heavy thin films via van der Waals epitaxy on substrates out of heavy elements, the principal investigators have found significant elastic strains in the epilayers of soft crystals including 3D/2D halide perovskite and chalcogenide materials. The principal investigators have also found that the epitaxial relation between halide perovskite and mica is incommensurate and there may exist static distortion wave (periodic strain patterns) in halide perovskite ultrathin films, and a lattice constant-dependent epitaxial angle evolution and a pronounced band structure change. In thick soft films, they found that crack, as an alternative relaxation mechanism, propagates along the crystallographic orientations. Band gap change of van der Waals epitaxial soft film has been linked to their epitaxial strain. First-principle computations reveal the nature of &ldquo;van der Waals&rdquo; interface to be partially van der Waals bond-based and partially ionic bond-based. Molecular dynamic simulations unveil the nucleation and growth mechanism in van der Waals epitaxy in which grain grows via gliding and rotation. In CdS/mica system, it was found that at least 0.4% strain can be borne at the interface when the film was only 6 nm thick and the strain was estimated to be 1.2% if a two-monolayer can be grown. The finding suggests that non-trivial strain could be enabled in 3D-2D van der Waals heterostructures if the thickness can be well-controlled. Additionally, the principal investigators have revealed the role of interlayer van der Waals force in Ruddlesden&minus;Popper perovskite in regulating phase-transition kinetics and carrier dynamics. They have found that the interlayer van der Waals force is strong enough to induce nonlocal phononic effect in the soft crystal Ruddlesden&minus;Popper perovskite. Further, by growing single-crystalline halide perovskite CsPbBr<sub>3</sub>, a mechanically soft and emerging semiconducting material, onto the VO<sub>2&plusmn;d</sub>, a heterogeneous interface is created that can entail a ~1% strain transfer upon the metal-insulator transition of VO<sub>2&plusmn;d</sub>. This strain is large enough to trigger a structural phase transition featured by PbX<sub>6</sub> octahedral tilting along with a modification of the photoluminescence energy landscape in halide perovskite. The findings suggest a promising strategy of dynamic strain engineering in a heterogeneous interface carrying soft and strain-sensitive semiconductors that can happen at a larger volumetric value surpassing the conventional critical thickness limit.
