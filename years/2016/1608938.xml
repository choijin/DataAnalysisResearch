<AbstractNarration>Nontechnical Description: Next-generation devices require new classes of materials capable of advance (multi-) functional response. In this regard, complex-oxide materials and interfaces have the potential for far-reaching impact. Of particular interest are opportunities to harness novel light-matter interactions to enable a range of applications. Controlling such interactions requires exacting production of materials and in-depth understanding of the mechanism(s) underlying the phenomena. For example, semiconductor heterostructures drive optoelectronics for solid-state lighting, communications, computing, and sensing and the subsequent introduction of nitride- and simple oxide-based materials has helped pushed such technologies into the ultraviolet emission range. New functionalities involving ultraviolet-emitting devices may enable faster encoding and manipulation of information, new modes of chemical detection and sensing, and more efficient solid-state lighting. This project explores opportunities for on-demand complex oxide-electronics through local material reconfiguration. It builds upon discoveries of conductivity at the interface of two insulators, and demonstration of reversible, local manipulation of conductance to produce tunable ultraviolet-light emission from such materials. The project actively promotes the training of next-generation scientists and engineers in technologically important and relevant fields critical for the sustained economic vitality of the United States, focuses efforts on the mentoring and training of students from historically underrepresented groups, and provides research co-op and international research experiences for student trainees.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Description: In this project, a new optoelectronic materials paradigm is defined by the coupling of spatially- and chemically-selective chemisorption with sub-surface quantum well(s) formed at the interface(s) of two band insulators. Symmetry-breaking and electrostatic potential mismatch between constituent semiconductors at an interface results in novel phenomena inaccessible in the bulk. This emergent phenomena can, in some systems, be tuned extensively since a surface, and to some extent, an interface, is free to reconstruct structurally and electronically. Bringing a surface or sub-surface into equilibrium with a controlled environment enables local, reversible control of the electronic phase or functional state. The effects of adsorbate type and locality, of a symmetry-lowering field on the strength, energy, and spatial response of ultraviolet luminescence from one or more distinct sub-surface, two-dimensional electron liquid(s) exhibiting electron correlations are studied. In particular, the activities focus on understanding and ultimately controlling several distinguishing features: 1) how the steady-state ultraviolet light emission intensity changes in response to different adsorbates; 2) how the physical properties of the model system, as probed by changes in spectral emission, respond to externally applied fields; 3) how the ultraviolet luminescence, including locality and stability, can be controlled with external stimuli; and 4) what the introduction of multiple, closely-spaced quantum wells and/or other oxide heterojunction materials does to the response. These investigations advance understanding of radiative recombination in new model optoelectronic ultraviolet light-emitting systems defined not by bulk, interfacial or surface properties alone, but by coupling of sub-surface interfacial quantum well electronic structure to surface chemisorption.</AbstractNarration>

These applications will have direct impact on improving social and economic conditions, in lessening our impact on the environment, and much more.   In this project, we have produced outcomes addressing a number of core aspects of this program, including:  New understanding about the physics of emergent function at interface and in heterostructures of different materials. By combining multiple materials with atomic-scale precision, we are able to produce properties - be it electronic, optical, dielectric, ferroelectric, ionic, magnetic, etc. - that cannot be obtained in the parent materials alone. The studies herein have shed light on how these properties form, how the materials respond to applied stimuli, and provide guidance on how to produce new effects in the future through thoughtful materials design. Ultimately, the project provided new pathways to manipulate and control such effects. Advances in the precision synthesis of materials - including routes to control materials, interfaces, and heterostructures at the unit-cell level. New predictive capabilities for these responses in thin-film systems based on our deeper understanding of the effects. New methodologies to probe the properties and ultimate performance of these materials including the development of new measurement modalities.    More broadly for other disciplines and the broader scientific community, this project has produced:  Advances that inform the development of new models, cutting-edge thin-film growth techniques, and modern characterization techniques can be applied to countless numbers of thin-film systems and to the study of a wide array of properties. Advances in emergent or unexpected states of matter - including electronic, magnetic, dielectric, etc. - with potential for important function. Beyond use in potential opto-electronic applications, considerable attention has been given to related materials for a range of next-generation nanoelectronic applications, including logic, memory, sensing, energy conversion/storage, etc. applications.  Emergence of novel effects (including magnetism, superconductivity, etc.) at heterointerfaces may also provide new insights into the fundamental nature of these effects found in a large, more diverse set of materials and provide for a model system to study these effects in novel ways.  Advances in spatially-locating effects developed in this program may provide a pathway beyond conventional photolithography approaches to define materials and function.    Finally, the program has made marked broader impacts on next-generation scientists and engineers including:  Training students and researchers in some of the most poorly developed, but technologically relevant fields of study in functional materials as well as in the synthesis of complex materials - a key skill-set needed to support next-generation technology and scientific advancement in the US. The training imparted to graduate and undergraduate students prepares them for cutting-edge research and technology jobs in an array of fields and will provide the US with the human infrastructure for exciting and pertinent fields. Research experience and mentorship aimed at providing students from underrepresented groups a first research experience and broadening their participation in STEM. This experience instills in those students a personal connection to the topics and promoted retention in science and engineering. Direct, one-on-one mentorship in scientific research methods, scientific writing and presentation, and other professional skill-sets essential for success at the next level. Scientific discoveries in this project supported the development of a number of commercial applications from electronics to energy conversion/storage to data storage and beyond. Support for budding industries in the US including the PI interacting with start-up companies as a scientific advisor to promote dissemination of knowledge and with established companies to aid the development of high-tech jobs in the US. Incorporation of new materials into the education and outreach programs that have touch hundreds of students and community members.
