<AbstractNarration>This project seeks to organize a workshop to address the question of how Cloud Computing is impacting, and potentially disrupting, academic research computing on campuses all across the nation. The workshop will bring together campus researchers, Chief Information Officers, Chief Research Officers, Chief Science Officers, Chief Information Security Officers, and Chief Financial Officers from campuses all across the country to discuss this important question. Through exploration of the evolving nature of academic research computing over time, the workshop will explore topics and challenges in academic research computing in a variety of contexts, including applications, support, data movement, administrative, legal, and financial. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The outcome of the workshop will be a set of white papers which will inform the compilation of a final report. This final report will elucidate key issues and recommendations surrounding Cloud Computing and its research implications, while presenting recommendations on how this activity could be supported by funding agencies moving forward.</AbstractNarration>
