<AbstractNarration>1636609 - Law&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the Princeton Summer School is to provide the next generation of combustion researchers and practicing engineers with comprehensive knowledge in the areas of combustion chemistry, theory, experiment, computation, and application For the past six years, the summer school session has offered daily morning and afternoon lectures taught at an accelerated pace over five days. The program typically consists of the foundational courses of combustion chemistry and combustion theory, as well as enrichment courses on practical combustion systems and laser diagnostics. The feedback from past participants has been uniformly enthusiastic for the learning and networking experience. The proposed support for graduate students and post-doctoral researchers is to partially offset part of the costs for travel and lodging (on Princeton's campus) at the 2016 Princeton-CEFRC-CI Summer School on Combustion. The camp-like environment provides ample opportunities for students to interact intimately with established researchers as well as among themselves. Such a learning opportunity is usually not offered on a university campus and should help develop the next-generation leader in combustion research and industry for the nation.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[     Objective  The   Princeton-CEFRC Summer School on Combustion has been a part of the outreach   program of the Combustion Energy Frontier Research Center (CEFRC), which was   one of the 46 Energy Frontier Research Centers (EFRCs) established by DOE in   2009. The goal of the Center is to develop a validated, predictive, multi-scale,   combustion modeling capability to optimize the design and operation of   evolving fuels, especially biofuels, in advanced engines for transportation   applications.  The Summer   School program was conceived by recognizing that while combustion is an interdisciplinary   subject, due to limitations at individual institutions the training received   by most combustion researchers has not been sufficiently comprehensive to   equip them to make breakthrough discoveries. The Summer School therefore aims   to offer advanced graduate level courses to remedy this deficiency.  The 2016 session of this annual summer school was supported   substantially by a grant from the Combustion Institute (CI), with additional   grants from NSF, ARO and Princeton University. The title of this session was   thus modified to 2016 Princeton-CEFRC-CI Summer School on Combustion to   reflect this substantial support.  Approach  The 2016   session was held from June 19 through June 24. Participants   comprised of senior graduate students and professionals from academia,   industries and government labs. World-renowned researchers   were commissioned to deliver the lectures.  Four 15-hour lectures were offered over 5   days, with 3 hours in the morning and 3 hours in the afternoon.     The five courses and their respective lecturers were:  Combustion        Dynamics: Professor S&eacute;bastien M. Candel of &Eacute;cole Centrale Paris Chemical        Kinetic Modeling for Combustion: Professor Henry J. Curran of National        University of Ireland, Galway Combustion        Physics: Professor Chung K Law of Princeton University Advanced        Laser Diagnostics in Combustion Research: Professor Mark A. Linne of        University of Edinburgh Turbulent        Combustion: Experiments and Fundamental Models: Professor James F.        Driscoll of University of Michigan   Detailed lecture notes were prepared and distributed to the   participants beforehand.    Participants   lived in comfortable dormitory setting, and had meals together in the   student cafeteria, hence facilitating networking.  Room and board for all US students were   covered.     Relevance to NSF  Many   participants were involved in research projects supported by NSF. The   enrichment of their knowledge in combustion will benefit the progress of   these research projects. Furthermore, it is anticipated that many of the   graduate students will become active researchers in combustion and propulsion   in the future, some assuming leadership positions. This Summer School   experience will undoubtedly prove useful as they carry out their   responsibilities.  Accomplishments for   Reporting Period  220   participants of the 2016 session came from 15 different countries, 31 US   states, 65 US and non-US universities, 4 U.S. government labs, and 7 U.S.   corporations. 178 of the participants were graduate students and 42 were   professionals. Participants   were highly satisfied with the experience, with many laudatory feedback   comments. All lectures   were professional taped and are freely available to the general public   through the Princeton University web-site and YouTube at https://www.youtube.com/user/PrincetonCEFRC/playlists?shelf_id=13&amp;view=50&amp;sort=dd Detailed lecture   notes are freely available to the general public through   Princeton University?s web-site at http://www.princeton.edu/cefrc/combustion-summer-school/archived-programs/2016-session/lecture-notes/                  Last Modified: 08/14/2017       Submitted by: Chung K Law]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
