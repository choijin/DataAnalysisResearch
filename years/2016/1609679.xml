<AbstractNarration>Magneto-dielectric devices, such as microwave and radio frequency lenses, are indispensable to communication systems, needed for example, for radar, mobile, cyber security and internet-of-things applications. Similar to glass lenses, which focus light, these devices allow for focusing or otherwise manipulating radio and microwaves. In particular, devices with spatially varying magnetic and dielectric properties offer exciting and innumerate possibilities for electromagnetic wave shaping but remain to be realized due to lack of practical fabrication techniques. Inkjet printing provides a promising approach to manufacturing such devices: inks of different composition (e.g., containing magnetic and dielectric nanoparticles) can be dispensed in varying ratio within the volume of the device to implement the desired spatial gradient in magneto dielectric properties. The goal of this industry university collaboration is to demonstrate devices, fabricated by 3D inkjet printing, with tailor-made spatial variation in magnetic and dielectric properties to achieve wave shaping as needed by a given application. The demonstration will pave the way for advanced devices such as antenna lenses that beam radio or microwave signals only to a specific WiFi enabled machine or within the perimeter of a specific room to mitigate the risk of signal interference or interception. The project will also create a unique educational and professional development opportunity for participating students, who will acquire expertise and industry experience, via internships, in advanced manufacturing, an area of significant economic importance to the U.S. Further, in partnership with a local library, talks aimed at public education in 3D printing technologies will be presented. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This collaborative GOALI project seeks to demonstrate the fabrication of microwave and radio frequency magneto-dielectric devices, with specifically designed, spatially varying electric permittivity and magnetic permeability. The project will combine transformation optics techniques for design of electromagnetic media with 3D inkjet printing for digitally directed device fabrication. Graded index microwave lens antennas, with individually customized radiation patterns, will be printed in proof of concept. The devices will be printed in a layer-by-layer sequence with polymerizable inks containing high permeability magnetic and high permittivity dielectric nanoparticles. A key challenge, due to particle loading constraints when jetting inks, will be attaining the requisite range of permeability and permittivity in the printed composite medium. Inks formulated with commercial nanoparticles will be used to conduct a rapid survey of electromagnetic properties possible in the composites. The results of the survey will guide subsequent ink design with custom nanoparticles. The size, dispersion and loading of the nanoparticles in the inks will be optimized for ink-jettability and range of electromagnetic properties achieved in the printed composites.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The overarching goal of this collaborative industry-university project was to examine the feasibility of inkjet printing 3-D structures with customized magnetic and dielectric properties. One important application of these materials is their use as antennas that beam radio or microwave signals only to a specific WiFi-enabled product or within the perimeter of a specific room to mitigate the risk of signal interference or interception.  During the project, the team designed devices containing gradients of magnetic and dielectric materials, formulated dielectric and magnetic nanoparticle containing inks, suitable for inkjet printing, and demonstrated the ability to print desired structures from those inks.  This portion of the collaborative project focused on development of the magnetic and dielectric inks.  Each ink contained nanometer-sized particles that imparted the desired magnetic or dielectric property.  To produce the ink particles were dispersed in a polymerizable liquid carrier containing a photosensitize initiator molecule.  Irradiation of the ink with ultraviolet (UV) light solidifies and sets the ink.  These inks can be printed with an inkjet printer. By printing multiple layers of ink droplets and curing them with UV light, 3D structures can be produced.  Because nanometer-sized particles tend to settle or separate from the rest of the ink, coatings were developed for the particles that enhanced their dispersion within the ink.  A general method of modifying the particles to enhance their dispersion was developed that was easily accomplished by ball milling the particles in the presence of a coating molecule (ligand).  Ball milling involves abrading the surfaces of the nanoparticles in the presence of small grinding balls.  The milling process increases the reactivity of the surface, ensuring good binding of the ligand to the particle surface.  The method was demonstrated for different sizes and types of particles possessing magnetic and dielectric properties. The use of ball milling to activate the surface of inorganic oxide nanoparticles appears to be a powerful approach to controlling the dispersibility of these structures and can likely be used in a wide variety of applications requiring the particle incorporation into printable matrices.  The project created unique educational and professional development opportunities for participating students. The research has been carried out by a diverse interdisciplinary team.  Everyone benefited from the experience of conducting team science toward the common goal of advancing materials science and engineering to develop printable dielectric and magnetic gradients. In particular, students learned to characterize complex nanoparticle-containing mixtures using corroborative and complementary analytical tools.
