<AbstractNarration>EarthCube is a community-driven effort with the goal of transforming the conduct of geoscience research and education by creating a well-integrated and facile environment to share scientific data, information tools and services, and knowledge in an open, transparent, and inclusive manner. Under the leadership of University Corporation for Atmospheric Research (UCAR) and in partnership with the EarthCube community, its governance, and other stakeholders and collaborators, the EarthCube Science Support Office (ESSO) will support efforts to advance EarthCube's mission. ESSO's role will be to provide a logistical, organizational, and administrative foundation to facilitate the advancement of EarthCube goals to catalyze scientific breakthroughs in the geosciences by fostering advances in information and computational sciences. ESSO will endeavor to ensure a high quality of service to EarthCube stakeholders, delivered with professionalism, efficiency, transparency, and nimbleness.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ESSO will provide logistical support to the EarthCube community and its governance groups in order to stimulate and manage community dialog, strengthen efforts to define and resolve common challenges using a consensus-oriented approach, and help realize EarthCube's full potential and vision. ESSO will provide leadership to improve the coherence and impact of EarthCube's efforts, bringing a coordinated and well-integrated approach to managing and supporting governance, science, and technology activities. To accomplish this, UCAR will draw on the expertise of two of its community programs -- Unidata and the Joint Office for Science Support (JOSS) -- to provide the services requested of the ESSO. In addition, ESSO will collaborate with the Earth Science Information Partners (ESIP) Federation to leverage their long experience with the geoscience cyberinfrastructure community for the mutual benefit of both organizations and their communities. ESSO will also spearhead outreach and community engagement activities by participating in national and international scientific society meetings, scientific career fairs, and other events. ESSO will reach out to broader audiences through the EarthCube website, newsletters, and social media. It will leverage the presence of geoscientists and cyberinfrastructure professionals to offer in-person and virtual seminars, promoting the work of funded projects, data facilities, and providing backbone support for education, training, and workforce development activities.</AbstractNarration>

Advancement of EarthCube Cyberinfrastructure  Under the leadership of the Technical Officer within ESSO, this project also successfully delivered, deployed, and maintained the cloud-based software services, registries, and user interfaces for the core data and software registry, discovery, and access needs for the geoscience community utilizing web standards for interoperability.   In summary, during the period of performance of this award, major strides were by EarthCube on multiple fronts. In particular, ESSO’s efforts to enhance EarthCube’s reputation in the community by expanding EarthCube’s outreach content highlighting project were quite successful.
