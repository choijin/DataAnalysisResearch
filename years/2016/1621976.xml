<AbstractNarration>This SBIR Phase I project will develop attractive and stimulating educational activities to improve vaccination awareness and understanding. Scientific evidence shows that vaccines are effective in preventing infectious diseases such as influenza, a contagious respiratory illness. However, despite CDC's recommendation for universal influenza vaccination, fewer than 50% of all children in the US, and only 1 in 3 of African-American children, are vaccinated each year. The proposed activities are designed to educate kids and parents about the benefits of vaccinations, in order to increase the number of vaccinated children. Through a tag game and wearable devices, participants simulate transmission of influenza, and thereby better visualize the health risks of going unvaccinated. The long-term goal is to improve the health literacy of young students in a fun and exciting way. Educating children about health concepts promotes healthy behaviors, and leads families toward better health-related decisions. Improving health literacy, especially in a technology-oriented society, is key to developing a thriving population that can understand and use new information. The commercial outcome of the proposed SBIR project will lead to a marketable product that will be targeted toward hands-on museums and has both individual and societal benefits.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The scalable educational technology in this project will engage children in modeling scientific phenomena in a fun and exciting way, while at the same time help them to better understand such phenomena. The system uses smartwatches for managing tag games that educate children about the benefits of vaccination against influenza. Each participant is assigned a health status, such as infectious, healthy, or immune, and then runs around to simulate the spread of the flu. Through these participation-based activities, students will develop better understandings of the underlying concepts of infectious disease transmission, community-level (herd) immunity, and disease outbreaks. Similar activities can be used to teach other scientific phenomena such as chemical reactions and phase changes. The project will evaluate the effectiveness of activities using systematic surveys producing feedback from participants. This work fills a market need for educational technology tools that provide powerful and memorable learning experiences that not only improve health literacy but also foster student interest and confidence in science and math. Educating children by exposing them to the sciences, especially in health-related areas, is essential to improving wellbeing, and aligns with NSF?s mission of promoting science education.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This Phase I project has seen massive success in all research and development efforts undertaken to develop the PlayFlu program. The team both met and exceeded the Phase I objectives and has refined the program through extensive iterative development and field-testing. Our dedicated team designed and developed an effective educational outreach program to teach k-12 students about flu outbreaks and related scientific concepts, including an innovative technological system for managing our unique kinesthetic activities, a comprehensive lesson-plan, and imbedded assessment tools. To date, PlayFlu has travelled to over 10,000 students across multiple school districts and has had excellent research outcomes. We are not only beyond testing a minimum viable product as proposed, but are now providing an in-depth educational experience that allows the technology and program to be fully implemented in classrooms. What was an abstract prototype little over a year ago has developed into a valuable resource for thousands of students, yet there is still so much work to be done.</p> <p>PlayFlu is a technology-intensive educational travel-outreach program designed to teach about fundamental science concepts in line with the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS). The PlayFlu technology enables the integration of kinesthetic learning methods (tag-style games), an out-of-your-chair style of learning where students are able to physically engage in modelling of scientific phenomena like the spread of infectious diseases and, specifically, influenza outbreaks.</p> <p>PlayFlu is an evidence-based learning approach, with the underlying technology enabling real-time production of data by students which simultaneously drives the activity and is used to enhance learning through data visualizations and real-time evaluation. Implementation of PlayFlu in the field validated the market need for technology-rich travel outreach STEM programs and gained extensively positive feedback from a range of stakeholders including science teachers, students, and administrators.</p> <p>The developed technology enables the PlayFlu activity to run for multiple rounds and change parameters to highlight lessons in cause and effect and other fundamental science concepts that are critical for science learning, all within the context of flu outbreaks. Through the technology, data produced by students is also used to drive post-workshop activities to reinforce critical skills like graphing and analysis. The underlying technology regulates all communications and interactions between wearable PlayFlu devices used by students to engage in the games. Regarding research, the PlayFlu program and technologies investigates kinesthetic learning and travel-outreach methods as approaches to enhancing STEM learning and student perceptions of STEM.</p> <p>The technology developed to enable data-driven activities simultaneously enables the collection of data for research purposes. Data generated with approximately 3,000 middle-school students (grades 6-8) was collected during the implementation of the program across multiple schools and districts in the mid-west. Research with this data found that there was a statistically significant difference (p-value &lt; 0.001) between the mean pre-test and mean post-test scores for all students, suggesting a significant educational value for all groups that participated in program. In addition to testing for overall impact of PlayFlu, data was analyzed to identify whether any subgroups benefited differently (e.g. gender). Interestingly, growth for girls was stronger than the growth for boys. Overall improvement of girls was more statistically significant (p-value&lt; 0.01) than that of boys, suggesting a greater educational value of the PlayFlu program for girls. While growth was stronger for girls, neither pre-test scores between boys and girls, nor post test scores, were statistically different (in each stage, i.e. pre/post). We also found that there was no statistical significant difference in learning between students in different grades at the middle-school level and between different participating school districts, validating that the program provides comparable value to all middle-school grades and across district lines. Research highlights that PlayFlu can impact a larger audience without limitations of gender, grade level, school, or region. Research and development efforts will continue into the future as PlayFlu further grows its audience over time.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 03/09/2018<br>      Modified by:
