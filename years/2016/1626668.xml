<AbstractNarration>The collective behavior of societies emerges from self-organized interactions among group members. Traditionally, group members have been thought of as identical individuals, but behavioral variation is prevalent in nature. This variation can be extreme and one group member, referred to here as the keystone individual, may have a greater impact on the collective behavior of a group than all other individuals. For example, some individuals may lead a group, tutor others or function as super-spreaders of information or disease. Despite the potential impact of keystone individuals on the success of a group, little is known about how and why this influence emerges. The investigators will use social spiders that can be easily manipulated and observed at the individual and group levels to test hypotheses about the emergence of collective behavior, hypotheses that cannot be easily evaluated in more complex systems. In addition to the numerous undergraduate and graduate research projects this project will generate, the proposed work will also be translated into hands-on activities about collective behavior geared towards the education of K-12 students though established and successful outreach programs. Adult science education activities to enhance public knowledge of invertebrate biology will include public lectures, media coverage, and conversations at local communities where the field work occurs.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This research aims to examine the mechanisms by which keystone individuals affect collective behavior, the effects of keystones on the development of collective behaviors and the ecological and evolutionary consequences of the presence of keystone individuals in groups. Using a model system that allows for detailed experimental manipulations, the social spider (Stegodyphus dumicola), will allow the investigators to develop a broad theory to enhance the progress of science on keystone individuals. Specifically, this work will (1) test whether keystone individuals produce tradeoffs among colony-level processes such as prey capture and disease spread, and how these tradeoffs change colony performance in different environments; (2) uncover the temporal dynamics of the effects of keystone individuals on the development of collective behaviors in the field; (3) elucidate the behavioral mechanisms that underlie the catalytic effects of keystone individuals on the behavior of other group members and collective outcomes; and (4) design versatile agent-based models that will uncover the general  mechanisms by which keystone individuals influence collective behaviors. The investigators will address these questions by combining lab and field experiments, analyzed with sophisticated image analysis technology and social network theory, with computational modeling.  Published data sets will be uploaded for use by others to Dryad.</AbstractNarration>

Social spiders do not have castes, like workers and queens, as the social insects do. Instead, the roles that individuals play in their group are dictated by subtler differences in individuals&rsquo; behavioral tendencies, which can be thought of as their personalities. Based on their personalities, some individuals in spider groups become leaders during collective prey capture events, during web repair, or during the defense of the colony against enemies, like ants.&nbsp; We found that although individuals bearing a rare &ldquo;bold&rdquo; personality type constituted only 2-5% of colony members, the presence of these individuals changes how a group behaves collectively and whether it survives. We found that adding just one bold individual to a group of shy spiders increases the number of attackers that respond to prey by 400% and can increase the number of individuals that construct the colony&rsquo;s web by 250%. This results in larger webs and more effective prey capture behavior. However, this is not without cost. Low resource conditions, like when colonies are surrounded by many rival colonies, favor non-aggressive colonies that lack bold individuals. Whereas, in some habitats and conditions, the presence of bold individuals can increase a colony&rsquo;s odds of survival by 400%. Using regional variation in the social order that underlies colony behavior, we determined that the social influence of bold individuals is actually caused by changes to &ldquo;followership&rdquo; in the shy population majority, which conveys that the leader-follower social order seen in many animals may be driven evolutionarily by followership and not leadership per se. Finally, we determined that boldness is a trait of an individual that emerges spontaneously in groups of shy group members and is maintained by a social feedback loop, where increases in an individual&rsquo;s boldness early in life beget more increases in boldness later in life.

Social spiders do not have castes, like workers and queens, as the social insects do.
