<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase-I project is in the development of low cost, environmentally-friendly coating materials for corrosion prevention. Corrosion is a significant global issue, resulting in high maintenance and repair costs. Current anti-corrosion coatings need an improvement in effective barrier against water or moisture. As a result, it is imperative to develop improved corrosion resistance coatings, leading to reduced downtime and damage to equipment and important infrastructure. This study aims to achieve the desired level of barrier properties necessary to significantly improve passive protection of the coated surface. These coating material developed will be sustainable and will use low cost clay as fillers to replace expensive Zinc fillers in coating formulations, completely or partially. The developed technology will have the potential to reduce damages due to corrosion in spectrum of industries spanning infrastructure, shipping, food containers, defense, and automobile domains. Primary fillers used will be non-toxic, abundantly available, versatile, low-cost, and easily adaptable with current coating manufacturing protocols, making them commercially viable. Successful completion of project phase I &amp; II will result in advanced manufacturing job creation and reduce corrosion related costs in industry and improve infrastructure lifetime.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The technical objective of this STTR Phase-I proposal is developing a platform technology for multi- functional low cost epoxy-based nanocomposite coatings for corrosion protection. The innovation in the proposed multi-functional coatings lay in deriving the benefits of various fillers and a combinatorial approach to synergistic harvesting of functionality and robustness. Polymer nanocomposites provide an opportunity to harness the maximum benefits of properties when fillers are uniformly dispersed in the host matrix. The structural integrity of metal and its products is directly dependent on its anti-corrosive properties, which can be enhanced using modified clay as fillers. Passive and active protection against corrosion reaction can be achieved by using transition metal ion modified clay as a filler coupled with dispersion and improved polymer-filler interactions. As part of this STTR Phase-I award we will optimize the formulations such that corrosion resistance and other key properties of coatings are enhanced. The validated corrosion resistance coatings will then be translated towards commercial success by: i) producing and benchmarking novel coating formulations for corrosion resistance, ii) scaling-up the production process, iii) mathematical modeling for recursive design of these coatings. At end of the project we will have a superior low cost multi-functional coating with lower toxic footprint.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit: The role of common fillers and their effect in concert for coatings development is poorly understood. Clays are widely used class of fillers in composite technology, and their modified forms have been shown to hold promise as functional displacement of traditional zinc and iron phosphate fillers.  The current work establishes the superior performance of transition metal ion (TMI) modified clays, when used as a co-filler or by itself in an epoxy matrix, for primarily anti-corrosion, but also anti-fouling and UV-resistance functionalities. Examination of: i) TMI-clays in concert with co-fillers, and ii) the interplay of TMI cation and anion choice in detail has provided a novel platform on which multifunctionality can be built based on TMI modified clays as fillers.   Broader Impact: Environmentally sustainable coatings can be developed through partial or complete replacement of traditionally used zinc and iron phosphate fillers. Reducing the toxic imprint of metal leaching in marine coatings- a target/first use application, has quantifiable implications for public health and aquatic ecosystems. Reduction in cost of formulations, and assurance of materials supply chain are added benefits to using modified clays as fillers for coatings.  Summary of Outcomes: There are three major outcomes that can be seen as primary markers of project success:   1. Anti-corrosion performance of TMI clays established: Quantification using both the accelerated corrosion and electrochemical tests demonstrate the efficacy of TMI modified fillers at loading of 3 weight % and less when compared to benchmark epoxy and control formulations.  2. Performance of TMI clay fillers in concert for multifunctionality demonstrated: Co-fillers of zinc and iron phosphate have been used in various ratios with the TMI modified clays to quantify synergies that may exist. In one particular case, TMI clay with zinc in 1:1 ratio yielded 68% enhancement  in UV absorbance when compared to neat clay, and about 72% enhancement when compared to zinc. Corresponding figures for iron phosphate were 64% and 42%, respectively. Increase in anti-corrosion was also observed in ratios of co-fillers. Additionally, it was found that a co-filler approach was the best strategy to reducing fouling in static tests for coupons in accelerated fouling tanks containing lake water and synthetic seawater.   3. Better performance when compared to commercial coatings: When benchmarked against a leading poly-urethane and siloxane based coating, addition of TMI fillers out-performed the base commercial formulations. An improvement of up to 180% in corrosion rate is observed when compared to widely used anti-corrosion epoxy resin. These are significant steps towards market readiness and eventual commercialization.       Last Modified: 07/02/2018       Submitted by: Ruby Chakraborty]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
