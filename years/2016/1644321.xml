<AbstractNarration>The purpose of this proposal is to convene scholars at a two-day conference to closely examine validity-related measurement issues, create a guidelines for the field of mathematics education research that addresses key ideas (e.g., validity, validity arguments, evidence for validity and measurement at-scale), and set a clear pathway for scholars to discuss quantitative measurement within mathematics education. Invitees will include a mix of young, older and diverse scholars in mathematics education research.  Products include refereed journal articles along with a website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop will engage the Mathematics Education, Policy, Statistical, Psychometrics and other education research communities in examining and critiquing measurement validity evidence of mathematics education research with the long-term goal of increasing the quality of quantitative inference in mathematics education research (to include improvements in the training of doctoral students).</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   The Validity Evidence for Measurement in Mathematics Education (V-M2Ed) conference was held April 2-3 at the Drury Inn in San Antonio, Texas. The purpose of the conference was to contextualize current conceptions of validity - with a focus on argument-based approaches to validation - within the field of mathematics education. The specific goals were to:   Promote conversation and collaboration among researchers with expertise in mathematics education and measurement.   Identify a set of recommended elements to include in instrument summary statements. (Instrument summary statements provide a clear and succinct description of an instrument to an assist end-user in making an initial determination of the fit of the instrument for their context.)   Develop a set of example validation arguments situated in mathematics education.   The conference gathered together a diverse group of individuals (graduate students, faculty, industry experts) from mathematics education, measurement, and applied measurement fields of research. There were thirty-four conference participants and five conference organizers. The keynote was provided by Mark Wilson, the president of the National Council for Measurement in Education (NCME) and director of the Berkeley Evaluation and Assessment Research Center.  The conference was organized around iterations of whole-group discussion and smaller working groups focused on articulating ideas related to instrument summary statements (day 1) and validation arguments (day 2). The format encouraged significant participation from all attendees and provided an excellent venue to exchange ideas and further develop the group's understanding related to current conceptions of validity and argument-based validation, which is expected to influence future work they engage in related to instrument development and validation. In addition, several opportunities for dissemination arose from V-M2Ed conference grant funding, which should serve to broaden the influence of the conference beyond that of the attendees. A few items are highlighted below, some of which are currently in progress;   A special issue of Investigations in Mathematics Learning, which examines validity within mathematics education contexts,   A working group facilitated at the Psychology of Mathematics Education - North American chapter 2016 and 2017 conferences focused on developing a repository for mathematics education research instruments,   Two American Educational Research Association symposium proposal submissions focused on a review of the validation literature,  instrument summary statements, and example validation arguments situated in mathematics education,   A conference presentation by three V-M2Ed attendees at the NCME Classroom Assessment conference in September of 2017,   And in progress are an edited book, a themed journal issue, and a literature synthesis focused on validity and validation arguments in mathematics education.    It is clear from communication and work products developed at and following the V-M2Ed conference that the impact on the attendees was significant, and that this work will have a direct impact on improving the use of current conceptions of validity and validation both within mathematics education and more broadly.
