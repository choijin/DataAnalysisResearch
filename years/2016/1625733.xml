<AbstractNarration>With this award from the Division of Materials Research (DMR) Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, the University of California, Merced will acquire a state-of-the-art confocal laser-scanning microscope to serve as primary tool for biomaterials-based research and teaching. In a confocal microscope, a pinhole that rejects out-of-plane light allows imaging at a higher resolution than achievable through conventional optical microscopy. This optical sectioning allows reconstruction of three-dimensional images from optical slices.  This microscope will dramatically augment the materials research facilities existing at UC Merced, specifically allowing research into: a) how do cells control the size of lipid domains in their membranes, b) how do we engineer synthetic cells, c) how do we design and characterize nano-assembled systems for energy and drug delivery, d) what are the effects of mechanical forces on the differentiation of stem cells,  e) what are the effects of hydrophilic polymers on fluid transport in the rhizosphere, f) what are the short- and long-term dynamics of biofilms, and g) how do cooperation between fungi and bacteria occur in mixed biofilms. Research activities and research training on the microscope, of a large number of students from diverse backgrounds at UC Merced, a minority serving institution, benefits from this award. Furthermore, teacher training on the instrument will increase pre-college exposure to science and engineering in the surrounding communities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The microscope will allow the PIs and senior personnel to conduct research requiring multi-modal imaging capabilities, such as a combination of high-resolution multichannel (up to six simultaneous channels) fluorescence microscopy, laser reflectance microscopy, bright-field microscopy, spectroscopic imaging, and high-signal-to-noise ratio imaging.  The detectors feature linear scanning and superior signal-to-noise ratios thus allowing quantitative imaging of dim and lightly-labeled samples. The upright configuration allows reflective imaging of semiconductor chips, nanofilms, and nanoparticles on surfaces using long-working distance objectives. The upright configuration will also allow studies of phenomena where directionality is important, such as the formation of biofilm pellicles on air-water interfaces, and gravity and capillarity driven transport of liquids through the rhizosphere.  This instrument will also allow students to receive hands on-training on the use and application of state-of-the-art microscopy techniques; particularly important for UC Merced, which has one of the nation's highest enrollment of first generation college students in a research university. The educational opportunities created by this instrument will further the university's commitment to diversity by investing institutional resources to recruit and retain students from underrepresented social and economic groups.</AbstractNarration>
