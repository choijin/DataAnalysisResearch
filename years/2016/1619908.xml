<AbstractNarration>This award will support participants attending the first Workshop for Women in Computational Topology.  Computational topology is a new and exciting field emerging at the intersection of mathematics and computer science, with applications in areas such as big data, image recognition, and medical imaging, among many others.  Traditionally, representation of women in these research areas is quite low, and attrition rates are high at all levels.  This award will allow the creation of a network of junior and senior women in this research area, a strategy which has proven invaluable to broadening participation in such areas.  Participants will spend a week at the Institute for Mathematics and its Applications, providing a critical opportunity for research collaboration as well as networking and mentoring for women.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Computational topology brings together tools from topology, geometry, algorithms, and statistics in order to tackle a range of problems from applications that include graphics, sensor networks, medical imaging, materials engineering, GIS, big data analysis, and many others. This workshop will form a series of working groups that will tackle open problems posed by senior women researchers in computational topology on topics ranging from computing optimal mappings between surfaces to investigating open problems related to persistent homology to applying techniques to new applications.  Results from the workshop will be published in an AWM Springer volume, and follow-up events will be organized in conjunction with AWM to continue to grow the network.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ When analyzing data from areas ranging from medical imaging to data analysis, one often needs further information about patterns or underlying structure.  Computational topology is an area at the intersection of mathematics and computer science that gives many tools and algorithms to find such underlying structure, which are applicable a broad range of questions from many disciplines.  For example, given an image from a medical scan, researchers often want automated software to detect if it is similar to known images or contains structures within it; or given a data set, you want to group items together into clusters based on how similar they are; or given a set of trajectories from a GPS tracker, you may want to recover the underlying structure of the road network.  This grant funded the first Women in Computational Topology Workshop, which brought a group of 27 women together for a week.  With respect to broader impacts, the impact of this grant is clear; since both mathematics and computer science are male-dominated fields, such events are crucial to provide support and mentorship to junior women in the field.  With regards to intellectual merit, working groups at the workshop addressed challenging open problems from applied and computational algebraic topology. The funding directly supported participation of 25 US-based women, and allowed all 4 working groups to publish a paper, which will appear in the Springer proceedings volume in 2018.
