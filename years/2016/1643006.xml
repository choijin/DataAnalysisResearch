<AbstractNarration>Many natural, social and engineered systems exhibit or facilitate complex behavior. Such behavior often results from the deliberate actions of, and interactions between, a large number of individuals. The need to study behavior in complex systems of network-structured interactions in large populations promotes interest in computational game-theoretic models.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Graphical games build on classical models in game theory, as well as compact, structured representations in probabilistic graphical models. The result is a practical and computationally amenable model to handle networked large-population systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The creation of technology for scientists and policy makers to study and work with large real-world complex systems of (strategic) interactions requires further advances in graphical games and models. The project seeks to fill knowledge gaps by advancing computational aspects of game theory, graphical models and machine learning, and laying the foundation for a systematic two-way knowledge transfer between computational game theory and graphical models.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research program strengthens the connection between graphical models and game theory by casting probabilistic inference problems as equilibrium computation, creating algorithms to learn games from behavioral data, and characterizing equilibrium structure and computation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The educational program includes the infusion of research results into general education, at all levels, via development of new courses and integration into existing ones; and a concerted effort to bridge the Departments of Economics and Computer Science at Stony Brook. Collaborations through the Center for Game Theory in Economics and the International Summer Festival on Game Theory, held annually at Stony Brook, serve as conduits for outreach and dissemination.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In its broadest view, the project sought to improve our computational tools to understand systems involving many individual entities in which complex global behavior emerges from simpler local interactions.  The particular emphasis was on systems involving distributed decision making.  Essentially, the project explored connections between explicitly strategic and inherently non-strategic systems within the context of reasoning, inference, and learning.  From a technical perspective, the project sought to improve and expand the knowledge base on graphical modeling within computer science, artificial intelligence, and machine learning, with emphasis on multi-agent systems mathematically grounded on classical game theory and economic modeling.  The project advanced the theory and practice of game-theoretic and microeconomic graphical models.  The work was illustrated in novel, non-traditional areas of potential application, such as political science, microfinance, and public health.   For example, the project led to theoretically-grounded computational models and tools for the study of influence in social networks in political systems and policy-making and interventions in microfinance and public-health systems.  As for concrete real-world examples, the project considered and studied applications related to congressional voting records in the U.S. Senate, banking interest rates and village loan allocations in microfinance systems in Bangladesh and Bolivia, and aggregatesate-level flu-vaccination rates in the continental U.S.A.. All ofthose examples were based on real-world publicly-available data.  The project also inspired auxiliary fundamental work in machine learning.  It helped with very preliminary foundational work to address a very difficult challenging problem: the study of the relationship among features of the graphical game-theoretic models, the structural properties of their induced solution space, and the computational complexity and algorithmic characteristics of existing approaches and methods designed for them.  The development of human resources is one of the key broader impacts from the project.  Several graduate-student participants, either supported in whole or in part, either financially or via other research opportunities facilitated by the project, are now in tenure-track positions at a wide range of institutions, from R1 universities, such as Purdue University and the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, to elite liberal-arts colleges, such as Bowdoin.  Similarly, undergraduate students have gone on to graduate studies, both Ph.D. and Masters, at institutions with prominent CS programs, such as Stanford, Harvard, and Stony Brook.  Some students have also gone on to positions in research and developments labs, and other positions in industry, including startups in the core technical areas of the project, some working internationally.  The project also facilitated improvements in undergraduate and graduate programs in CS at the Stony Brook University and the University of Michigan-Dearborn.  In addition, some of the datasets collected, the computational and algorithmic technics designed, and the software products and tools produced, have had broader impact in terms of their further usage in both academia and industry.
