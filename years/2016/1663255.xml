<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps is in utilization of a byproduct of water treatment for reducing harmful impact of agricultural runoff.  Spent lime is a common byproduct generated during the treatment process in water treatment plants. This project will beneficially reuse spent lime to reduce disposal costs for municipalities, improve water quality, and provide a suitable product to enhance agricultural production. Agricultural runoff and drainage of phosphorus are considered to be a contributing factor to eutrophication and proliferation of harmful algal blooms.  The technology developed here utilizes spent lime from water treatment plants to remove phosphorus from surface waters.  The spent material removed from the system will serve as a nutrient-enhanced product with many potential uses, including application directly to agricultural land or incorporation as a fertilizer additive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project utilizes spent lime as a sorbing material to remove phosphorus from surface waters.  Calcium ions in spent lime form covalent bonds with orthophosphates to form calcium phosphate.   Thus, phosphorus in a dissolved form precipitates to a solid form.  The technology used here has demonstrated adsorption of phosphorus to spent lime is nearly instantaneous with a considerable calculated sorption capacity.   Maximum phosphorus removal can be achieved by increasing the mass of spent lime.  This project develops a phosphorus interceptor system that utilize spent lime as filter material.  To maintain optimal performance, spent lime is replaced with new material after reaching phosphorus saturation.  The resulting material is nutrient-enhanced with multiple potential agricultural uses.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual merit: The initial hypothesis was that spent lime from water treatment plants could be used as the basis for production of a product that could be used to remove phosphorus from surface waters that have been impacted by agricultural runoff and any other source, such as urban combined sewer overflows and industrial waste streams.  The proposed product was to be created in a pellet form for application to any relevant site with the goal of improving water quality, specifically with respect to phosphorus removal and, as a secondary outcome, reduction in algal blooms that produce toxic compounds and create oxygen-poor ?dead? zones in water bodies.  Following customer discovery, personnel discovered that (1) a number of government bodies ranging from cities, to counties, to state levels wanted to establish businesses within their jurisdictions with the goal of using the spent lime, which is currently a waste product that costs money for disposal and of improving water quality.  (2) In addition, a second application of the spent lime was discovered ? the production of controlled release fertilizer that includes calcium as a result of using spent lime.  The calcium would be primarily for plants that are grown as container and specialty crops due to the protection that calcium offers with respect to drier and warmer conditions that occur from climate change.     Broader impacts:  Customer discovery lead to research personnel establishing partnerships within the locale of the University of Toledo that resulted in the following: (1) the City of Defiance helped identify a non-profit health care supplier that is investing in the creation of a company that uses the above-mentioned process to improve water quality in the Maumee River, which is the primary contributor of phosphorus to Lake Erie.  The goal is to improve human health by limiting the occurrences of harmful algal blooms. (2) The City will also benefit from the process by improving water quality at a lower cost, by creating a ?market? for spent lime that has been a costly waste product until now, and creating local employment opportunities around the processing of spent lime into a phosphorus adsorbing material.  (3) Researchers are continuing to investigate the use of spent lime as a material for production of a controlled release fertilizer.
