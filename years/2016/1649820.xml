<AbstractNarration>Food safety and procurement policies that focus on local producers can prevent foodborne illness outbreaks and are an important component of a healthy food environment. Food safety policies such as the New York (NY) Food Metric require some traceability, meaning the revealing of information and processes of the origin, location, and life history of a product across the supply-chain. However, the costs of participating in a traceability cyber infrastructure could potentially nullify the economic benefits of food safety policy implementation for small farms. Data and technology requirements and capabilities have the potential to marginalize small farms who have restricted capability, time, and resources to collect, record, and share data. In partnership with Professor Gary Kleppel and the Kleppel Lab for Agricultural Ecology and Sustainable Food Production in the Department of Biology at the University at Albany (UAlbany), the Center for Technology in Government, UAlbany proposes to build preliminary data and technology architectures to support the development of the necessary cyber-infrastructure for a whole-chain traceability system that fits with the data capabilities of small farms. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The focus of this research is to design data and technology architectures that fit with the capabilities of small farms. Data collection will include a series of in-depth interviews with selected small farmers and government officials in NY?s Capital District and representatives of UAlbany, which will serve as the institutional buyer. The research team will use qualitative analysis of the interview data to identify the critical factors needed to design appropriate technology and data architectures for small farms. In addition, the results will be used to document the policy, organizational, governance, and technical components needed to enable whole-chain traceability from small farms to institutional buyers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Many government agencies, businesses, organizations and citizens assume food products originate on a farm, but that is usually the extent of their modern food-chain knowledge.  Tracking the journey a food product takes from its origin to the dinner table is difficult. However, it is important to trace food products every step of the way to ensure each product is free of food-borne illness and for economic development purposes.  Our team at CTG UAlbany explored the unique characteristics of small farmers as food producers in New York?s Capital Region, plus the potential benefits and challenges of food traceability with funding from a National Science Foundation Early-Concept Grant for Exploratory Research.  Our researchers partnered with Biology Professor Gary Kleppel from the Kleppel Lab for Agricultural Ecology and Sustainable Food Production at the University at Albany for this study.  Based on in-depth interviews with small local farmers, non-profits, food distributors, institutional buyers, and key government managers and policy makers our team identified enablers and barriers affecting small farmers? willingness and ability to participate in a food traceability system.  UAlbany Biology and Public Administration undergraduate and graduate students conducted interviews, analyzed data, and helped publish results throughout the process.  Thanks to the data gathered and analysis of it, our research team developed a preliminary framework that could help to develop the data and technology architecture needed for food traceability. The framework includes data specifications, policies, and governance elements that could help build an effective food traceability system between small farms and consumers.  Findings from this project were presented at the 2018 Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences and published in the conference proceedings.
