<AbstractNarration>The Research Experience for Undergraduates Site: Polymer Innovation for a Sustainable Future (REU) at the University of Southern Mississippi School of Polymers and High Performance Materials engages students from across the country in research aimed at sustainable approaches to materials development. Sustainable materials research addresses the challenge of meeting global societal needs while sustaining natural resources and reducing impact on the environment.  REU participants perform research designed to improve utilization of energy and raw materials in state-of-the-art facilities with interdisciplinary research teams.  A diverse population of students, 50% of whom are women, 27% from underrepresented groups, and 60% from primarily undergraduate institutions, are recruited to the program.  Over 70% of participants seek advanced degrees in science and engineering disciplines upon graduation. The grand challenges of science and engineering for the 21st century require the engagement and the talent of the diverse student population.  The REU program helps to build the pipeline of highly skilled next generation scientists and engineers necessary for the continued economic strength and prosperity of the nation. This site is funded by the REU Site Programs of the Division of Materials Research and the Division of Chemistry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research objective of the REU site is to develop sustainable approaches to materials development to meet critical societal and technological needs. Ten students are recruited from primarily undergraduate and minority institutions across the country for a ten-week research experience. Undergraduate student researchers are engaged in fundamental research projects that span the complex, interdisciplinary facets of materials sustainability, including synthesis of polymers from renewable feedstocks, enhancing process efficiency, designing materials for environmental remediation, and improving performance in renewable energy materials. They work alongside graduate student and faculty mentors in interdisciplinary research in state-of-the-art polymer synthesis, analysis, and processing research laboratories. Participants build interdisciplinary communication skills through participative workshops and outreach activities in the community, gain exposure to materials manufacturing challenges through interaction with local polymer businesses, and gain appreciation for environmental impact of materials through lectures, field trips, and literature review. Students present their research in podium and poster formats on campus and in regional and national technical meetings. The REU site helps develop the pipeline of science and engineering researchers with the skills to address the challenges of the next century while advancing fundamental research to enable implementation of environmentally sustainable materials applications such as polymeric solar cells and polymers from renewable feedstocks for drug delivery. This site is funded by the REU Site Programs of the Division of Materials Research and the Division of Chemistry.</AbstractNarration>

Over the summers of 2017 - 2019, participants explored fundamental research that spanned the complex, interdisciplinary facets of materials sustainability, including polymer synthesis from renewable sources, materials with enhanced properties and lifetime, materials to improve utilization of natural resources, reduced energy polymer processes, and biodegradable materials.&nbsp; Strengthening the theme of sustainability, students acquired skills and tools to assess the environmental impact of new material development, and were encouraged to consider these aspects at each stage of their research projects.&nbsp; In addition to spending 40 hours per week in the laboratory with graduate students and faculty advisors, the diverse cohort of students (including 23 women, 12 underrepresented minorities, and 24 from primarily undergraduate institutions) participated in foundational courses in polymer science and engineering, communication skills training, field trips to local industry, career exploration, and seminars by graduate students and visiting scientists.&nbsp; The students practiced and developed effective scientific communication skills by providing two oral presentations and a final poster session explaining the results of their research.&nbsp; REU participants in each cohort worked on engaging the next generation of scientists and engineers by facilitating outreach events for K-12 students participating in the local urban summer camp that featured hands-on polymer science activities.&nbsp; The research efforts of the participants resulted in four refereed publications and twenty-four presentations at national and regional conferences with REU co-authors.&nbsp; Twenty-six of the 46 participants are currently pursuing graduate degrees or applying to graduate school, eight have secured positions in industry, one is working in another field, and the remaining students are still undergraduates in chemistry, biochemistry, engineering, or materials science at their home institutions.

REU participants in each cohort worked on engaging the next generation of scientists and engineers by facilitating outreach events for K-12 students participating in the local urban summer camp that featured hands-on polymer science activities.  The research efforts of the participants resulted in four refereed publications and twenty-four presentations at national and regional conferences with REU co-authors.  Twenty-six of the 46 participants are currently pursuing graduate degrees or applying to graduate school, eight have secured positions in industry, one is working in another field, and the remaining students are still undergraduates in chemistry, biochemistry, engineering, or materials science at their home institutions.
