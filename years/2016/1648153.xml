<AbstractNarration>This award will support student travel to the 2016 IEEE Cyber Security Development Conference to be held in Boston in November 2016. The Cyber Security Development Conference (SecDev) provides a venue for presenting ideas, research and experience about the development of secure systems. SecDev is distinguished by its focus on how to "build security in". Its goal is to encourage and disseminate new ideas for secure system development among both academia and industry. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SecDev encourages students to consider "big" ideas that will lead to a stimulating, thoughtful, and perhaps (gently) provocative discussion. The support from NSF will be used to sponsor travel expenses for students to attend the conference. The training and development of students in this way will help to widen the talent pool of professionals and researchers focused on addressing challenges of developing critical secure systems and services. The proposed effort particularly encourages students from under-represented populations and institutions.</AbstractNarration>
