<AbstractNarration>The Large Hadron Collider (LHC), located at the CERN particle physics laboratory in Switzerland, is the largest machine that humanity has ever constructed and allows scientists to study matter and energy on the smallest scales. The goal of these efforts  is to answer questions about how our Universe came into exisitence and how it evolved to look the way it does today. The PI is a member of the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) experiment, one of the large particle detectors at the LHC that collects data produced by the collisions of 40 million protons every second. The CMS collaboration consists of 3000 scientists the world over that study all the different particles that come out of these collisions in an effort to understand precisely how they were produced and whether or not there are indications of new Physics: cracks in our current understanding of Nature or glimpses of new and exciting theories.  This project looks for new physics through the search for as-yet-unobserved decays of the top quark, one of the particles that make up the list of fundamental particles known to date. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI will be conducting an analysis to search for baryon-number violating (BNV) decays of the top quark. The top quark is the most massive fundamental particle yet discovered, and while it was first observed 20 years ago, it is only relatively recently that experiments have begun to collect enough data to study them in detail. This analysis is related to another as-of-yet unobserved phenomenon, proton decay. Some theories suggest that the same protons that are found in every atom will eventually decay away and these theories are invoked to try to explain why our Universe is dominated by matter and does not consist of equal amounts of matter and antimatter. Any sign of BNV decays, whether in top quarks or protons or other particles, would instantly change how we understand fundamental particle interactions. A preliminary analysis was performed with the first set of data from CMS, but in the next couple of years, we will have 10x the data to work with and so we will be much more sensitive to any signs of new physics. In parallel, the PI will continue to work on innovative outreach techniques, such as making real experimental data from CMS and other experiments available to teachers and the general public, simplifed so that anyone can use it and learn from it. The PI will also continue to host high school teachers for workshops where they build cloud chambers, one of the earliest particle detectors, for use in their classrooms.</AbstractNarration>

While this search was performed with Run I data, this analysis will extend the scientific reach by taking advantage of the increased statistics in Run II data as well as by integrating two new approaches. The first of these approaches will increase the number of final states searched for by not limiting ourselves to any particular effective field theory and instead use a phase-space approach to simulating the decays. The code for this was developed during this grant period&nbsp; in part by a Siena student who has since gone on to get their teaching certification in preparation to teach science in the NY-state K-12 system. In the second approach, we have built on the work of others to perform top ?tagging? in which a machine-learning algorithm is applied to a kinematic description of an event to identify a hadronically-decaying top. This grant period allowed us to extend this to incorporate the full dynamics of the event and identify events with both a hadronically-decaying top quark and the baryon-number violating partner, in a way that reduces our dependence on models. This work was developed in collaboration with a Siena student who is currently in graduate school for physics. CMS is wrapping up a re-processing of the Run II data, the Ultra-Legacy datasets, which will make analyses much easier. As we wait for this dataset, the Siena group has rewritten the bulk its analysis software to use the new NanoAOD format and coffea framework, developed out of Fermilab?s LPC group, all of which will not only speed up this current analysis, but make it easier for Siena students to contribute to this and future extensions of this analysis.&nbsp;</span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p dir="ltr"><span>The Siena group has become more integrated into the efforts of the CMS Data Preservation and Open Access (DPOA) group.

These datasets have already yielded scientific results from theorists who used these data to test their own ideas directly. Feedback from these users motivated better documentation and the idea of a workshop. Siena students helped test and vet documentation tools and software examples and in 2020, the DPOA group hosted the first of these workshops with a second to follow in 2021.

During this grant period, significant improvements were made to the website. The most significant change involved moving the tutorials to use Google?s cloud-based Colab python environment, rather than downloading the data and notebooks. This meant that anyone with a Chromebook could start ?analyzing? CMS data. The second improvement involved moving the data to a Siena-developed file description built on HDF5, a standard file format used in many big-data projects. This makes the user experience much more uniform, whether they are working with CMS or CLEO data. At the end of these changes, Siena students developed video tutorials for how to use the website and access the data. This website has proven very popular, not just for use in Siena classes, but ?in the wild?.

It?s been very rewarding to see this impact on others.</span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 02/08/2021<br>      Modified by: Matthew&nbsp;Bellis</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1608779/1608779_10438481_1612800891813_CODASTposter--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1608779/1608779_10438481_1612800891813_CODASTposter--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Workshop poster"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1608779/1608779_10438481_1612800891813_CODASTposter--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Workshop poster"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Poster for the first ever CMS Open Data Workshop for Theorists.
