<AbstractNarration>Nearly all primates are tropical mammals, with only a handful of species living in temperate environments. How do primates adapt to non-tropical environments? This study uses state-of-the-art, non-invasive techniques to expand our understanding of wild primate physiology, metabolism and behavioral adaptations to environmental stressors not normally encountered within tropical habitats. Results will inform our understanding of primate physiology, body size variation, and evolutionary history in more seasonal habitats. This project offers a variety of key student research experiences that include undergraduate research opportunities (including for students from underrepresented groups), student training in field and analytic methods, and mentoring students in the production of both MSc and PhD projects. The project will foster international research collaborations and capacity building at the field location. In addition, the project will provide important knowledge facilitating effective husbandry and management of zoo primates, and will contribute DNA data to the International Barcode of Life Program to track primate poaching and illegal bushmeat trade. This project is co-funded by the Office of International Science and Engineering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A broadly comparative approach will be taken to understand how two nocturnal primate species of dramatically different body sizes react to the stressful ecology of temperate habitats. Otolemur crassicaudatus (3.3 lbs) and Galago moholi (5.15oz) will be studied at the Lajuma Research Centre, located high in the Soutpansberg Mountains and characterized by a temperate climate with cold humid winters and warm-to-hot humid summers. Methodology to assess physiological responses include isotopic ecology from hair samples (which will help characterize each species' diet across months), metabolomics (which provides relative nutrition at the molecular level), nutritional ecology and stress hormones from fecal samples, and assessment of health and dental ecology in relation to habitat stressors. Behavioral comparisons will provide real-time assessment of each species' thermoregulation by using portable, professional-grade thermal imaging devices and infrared cameras, allowing remote recording of the primate's body temperature throughout nightly follows. Such comparative data are relevant for evaluating the limitations of primate adaptation, for understanding how ancestral primates mediated past environmental change, and for clarifying the mechanisms and physiological patterns underlying primate resilience in changing environmental conditions.</AbstractNarration>

Indeed, of the more than 500+ extant primate species (including humans), only a handful inhabit temperate environs. So how do non-human primates adapt to non-tropical environments? &nbsp;Unlike humans, who use cultural adaptations to inhabit these more challenging habitats, temperate non-human primates must cope with periods of cold temperatures,&nbsp;strong seasonal changes in food availability and sometimes even snow!&nbsp; Most temperate primates are large in body size and are active only during warmer daylight hours-- suggesting that these traits are important in allowing them to cope with temperate habitat stressors. In comparison there are only a few nocturnal primates that also exist in these environments.&nbsp; They are thus especially informative for understanding the limitations and requirements for living in these more difficult habitats.</p> <p>This research focused on the physiological and behavioral responses to environmental stress by two related, sympatric continental South African primate species,&nbsp;<em>Otolemur crassicaudatus</em>&nbsp;(3 lbs) &nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Galago moholi</em>&nbsp; (5.15oz). These species differ dramatically in body size and inhabit a high altitude montane habitat characterized by a temperate climate with cold humid winters and warm-to-hot humid summers and periods of low food availability. Importantly, while most nocturnal primates adapt to temperate forests by employing torpor or hibernation, these two study species are unusual in being able to adjust to the challenging environment of temperate South Africa without these metabolic adjustments, and are thus not following other general climatic rules (e.g. higher basal metabolic rates and larger body size in colder environments). Exactly how they do this was the focus of this project.&nbsp;</p> <p>Cutting edge methodology to assess physiological and behavioral responses included isotopic ecology from hair samples (which characterize diet across months), metabolomics (which provides relative nutrition at the molecular level), fecal nutritional ecology (which gives data on diet), endocrinology (which provides patterns of stress hormones using fecal samples) and direct assessment of health in relation to habitat stressors. Behavioral, dietary and physiological adjustments to environmental stress were also determined using camera trap technology and by real-time night follows of each species using a portable infrared thermal camera, which allowed remote recording of the primate's body temperature throughout nightly follows.</p> <p>Results demonstrate thermal infrared technology is especially useful for understanding thermoregulation and physiology in nocturnal mammals. During health evaluations the project validated, for the first time, that thermal readings of the eye most closely correlates with body temperature while readings of the nose (rhinarium) correlate best with ambient temperatures. Thermoregulation is impacted by body size, with the smaller&nbsp;<em>Galago</em>&nbsp;maintaining a higher internal body temperature during both warm and cold periods when compared to the larger&nbsp;<em>Otolemur</em>, indicating a higher physiological cost for the small-bodied species. Such higher costs result in different feeding patterns. Tree gum is a key food resource for both species but it is difficult to digest. As larger body size links to lower metabolic rates and greater gut capacity that facilitate gum digestion in the larger&nbsp;<em>Otolemur&nbsp;</em>species, they may feed more efficiently on gum. Indeed, they used this food resource more consistently compared to the smaller&nbsp;<em>Galago</em>&nbsp;who only emphasized this food when insects were less available during the cold season. Such comparative data are relevant for assessing the limitations of primate adaptation, for understanding how ancestral primates mediated past climatic change, and for clarifying the mechanisms and physiological patterns underlying primate resilience, which is key to predicting how species may adjust to ongoing climate change.</p> <p>Research experiences for both U.S. and South African students were provided, including three U.S. University of Colorado undergraduates who received REU training and support.
