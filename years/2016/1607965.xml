<AbstractNarration>The conference Nonparametric Statistics: Integration of Theory, Methods and Applications will be held at the University of Michigan, October 5-7, 2016. (See http://sites.lsa.umich.edu/npworkshop2016/.) The goal of the conference is to bring together researchers in nonparametric statistics, practitioners requiring these methods, and graduate students interested in this area, in a relaxed and stimulating atmosphere focused on research and applications. The development of nonparametric methods contribute to an essential part of modern data analysis and provide important research topics within statistics. Reduction or elimination of overfitting, uncontrollable biases and elevated variation through approaches supported by theoretical and numerical investigations have always been the key exercises in the field of nonparametric statistics. Exposure to and understanding of these methods are essential to practical applications and education of the next-generation statisticians. NSF funding will ensure that junior researchers are able to attend this conference.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The University of Michigan will host a conference on Nonparametric Statistics: Integration of Theory, Methods and Applications, October 5-7, 2016. Plenary speakers for the conference are Peter Bickel, Raymond Carroll, David Ruppert, and Jane-Ling Wang. The goal of the conference is to bring together researchers in nonparametric statistics, practitioners requiring these methods, and graduate students interested in this area, in a relaxed and stimulating atmosphere focused on research and applications. This award provides travel support for junior researchers to attend the conference.</AbstractNarration>

The title of the conference "Nonparametric Statistics: Integration of Theory, Methods and Applications'' reflects the theme.  The conference, taking place at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor on October 5-7, 2016, consists of 35 oral presentations, and a well attended poster session where 27 junior participants presented their research outcomes.   There were 132 registered attendees and many local students/researchers participated.  The funding given by NSF provided partial travel support for 26 junior researchers at the levels of Assistant Professor, Post-Docs and Ph.D. students.  Additional matching support from University of Michigan, only being made possible as a match of the NSF award, allows us to warrant a diverse group of presenters, including underrepresented researchers. The conference covers the areas of statistical network modeling and ultra high dimensional data analysis; functional and image data analysis with highlight on neuroimaging research; semiparametric solutions and efficiency consideration in the areas of nutritional risk scores and gene-environment integrations and dynamic modeling with emphasis on astronomy and economic applications.  The conference has successfully promoted stimulating interactions and exchanges of ideas among participants.  In addition, it provides junior researchers ample opportunities to interact with and learn from prominent researchers in the field, as well as building connections among participants.
