<AbstractNarration>Monarch butterflies (Danaus plexippus) are best-known from their North American range but more recently have also become established on nearly every Pacific island chain. Because of their geographic isolation, these island populations of monarch butterflies provide ideal ?natural experiments? for addressing ecological and evolutionary questions about the monarch butterfly.  This project will focus on museum specimens and live-caught monarchs from Australia?where populations of migratory and non-migratory monarchs co-occur?and will be in collaboration with Dr. Myron Zalucki (University of Queensland), the world?s foremost expert on Pacific island monarchs. Results from this research will contribute to a better understanding of (1) the genes and environmental cues that govern monarch migration, (2) how migratory and non-migratory monarchs may differ in their morphology, behavior, and interactions with parasites and (3) the strategies employed by milkweed host plants to cope with monarch herbivory. This information will contribute to strategies for protecting North American monarchs, which are currently being petitioned for federally protected status.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Oceanic islands have long served as valuable natural laboratories for understanding evolutionary processes over both contemporary and long-term time scales. Monarch butterflies on Pacific islands provide replicated natural experiments for investigating transitions from migratory to non-migratory status as well independent re-associations with their milkweed host plants.  For this project, I will focus on Australian monarchs (both museum specimens and live-caught individuals) and their milkweed host plants. This will enable me to answer questions about (1) the short-term evolution of monarch wing morphology and antennal circadian rhythm expression in relation to migratory status, (2) the prevalence and virulence of the protozoan parasite Ophryocystis elektroschirrha, and (3) the evolution of resistance and/or tolerance traits in novel milkweed host plants.  The results of this research will contribute to a greater understanding of the basic biology of the monarch butterfly and potentially aid in its conservation.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This award under the East Asia and Pacific Summer Institutes program supports summer research by a U.S. graduate student and is jointly funded by NSF and the Australian Academy of Science.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Monarch butterflies (Danaus plexippus) are best known from North America, where they seasonally migrate thousands of miles to and from overwintering sites in Mexico.  These North American monarchs have many adaptations that make them well-suited to long-distance migration, including the ability to postpone their reproductive development as adults and re-allocate these resources to energy storage for their journey.  While much research to date has focused on North American monarch butterflies, monarchs are also established in many locations throughout the world, including Australia, where they form non-migratory populations that breed year round.  There are many changes associated with the loss of migration: for example, non-migratory monarchs have wings that are smaller and rounder than migratory monarchs, and non-migratory monarchs are also much more likely to host parasites than migrants.  While it is clear that migrants and residents differ in important aspects of their biology, it is currently unknown whether resident monarchs retain the ability to resume migration, or whether the shift to non-migratory status is an irreversible change.  For this project, I worked with Dr. Myron Zalucki at the University of Queensland and tested whether resident Australian monarch butterflies are still able to respond to seasonal cues associated with the onset of migration in their North American ancestors.  To do this, I exposed Australian monarch caterpillars to either decreasing daylength (associated with the onset of migration in North America) or constant daylength and assessed reproductive development in the resulting butterflies.  I found that Australian monarchs do indeed respond to decreasing daylengths and that female butterflies reared under these conditions show significantly reduced reproductive development and greater body mass compared to butterflies raised under constant daylength.  This reduced reproductive development and greater body mass is associated with increased ability to migrate long distances.  However, the degree of this response in Australian monarchs does not appear to be as strong as that seen in North American migratory monarchs.  These results suggest that resident Australian monarchs retain the capacity to resume migration, but that they simply may not experience the relevant seasonal cues that typically induce migration in North America.  In addition to my work with Dr. Zalucki, I was also able to visit numerous museum collections throughout Australia to photograph monarch butterflies collected as long ago as 1871.  These specimens were added to a database of monarch butterfly images that is being used to determine how residents and migrants differ in their wing morphology and whether there is ongoing evolution in the size and shape of wings in butterflies that have shifted to non-migratory status.  The results of the first study above have been submitted for publication to a scientific journal, and the results of the second study are being analyzed and prepared for submission. Finally, working with Dr. Zalucki has provided me with an invaluable contact for completing my dissertation, and I continue to collaborate with him on other aspects of my research.   This research is important for understanding the basic biology of the monarch butterfly, which has recently seen steep declines in its native North American range.  Understanding the changes that accompany the loss of migration can potentially inform conservation efforts and provide a window into the future of North American monarch butterflies if declines in the numbers of migrants do not stop.
