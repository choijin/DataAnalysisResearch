<AbstractNarration>A goal of the Tribal Colleges and Universities Program (TCUP) is to increase the science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) instructional and research capacities of specific institutions of higher education that serve the Nation's indigenous students. Expanding the research capacity at these institutions expands the opportunities for students to pursue challenging, rewarding careers in STEM fields, provides for research studies in areas that may be locally relevant, and encourages a faculty community to look beyond the traditional classroom for intellectual and professional growth. This project aligns directly with that goal, allowing tribal college students and faculty to engage in international research while developing as a cohort of scientists with share experience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Salish Kootenai College will facilitate the travel for up to sixteen students and up to eight faculty to participate in research experiences at the Organization for Tropical Studies at the Las Cruces Biological Research Station, in Costa Rica.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The goal of the Costa Rica International Research Experience (CRIRE) project was fourfold, 1) enhance research skills for TCU students, 2) enhance research and mentoring skills for TCU faculty researchers, 3) to improve the participation rate in the full 8-week summer research program by exposing TCU students to an international experience on a short term project, and 4) development of cultural capital of participants through cross-cultural and cross-institutional experiences. The 13 day program is hosted at the Las Cruces Biological Station (LCBS). The LCBS is located near the border with Panama, just outside the small town of San Vito, Costa Rica. The LCBS has housing, dining, and lab facilities to accommodate the group. TCU Students, along with their Faculty Mentors conducted small field research projects. Students and Faculty Mentors applied the scientific method through ecological inquiry and discovery in a collaborative and team-oriented environment. Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) experts from the Ng?be and Bugle indigenous groups of this region shared their knowledge of the various plants, animals, birds, and insects within the environment to the students and mentors, along with sharing their environmental concerns with CRIRE participants. Students were selected through a review process that involved letters of recommendation, paper stating research interests, and how this experience would help them reach their educational and research goals. In addition, Faculty Mentors were paired up with two students with similar research interests. Because there is research being conducted, an approval must be obtained by the Costa Rican government. Therefore, the CRIRE limits the number of projects to 6 or fewer, which for project management, is a good for the timeframe and number of participants.&nbsp; Students report that the experience has been very informative, as about half have not conducted field research projects. In addition, most students did not have a passport, thus have never left the country. Students also appreciated meeting the indigenous people of the area and exchanging cultures and traditions. Faculty mentors enjoy getting out in the field with motivated students in a new environment. Overall, the CRIIRE is a very successful project that TCU students and faculty get a lot more out of then just conducting research in an international setting.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 03/22/2019<br>      Modified by: Steven&nbsp;D&nbsp;Dupuis</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
