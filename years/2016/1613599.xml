<AbstractNarration>The LSAMP program began in 1991 as a multidisciplinary comprehensive undergraduate program designed to increase substantially the number of minority students receiving baccalaureate degrees in STEM field. Awards have grown from 6 alliances to 45 state and regional alliances which encompass more than 600 institutions. The program is considered by many to be the crown-jewel of broadening participation programs. The knowledge of how LSAMP was able to accomplish this incredible feat needs a forum where the stakeholders can highlight to the nation NSF's LSAMP strategy and help to build the knowledge base on models and evidenced-based approaches to recruitment and retention.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is an important step in advancing the knowledge of underrepresented minority students in STEM through the LSAMP project directors. The experiences gained by principal investigators working with other science and education faculty will position them to address the nation's great challenge of producing more minority scientists. Reviewing the rich history of the past twenty five (25) years of a successful program will contribute to the nation's understanding of effective practices that contribute to the trajectories of minority scientists in both research and the professoriate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project, through implementation of this conference, broadens participation of underrepresented groups in graduate and undergraduate education with the real prospect of increasing the number of such groups attaining doctoral and other degrees in STEM and entering the professoriate. Discovery and understanding resulting from this conference will enhance the participation of underrepresented minorities in STEM fields.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The National Science Foundation Showcases Successful Strategies that produced over 600,000 Minority Science and Engineering Graduates    Washington, D.C., Feb. 29, 2016 &ndash; More than 800 scientists and their students recently gathered near Washington D.C. to share strategies that have resulted in more than 600,000 minorities receiving degrees in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) since 1991. Attendees traveled from across the United States to participate in the 25th Louis Stokes Alliances for Minority Participation (LSAMP) Research Symposium, which was held February 22 &ndash; 24 in National Harbor, Maryland.    Throughout the symposium, professors, undergraduate and graduate students, and professionals exchanged best practices. The Symposium started by reviewing lessons learned by the original six alliances.  This session, chaired by the Symposium Chair, William McHenry, Jackson State University, included the NSF Assistant Director for Education and Human Resources, Joan Ferrini-Mundy, announcing a new NSF initiative to infuse broadening Participation throughout the academy called Inclusion.   Through a series of "What Works" sessions universities documented lessons learned which included the importance of motivation, research opportunities, summer bridge programs, Inter- and intra- partnership, the importance of institutional commitment, leadership, Mentoring, and networking.   NSF received the first "LSAMP Game Changer institutional award, while the late Representative Louis Stokes received the first LSAMP Game Changer individual award for changing the game as it relates to broadening participation of minorities in STEM.   The National Science Foundation (NSF) funds 45 LSAMP programs at more than 500 universities across the United States. NSF Director France A. C&oacute;rdova and OSTP Assistant Director for Science were among speakers discussing the program?s milestones.  Family members of the late Ohio Congressman Stokes accepted the award attended the symposium and banquet to salute Stokes? dedication award.    Dr. McHenry stated "The LSAMP is considered the "crown jewel" of federal programs designed to broaden participation of African-Americans, Hispanic Americans, Native Americans, Native Alaskans, and Native Hawaiians in STEM disciplines.  Dr. Clemencia Cosentino has been studying the LSAMP program for more than a decade and stated that the LSAMP has assisted universities develop effective broadening participations in Science Strategies.  Cosentino also noted, "We have come to recognize as a nation that we need not just build a STEM work force but a STEM-capable workforce &ndash; understanding science matters beyond STEM fields such as lawyers, media, and marketing.
