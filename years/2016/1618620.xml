<AbstractNarration>Memory is a key component of computers. Modern parallel architectures begin to employ heterogeneous memory to improve both latency and bandwidth of the memory subsystem. Typically, a heterogeneous memory system consists of a fast and a slow component and requires explicit software management. It puts unique burdens on programmers and compilers, especially in the domains of high-performance computing (HPC) and big data analytics. These challenges are crucial to the evolution of computer systems and therefore are key to future scientific discovery, economic prosperity, and national security. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To address these challenges in exploiting heterogeneous memory, this project targets co-designing the compiler and the operating system (OS): it explores i) a new compiler design that supports heterogeneity-aware data management and ii) new OS facilities for efficient data move and fair memory sharing. Overall, this project serves as a stepping stone towards a long-term vision -- taming emerging heterogeneous hardware by tightly integrating programming and OS support.</AbstractNarration>
