<AbstractNarration>The University of Georgia, Florida International University, Savannah State University, Clark Atlanta University and Fort Valley State University will lead this Design and Development Launch Pilot to address enhancing recruitment, retention, productivity and satisfaction of historically underrepresented minority (URM) undergraduate students who enroll in STEM graduate programs at primarily white (PWI) and research intensive (RI) universities.  This project was created in response to the Inclusion across the Nation of Communities of Learners of Underrepresented Discoverers in Engineering and Science (NSF INCLUDES) program solicitation (NSF 16-544). The INCLUDES program is a comprehensive national initiative designed to enhance U.S. leadership in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) discoveries and innovations focused on NSF's commitment to diversity, inclusion, and broadening participation in these fields.  The INCLUDES Design and Development Launch Pilots represent bold, innovative ways for solving a broadening participation challenge in STEM.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The full participation of all of America's STEM talent is critical to the advancement of science and engineering for national security, health and prosperity.  Our nation is advancing knowledge and practices to address the STEM education practices for retaining and educating URM undergraduate STEM students at our nation's research intensive universities (RIs). This project, NSF INCLUDES: An Integrated Approach to Retain Underrepresented Minority Students in STEM Disciplines, has the potential to advance a collaborative approach by a group of organizations to improve the success of URM undergraduates in STEM disciplines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The collaborating universities will work together for the purposes of empowering URM students to more effectively navigate STEM undergraduate and graduate education at minority serving institutions (MSIs) and PWIs, and for transforming the culture of PWIs and RIs.  The team plans to use evidence-based approaches to gain insights into cultural differences that impact the success of URM STEM students. Three interventions will be included in the pilot study: (1) undergraduate URM student exchanges between MSIs and PWIs, (2) collaborative inquiry to engage URM students in social science research about issues and experiences of under-representation in STEM, and (3) the adaptation of resources from the Center for the Integration of Research, Teaching and Learning (CIRTL) to train STEM faculty to embrace diversity and improve teaching in diverse classroom settings.  The project team plans to develop strategies to scale approaches and develop an alliance of institutions to maximize potential project outcomes.</AbstractNarration>

URM sophomores in STEM disciplines engaged in a semester-long exchange program wherein they placed at another institution in our Alliance (which consists of both research-intensive and masters institutions as well as minority-serving and majority institutions).

(1) Summer research programs are not enough: although several of our students participated in summer programs at their host institutions, their perceptions of and comfort with institutional culture were different during the academic year; (2) Collaborative Inquiry was cathartic and allowed students to &ldquo;process&rdquo; experiences at their host campuses. For example, at the University of Georgia (UGA, the majority institution in the Alliance), this processing often involved perceived microaggressions and differences in institutional culture; (3) at UGA, the collaborative inquiry coordinator was a faculty member from Europe whose lived experience was different from those of both the students and their majority peers. This was of benefit to collaborative inquiry, as it empowered the students as &ldquo;teachers&rdquo; of their culture; (4) Several themes emerged from collaborative research that provides insights into the impact of institutional culture on URM STEM students, including (a) <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Dress Codes</span>: Exchange students at UGA perceived a sense of entitlement in their majority peers, based on the informal way they were dressed when they came to class. (b) <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Code-switching</span>: Exchange students perceived a need to assimilate and not appear to be &ldquo;too Black&rdquo; or &ldquo;too Hispanic,&rdquo; especially at UGA. (c) <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Community/ manners</span>: The UGA community was viewed as rude and focused on the competition, rather than on &ldquo;collaboration,&rdquo; as was more typical at minority-serving institutions.

(e) <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Struggle as identity</span>: Exchange students were empowered by their struggles and viewed paternalistic attempts to soften their experiences as robbing them of their characters. The term &ldquo;I need to work for this&rdquo; was a common refrain.

(g) <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Don&rsquo;t forget where you came from</span>: Students were adamant about maintaining their identities and this was at the root of much of their activism. They rejected research mentors&rsquo; attempts to re-make them, emphasizing the need for mentors, faculty, and other students to recognize the value in their lived experiences.</p> <p>We also gleaned insights into management, both of a student exchange program and our Alliance. The National Student Exchange facilitated the process of enrolling students in coursework and ensuring that their grades transferred and were credited at their home institutions. However, complicated and at times, frustrating negotiations were still required to ensure exchange students were enrolled in courses that had comparable content and assessments as those at their home institutions.

This is just one example of the extensive network of academic partners that is necessary to administer a successful exchange program. By the end of the project, our system included representatives from housing and student affairs as well.
