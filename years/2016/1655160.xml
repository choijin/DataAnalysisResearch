<AbstractNarration>This project seeks to engage representatives of the scientific and engineering communities supported by NSF into an active dialogue aimed at making publicly available the results of scientific research sponsored by NSF. Scientists with a broad variety of expertise will come together for a workshop to discuss the lessons learned in previous domain-specific workshops, identify common needs regarding knowledge preservation and open access for the scientific and engineering communities, and suggest possible requirements that will promote broad public access to data. The latter are expected to be discipline dependent, but promoting a dialogue between communities is necessary in order to identify effective practices and cost-effective solutions to serve the community needs and to help pave the way to a world with broad public access to scientific data. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Making research data broadly available opens the scientific enterprise to citizen scientists and other researchers and enhances the potential for discovery. Recognizing that the transition from the Digital Age to the Big Data Age provides also the technical means needed to make public the research data from a wide variety of scientific inquiries, this workshop will play an import role towards the development of a framework by which public access can be accomplished. Economies of scale are expected by combining projects and infrastructure across various disciplines. As such, this effort will identify new opportunities for cross-disciplinary research by emphasizing the dataset and metadata interoperability in the design of archival systems.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   This award provided funding for a workshop that reviewed the results of a number of different projects that were funded by NSF to address questions in and around public access to research data. The projects themselves were quite diverse, encompassing workshops, tool-building and exploration, and innovative infrastructure support. Taken as a whole, the projects addressed almost every aspect of problems and issues surrounding public access to research results.      This workshop was one of the first times that representatives of most of the NSF directorates gathered to review issues, initiatives, and problems around public access to research data. The workshop clearly demonstrated that there exists consensus on many of the conclusions related to public access to data across the many disciplines represented by the NSF.  In particular, all of the scientific communities represented recognize the importance of data sharing, moving towards FAIR principles (that data should be Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) for research data. The surprising level of commonality let the participants to assert that NSF should be able to lead agency- and nation-wide efforts to solve the problems around public access.  Workshop participants laid out areas where the NSF can show real leadership on the national and even international stage, emphasizing that the NSF should continue to invest and coordinate projects in this area.
