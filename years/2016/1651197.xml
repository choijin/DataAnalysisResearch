<AbstractNarration>Vowel nasalization lies at the heart of a number of important, widely-attested diachronic and&lt;br/&gt;synchronic phonological processes throughout the world's languages. However, relatively little&lt;br/&gt;is understood about the mapping between the oro-pharyngeal articulatory system and the&lt;br/&gt;acoustics of phonemically nasal and phonetically nasalized vowels compared to their oral&lt;br/&gt;counterparts. This project combines state-of-the-art rt-MRI methods and sophisticated modeling&lt;br/&gt;techniques to solve some persistent problems regarding the synchronic and diachronic behavior&lt;br/&gt;of vowels in Brazilian Portuguese, with wider implications for many other languages with vowel&lt;br/&gt;nasalization.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This dissertation applies advanced methodologies in the collection and analysis of real-time&lt;br/&gt;magnetic resonance imaging (rt-MRI) to study phonemically nasal, phonetically nasalized, and&lt;br/&gt;oral vowels in Brazilian Portuguese. Researchers debate whether nasal vowels in Brazilian&lt;br/&gt;Portuguese are phonemically distinct or are underlyingly two segments (an oral vowel followed&lt;br/&gt;by a nasal consonant). This work will add a different perspective to this debate by constructing&lt;br/&gt;and analyzing a multi-speaker corpus of nasal, phonetically nasalized, and oral vowels.&lt;br/&gt;Analysis focuses on oro-pharyngeal differences in Brazilian Portuguese vowels, as well as&lt;br/&gt;velopharyngeal opening. This work aims to show that underlying oro-pharyngeal shape of oral&lt;br/&gt;vowels and nasalized vowels differs from those of phonemic nasal vowels, suggesting that each&lt;br/&gt;vowel has its own motor plan. This will add to a growing body of literature arguing that nasal&lt;br/&gt;vowels are not merely oral vowels affected by velopharyngeal opening, and that oro-pharyngeal&lt;br/&gt;differences in these vowels contribute to sound change. The project will also involve careful&lt;br/&gt;analysis of the acoustics of Brazilian Portuguese vowels and will extend to modeling the&lt;br/&gt;acoustics that can be drawn from MR images. This study will give more insight into the causes&lt;br/&gt;of diachronic sound change, specifically with regard to the feedback loop between speech&lt;br/&gt;perception and speech articulation.</AbstractNarration>
