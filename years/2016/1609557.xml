<AbstractNarration>With this award, the Chemistry of Life Processes Program in the Chemistry Division is funding a collaborative local team at Montana State University comprised of Dr. Eric Shepard (PI), Dr. Joan Broderick, Dr. Valérie Copié, and Dr. Robert Szilagyi to investigate the minimal protein structural requirements for generating and controlling organic radical chemistry in biology. The largest known superfamily of enzymes in Nature is the radical S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) superfamily. These metalloenzymes contain an iron-sulfur cluster that is responsible for the coordination and cleavage of the essential cofactor SAM.  The cleavage of SAM generates a radical intermediate species, known as the 5'-deoxyadenosyl radical, which is responsible for propagating a diverse array of chemical transformations essential to life. Examples of such transformations include DNA repair, RNA modification, protein activation, vitamin biosynthesis, and cofactor formation. This project employs parallel synthetic, spectroscopic, and computational investigations to develop and characterize iron-sulfur cluster complexes that are functional in SAM chemistry. These synthetic compounds are used to understand the specific SAM-based carbon-sulfur bond activation event that leads to 5'-deoxyadenosyl radical formation. Students are being trained in interdisciplinary research that encompasses biochemical, spectroscopic, kinetic, computational and synthetic methodologies. Outreach and educational activities are within the Native American and home-schooling communities from rural Montana. As part of these activities young scientists are being exposed to basic chemistry/biochemistry laboratory exercises, as well as advanced scientific problem solving techniques.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Enzymes in the radical S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) superfamily catalyze an incredible array of chemical transformations essential for life's processes. This diversity is propagated through a stoichiometrically simple Hydrogen-atom abstraction event.  At the core of radical SAM catalytic processes is a redox active [4Fe-4S] cluster that harbors a site-differentiated iron site that promotes the bidentate coordination of SAM.  Using a retrosynthetic approach, minimalist protein maquettes that coordinate site-differentiated [4Fe-4S] clusters are prepared to probe the importance of protein environment in fine-tuning the stability, reactivity, and selectivity of SAM based radical reactions. Complementary NMR, EPR, CD, UV-vis, HPLC, SAXS, XAS, and Mössbauer techniques, along with multi-layered DFT/MO/MM computational models are techniques that interrogate the structure, stability, and reactivity of the maquette complexes.  Chemical, structural, and mechanistic characteristics of the maquette complexes are investigated through structure-function relationships. The insights gained from [4Fe-4S] maquette studies may contribute to understanding how and why Nature uses this platform as its preferred method for generating and propagating radical reactions.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Biology catalyzes key electron transfer events accompanying chemical reactions using protein bound iron sulfur (Fe-S) metallocofactor units known as [Fe-S] clusters. [Fe-S] clusters are present in every kingdom of life and facilitate electron transfer events spanning nearly 1 volt in potential that are crucial for metabolic processes such as fermentation, photosynthesis, and respiration. Accordingly, [Fe-S]-enzymes are often considered to be modern molecular fossils, or relics of catalysts that persisted in ancient organisms. Two ancient and ubiquitous protein groups known as the radical <em>S</em>-adenosylmethionine (radSAM) and ferredoxin (Fd) superfamilies, respectively, utilize similar cysteine motifs to coordinate [Fe-S] clusters. RadSAM enzymes use a Cx<sub>3</sub>Cx<sub>2</sub>C motif ("x", any amino acid) to coordinate a site-differentiated (non-cysteinyl thiolate coordination) [4Fe-4S] cluster. A unique Fe site of the [4Fe-4S] cluster anchors SAM and facilitates the reductive cleavage of a specific carbon-sulfur bond to generate the highly reactive 5'-deoxyadenosyl radical; this radical carries out a spectacular array of hydrogen atom abstraction events that include isomerization reactions, vitamin and cofactor biosynthesis, DNA repair, ribonucleotide reduction, among many others. This contrasts significantly from that observed in bacterial Fd enzymes, wherein a conserved Cx<sub>2</sub>Cx<sub>2</sub>C motif coordinates a [4Fe-4S] cluster that only functions in electron transfer reactions.</p> <p>A molecular level understanding of the origin of selectivity in SAM-based carbon-sulfur bond cleavage, and the control imparted by the protein environment in directing SAM reactivity both require additional insights. While research in these areas has been driven by studying radSAM metalloenzymes, our project focused on the biomimetic approach of peptide maquette Fe-S chemistry. Maquettes provide a formidable tool that enables the construction of minimalistic protein models that in turn facilitate the controlled evaluation of how variations in peptide amino acid length and chemical composition, as well as small molecule coordination, tune [Fe-S] cluster structure and redox activity. Our research plan has thus addressed these chemical, structural, and mechanistic issues through establishing structure-function relationships for SAM metalloenzyme chemistry by creating and investigating [4Fe-4S]-maquettes using radSAM and Fd inspired peptides.</p> <p>We have utilized an integrated scheme of experimental and theoretical modeling approaches, with specific foci on chemical structure, composition, and reactivity (Figure 1). The synthetic results, small molecule binding, structure and composition determinations, and interpretation of spectroscopic results, were all guided by a range of computational methods that included empirical force field, semi-empirical quantum, and <em>ab initio</em> density functional theories. Through this approach, we developed a molecular structural toolkit for quantitatively analyzing peptide secondary structure elements with respect to [Fe-S] cluster nesting. Moreover, we created a computational protocol for conducting quantum molecular dynamics simulations for explicitly solvated peptides in the presence of Fe and S ions, which fostered a molecular level examination of [Fe-S] cluster assembly.

Expanded studies of longer peptide sequences (up to 29 amino acids) revealed that the chemical properties of the peptide nest can deleteriously impact [4Fe-4S] cluster coordination and stability, revealing that the biophysical properties of peptides must be carefully considered in bioinorganic maquette design. Our work has additionally shown that there exist strong connections that contribute to understanding the relationship between biological [4Fe-4S] clusters and geological FeS<sub>(aq)</sub> nanoparticles and minerals.
