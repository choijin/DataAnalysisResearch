<AbstractNarration>This award supports participation of junior researchers in the research conference "Latent Variables 2016" held at the University of South Carolina, October 12-14, 2016. The statistical concept of a latent variable (a quantity whose values are inferred rather than directly measured) is important for statistical analysis in a wide variety of fields, from medicine to social science to machine processing of natural language. The purpose of the Latent Variables conference is to encourage the exchange of research ideas in latent variables, and to motivate and direct future research in this and related areas.  The conference provides an excellent opportunity for young researchers to present their work, to learn about recent developments in the field, and to initiate new research collaborations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference features four plenary talks by leaders in the field, as well as six pairs of concurrent sessions, each with three speakers, that will include address research progress in several areas related to latent variables theory and analysis, including multiple testing, frailty models, objective Bayes analysis, factor models, diagnostic screening, model misspecification, group testing and biomarker pooling, item response theory, model-based clustering, generalized linear latent variable models, and measurement error models.  Poster sessions will provide additional opportunities for exchange of ideas, and one of the poster sessions is designated specifically for graduate students to present their research.  Additional information can be found at the conference web site:&lt;br/&gt;http://www.stat.sc.edu/latent-variables-2016</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The purpose of the Latent Variables Conference (LV16) was to encourage exchange of research ideas in areas that are strengths of the University of South Carolina Department of Statistics, to motivate and direct future research in these areas, and to recognize the fundamental contributions of Jayaram Sethuraman to foundational issues in latent variables theory.   The department has research interests in several areas related to latent  variables theory and methods, including factor models, nonparametric  Bayes, objective Bayes, model-based clustering, interval censoring,  frailty models, multiple testing, semiparametric methods, model  misspecification, group testing, and item response theory.  Department  faculty organized invited sessions focused on their specific areas of  research expertise.  The meeting allowed graduate students and younger faculty to present posters and talks, while providing them an opportunity to apply for competitive travel stipends to support their research.  Two of four  plenary speakers were women (Prof. Sonia Petrone, Universita Bocconi; Prof. Yanyuan Ma, Penn State University), so the conference motivated and modeled greater participation by female graduate students and faculty in statistical research.  The Latent Variables 2016 Conference was held October 12-14, 2016 at the University of South Carolina Alumni Center on the USC campus.  Just over 100 registrants attended 5 plenary talks, 12 invited sessions, a banquet in honor of Prof. Jayaram Sethuraman and a student poster session.  The conference was co-sponsored by the National Institute of Statistical Sciences, the Statistical and Applied Mathematical Sciences Institute, the NSF, and the University of South Carolina's Office of the Vice President for Research.  The NSF conference grant was used to reimburse $9418 in travel expenses for ten junior faculty and graduate students who served as invited speakers and poster presenters at the conference.  The grant made it feasible for these junior faculty and students to present their work.       Last Modified: 06/02/2017       Submitted by: John M Grego]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
