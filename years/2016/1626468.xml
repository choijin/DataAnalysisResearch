<AbstractNarration>An award is made to New Mexico State University to acquire an Orbitrap Fusion mass spectrometer, to be housed in the Chemical Analysis and Instrumentation Laboratory.  This instrumentation is the state-for-the art for chemical characterization of extremely complex mixtures and will be used in a wide variety of applications that range from alternative fuel research to disease research and fundamental biology. This instrument will be used to describe the chemical composition of complex mixtures to help improve the manner in which biomass is cultivated and processed into fuel and will be a key component to multiple health-related research projects including the imaging of live cells. Given the wide range of applications where the instrument will be used, this research will generate both novel applications and significant advancements in the application of this technology. Finally, the collaborative research projects that use the Orbitrap Fusion will provide a framework for discovery that will improve the ability of our institution to recruit and retain excellent faculty and will provide enormous opportunity for student participation in science and engineering. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The purpose of this acquisition is twofold. First, this acquisition will enable mass spectrometry-based proteomics for a number of collaborative research projects. Modern proteomic capability is currently absent in the state of New Mexico. The Orbitrap Fusion instrument architecture includes three orthogonal fragmentation techniques (electron transfer dissociation, collisional dissociation and higher energy collisional dissociation) and multiplex-in-time ion fragmentation capability, all of which are critical for modern quantitative proteomics and the analysis of protein post-translational modification. Second, with respect to multiple current research efforts in energy, environment and lipid applications, the Orbitrap Fusion offers excellent mass accuracy, ion transmission efficiency across a broad mass range and high resolving power for complex mixture analysis with collisional and higher energy collisional fragmentation methods to aid structural elucidation. Within those project areas, we will utilize the Orbitrap Fusion for the analysis of bio-oils and fuel precursors from biomass thermotreatment and upgrading, algal growth media and feedstocks, lipid mixtures from various biofuel feedstocks and complex environmental samples.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Introduction: Mass spectrometry is an analytical technique that determines the mass of ionized molecules to deduce their identity and abundance in a sample. Various configurations exist and each type of mass spectrometer has inherent advantages and limitations. The NMSU Chemical Analysis and Instrumentation Laboratory (CAIL) specializes in the application of high mass resolution spectrometers that are capable of analyzing some of the world's most complex mixtures.This project funded the purchase of such a system, an Orbitrap Fusion mass spectrometer that is the state of the art technology for multiple types of complex mixture analysis. With this project, we have utilized the Orbitrap Fusion to analyze samples that answer important questions in biofuel development, mass spectrometry instrumentation, environmental engineering, and biomedical applications.  Intellectual Merit: Our project combined high resolution mass spectrometry experience at CAIL with topic-specific expertise in various application areas, through collaboration with thirteen different laboratories.  For biofuel research, we utilized the Orbitrap Fusion to develop mass spectrometry measurement capability that ultimately described the detailed chemical composition of biocrude oils produced from multiple wet industrial feedstocks by a process called hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL). Those efforts allowed biofuel researchers to monitor the efficacy of relevant processes, optimize performance and to consider how these biofuels might integrate into a traditional petroleum refinery stream. Part of that effort included CAIL development of new instrumentation modes of operation that improve our ability to see low-abundance compounds and those techniques are pertinent to many areas of research. In the area of environmental engineering, we utilized the Orbitrap Fusion system to analyze multiple types of contaminated water to help our engineering collaborators understand and optimize their treatment technologies. One such technology has been developed by Co-PI Nagamany Nirmalakhandan and Pei Xu at NMSU and uses algae in combination with membrane permeation to clean municipal wastewater for potential reuse in agriculture. We developed instrumentation approaches with the Orbitrap Fusion that monitor the removal of contaminants with excellent specificity and sensitivity for this and other projects. Our project developed a local resource for the analysis of lipids and proteins for biomedical research applications. Most prominently, the Orbitrap Fusion was used to monitor the labeling of lipids, which are important molecules in cells that control cell shape and functionality, with fluorescent tags that can be used to make images of living cells. This effort was a collaboration between the research groups of Co-PI Jeff Arterburn and the CAIL lab.  Broader Impacts: Our project established a regionally unique high resolution mass spectrometry resource and provided a basis for many collaborations that have led to new research funding and investigation. The availability of the Orbitrap Fusion catalyzed the acquisition of multiple pieces of supporting equipment that improve our institutional capacity to tackle modern research questions.

We hosted a proteomics summer boot camp for interested researchers and students, hosted Orbitrap Fusion lab demonstrations for classes and included Orbitrap Fusion data in ten graduate student projects and four postdoctoral research projects.  Summary: This project built a regionally unique analytical instrumentation capability at New Mexico State University that serves interdisciplinary collaboration in research areas that are critical to improving the lives of New Mexicans. The collaborative research supported by this project seeks to find ways to clean and reuse impaired water, provide new energy sources for a booming world population and improving human health through new understanding of molecular intricacies of biological systems.
