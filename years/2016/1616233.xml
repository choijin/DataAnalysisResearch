<AbstractNarration>Chemical reaction networks lie at the heart of biological processes at the cellular level such as signal transduction, development, gene expression and metabolism.  Cells need to be sensitive to environmental signals, while being robust to unwanted cell-to-cell and environmental variability.  This research will characterize the chemical reaction networks that are absolutely robust with respect to some proteins in the system (background noise and variability) but not to others (molecular signals).  While there are many mechanisms for implementing robustness, the proposed framework relies on intrinsic structural properties of the network. Key downstream proteins are activated and deactivated, so that at steady state the active form has exactly the same concentration in all cells, while inactive forms act as buffers to absorb excess protein.  The goals include: (1) generalizing existing results on absolute robustness to allow for robustness with respect to some proteins but not others, and applying these results to bacterial two-component models; (2) determining the viability of ultrasensitivity, specificity and other signal processing mechanisms in absolutely robust networks; (3) calculating the mean and variance of stochastic absolutely robust systems, and implementing the results to better understand systems of cellular differentiation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Modern techniques to make measurements inside individual cells are increasingly demonstrating that protein concentrations routinely vary several fold from one cell to the next in cellular tissues.  An important question is to understand how cells handle such variability and perform in a consistent manner.  This question is relevant for many medical issues including abnormal cellular signaling and development.  It could also underlie problems of inconsistent cellular responses to drugs such as chemotherapies.  This grant will develop mathematical methods that are grounded in experimental data, which can help discover new molecular design principles for robustness to total protein concentrations.</AbstractNarration>
