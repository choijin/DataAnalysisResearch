<AbstractNarration>Just like changes in blood chemistry can be used to diagnose an individual?s health, so too can changes in river water chemistry be used to evaluate the condition of a river?s watershed.  In the Arctic, six massive rivers capture freshwater runoff from two-thirds of the land area that drains to the Arctic Ocean.  The chemistry of this runoff reflects watershed characteristics (e.g. soil composition), and carries essential nutrients to the marine environment.  The overarching scientific objective of the Arctic Great Rivers Observatory (Arctic-GRO) is to make sustained observations of the chemistry of these six large rivers, which is vital for assessing changes on land that subsequently impact physical, chemical, and biological properties of the Arctic Ocean. The project involves partnerships with the Yukon River Intertribal Watershed Council, The Pilot Station Traditional Council, the Gwichya Gwich?in Renewable Resource Council, and with the University of Alaska at Kuskowkwin community college that serves the largely Yup?ik residents of the Yukon-Kuskowkwim Delta. . &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The six rivers included in the Arctic Great Rivers Observatory are the Yukon and Mackenzie in North American and the Ob?, Yenisey, Lena, and Kolyma in Eurasia.  The rivers will be sampled near their mouths, every two months for three years, using identical sample collection and preservation protocols.  Approximately 40 parameters will be measured on all samples including dissolved and particulate organic carbon concentrations and isotopic compositions, concentrations of dissolved nutrients, major ions, and trace elements, and optical properties of dissolved organic matter, including UV absorbance and fluorescence excitation-emission matrices.  For QA/QC purposes, every analysis will be conducted at a single laboratory.  The resulting data, along with complementary data on river discharge, will be made available without restriction at the Arctic-GRO website (arcticgreatrivers.org) and through the NSF Arctic Data Center.  Arctic-GRO data, which build on observatory records that extend back to 2003, provide valuable end-members for the oceanographic research community as well as for analyses of terrestrial landscape change.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The pan-Arctic is one of the regions requiring more immediate attention in association with global warming. Freshwater inflow contributes as much as 10% to the upper 100 meters of the water column for the entire Arctic Ocean. Thus, river flow to the Arctic Ocean plays a significant role in the oceanic freshwater budget, accounting for about two thirds of the total freshwater flux to the Arctic Ocean. Ocean salinity and sea ice formation are critically affected by river input and changes in the freshwater and heat fluxes to the ocean can exert significant control over global ocean circulation via the North Atlantic deep water formation. River flow also plays an important role as a nutrient supplier to near-shore and estuarine ecosystems of the Arctic Ocean, providing their biological productivity.  The major goal of the Arctic Great Rivers Observatory (ArcticGRO) is to observe the changing hydrologic and biogeochemical fluxes from the pan-arctic watershed to the Arctic Ocean.  ArcticGRO is specifically focused on largest Arctic rivers: the Yenisey, Ob?, Lena and Kolyma Rivers in Siberia and the Yukon and Mackenzie Rivers in North America.  Together the watersheds of these rivers cover more than 60% of the pan-arctic watershed. When ArcticGRO (then PARTNERS) began in 2003, our primary goal was to gather baseline data on key biogeochemical constituents in Arctic rivers that would support improved definition of watershed processes and land-to-ocean fluxes.  We recognized these baselines as moving targets in a rapidly changing Arctic, but focused our initial attention on capturing seasonal dynamics and inter-annual variability to support robust, well constrained averages that could be used to better understand biogeochemical transport and processing within the Arctic Ocean.  Now, 15 years later, we are at a point where we are not only providing the broader research community with well constrained estimates of constituent concentrations and fluxes in the major Arctic rivers, but capturing longer-term changes as well.  For example, ArcticGRO data show that alkalinity is increasing in all of the major Arctic rivers.  The increases are more pronounced in some rivers/seasons than others, but collectively the change in alkalinity signals a shift in how water is interacting with minerals as it moves through Arctic soils and stream networks.  Such changes have been attributed to permafrost thaw in other, more focused, studies within the Arctic, but ArcticGRO data show that this is a pan-Arctic phenomenon.  These data also underscore the fact that baselines are indeed changing, and that data users require long-term, up-to-date information on river chemistry to support robust data synthesis and modeling efforts aimed at understanding past, present, and future linkages across the watershed-ocean domains.  Besides biochemical information the near real-time river discharge data provided by ArcticGRO was widely used by research community to identify and understand ongoing changes in different components of water cycle across the pan-Arctic watersheds. We also used the data to provide analysis of contemporary changes in river flux to the Arctic Ocean, which was published in Arctic Report Cards for 2015 and 2018.  This analysis was then updated with additional data and published in the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society?s annual State of the Climate Reports for 2015 and 2018. We found that river flux to the Arctic Ocean continues to increase with major contribution to the growth from Lena and Yenisei rivers.          Project results were presented at numerous national and international scientific venues and were published in high-impact journals. In addition we have launched an ArcticGRO Twitter account (@Arctic_Rivers) to publicize the project (and encourage wider data use). ArcticGRO data are available for download on the project website (https://arcticgreatrivers.org/data/) and through the Arctic Data Center.
