<AbstractNarration>Previous international studies of mathematics and science education have provided important perspectives on the global competitiveness of STEM education in the United States. The world, including the world of mathematics in schools, has changed in many ways over the past 20 years especially in the area of technology which is closely related to the discipline of mathematics. Many countries have revised their mathematics standards and currently, questions about what is needed for a 21st century curriculum continue to drive curriculum reform in virtually every country. Questions around what students need to know and be able to do in the 21st century are central in curriculum reform discussions in the U.S. and other countries. These questions have led the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) to plan and develop the Education 2030 International Curriculum Analysis. This project will take advantage of the developing opportunity to participate in OECD's Education 2030 Curriculum Analysis to develop a current international benchmark in mathematics against which the Common Core Standards for Mathematics (CCSSM) and other College and Career Ready Standards may be evaluated. The project will provide a window on the state of 21st century skills currently incorporated by countries into their curriculum in various ways.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The project staff will lead the Mathematics Curriculum Document Analysis (MCDA) project. The specific questions to be addressed through the mathematics document-based analysis are: What are the topics and key concepts currently focused upon in mathematics standards (guidelines) across over 20 countries? What do mathematics curriculum documents - standards and textbooks - reveal about the current state of the focus, rigor, and coherence of the mathematics curriculum? What do mathematics curriculum documents - standards and textbooks - reveal about the coherent inclusion of 21st century skills expectations for students? To what extent are the Common Core State Standards for Mathematics reflected in or consistent with the current mathematics standards for leading countries, i.e., those whose students do well on international assessments such as TIMSS and PISA? The project will work with international partners to create a multidimensional framework for analysis of curriculum standards and conduct a multidimensional analysis of standards and textbooks in the US.</AbstractNarration>

An Opportunity to Learn Through Support for U.S. Participation in the OECD 2030 Curriculum Analysis Project          This project was sponsored by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECED) as part of the Education 2030 project. This project sought to help countries clarify what students need to know and be able to do upon compleiton of mandatory education in the year 2030.  As the expectations for students and their education only seems to increase each year, this project sought to clarify which aspects of these increased expectation are most essential and explore profitable strategies for addressing the ongoing pressure to add to the size and scope of the curriculum. The Mathematics Curriculum Document Analysis (MCDA) project sought to explore the extent to which each country's curriculum standards and commonly used eighth grade mathematics textbook incorporate any aspect of the expanded definition of mathematics literacy as defined for the upcoming PISA 2021.       This expanded concept of mathematics literacy together with consultation with leaders from diverse key economic sectors led to the development of a multidimentional Mathematics Framework to inform and guide all aspects of the MCDA. Five dimenstions identified in the Framework include: mathematics content including areas of statistics and data analysis for increased emphasis; the development of mathematical (quantitative) reasoning; making use of the fundamental mathematics concepts towards the development of deep undertanding of mathematics; development of key 21st century competencies or skills such as critical thinking most easily developed in the context of mathematics; and the authentic application of mathematics to address real-world challenges.       The development of the MCDA Mathematics Framework is an important product itself in that it incorporates a vision of mathematics that is more and more needed to be a mathematically literate citizen in the 21st century as well as identifying important competencies in great demand by diverse sectors of the economy in virtually every country. Computation is an important skill not as an end - since calculators and computers are now ubiquitous - but as an important window on the conceptual foundations of mathematics and its nature. Building upon these to develop mathematical reasoning together with quantitative models that reflect and predict phenomena in the real world brings the power of mathematics to the everyday decisions so many citizens are required to make in the personal, civic, and occupational lives.
