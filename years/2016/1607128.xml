<AbstractNarration>Gamma-rays are the highest energy form of electromagnetic radiation.  Observations of astrophysical gamma-rays serve as probes of physical conditions and processes in the most extreme environments throughout the Universe, and can be used to test fundamental physics.  The Very Energetic Radiation Imaging Telescope Array System (VERITAS), located in southern Arizona, is a ground-based observatory designed to study high energy gamma-rays.  VERITAS has unique capabilities, providing high sensitivity pointed observations of both galactic and extragalactic sources.  This award provides funding to continue VERITAS operations.  During this time the Observatory will complete a program designed to address themes in Particle Physics and Fundamental Laws, Black Holes, Cosmology, and Galactic Particle Accelerators.  This award will also support the VERITAS collaboration efforts to engage the public in science.  These include collaboration with the Whipple Observatory Visitors Center to promote VERITAS science to the public, other educators, museum professionals and the wider community.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;VERITAS is an array of four 12-meter atmospheric-Cherenkov Telescopes. VERITAS seeks both to identify new sources of high energy gamma rays, and to perform in-depth studies of the known sources to better understand their underlying fundamental processes. The primary targets of VERITAS Galactic observations are supernova remnants, pulsars, binary systems, and sources whose classification is unknown. The extragalactic targets observed by VERITAS include active galactic nuclei, radio galaxies, starburst galaxies, galaxy clusters, globular clusters and gamma-ray bursts. In addition, Local Group galaxies, the Galactic Center and dwarf spheroidal galaxies and are targets of VERITAS observations focused on the indirect detection of cold dark matter.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[     VERITAS is the world’s most-sensitive very-high-energy (VHE; E &gt; 100 GeV) gamma-ray observatory, and is located in southern Arizona.  This award from the NSF partially supported the experimental operations of the VERITAS telescope array and the array facility for the purposes of astrophysical research from 2016-2020. The support covered the project’s tenth through fourteenth season of operation. VERITAS remains operational and in excellent condition and support is identified to operate the facility through at least 2022.       A recent external review (NSF PA-CP) concluded the VERITAS collaboration of ~80 scientists "provided a compelling case for Very High Energy (VHE) gamma-ray observations, as key steps towards understanding the most energetic processes operating in the Universe", and that the project’s "discovery potential is significant".  The scientific operation of VERITAS was very strong during the award period and the NSF PA-CP panel stated "The VERITAS observatory &hellip; has been tremendously productive." Overall, the VERITAS collaboration has reported the detection of 64 astrophysical sources of VHE gamma rays, belonging to ~8 different source classes.  The VERITAS catalog increased by ~10% (7 objects) during the award period, and it represents about one-third of the entire VHE catalog. All VERITAS results are published in high-impact factor, peer-reviewed journals.  The VERITAS collaboration has published 115 refereed journal articles and has produced 71 PhD theses.  Thirty-seven of these articles appeared, and twenty-five of these theses were completed, during the award period. While the science program addressed a number of important topics in astrophysics, one breakthrough result was the VERITAS, MAGIC and Fermi-LAT detection of the flaring blazar TXS 0506+056 following an alert from the IceCube detection of a high-energy neutrino.

Approximately 30 VERITAS journal articles are in preparation, with another six either near submission or recently submitted.  Significant science topics continue to be explored with VERITAS and observing time at VERITAS remains oversubscribed (by a factor of 2.5 for the current season).  The training mission of VERITAS also remains strong as 35% of the collaboration members are students. Another recent review (2018 VERITAS ESAC) noted "VERITAS is clearly an invaluable scientific facility for VHE gamma ray astronomy, providing excellent return on the cumulative investment to date from the various sources."     During the award period, VERITAS experimental operations were also highly successful.  An external review (2018 NSF PACP) held during the award period commented that: "The VERITAS project has a history of effective and efficient management.  It has a well designed management structure" and "has an excellent record of telescope uptime".  Specifically, an average of 1080 h of data were taken over the four seasons covered by this award (~1210 h excluding the pandemic shortened 2019-20 season).  During this period all four telescopes were operational 94% of the time and fewer than 1% of the available time were lost due to technical reasons. These quantities surpass the project requirements of more than 900 h data per year, &gt;90% four-telescope participation, and &lt;10% time lost to technical issues. All other technical performance metrics for the VERITAS data were met and often exceeded and no event rendered any significant quantity of data unusable.     Throughout this award the VERITAS collaboration continued its strong commitment to enabling public understanding of science as an outcome of its research.  At the VERITAS site itself, the F.L.

Over the course of the award we also enabled many unique outreach experiences, including several iterations of VERITAS Muon Hunter partnership with the Zooniverse project.  Approximately 20,000 volunteers have participated in this citizen science effort so far.     The VERITAS collaboration is grateful for the support of the U.S. National Science Foundation which makes its research possible.
