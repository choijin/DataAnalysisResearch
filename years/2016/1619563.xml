<AbstractNarration>This work will study plasmas, which are clouds or bubbles of ionized gas, produced near liquid surfaces and in liquids at near room temperatures. Such plasmas have significant potential for development of several emerging technologies in biology and medicine for removal of organic contaminants from water, activation of water for sterilization and disinfection, wound healing, skin cancer therapies, synthesis of nanoparticles in liquids, as well as clean energy technologies. Fundamental physical and chemical processes in these plasmas are poorly understood, primarily due to lack of accurate experimental data which will be obtained in this work. The results obtained during this study will improve our understanding of these processes and are expected to have a major impact on development of low-temperature plasmas for biomedical applications, healthcare, and clean energy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fundamental kinetics of pulsed plasmas sustained at a liquid-vapor interface and in liquids will be studied using the following methods: (i) Measurements of electric field in surface ionization wave plasmas at a liquid-vapor interface. These data will provide insight into surface ionization wave structure and dynamics. (ii) Measurements of electron density and electron temperature in the near-surface plasma. These data will quantify input energy partition among different energy modes. (iii) Measurements of solvated electrons in the near-surface liquid layer. These data will show how electrons are transported to the liquid surface and penetrate into the liquid. These measurements may also resolve the fundamental question whether the plasma may be generated directly in the liquid phase. (iv) Measurements of species number densities in the plasma near the liquid-vapor interface. These results will be compared with kinetic modeling predictions to quantify the effect of electric field and electron energy in the surface plasma on vapor phase plasma chemistry. This work will yield quantitative insight into dynamics and kinetics of transient liquid-vapor interface plasmas for which there is little experimental data, and make possible confident prediction of their behavior.</AbstractNarration>

This required the development of new diagnostic methods for the measurements of the electric field, excited species concentrations, and radical species concentrations in these plasmas; use of these diagnostics for detailed plasma characterization; and kinetic modeling analysis of the experimental results. This major outcomes of this work are as follows.  1. Development of new diagnostics (N2 Picosecond Four-Wave Mixing) for absolute, time-resolved, spatially resolved measurements of electric field in highly transient air plasmas, and its use for characterization of ambient air plasmas sustained near a solid dielectric surface (quartz) and the liquid water surface, with sub-nanosecond time resolution.  2. Development of new diagnostics (Ps and Ns Electric Field Induced Second Harmonic Generation) for absolute, time-resolved, spatially resolved measurements of electric field in transient plasmas sustained in different gas mixtures, including noble gas atmospheric pressure plasma jets. These diagnostics, which are species-independent, have been used for characterization of ns pulse dielectric barrier discharge plasmas in ambient air, ns pulse helium plasma jets impinging on a liquid water surface, and plane ionization waves forming during ns pulse breakdown in nitrogen. Again, these measurements have sub-ns time resolution.  3. Development of new powerful diagnostics for absolute, time-resolved measurements of the key excited metastable state of molecular nitrogen, N2(A3&Sigma;u+), and hydroperoxyl radical (HO2), generated in low-temperature nonequilibrium plasmas containing nitrogen, oxygen, hydrogen,  and water vapor, as well as in plasmas sustained near liquid water. These diagnostics have been used for N2(A3&Sigma;u+) measurements in ns pulse discharges in N2, N2-O2, and N2-H2 mixtures, and for HO2 measurements in H2-O2-Ar mixtures.  4. Plasma kinetics modeling elucidating the formation and propagation of ionization waves in plasma sustained by ns discharge pulses, as well as the kinetic mechanism of N2(A3&Sigma;u+) and HO2 formation and decay in low-temperature, high-pressure plasmas.
