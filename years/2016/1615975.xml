<AbstractNarration>Just after the Solar System formed, the giant planets Jupiter and Saturn moved closer and farther, respectively, from the Sun in their orbits. These planets are so large that their wander affected all the other, smaller objects that were also forming in the Solar System ? planets like Venus and Earth, asteroids, and comets. These smaller planets were pushed around by the gravity of the giant planets. The violent forces created by the giant planets? movements caused many smaller objects to bombard other objects.  Mathematical models have been developed to describe this movement of the giant planets in the early Solar System. The models, however, suggest forces so great that the smaller planets cannot survive the process. Using state-of-the-art computational techniques that include the effects of collisions, these investigators will study the beginning of the Solar System and place limits on the conditions under which the Earth and other smaller planets formed. Graduate and undergraduate students will participate in the study.  The team will share their results with the general public through public talks and public student posters on recent planetary research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Giant planets orbiting our sun and other stars evolve significantly after initial formation. This is caused by a dynamical instability among the giant planets that organizes the orbital structure of the outer Solar System. The terrestrial planets, however, are unlikely to survive this dynamical interplay. How the exact configuration of the terrestrial planets emerged from the final giant-impact phase of planet formation is not fully understood, and the timing of this evolution within our own Solar System is not well constrained. State-of-the-art numerical simulations, including recently-developed methods of modeling collisions during planet formation, will be used here to model the giant-planet instability occurring while the terrestrial planets are still forming. The effects of this process on terrestrial planet formation will be assessed to determine whether our current Solar System is consistent with this scenario, and will be used to place new constraints on terrestrial-planet formation models. What the investigators learn can also be applied to exoplanet system formation. The Principal Investigator will mentor a graduate student in the proposed research, and the graduate student will in turn mentor undergraduate students. The PI also plans local public lectures on the research, as well as a student poster contest.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Under award AST-1615975, our group used computer simulations to study the connection between the orbital evolution of the solar system's outer planets and the formation and orbital evolution of the solar system's inner planets. Currently, the solar system's inner planets exist in a chaotic state right on the edge of stability, in which slight perturbations to their orbits can lead to collisions or losses of planets billions of years from now. Our work showed that such marginally stable states are a common outcome of the accretion of rocky planets from planetesimals and that the presence of Jupiter and Saturn enhances these types of outcomes. In addition, we showed that if the outer planets passed through an orbital instability within their first 10 million years of formation, this would have dramatic effects on the formation of the inner solar system. In particular the masses of planets near Mars' location would be substantially smaller than those near Earth's and Venus' location, similar to the trend seen in the actual inner solar system. Moreover, this same outer solar system instability would destabilize and remove large numbers of bodies from the asteroid belt, potentially helping explain the real belt's meager mass. Although such outer solar system instabilities place more asteroids on highly inclined orbits than observed, we found that many of these highly inclined asteroids are destabilized as Jupiter and Saturn slowly settle into their final orbits after the instability. Finally, we found that our same simulations that depleted the asteroid belt's mass and stunted the growth of Mars-like planets also occasionally generated Mercury-like bodies in which much of their mantle was stripped off by violent collisions. However, such bodies were rarely predicted to form near Mercury's actual location, and this planet's origins remain an outstanding mystery in solar system science. This research and its publications were led by graduate student Matt Clement and formed the bedrock of his PhD thesis. Under this award, we also organized 4 student-led poster sessions in which planetary science topics were presented to local attendees at the Norman Public Library.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 12/15/2020<br>      Modified by: Nathan&nbsp;A&nbsp;Kaib</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Image         </div> <div class="galControls onePhoto" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation onePhoto" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1615975/1615975_10435821_1608048066853_vid1238--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1615975/1615975_10435821_1608048066853_vid1238--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Simulated Solar System Formation"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1615975/1615975_10435821_1608048066853_vid1238--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Simulated Solar System Formation"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Orbital ellipticity of bodies are plotted against their orbital average distance from the Sun for one a simulation that produces an Earth-Mars mass disparity and a general replication of the overall orbital architecture of the solar system.
