<AbstractNarration>The management of coastal ecosystems for long term sustainability requires an enhanced understanding of the interplay among social, biological, and physical systems. Anticipating and managing future changes is a unique challenge requiring accurate representation and integration of climate drivers, biophysical responses, economic impacts, and adaptation decisions, but also the production of model outputs that are usable for decision making. To enhance usability, this project uses collaborations between scientists and stakeholders to foster mutual learning and the production of information that can support real-world decisions towards sustainability. In particular it focuses on advancing understanding of (1) the coupled human-natural system and (2) knowledge co-production, using harmful algal blooms (HABs) in the Great Lakes as a test case. As HAB events have been increasing globally over the past decade and directly impact ecosystem services for coastal communities (e.g., drinking water provision, fishing and recreation), understanding, predicting and alleviating this water quality issue is a problem of great societal relevance. The location of the study will be western Lake Erie because of the ability to build upon previous research and existing datasets and the team's previous involvement the region's policy networks. This integrated modeling approach is transferable and the results will be applicable to other coastal areas where stakeholders are attempting to manage complex ecological systems. The results will be communicated widely, leveraging the fact that  team members are actively engaged in regional and trans-national policy networks to purposefully disseminate the approach and lessons learned. The project will train a cohort of four graduate students and five postdoctoral fellows in an integrated interdisciplinary context.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The  work is organized around the overarching question: How does climate influence the biophysical dynamics of freshwater ecosystems and ecosystem services, and how can scientist and stakeholder co-production of information enhance coastal decision-making and sustainability? It will advance the fundamental knowledge of (1) the role of precipitation change and how uncertainty in climate model precipitation affects simulations of phosphorous loading, (2) the role of cold season processes on climate and phosphorous loading, (3) primary climate versus anthropogenic drivers that alter phosphorous loading, (4) the drivers over time and space controlling the size and location of future HABs, (5) how humans and the valuation of ecosystem services respond to HABs, and (6) information usability, by better understanding drivers of use and the kinds of decisions that may emerge from the co-production process. Four stakeholder sectors will be engaged: water treatment, beach management, recreational fishing and agricultural management and policy. Workshops will develop decision-relevant information for and feedback from those responsible for preventing future HABs (considering watershed loading simulations) and those required to adapt to current HABs (considering HAB forecasts).</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[This interdisciplinary project brought together physical and social scientists with two primary goals:  (1)  to understand how climate influences the formation of harmful algal blooms (HABs) in  freshwater and associated ecosystem services, and (2) how scientist and stakeholder co-production of information can enhance coastal decision-making and sustainability.  Specifically, we focused on the western Lake Erie ecosystem, due to the increasing prevalence of HABs and the regional ecosystem services impacts.  Our work investigated how future climatic changes may influence the formation of HABs using three linked predictive tools.  Atmospheric climate models simulate precipitation used in watershed models to simulate streamflow and nutrient loads, which in turn drives lake models that simulate the timing and extent of HAB formation. We found:  Climate data and models identified atmospheric moisture transport and evaporation as co-drivers of precipitation in the Great Lakes region, and the accurate representation of the Great Lakes in these models is necessary to capture the precipitation seasonality.  In the future, climate models simulate a clear shift to earlier season precipitation in the late winter/early spring, which can influence nutrient delivery from the land to the lakes. Because climate models frequently simulate more or less precipitation than observed during historical time periods, a common application technique is used to "correct" these biases and improve data inputs to watershed models.  We found that different bias correction techniques can influence future nutrient load predictions, and note that caution must be used when applying this technique. SWAT model development has also improved parameter representation using refined land use and management information, and we found that soil phosphorous concentrations were an important component of the model improvement. We developed a novel geostatistical approach to model HAB variability, synthesizing data from an international suite of monitoring programs in western Lake Erie. The model identifies algal and toxin "hotspots" across space and time, which can inform HAB monitoring and management.  We also created a data-driven (Bayesian) biophysical model to understand HAB dynamics, finding that blooms initiate after a month of lake temperatures warmer than 20oC, which has implications for future climate. Together, we worked to understand how uncertainty is propagated as data are transferred from one model type to the next.  Specifically, climate data such as temperature and precipitation drives the watershed model, and nutrient projections from watershed models drive the HAB models. Our modeling suite indicates that HABs under the future climate (2051-2065)  are likely to be considerably smaller than current (2002-2017) conditions, and comparable to those of the historical period (1985-1999). Uncertainty analysis across model types suggest that the largest sources of error for the projections come from uncertain HAB model parameters and climate models, followed by HAB model structure and the SWAT models. It also suggests that uncertainties in the HAB models are driven roughly evenly between HAB measurement errors and model prediction errors.  We also conducted research to understand how HABs can influence ecosystem services in the region:  Holding a stakeholder workshop in 2018 in Northeastern Ohio that brought together 17 external stakeholders representing multiple impacted communities in the western Lake Erie basin including public health, water, parks, recreation, campground, and marina managers. The workshop gave stakeholders information about the state of HABs modeling and stakeholders provided information about their experience with HABs and what information they use/need through testimonials, pre- and post-surveys, a parameter elicitation exercise, and an experimental decision-making task.

We also found that, even after a HAB warning is lifted at a beach, beachgoers are less likely to visit that beach and hence suffer additional economic losses, although these effects dissipate over time.    Together, this project integrated physical and social sciences to improve our understanding the drivers of HABs in the western Lake Erie basin, how we can develop predictive tools to inform stakeholder decision making, and how stakeholder feedback can improve the scientific process.
