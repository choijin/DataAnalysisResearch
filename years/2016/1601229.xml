<AbstractNarration>In many areas of science and engineering, including signal processing, data mining, neuroscience, and chemometrics, data often appear in multidimensional arrays. Such multidimensional arrays are known as tensors. To understand the internal structure of the data at hand, it is useful to decompose a given tensor as a sum of simpler tensors. However, the classical method for such decompositions has flaws, such as numerical instability. One of the main goals of this research project is to develop the theoretical underpinning of a new method for tensor decomposition that will perform better in applications, particularly in biomedical signal processing. The project involves graduate and undergraduate students in the research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research project studies tensors and invariant theory. The project aims to develop methods for lower and upper bounds for the rank of a tensor. The theory of convex decompositions of tensors will be developed and generalized. This new theoretical framework for tensor decompositions is an alternative to the low rank (PARAFAC) decomposition and is expected to behave better numerically. The investigator will study rings of (semi-)invariants for quivers and quivers with potentials. He will also explore tensor invariants and their relations to twisted commutative algebras.</AbstractNarration>

It was already known to David Hilbert in the nineteenth century that for certain classes of symmetries, there are finitely many fundamental polynomial invariants such that every other polynomial invariant can be expressed in these fundamental invariants.However, in many examples these fundamental invariants can be very big and difficult to compute.  One important example is the space of m-tuples of n by n matrices, where the symmetries are given by simultaneous conjugation with other matrices. Visu Makam, a graduate student, and the PI showed that the fundamental invariants have degree  mn4. The previously best known upper bound was worse than exponential. The result has applications to complexity theory. The new degree bound implies that certain problems can be solved with polynomial time algorithms, where before no polynomial time algorithms or only randomized polynomial time algorithms were known.  A vector is a 1-dimensional array, a matrix is a 2-dimensional array, and arrays of dimension 3 and more are called tensors.For example, a stacked m-tuple of n by n matrices is a tensor. A framework was developed for studying polynomial invariants of tensors. The PI also developed generalizations of the singular value decomposition of a matrix to higher order tensors.  The grant has supported two graduate students, who both have graduated.. It also supported  several undergraduate research projects supervised by the PI.  Together with Jerzy Weyman, the PI published a book that introduces graduate students to the representation theory of quivers.
