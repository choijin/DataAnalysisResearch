<AbstractNarration>Human capability to learn underlies and informs the intellectual and technical vigor of society, fueling advances in our educational system and innovation in the technology sector, among many others. This proposal will enable US students and researchers to co-organize with international partners, a workshop following the International Conference on Science of Learning being organized by the Australian Science of Learning Center in Brisbane, Australia.  The goal of the proposed workshop is to leverage existing progress in research to develop synergies between US and international scientists as well as among the US NSF Science of Learning Collaborative Networks. The workshop will serve as an important milestone in the development of an International Science of Learning community. Additionally, gaining cross-cultural perspectives will enrich scientific practice and be an excellent experience for US trainees.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The workshop will take place in September 2017, following the International Conference on the Science of Learning to be hosted by the Australian Science of Learning Centre in Brisbane, Australia. The proposal would enable a delegation of US (NSF-supported) Science of Learning researchers to present their work at this Conference, as a prelude to the post-conference workshop to engage in more specific interactions and planning through laboratory visits and targeted workgroups on specific themes/problems of common interest.  The post-conference workshop will offer opportunities for US and Australian researchers to engage in planning of collaborations that would continue scientific exchange and sharing or resources well beyond the Conference activities. The goals of the Conference and post-conference workshop include: 1) The dissemination of NSF-funded research to an international audience, with consequent feedback and refinement of research approaches; 2) The creation and deepening of SL-CN international communities; 3) the production of state-of-the field assessments together with roadmaps for future work, and 4) The establishment of new research collaboration. Four research themes are planned, based on discussions with Australian counterparts about shared interests:  A) Cutting-edge technologies for research in the classroom, B) Immersive, computer-based multimedia learning, C) Social, emotional, and contextual determinants of learning, and D) Executive function and self-regulation in learning.  The workshops will consist of targeted workgroups, laboratory visits, and full-group discussions, and will address questions and deliverables that are developed prior to the trip.</AbstractNarration>
