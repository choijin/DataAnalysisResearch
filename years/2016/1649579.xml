<AbstractNarration>Some of the major objectives of chemical catalysis are to lower the energy input required to effect important chemical transformations and reduce the amount of materials needed (solvents, reagents, etc.) to generate the desired end product.  In this project funded by the Chemical Catalysis Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Scott E. Denmark is conducting research to improve an industrially relevant chemical process, the Water Gas Shift Reaction (WGSR).  The reaction is used to form of carbon-carbon bonds in a variety of fundamental chemical reactions. The goal of this research project is to replace metal-containing reagents that generate large amounts of waste products with less polluting reagents. The WGSR is used on an enormous scale to generate hydrogen for high volume chemical processes.  The reaction is generally done by combining carbon monoxide and water over a solid catalyst to produce hydrogen and carbon dioxide. The research seeks to form new carbon-carbon bonds with fewer by-products and solvents. Professor Denmark's students identify the most efficient catalysts to enable the desired chemical reaction under mild reaction conditions. The project is designed to reduce waste in fine chemical manufacturing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The landmark report "Sustainability in the Chemical Industry" published by the National Research Council in 2005, identified eight "Grand Challenges" the first of which is "Green and Sustainable Chemistry and Engineering". The report called for research to "Identify appropriate solvents, control thermal conditions, and purify, recover, and formulate products that prevent waste and that are environmentally benign, economically viable, and generally support a better societal quality of life". Despite all of the research into improving the efficiency of the WGSR, the process is exclusively used for generation of hydrogen using heterogeneous catalysis. However, outside of hydroformylation, no other carbon-carbon bond forming reactions have been developed that harness the reducing potential of the WGSR. This project identifies important carbon-carbon bond forming reactions that require stoichiometric amounts of a reducing agent and replaces that agent with the combination of water and carbon monoxide in the presence of a suitable catalyst or catalyst combination. This research is an good platform for training new scientists to think creatively.</AbstractNarration>
