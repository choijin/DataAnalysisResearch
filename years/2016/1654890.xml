<AbstractNarration>Women of color are underrepresented throughout the engineering professoriate. This project is developing a special professional development workshop for women faculty of color to broaden their participation in advanced manufacturing areas. The main objectives of the workshop are to: 1) increase awareness of innovation needs and relevance of advanced manufacturing to the U.S., 2) promote a networking platform that brings women of color engineering faculty together to stimulate potential collaborations on advanced manufacturing, and 3) share strategies for overcoming obstacles that often hinder the career advancement of women of color faculty in engineering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research-driven workshop will focus on emerging advanced manufacturing areas, with an emphasis on the design of materials, additive manufacturing, and hybrid manufacturing. Workshop participants will have access to state of the art equipment available in the Industrial and Manufacturing Systems Engineering Department at Iowa State University, and training will be offered through modular hands-on activities that are supplemented with theoretical instruction. The workshop will host up to twenty-five women of color engineering faculty from various universities around the country, along with ten to fifteen undergraduate students from Iowa State University. The participants will engage in a "speed mentoring" activity, where they will have the unique opportunity to develop and discuss their specific career plans in one-on-one sessions.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Organized by the PI, Iris V. Rivero, the NSF funded Advanced Manufacturing Workshop - Preparing the Next Generation of Researchers was a strategic effort that brought together women and underrepresented minority (URM) women in engineering academia from across the country to engage and prepare them in fundamental engineering research in advanced manufacturing - The Next Generation of Researchers. The workshop brought attention to emerging subject areas in advanced manufacturing such as design of materials, additive and hybrid manufacturing which constitute the foundation of transformative research in biomedical, automotive, and aerospace fields. More importantly, the workshop was an endeavor to begin breaking cultural stereotypes and increase the involvement of these demographical groups in the field of manufacturing. Obstacles deterring the involvement and advancement of women and URM women in the engineering professoriate and the field of manufacturing include the perception of "cultural" intellectual capabilities, limited access to state-of-the-art resources directly impacting research support, lack of advancement opportunities, "chilly" environment, structural impediments, and perception of manufacturing being a field lacking a bright future. Therefore, the objectives of the workshop included to: 1) bring awareness of innovation needs and relevance of advanced manufacturing to the U.S.; 2) promote a networking platform that brings women and URM women faculty in engineering together to stimulate interaction and potential collaborations in advanced manufacturing research; and 3) establish strategies to counteract obstacles that hinder the career advancement of URM women faculty in engineering.

With regards to the manufacturing research discussions, they were initiated by providing an overview of polymers and metals used in the fabrication of components and structures via additive manufacturing techniques. This subject was followed by an interactive session introducing the subject of Hybrid Manufacturing. Lastly, the subject of Additive Manufacturing was presented by emphasizing the multidisciplinarity of research projects carried out within this field.

The application process consisted of submission of a packet that included: a statement of research, and an NSF style biosketch.
