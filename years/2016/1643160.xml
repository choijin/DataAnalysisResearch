<AbstractNarration>The objective of this project is to apply available observations to evaluate whether short-term solar ultraviolet variability (occurring mainly on the ~ 27-day solar rotation time scale) can influence tropical climate variability on time scales from weeks to months. It will specifically explore whether previously reported evidence for such an influence in the tropical Pacific sector is indeed robust.  Statistical analyses will employ a total of 20 years of solar ultraviolet radiation measurements under solar maximum conditions when 27-day variations are especially large.  Coincident meteorological fields such as temperature and wind near the troposphere will be analyzed to determine whether short-term solar ultraviolet forcing can significantly perturb the stratification of the tropical upper troposphere and thereby modify the environment condition for deep convections.  Associated effects on synoptic and large-scale circulations will be investigated. The PI will also explore whether such responses to the 27-day solar depend on season or on the phases of the El-Ni√±o/Southern Oscillation as well as the stratospheric quasi-biennial oscillation.  The statistical significance of any detected responses will be assessed using standard methods.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Confirmation of a significant short-term solar impact on tropical convection and short-time climate variability would (a) provide a new observation for testing climate models that include solar forcing; (b) lead to improvements in extended-range weather forecasting; and (c) improve our understanding of short-time climate variability. The project will support one graduate student and one undergraduate student.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Variability in the tropical atmosphere affects weather and climate outside of the tropics.  The Madden-Julian oscillation (MJO) is the dominant mode of tropical intraseasonal climate variability.  It consists of a pattern of alternately intense and weak tropical convection and precipitation that propagates eastward through the warm pool region between the Indian and Pacific Oceans.  It has well-documented effects on weather and intraseasonal climate in many areas of the world.  Our project was designed to investigate whether the occurrence of MJO events and their extratropical consequences are affected by solar variability.  Solar ultraviolet (UV) variations affect ozone production and radiative heating in the upper stratosphere (30 to 50 km altitude), which lead to changes in stratospheric circulation and temperature.  We have specifically investigated the hypothesis that solar-induced changes in lower stratospheric temperature can affect the intensity of deep tropical convection and, hence, the occurrence rate of MJO events.  Changes in lower stratospheric temperature modify the fall-off of temperature with height in the upper troposphere and, therefore, the stability of this part of the atmosphere against convection ("static stability").  Observations indicate a warming of the tropical lower stratosphere (about 18 to 25 km altitude) following peaks in solar UV radiation and a cooling following solar UV minima.  The warmings following UV peaks are believed to be caused mainly by relative downwelling, which is related to a slowing of the mean meridional circulation in the northern hemisphere stratosphere.  The converse is believed to occur following UV minima.  We have investigated whether the occurrence of significant MJO events is reduced following solar UV peaks and increased following UV minima as expected according to the hypothesized mechanism.

On the 27-day time scale, when data for all MJO events were considered, no significant reductions in the number of these events was found following solar UV peaks.  However, when only relatively strong MJO events were considered, significant reductions of MJO occurrence rates and associated increases in static stability were found at lags of one to seven days following UV peaks.  Conversely, mean occurrence rates were increased and tropical lower stratospheric static stabilities were decreased following UV minima.  On the 11-year time scale, the occurrence rate of MJO events during northern winter (Dec. to Feb.) was found to be somewhat less under solar maximum conditions than under solar minimum conditions, as expected according to the stated hypothesis, but the difference was not statistically significant.

Finally, an initial investigation of the role of stratospheric forcings (QBO and 11-year solar cycle) in modifying the extratropical consequences of the MJO for subseasonal climate during northern winter was conducted.  It was found that these consequences are generally strengthened during the easterly QBO phase relative to the westerly phase.  Although less certain because of the short data record, some evidence that the minimum phase of the solar cycle produces a similar strengthening was also obtained.  It is possible that these results will ultimately lead to improvements in models that are routinely used for extended range (1 week to a month) weather forecasting.

This would have positive economic and societal benefits, e.g., advanced planning of industrial and public activities.  In addition to providing several months per year of support over two years for the principal investigator, the project also helped to support a masters degree student in the Department of Hydrology and Atmospheric Sciences as well as an undergraduate intern at the University of Arizona.
