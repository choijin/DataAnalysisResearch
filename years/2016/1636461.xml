<AbstractNarration>The National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) will be a shared-use, continental scale research platform for ecological research. The network will consist of geographically distributed infrastructure deployed across the continental US, Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico. The concept, design, and selection of sites and instruments for the various NEON sites and activities have evolved over many years, during which community consultation has been an important activity. The recent change in NEON management provides an opportunity for evaluating aspects of the Observatory's infrastructure as it relates to the achievement of the Observatory's goals. Through consultation with NEON's new management, this project will plan and implement two workshops to identifying immediate improvements in the current cyberinfrastructure (CI) architecture, and provide a foundation for framing community involvement in designing a cutting-edge, evolvable framework for the NEON CI.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With the selection of Battelle to assume management responsibilities of NEON, NSF views this as a prime opportunity to evaluate the CI needs of the NEON project and align them to support the data products and other IT requirements of the project. A major goal is to update the framework of NEON's CI and put in place an architecture that is evolvable. Plans are to engage Battelle and the expertise it brings to the project in the evaluation of the CI requirements of the project. Participants in the workshop will engage in open discussion of issues and opportunities, identify constructive approaches towards enhancing NEON's CI, and provide suggestions about how to best maintain a CI framework that can be optimized to meet the community's needs over the life of the project. Outcomes of the workshop include several deliverables that will inform management and the community of stakeholders as the project moves into this new phase.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) facility collects high-quality, standardized data from 81 field sites (47 terrestrial and 34 aquatic) across the United States including Alaska, Hawaii and Puerto Rico. Data collection methods are standardized across sites and include in situ instrument measurements, field sampling and airborne remote sensing.  Funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF) and operating under the leadership of Battelle, NEON?s cyberinfrastructure (CI) is essential for the sharing and reuse of diverse forms of ecological data. The NEON cyberinfrastructure includes people, software, hardware, data, physical samples, protocols, and other social and technical elements that enable ecological observations to be acquired, networked, stored, computed, integrated, published, discovered, analyzed, and reused.  NEON has come on line at a time when data, models, and the supporting cyberinfrastructure are of increasing importance as digital technologies expand the amount of available data and the tools and methods for curating data (including digital identifiers for physical samples).  A workshop for cyberinfrastructure experts was held in June, 2016, providing timely feedback for Battelle in this dimension of its NEON management responsibilities.  A stakeholder mapping survey was conducted in advance of the June, 2016, workshop and the results informed the dialogue at the workshop.  Many aspects of the NEON CI planning were supported by the workshop.  For example, that  allowed for the generation and dissemination of standardized APIs for data access without reliance on the somewhat cumbersome data portal interface and CSV file delivery.  For novice users, the CSV approach is perfectly adequate and appropriate.  But, as the NEON dataset volume expands, power users will definitely seek API access so they can develop their own processing pipelines to automate data analysis.   Between 2016 and 2020, there have been major advances in the NEON cyberinfrastructure.  During this time, data curation practices have been established, data delivery services have been launched, data work professionals have been developed, and a community of end user researchers built up.  While a second end user workshop was planned, delays followed by the COVID-19 pandemic led to the substation of a second stakeholder survey in 2020 focused on end users.  Integral to the workshop and the two stakeholder surveys is the view that there are many relevant stakeholders who are essential for the effective functioning and impact of any cyberinfrastructure.  These include the cyberinfrastructure professionals directly involved in curating and making available data, models, and related resources, as well as the other professional staff and leadership of NEON, the end users in diverse fields and disciplines, and the general public who depend on continual advances in continent-scale understanding of ecological matters.   Intellectual Merits with the NEON cyberinfrastructure center on new insights around the stakeholder views of the CI.  Broader Impacts center on the actual results with CI and impacts on relevant fields and disciplines.  For intellectual merits, one question posed in just the 2020 stakeholder survey illustrates the diversity of end user views.  Respondents where ask to provide a word or phrase to describe their current view of NEON and its cyberinfrastructure.  Some (24%) were enthusiastic, with comments such as "Treasure!," "An impressive resource," "Exciting and ambitious - much needed," and "Dependable and responsive team." Others (29%) were more mixed, with comments such as "Great potential, but it has yet to deliver" and "Lofty goals, moderate output."  Finally, some (24%) were negative, with comments such as "I am incredibly frustrated with how difficult it is to access and use NEON data" and "Isolated and difficult to build out from."  Potential next steps for intellectual merits and broader impacts are organized around a common template (the 5Ws &amp; How) which has proven effective in high-performance work systems in industry.  These cover:  Integrated Success Vision     Benchmarking                       Communities of Practice       Cybersecurity             Data Work                 Data Findability &amp; Interoperability             Agile &amp; Long-Term Design Approaches      Education &amp; Active Learning                                     In the 2020 end user stakeholder survey, researchers from diverse ecological fields and disciplines were asked "how important and how difficult it was to be able to use NEON data to transform the way ecological science is conducted" a key part of broader impacts.  For importance (on a scale of 0=not important and 10=very important) the average response was 8.1 (SD=2.2), while for difficulty (on a scale of 0=very difficult and 10=very easy) the average response was 3.4 (SD=2.4).  That is, while having a transformational impact with NEON data was seen is important, it was also seen as hard to do.  The same respondents were also asked about "being able to use NEON data to expand the impact of ecological science in society."  For importance the average response was 8.4 (SD=1.9), while for difficulty the average response was 3.0 (SD=2.4).  That is, while having a transformational impact with NEON data in society was seen as even more important, it was also seen as harder to do.
