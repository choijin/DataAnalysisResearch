<AbstractNarration>In this project funded by the Chemical Structure Dynamics and Mechanism (CSDM-A) Program of the NSF Chemistry Division, Professor Boldyrev explores new frontiers for multicenter bonding. In high school and college chemistry classes, chemical bonds are typically presented as pairs of electrons shared between two atoms (a single pair produces a single bond, two pairs create a double bond, etc.).  However, there are many cases where chemical bonds are formed through electrons being shared by multiple atoms (hence the name "multicenter").  Professor Boldyrev and his group have developed a theoretical model that takes into account both two- and multi-center chemical bonding.  He and his group are now applying this model to explain the geometry and behavior of complex systems such as cluster molecules containing dozens of atoms, molecules dissolved in liquids, and molecules which have been excited by light.  Chemical bonding is at the heart of chemical understanding, and is the basis for explaining why molecules and solids adopt a certain geometric structure, and why molecules or solids react with other molecules in a particular manner.  Professor Boldyrev's computational approach is called Adaptive Natural Density Partitioning, or "AdNDP."  AdNDP is currently used by 50 research groups around the world, and the Boldyrev group is continuing to make this program and its updates available to other scientists.  The graduate students involved in this project are not only helping to advance the field of chemistry, but are also obtaining important skills in computer programming and software development, all of which are valuable assets in the technology industry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is exploring new chemistry frontiers for the application of the AdNDP method and its solid-state adaptation (SSAdNDP).   The topics being studied include chemical bonding in excited states of molecules and clusters, the interaction of solvated electrons and multiply charged anions with solvent molecules.  The project seeks to understand the chemical bonding in novel three-dimensional (3D) chemical systems that have been synthesized under extremely high pressure. Such high-pressure compounds violate many conventional stoichiometries and chemical bonding.  In such systems, chemical bonding cannot be rationalized on the basis of a Lewis model alone. This project continues to benefit from collaborations with experimentalists (Professors Kit Bowen at Johns Hopkins, Lai-Sheng Wang at Brown University, Michael Heaven at Emory University, and Zhong-Ming Sun at the Chinese Academy of Sciences) who are providing experimental data on newly  made clusters (0D species), as well as new 1D-, 2D- and 3D-materials. The broader impacts of this work include potential societal benefits of the AdNDP and SSAdNDP methods for the rational design of new materials, and for application in chemical education. These methods and the software developed under the support of Chemical Structure Dynamics and Mechanism (CSDM-A) Program of the NSF Chemistry Division are being developed for use in classes such as general chemistry, computational chemistry, quantum chemistry, advanced inorganic chemistry, nanotechnology, and materials chemistry.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Everything in the Universe is built of atoms. Atoms are organized in more complex aggregates, molecules or solids.&nbsp; Knowledge of how atoms form molecules is crucial towards understanding how to create new chemical species and materials, analyze and predict naturally occurring and human-controlled process. In high school and college chemistry classes we are taught that chemical bonds are usually represented as pairs of electrons shared between two atoms (a single pair produces a single bond, two pairs create a double bond, etc.). This is a famous Lewis model which has been proven to be very useful to explain bonding in many cases. However, it is not satisfactory because even canonical molecules such as benzene (C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>6</sub>) could not be described by a single Lewis structure preserving the high symmetry hexagonal structure: there are simply not enough electron pairs to draw bonds as lines connecting two atoms.</p> <p>This is the example when we must combine Lewis model and multicenter bonding (2 electrons belong to a few atoms simultaneously). All these phenomena are studied by quantum chemistry which can calculate electronic distribution in molecules. The complication is that molecular orbitals, commonly used to treat electrons, are delocalized over the whole system, hence, they do not provide information about localized, Lewis bonds. In 2007 we developed a method which combines the best of these two opposite approaches: localized Lewis bonds and multicenter bonding. We call it Adaptive Natural Density Partitioning (AdNDP) since it enables partitioning of electron density (bonds) in desirable fashion. Current project continued the development of the original AdNDP idea and resulted in the release of the major update, AdNDP2.0. This version is re-written in Python and has a user-friendly interface. Besides, we incorporated new features to the code that enable dealing with more complex, larger systems and excited state molecules (Figure 1, ground and excited state of water molecule).</p> <p>Simplicity and usability of bonding pictures produced by AdNDP allowed it to gain attention from scientific community and currently about 100 research groups use it for research and teaching. Bonding can explain variety of chemical phenomena, for example, stability of structures, behavior of particles dissolved in a liquid and defects on material surfaces. To show the capabilities and the diversity of possible application of the AdNDP paradigm below we summarized the results of some recently published projects.</p> <p>The theoretical study of excited state molecules has a great importance in science and industry. Using the AdNDP 2.0, we showed that one can easily predict the geometry transformation upon an excitation to a higher energy state.</p> <p>Chemical bonding analysis of materials can direct experimentalists and theoreticians in designing new structures with unprecedented physical properties. Guided by the AdNDP analysis, we predicted a novel two-dimensional material that consists of boron octahedra (2D-B<sub>6</sub>). Calculations showed its stability up to 300 K. Most importantly, this is the first example of ferromagnetic boron material (Figure 2).</p> <p>We computationally designed chain structures built of C<sub>18</sub> rings, a novel carbon allotrope. AdNDP revealed that there are no chemical bonds between different interlocked rings, i. e. they are trapped mechanically. Moreover, substantial energy is needed to break the trap, while they can freely rotate along each other which is widely used in molecular motors and molecular electronics (Figure 3).</p> <p>We also analyzed a series of clusters of very diverse composition, just to name few: gold clusters [MAu12]<sup>4+</sup> (M=Pd,Pt), intermetalloid clusters [Sb@In<sub>8</sub>Sb<sub>12</sub>]<sup>3-/5-</sup>, [Bi@In<sub>8</sub>Sb<sub>12</sub>]<sup>3-/5-</sup> and [Pd<sub>3</sub>Sn<sub>8</sub>Bi<sub>6</sub>]<sup>4-</sup>, multilayer cluster [Sn@Cu<sub>12</sub>Sn<sub>20</sub>]<sup>12- </sup>(Figure 4) and others. Chemical intuition cannot capture any similarity between them, but AdNDP can. As AdNDP revealed, all of them are stabilized by multicenter bonding (also known as spherical aromaticity). These insights are in full agreement with the experiment because all the structures were synthesized as stable units.</p> <p>By means of AdNDP we managed to characterize defects on the surface of MgO crystal. We examined periodic defects on the crystalline surface with missing oxygen atoms (Figure 5). It turns out that each such defect contains an electron pair delocalized over five magnesium atoms. This diffused electron pair is responsible for peculiar optical properties. Besides, these pairs can serve as catalytic sites.</p> <p>Another important insight was gained for a classical textbook anion, SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>. It is a well-known fact that three water molecules are needed to stabilize it. However, electron density transfer accompanying this stabilization remained unclear. We showed that 0.15 units of electron charge should be transferred to water for the SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> stabilization. Moreover, AdNDP revealed that intense charge transfer occurs only between the anion and the first solvation shell and there is no significant charge migration to higher order shells.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 12/10/2020<br>      Modified by: Alexander&nbsp;I&nbsp;Boldyrev</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1664379/1664379_10509585_1607649133570_Figure_1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1664379/1664379_10509585_1607649133570_Figure_1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 1"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1664379/1664379_10509585_1607649133570_Figure_1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 1"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Figure 1: Optimized structures of the water molecule in the ground electronic state (A top) and in the first excited electronic state (B top); the results of the extended AdNDP analysis of the ground state (A bottom) and the first excited state (B bottom) at the ground state optimized geometry.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Nikolay Tkachenko</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Alexander&nbsp;I&nbsp;Boldyrev</div> <div class="imageTitle">Figure 1</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1664379/1664379_10509585_1607650127310_Figure_2--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1664379/1664379_10509585_1607650127310_Figure_2--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 2"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1664379/1664379_10509585_1607650127310_Figure_2--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 2"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Overall chemical bonding picture obtained for the 2D-B6 sheet.
