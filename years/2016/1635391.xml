<AbstractNarration>The climate and hydrology in the Middle East for the last 200,000 years can be deduced from chemical analyses of 460-meters of drill core obtained from beneath the Dead Sea by the International Continental Scientific Drilling Project (ICDP).  Thick layers of salt deposited between 115,000 and 130,000 years ago imply drought conditions.  The climate and hydrology in the Middle East during this time period can be compared with results from other regions to understand how they are connected globally.  Using evidence from the past can test our theories and broaden our understanding of how the climate will respond in the future. This project will strengthen present and future international scientific collaboration through participation of students from Jordan and Israel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Drill core recovered by the Dead Sea Drilling Project contained thick layers of salt that document drought conditions in the Middle East between 115,000 and 130,000 years ago.  The project will reconstruct the climate and hydrology during warmer periods in the past 200,000 years by analyzing the chemistry of fluid bubbles trapped in the salt.  Geochemical measurements will be interpreted for rainfall, temperature, relative humidity, and winds. The results will be compared with predictions from climate models for this period in earth history.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Due to concerns about human impacts on climate, there is great interest in conditions during past intervals that were warmer than the climate of today. A drill-core recently recovered from the Dead Sea in the Middle East records ~200,000 years of climate history in the Middle East. It includes thick sections of salt (Figure 1), corresponding to major lake level drops associated with extreme drought during the extra-warm ?last interglacial? interval between ~130-115 thousand years ago. This project?s aim was to reconstruct important climate characteristics, events, and rates of change throughout the interglacial interval. The study connected the data obtained through chemical analyses of the drill core to climate models and global climate indicators of the present-day. Based on salt and water budgets, we found that there were extremely dry intervals lasting for decades occurring at ~120,000 years ago during the last interglacial, and also at ~10,000 years ago during the current interglacial. In both cases, the availability of fresh water in the Middle East decreased to ~20% of the present-day. This was related to increasing global temperatures and suggests that the future effects of global warming in the Middle East on fresh water resources may be much worse than what is currently predicted.</p> <p>A detailed investigation of the sediments in the core showed that these warm intervals were not only extremely dry, but were associated with a dramatic shift in the climate and hydrology. We found that the changing isotopic composition of uranium in the lake was a good indication of changes in the rainfall sources and thus the fresh water sources (i.e. whether water flowing to the Dead Sea originated in the Mediterranean or the Tropics). We used them to generate a record of the different sources of water through time. We found that some of the periods of extreme drought are associated with increased flash floods (Figure 2) and rainfall that originated in the tropics during the summer, fall and spring, in contrast to the present day, when rainfall is mainly during the winter. Similar characteristics are also seen as a result of climate change today.</p> <p>With atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations increasing, there is a need to better understand how the climate will respond; however, present-day instrumental data covers only a limited timeframe. On the other hand, records like the Dead Sea drill core provide critical information on how the climate changed in the past, as well as the rates of change, and thus help broaden our understanding of the climate system?s response to warming. This is particularly important for water-stressed areas like the Middle East, where climate models predict a more arid future that threatens the socio-economic stability of the region. Improving the ability to predict the effects of future warming is of great importance for making informed decisions to prepare for the future.</p> <p>This project has led to a new collaboration with Jordanian scientists (Dr. Marwan El-Raggad, University of Jordan) and a planned policy-science workshop (funded by the President?s Global Innovation Fund of Columbia University), to be held in Amman, Jordan in summer 2019. In addition, three undergraduate students participated in this project through internship programs by the Columbia Earth Institute and by the National Science Foundation. These students presented their projects at the Geological Society of America and the American Geophysical Union annual meetings. Their involvement provided them with lab skills and experience in conducting a scientific project and presenting their results.
