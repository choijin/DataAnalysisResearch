<AbstractNarration>Due to the lack of vegetation associated with many dryland ecosystems, rainfall generates significant overland flow so that runoff/runon processes become important for providing flows to vegetated sites where water can infiltrate, leading to complex patterns of water resources available to plants. Predicting these flow patterns from easily observable features such as vegetation and topographic patterns, would be instrumental in evaluating landscape vulnerability to desertification. In addition, it would provide design strategies for restoration activities by optimizing vegetation selection, hillslope contouring and planting design. This research aims to develop improved techniques to enable such predictions through models that test runon-runoff process against the experimental behavior of isotopic tracers and through the development of new techniques that improve the realism of modeled vegetation and topographic surfaces. The research will support two doctoral research students (one in Israel and one in the US), and research exchange between research sites at UC Berkeley and Ben Gurion University of the Negev.  It will enable outreach activities that use the research findings to inform land restoration planning and guidelines, in conjunction with partners at the UC Berkeley College of Environmental Design and the Keren Kayemeth LeIsrael-Jewish National Fund in Israel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will advance predictions of dryland vulnerability to disruption of runon-runoff processes based on the spatial organization of vegetation, hillslope topography and storm characteristics. The aim of such predictions is to identify high priorities for intervention to prevent degradation, and to inform restoration designs, focusing on modification of the vegetation distribution and hillslope form. Previous modeling attempts to generalize the predictions of plant water availability based on spatial pattern were constrained in two ways: (i) The models used to make predictions are generally tested against indirect metrics of the runon-runoff process, such as net discharge from a runoff plot, rather than against observations of site-to-site source-sink transport of water during storm events; thus their ability to constrain the source-sink behavior within a runoff site is questionable. (ii) The model experiments used to connect dryland surface features to water redistribution rely on individual realizations of idealized land surfaces. Consequently, uncertainty is poorly characterized, and the meaning of the resulting metrics for real landscapes is unclear. This proposal exploits isotopic tracer experiments to reveal patterns of connectivity and water availability to vegetation on a well-characterized dryland hillslope at the Lehavim Long Term Ecological Research site in Israel.  The patterns will be used to test the predictions of runoff-runon models by adapting these models to predict Lagrangian transport of water using Coupled Eulerian-Lagrangian Modeling techniques.  Model experiments with the tested model will then draw on the emerging field of multi-point statistics to enable realistic realizations of landscape surface features, allowing uncertainty in predicted water availability, degradation risk or restoration quality to be characterized.  The research will provide insights into landscape-scale controls on desertification vulnerability based on the likelihood that runoff is captured on a hillslope, or is lost via export from vegetated slopes.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Drylands and cities have more in common than you might think - at least hydrologically.  Bare soils in drylands, like roofs or roads in cities, are impermeable.  Rain cannot enter the soil, and instead forms runoff.  Most drylands and cities also contain vegetated areas, with permeable soil.  Runoff can infiltrate in these locations, sustaining dryland ecosystems and preventing extreme stormflow in cities.    This research project aimed to understand how the spatial pattern of permeable (vegetated) and impermeable areas on hillslopes influenced hillslope hydrology, particularly the partitioning of rainfall into infiltration or runoff.  There is a long history of "connectivity" studies that attempt to summarize spatial patterns with single metrics that capture the patterns effects on water.  In experiments (Figure 1, A), we found a variety of connectivity metrics that predicted of flow response.  These could be derived from only the surface topography of experimental soil surfaces. Soil topographic connectivity was closely related to resulting flow patterns and hillslope runoff.  As we explored these relationships, we showed that using thermal images to characterize flow networks was highly effective (Figure 1, B), and tested novel ways of characterizing small-scale topographic variations with LiDAR (Figure 1, C).    The experiments were extended by modeling runoff production and infiltration on hillslopes that had different spatial patterns.  We developed a detailed model to describe these processes, but it was slow to run. To test many different spatial patterns we needed a faster tool, and we turned to machine learning to emulate the model.  We ran lots of simulations with the physical model, and modeled the results with the emulator.  A schematic of this approach is shown in Figure 2.  The emulator sped up predictions 15,000 times without sacrificing accuracy.  This let us explore a wide variety of connectivity metrics for many combinations of pattern, storm properties and soil properties.   The emulator supported the experimental finding that connectivity metrics were closely related to hillslope hydrology for fixed flow and soil conditions (as per the experiments). Unfortunately, we also found that the relationships between connectivity metrics and hillslope hydrology changed when rainfall or soil properties changed.  Metrics that worked very well under one set of rainfall and soil conditions had very little predictive power under other conditions - and vice versa. This can be seen in Figure 3, which shows how well different connectivity metrics (the symbols on the x axis) explained the fraction of hillslope rainfall that infiltrated (the y axis).  For different slope and rainfall conditions, the explanatory power of the metrics changes. This finding suggests there are unlikely to be any "universal" metrics that predict hydrology from the spatial properties of the landscape: the aspects of the spatial patterns that matter for hydrology are not fixed.  Tools like the emulator model may provide a better approach to rapidly account for the effects of spatial patterns on flow and infiltration.  We used the emulator in several applications, including: (i) testing assumptions in the basic urban hydrology tool, the "rational method", (ii) exploring how storm-scale hydrological features alter the trajectory of vegetation coverage on patchy landscapes, and (iii) testing the stationarity (or otherwise) of calibration of typical urban hydrology tools such as SWMM.  (i) Using the emulator we showed that on landscapes with spatial patterns in permeability may violate standard design assumptions in the Rational Method.  These violations are likely to cause practitioners to under-estimate flood risk  (by 10% in the example shown in Figure 4).    (ii) We employed the emulator in ecohydrological models coupling water availability and vegetation growth and spread.  These models embody large differences in process timescales - minutes/hours for runoff production versus months-years for vegetation growth and dispersal.  Simulating vegetation to steady state with the physical model required 6 months of supercomputer time! It could be achieved in a day with the emulator.  We demonstrated relationships between storm properties and the pattern of vegetation. This is illustrated in Figure 5 where every panel shows vegetation on a hillslope (green).  Each panel represents the same annual climatology, with differences only in storm intensity and frequency.    (iii) Finally, we used the emulator to produce a "truth" dataset of flow behavior across multiple urban land cover patterns, against which the widely used urban SWMM model was calibrated.  Calibrated parameters of the SWMM model subcatchments were shown to be non-stationary as rainfall and soil properties changed.  This suggests historically calibrated models may be unreliable for many applications like climate or land use change - a challenge for urban hydrologists.  The key finding from this research project is that the spatial pattern of impermeability on hillslopes controls hydrologic responses in different ways under different environmental conditions.  This challenges the search for connectivity metrics and for transferable calibration parameters, and should motivate new predictive approaches, such as emulation, to account for spatial variability without requiring computationally intensive modeling.
