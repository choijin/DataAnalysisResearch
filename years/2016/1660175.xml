<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to enable continuous sensing applications in a wide range of energy-constrained sensor-enabled devices. Without dramatic innovations in the development of ultralow power sensory processing, continuous and accurate sensing will remain a niche application limited to environments with a stable and plentiful power source and significant computing resources. The technology described in this proposal will demonstrate the viability and potential widespread deployment of continuous sensing devices in mobile or remote environments with strict energy constraints. An important immediate market for the proposed technology with significant customer base is the smartphone and wearables market, where many new and emerging end user applications could leverage environmental sensing to trigger context-based and anticipatory actions. The proposed technology is broadly applicable to a number of other markets and domains, including medical, health, and safety monitoring of critical patient sensors, personal fitness devices, military applications, and environmental monitors. The ability to flexibly deploy continuous sensing for these and other applications has the potential to revolutionize these markets and create entirely new and unforeseen application domains. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research Phase 2 Project plans to research and develop algorithms based on the properties of biological spiking neurons and the sensory processing capabilities of the human brain. The human brain is truly unique in its ability to use a basic computational element, the spiking neuron, and perform a broad variety of tasks. The brain has the ability to accurately classify sensory patterns from multiple modalities (touch, sight, etc.), to interpret the outside world, and to recognize the current context. A key intellectual merit of this project is a demonstration of how these novel neural algorithms can perform accurate, robust, and low power sensory analysis across multiple sensory domains. Just as the brain is capable of processing data from very different sensors. Researching and developing these neural algorithms will provide insight as to how the human brain learns to recognize important sensory information, how it is able to integrate information from such different sense modalities, and how it is able to perform complex analysis so efficiently.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   In this NSF Phase II Project, Thalchemy has advanced the field of Neural Networks, specifically in their application to wearable technology, environmental sensors, and IoT devices.  The vast majority of Neural Network and Machine Learning research has been devoted to video/image processing applications (such as autonomous vehicles) or natural language applications (such as smart speakers).  Often these applications are using high powered custom hardware or cloud-based servers.  Considerably less effort has looked at the potential applications and benefits of Neural Networks on edge computing, environmental sensing, wearables, and other resource constrained devices.     The research conducted in this Phase II project focuses entirely on resource constrained devices. Thalchemy has developed Neural Networks for a range of unique applications, where the fully trained models can be deployed on the types of embedded systems seen in wearables or edge computing devices. These Neural Network algorithms have been shown to solve unique problems with a wide array of sensors commonly available in devices, such as accelerometers, microphones, gyroscopes, heart rate sensors, and more.     Much of the research and development of this project has focused on consumer wearable abilities, such as enabling user activity recognition, sleep detection, gesture recognition, or other user context classification. This SBIR Project funded several key advancements in consumer-focused applications, providing solutions for Thalchemy’s customers which outperform the accuracy, reliability, and battery life of competing products.  However, this research has also resulted in broader impact applications related to health and safety. One ability that was prototyped was the detection and classification dangerous sounds.  This has a clear application in security systems, providing an ability to improve the safety of cities and infrastructure through remote monitoring.  Another feature developed was the ability to accurately and reliably detect user falls, which has applications for improving the safety of elderly wearables users.  In fact, many of the research elements of this project have applications for assisting in the monitoring of safety and health for the population of aging individuals.     The research work that Thalchemy has performed, in large part funded by the NSF SBIR, has shown that highly optimized neural networks have a broad set of applications beyond image and natural language processing.  As embedded computing, wearables, and edge computing devices continue to grow, these accomplishments will continue to drive important features for sensor enabled devices.
