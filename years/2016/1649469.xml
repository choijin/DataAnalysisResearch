<AbstractNarration>Much of human communication is now mediated by online social networks. Twitter, Facebook, and Youtube now compete for our collective attention in much the same way as television, radio, and newspapers did for previous generations. But contemporary online social media are qualitatively different from media of the past. Online communication leaves a record of who said what to whom, when, and on what topic. The development of new analytical tools offer the possibility to use these records to track popular on-line topics and to identify the demographics of groups contributing to these topics, including  the geographic location of contributors, as well as their age, gender, and ethnicity. What is more, it is possible for ad hoc groups to coalesce around topics in real time. On the one hand, these data present a challenge for computer scientists to develop new tools that enable the tracking of these kinds of information. Success in this domain offers significant practical benefits in business, marketing, and politics. At the same time, however, the ability to track these kinds of information raise privacy concerns, both for individuals and for members of groups who can be identified by the emerging technology. In our research, computer scientists will develop tools that enable tracking of topics and group memberships,  and communication researchers will identify the kinds of privacy concerns that people develop around these kinds of information, when, why, and with what consequences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research described in this project builds on prior work on trend analysis and community extraction, seeking to advance research on two fronts: the efficient identification of ad hoc communities which focus on a popular topic, and the understanding of individual versus group privacy based on the identified communities. Although trend analysis is a burgeoning area of research in Computer Science, existing models focus on the correlation of only one dimension (e.g., location) with trending topics. This research represents a step forward by providing a more sophisticated and powerful tool that allows for the extraction of interesting and potentially useful trend patterns through Topic Based Community Identification. At the same time, this community identification may prompt new types of group privacy concerns that have not been researched in social science, which has mainly focused on individual rather than group privacy. This approach provides a unique opportunity to significantly impact scholarly understanding of the mechanisms and dynamics of individual and group privacy concern, especially with regard to ad-hoc, topic-based groups, and their effects on Social Media users' attitudes and behavior. If group-level privacy is a concern beyond individual privacy, then we expect to find that people will express group privacy concerns when a group they identify with is included in the tracking information, especially when topics are morally loaded, but independent of whether the individual participant is personally involved in the Twitter conversation. This has the potential to develop necessary and sufficient conditions for the emergence of group privacy concerns.</AbstractNarration>

The notion of a cyborg, or software tools that reside on the user's machine to protect and preserve their privacy.  LocBorg is an idea that will be critical to protect user privacy as the degree of trust decreases in large social media systems.  Recent revelations indicate that such large enterprises cannot be completely trusted to preserve crucial user attributes or characteristics.     Identification of topic-based communities and individuals who discuss specific topics in social media through CATT may also prompt new types of group privacy concerns never before researched in the social sciences, which tends to focus on individual-level privacy and on static rather than ad-hoc groups. Thus a second goal of this project was to develop a better understanding of individual versus group privacy based on the identified communities. To this end we performed a series of planned "user studies" among samples of UCSB students and Mechanical Turk workers. The first set of user studies consisted of online experiments in which topic sensitivity (sensitive vs. nonsensitive) and group tracking (ingroup vs. outgroup tracking) were manipulated. Data from 353 participants show that CATT evoked moderate levels of both personal and group privacy concern.  The second set of user studies examined how algorithmic inference technologies, such as CATT, create groups and threaten their privacy through revealing community- or group-level information based on individual-level data (e.g., social media postings or fitness app usage). Results showed evidence that they do, but varied by the app. For Trender (the CATT-like app), personal and group privacy concerns were highly correlated and dependent. Results for the second research question showed that personal and group privacy threats affected users? judgements of the group inference apps, with increased threat lowering users? perceptions of the appeal and degree of risk posed by the technology. Again, however, the results varied by app.   These findings have important theoretical and practical implications. Primarily, they suggest existing theories should be expanded to consider group-level privacy, rather than focusing solely on privacy at the individual level. In fact, group privacy is gaining in importance and group inference technologies present new threats to privacy that have not been identified or studied in the literature.  Our research is a first step in  undertanding how indivduals perceive this critical notion, which will be important to future privacy literacy educational efforts, as well as in promoting computer scientists to explore novel methods for preserving group privacy.
