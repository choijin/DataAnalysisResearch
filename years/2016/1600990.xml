<AbstractNarration>CS Gateways 2015 is a two-day workshop for selected project leaders from NSF-supported computer science instructional material and professional development projects. The workshop will provide an opportunity for those leaders to think collectively about the scalability and long-term sustainability of their work, as well as support structures for long-term implementation and growth.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broad goals of the conference are to &lt;br/&gt; -- Inspire the project leaders to think beyond the development activities of their NSF-funded projects and to commit to taking steps that will lead to long-term growth and sustainability once NSF funding has ended;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; -- Educate the participants about key issues that should be considered now in order to facilitate scalability and sustainability of their work; provide models of potential routes to scalability and sustainability; and&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; -- Strengthen the community of CS curriculum and professional developers; encourage collaboration and sharing of ideas and solution strategies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop represents a continuation of a series of NSF sponsored "Gateways" conferences where mathematics and science curriculum developers met annually to share experiences, discuss challenges, find and identify joint solutions, and build a community of educators and leaders focused on instructional material and professional development.</AbstractNarration>
