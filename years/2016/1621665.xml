<AbstractNarration>With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program and the Chemistry Research Instrumentation (CRIF) Program, Professor Neelam Khan from Georgia Gwinnett College (GGC) and colleague Simon Mwongela have acquired an atomic force microscope (AFM). In an AFM a laser beam is directed to a surface area by means of a cantilever (a tip anchored at only one end). As the cantilever is displaced by interacting with the surface a reflection of the laser beam is displayed on a detector (photodiode). In this way an image of the surface can be created with the aid of an electronic system. In general, an AFM has three major abilities: force measurement, imaging and manipulation. This microscopy instrument is used to investigate the surface of materials and enable researchers to obtain nanoscale-level details of surface structure, morphology and interaction forces for a wide range of systems. The technique provides images which enable characterization of surfaces on various materials such as polymers, biological materials and aerosols. Information is obtained on magnetic, electronic and mechanical properties which can lead to improvement in desirable properties for materials such as semiconductors, vertebrate visual pigments and water filtration membranes. The instrumentation is used in research projects undertaken by undergraduates providing invaluable real-world, hands-on training for future careers in higher education or industry.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The instrumentation will be used in research at Georgia Gwinnett College especially in areas such as (a) chracterizing semiconductors of groups II-V; (b) characterizing the packing of rhodopsin, a visual pigment, at membrane surfaces; (c) studying conductive polymer film morphology as a function of biomolecular oxidant; (d) analyzing natural and synthetic neuromelanin; (e) analyzing single-particles of local tropospheric aerosols; and (f) analyzing interactions between pollutants and membranes.</AbstractNarration>
