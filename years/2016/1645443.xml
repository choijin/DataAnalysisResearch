<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project ranges from discovery research in the biological and other life sciences to applications in laboratory and clinical medicine. The PVT1 non-protein coding gene is very important in both disease and non-disease biological states. This project is producing multiple novel tools potentially useful for research, diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic applications. The new tools being developed have applications in bioimaging and discovery research and development, with impact extending beyond disease states where PVT1-derived non-coding RNAs and their molecular targets may be abnormal into non-disease states across the full spectrum of biological systems where PVT1-derived non-coding RNAs and their molecular targets may be relevant.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project focuses on the non-coding gene locus, PVT1, located on the 8q24 chromosome. PVT1 is important in normal and abnormal biological states. PVT1 has at least 12 different exons and encodes six microRNAs, which are differentially expressed in prostate cancer (PCa). PVT1 exon 9 may be a biomarker of aggressive PCa, and microRNA-1207-3p has prognostic value in PCa, and regulates a new fibronectin domain containing 1 (FNDC1)/fibronectin (FN1)/androgen receptor (AR) molecular pathway that is associated with metastatic PCa. Consequently, PVT1 exon 9 primers (patent pending) were invented for detection of both cellular and cell-free PVT1 exon 9, and siRNAs (patent pending) that silence expression of PVT1 exon 9 and inhibit PCa tumor cell phenotypes were invented. For discovery of the molecular mechanisms of action of microRNA-1207-3p, a novel synthetic biotinylated microRNA-1207-3p duplex (patent pending) was invented. The usefulness of this novel synthetic biotinylated microRNA-1207-3p duplex in bioimaging, and inhibition of PCa tumor cell phenotypes has been demonstrated.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>We discovered that specific molecules derived from the PVT1 gene have specific expression patterns in prostate cancer. And we decided to utilize this discovery to develop an assay with application in prostate cancer diagnosis. During the course of this project we interviewed well over 100 individuals, and groups to determine what the most important problem in the field of prostate cancer is, and who would most want it to be solved. We discovered that accurately diagnosing prostate cancer and distinguishing between indolent and aggressive prostate cancer is the most important problem in the field of prostate cancer. Further, we were able to determine that primary care physicians and urologists are two customer segments that need to be able to order a diagnostic assay that accurately diagnoses prostate cancer and distinguishes between indolent and aggressive prostate cancer. Based on this, we determined that there is a market for the prostate cancer diagnostic assay we are developing. Furthermore, we decided that we needed to form a start-up biotechnology company to pursue commercialization of the prostate cancer diagnostic assay we are developing. We were able to identify a collaborator who could suitably serve as chief executive officer of the company. The chief executive officer has taken the lead in setting up the company and using it to pursue commercialization of our prostate cancer diagnostic. The company is now progressively discussing with multiple potential investors. In the meantime, we have obtained one issued US patent, one allowed US patent, and two pending US patent applications. In addition, we have developed an absolute quantification assay for non-invasive detection of the PVT1 molecules in urine. We are now poised to test this assay to determine if it accurately diagnoses prostate cancer and distinguishes between indolent and aggressive prostate cancer, and subsequently to bring it to the market.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 09/08/2018<br>      Modified by: Olorunseun&nbsp;0&nbsp;Ogunwobi</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
