<AbstractNarration>The present subsurface imaging process involves massive data collection, often manual retrieval, from hundreds and thousands of sensors to a central place for post computing. The whole process is expensive and often takes months to complete. This I-Corps team creates a groundbreaking technology, Real-time In-situ Subsurface Imaging (RISI), for imaging subsurface dynamics in real-time (e.g., seconds to minutes). A RISI system can be said as a "subsurface camera and video camera" that records the subsurface dynamics in a snap - a technology milestone and invention to be written in the history. Such a technology can be applied to a wide range of subsurface exploration topics such as oil/gas exploration and production, hydrothermal, CO2 storage, mining safety, border security and civil engineering applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The RISI technology is a groundbreaking technology that integrates interdisciplinary innovations on distributed computing and signal processing, geophysical imaging and mesh networking technology. Instead of collecting data to a central server for post-processing, the distributed data processing and computing are performed in-situ under resource constraints. Such an approach has never been attempted before and represents a major achievement for both earth and computer science. In sharp contrast to present-time technology, the RISI system significantly reduces the whole process from months/days to seconds, and its deployment and maintenance costs are near zero, as a RISI system is autonomous, self-healing and self-sustainable, and requires little intervention during operations. The I-Corps program will provide insight through customer interviews of the viability of the RISI technology in the marketplace, information regarding desired instrument design attributes, funds for technology development, and a transition plan for commercializing the technology. It will be a great education and outreach experiences for faculty and students involved, and promote the entrepreneurship in the GSU and the broader technical community of Atlanta.</AbstractNarration>
