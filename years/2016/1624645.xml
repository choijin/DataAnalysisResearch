<AbstractNarration>The use of Unoccupied Aircraft Systems (UAS), also known as drones, in marine science is growing, filling a gap between shoreline or boat-based surveys and aerial imagery collected by occupied airplanes and satellites. Drones enable on-demand, high resolution data collection across ocean environments, while reducing costs and human risk. The potential applications for promoting the progress of marine science are vast, including studies of changing coastlines, measuring ocean water quality, counting animals such as seabirds and sea turtles, assessing the health and behavior of animals, and even sampling the breath of individual whales. Despite their demonstrated utility for marine science and conservation missions, there is little support for researchers to integrate drones into their scientific studies. Similarly, there are few programs designed to train students to use drones in marine science and conservation programs. This project addresses these gaps by establishing a research and training facility that will enhance the capacity of NSF-funded researchers, and other portions of the scientific community on the US East Coast, to use drones for the study and conservation of coastal and marine systems.&amp;#8232; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will i) repurpose and renovate an existing building to create engineering, computational, and visualization/training/outreach laboratories for UAS research, ii) diversify a fleet of UAS to increase capabilities available to the scientific community in the region, iii) develop a data analysis, visualization, and storage framework for products generated by the facility.  Numerous challenges associated with operating UAS will benefit from this centralized regional marine facility, including FAA licensing and permitting, development and deployment of marine-specific sampling methods, maintenance of the social license to operate, centralized data archiving, and by establishing a locus for sensor, computational, and visualization tool development in response to the scientific needs of coastal and marine researchers.  The UAS facility will enable studies of the ecosystem consequences of human activities in marine habitats, including dynamics and processes. This new sampling capability provides aerial imagery from visible to infrared and hyperspectral wavelengths, as well as other geo-referenced sensor data, including light detection and ranging (LIDAR) and synthetic aperture radar (SAR). UAS are also now used to sample atmospheric phenomena (wind, aerosols) and can even be used to sample breath from individual whales. The potential coastal applications range from studies of changing coastal geomorphology to population dynamics and behavior of marine vertebrates such as seals and turtles. Archived, geospatially referenced data will be invaluable for long-term studies of change related to storm events and sea-level rise in coastal areas. The facility will enable hands-on sensor and computational development experience for students in engineering and biology programs at Duke, and will support a summer training course in research methods open to professionals as well as undergraduate and graduate students. The facility will also support marine science interaction in the local community and established STEM outreach initiatives including local public school aviation clubs and summer programs at local the Boys and Girls Clubs.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The use of Unoccupied Aircraft Systems (UAS, aka drones) in marine science is growing, addressing an important gap between on-the-ground observations and remote-sensing methods of occupied aircraft and satellites. The proposed work established a facility at Duke University to enable reserarchers to conduct high resolution (in time and space), drone-based remote sensing in both coastal and pelagic environments, while reducing costs and risk. The proposed work wassplitinto three main components: 1) The renovation of a building to housethefacility, 2, the expansion of aircrqft and sensors vailable at the facilityand 3) the exhancement of computing resources to analyze and archivevdrone data collected at the facility. The renovation of the Boathouse north building was completed in April 2017. The building was seperated into 2 main sections, both ADA compliant. One section was designed to be an open engineering space with storage space, benches for technical work with aircraft and sensors, and secure cabinets for storing batteries and expensive sensors. The second portion of the renovation provided desk space for a lab engineer and a program manager, as well as for students working on data analysis. The rsecond room is partially seperated by a pony wall that supports a large screen display for teaching and data visualization. The removations provided an ADA bathroom for the building as well.</p> <p>The expansion of UAS fleet included the purchase of several training platforms (both multirotor and fixed wing) as well as research grade aircraft of both configurations. Due to the rate of technological development in the UAS market, the project was able to acquire a larger number of aircraft, in some cases with better sensors, than originally proposed. Specifically, the project purchased 2 Parrot "Disco" fixed wing drones and 3 Parrot Bebop II multirotors as training aircraft. For research-grade aircraft, the project acquired 2 eBee Plus RTK fixed wing drones, 1 Altavian Nova fixed wing drone, and one Alta FreeFly 6 multicopter aircraft with RGB sensors.</p> <p>The project acquired 3 workstation computers for onsite data analysis. These workstations are fitted with high end GPUs (NVidia GeForce 10 Series) to facililate photgrammetric analysis of drone imagery. For data storage and archival,&nbsp;The equipment that was purchased uses solid state drives (SSDs), which provide an extremely fast reading and writing capability &ndash; far outstripping the ability of conventional hard drives &ndash; though with a lower total capacity. The machines together serve as a "data transfer node" with capacity and speed sufficient to keep up with data streams on a 10 Gbs fiber network connection, thus avoiding a data transfer bottleneck at the storage device in Durham by serving as a "buffer" for incoming and outgoing data. Because capacity of the SSDs is smaller, Duke provided storage capacity on EMC Isilon devices in the Durham data centers equivalent to the capacity specified in the original proposal. Those devices are administered by OIT, and the allocation and management of the capacity are by Nicholas School IT staff who work in concert with the Marine Lab drone center researchers. In addition, the data transfer node can be used to facilitate data transfers to and from other researchers at other institutions using Duke&rsquo;s high-bandwidth connections through the research and education networks. Thus, the installation of the storage takes advantage of new networking capability and data management changes in the Nicholas School of the Environment, easing large data transfers and increasing the resilience of data storage (e.g., no removals of devices from Beaufort when hurricanes threaten).</p> <p>In terms of intellectual merit and broader impacts, the projects has exceeded expectations. For example, during the year it was established: 1) the project supported a series of local and international research projects that have resulted in the publication of 6 peer-reviewed studies; 2) the project provided UAS support to 4 NSF-funded projects (OPP Palmer LTER, PI Ducklow; OPP Minke Whales, PI Friedlaender; IOS Sea turtles, PI Lohmann; IOS Whale Manueverability, PI Goldbogen) as well as at least 11 other projects funded through state or private foundations. In terms of outreach, the facility hosted or participated in over 130 outreach events withing the local community along with delivering presentations on the facility and it's work at over 22 invited seminars at academic institutions. For formal training, the facility supported the creation of a university level course on the use of Drones in Marine Biology, Ecology and Conservation at Duke University. From this, the facility has now graduated 13 FAA certified Part 107 remote pilots authorized to use drones for research in the US National Airspace System (NAS). Lastly, in terms of engineering, the facility has now developed an in-house multicopter drone useful for cetacean photogrammetry that is light and compact, yet capable of long endurance flights (&gt; 30 minutes).</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 12/05/2017<br>      Modified by: David&nbsp;Johnston</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent"
