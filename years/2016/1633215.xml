<AbstractNarration>A number of phenomena of societal importance, such as the spread of diseases and&lt;br/&gt;contagion processes, can be modeled by stochastic processes on networks. The analysis &lt;br/&gt;and control of such network phenomena involve, at their heart, fundamental graph-theoretic problems. &lt;br/&gt;The graphs encountered are typically of large-scale (having tens of millions of nodes); &lt;br/&gt;further, typical experimental analyses involve large designs with a number of parameters, &lt;br/&gt;leading to hundreds of thousands of graph computations. Novel methods for solving these problems&lt;br/&gt;are needed, since fast response times are critical to effective decision making.&lt;br/&gt;The overarching goal of this project is to develop efficient distributed algorithms &lt;br/&gt;and associated lower bounds for graph-theoretic problems that arise in computational &lt;br/&gt;epidemiology and contagion dynamics.  This will have a significant impact on these specific &lt;br/&gt;applications, through more efficient algorithmic tools for enabling complex analyses.  &lt;br/&gt;The project will also make fundamental contributions to the design and analysis of &lt;br/&gt;distributed algorithms for graph problems in large-scale networks, and will&lt;br/&gt;result in an algorithmic toolkit with building blocks for performing large-scale &lt;br/&gt;distributed graph computation.  The project will lead to significant curriculum development &lt;br/&gt;for undergraduate as well as graduate students, as well as public health analysts. &lt;br/&gt;Finally, the project will help in involving minority and underrepresented students in research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The technical focus of the project will be on distributed algorithms for fundamental topics &lt;br/&gt;in graph algorithms such as graph connectivity, distances, subgraph analysis, and different&lt;br/&gt;kinds of centrality measures.  These topics underlie some of the recurring problems in the &lt;br/&gt;modeling, simulation and analysis and control of different kinds of contagion processes.  &lt;br/&gt;For all these problems, the project will focus on developing provably efficient distributed &lt;br/&gt;algorithms and showing lower bounds under a message-passing distributed computing model. &lt;br/&gt;The PIs will also develop efficient implementations of these algorithms, and evaluate their &lt;br/&gt;performance and solution quality in real-world graphs arising in epidemiology.  The graphs &lt;br/&gt;that arise in these applications have several novel characteristics, which will present new &lt;br/&gt;challenges as well as opportunities for distributed computing.</AbstractNarration>
