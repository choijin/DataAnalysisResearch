<AbstractNarration>The project proposes hosting a national workshop on redefining the domain of cyber forensics. Cyber forensics has encountered major obstacles over the last decade and is at a crossroads. Traditional computer forensics, although still valid, does not fully map to emerging sub-areas such as memory forensics, cloud forensics, social media forensics, network forensics and mobile forensics, since data in many instances may not be acquired without some form of modification. There is also an increase in the volume, velocity and variety of data and storage necessitating the need for more efficient analysis methods while still preserving the authenticity and privacy of the collected digital evidence. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Device security and encryption has also improved and now, cyber forensics scientists and practitioners have to venture into ethical hacking to gain access to potential digital evidence as exhibited in the high profile Apple-FBI case. All these challenges have impacts on education and training, policy, law, the domain's ontology, and society as a whole. In parallel, there have been related extensive research areas emerging in social network analysis, psychology, data science, reverse engineering, and privacy without much interaction with cyber forensics. The proposed workshop with a blue-ribbon panel will stimulate the needed intellectual exchange of ideas and discussions on the future of the domain. It will help redefine the agenda for the future of cyber forensics, and will disseminate a progressive national report, setting the agenda for the field.</AbstractNarration>

This work presents data that was obtained during the National Workshop on Redefining Cyber Forensics (NWRCF) on May 23-24, 2017 supported by the National Science Foundation and organized by the University of New Haven. Qualitative and quantitative data were analyzed from twenty-four cyber forensics expert panel members. Our work identified important themes that need to be addressed by the community, focusing on (1) where the domain currently is; (2) where it needs to go and; (3) steps needed to improve it. Furthermore, based on the results, we articulate (1) the biggest anticipated challenges the domain will face in the next five years; (2) the most important cyber forensics research opportunities in the next five years and; (3) the most important job-ready skills that need to be addressed by higher education curricula over the next five years. Lastly, we present the key issues and recommendations deliberated by the expert panel.

The overall recommendations from our work were as follows:  Development of an emerging group as part of organizations such as the Association of Computing Machinery (ACM) to make the community a more coherent group within the computing disciplines. Increase the number of annual competitions in open-source tool development to encourage practitioners to solve problems in emerging areas. The creation of a forensic tool marketplace where tools, their issues, bugs, and tests, and testing datasets are shared with the community. Early identification of emerging topics so that standardized processes can be developed, leading to the possibility of more focused and timely funding being provided. The creation of flash granting mechanisms for applied cyber forensics research topics with short technological turnarounds. Improving inter-grant agency funding collaboration, such as a joint granting effort between DOJ and NSF. The creation of focused funding in Cyber Forensics in programs like SaTC, with review panels made up of digital forensics experts. Establishing mechanisms for communication channels and collaboration between stakeholders in the community should be improved and encouraged, so that standardized policies, procedures and tools can be developed, utilized and enforced with confidence in the industry.  Hosting more frequently funded active workshops to discuss the cyber forensics community, the future of the community, and shift focus of the community to current trends. Re-examination of educational programs shifting the focus from a specialized approach to one that is multidisciplinary. Expanding cyber forensics to other areas to allow stakeholders and students to understand problems as a whole, leading to the development of more efficient solutions. Teaching low-level fundamentals in courses for subjects such as encryption, forensic investigations and ethics, which should be standardized and incorporated into programs.
