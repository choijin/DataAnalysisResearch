<AbstractNarration>SES-1636924&lt;br/&gt;Stephen Benard&lt;br/&gt;Bianca Manago&lt;br/&gt;Indiana University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Past research has documented the serious stigma consequences of mental health labels. However, research has not examined how individuals are viewed when a mental health label is not given to explain deviant behavior; or compared how these consequences differ by the legitimacy of who provides the label (e.g., physician vs. layperson). A systematic investigation of labeling: (1) provides a better understanding of how to intervene in the stigma and status loss processes (e.g., targeting descriptions of behavior vs. mental illness labels in anti-stigma campaigns); (2) may inform physicians' decisions regarding diagnosing patients with mental illness; and (3) influences individuals' decisions regarding if, when, and how to disclose their own mental illnesses. To ensure this information is disseminated to individuals with mental illnesses and organizations dedicated to reducing mental illness stigma, the co-PI is  collaborating with Bring Change 2 Mind - a national anti-stigma campaign. Finally, the proposed project will educate undergraduate research assistants by training them in social science research methodology, and teaching them the sociological implications of mental health issues.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project investigates how the presence, source, and characteristics of mental illness labels affect the desired social distance from (stigmatization), and perceived competence of (status) an individual. Specifically, the research asks: (1) When a mental health label is given to explain an individual's deviant behavior, how does that change others' evaluations of that person? (2) Does the legitimacy of the label's source (e.g., physician vs. layperson) change the label's impact? (3) How do the features of the mental illness affect this process? To examine these processes, the co-PI will complete a national survey experiment of adults in the United States. Following methods used in the 1996, 2002, and 2006 General Social Surveys, respondents will read a vignette that describes a person who is experiencing symptoms of a mental illness. The vignettes are identical except the presence/absence and source of a mental health label differ. To study the effect of uncertainty on stigma, the research compares the effects of providing a specific diagnosis (e.g., schizophrenia), to no diagnostic information, and finally, to an explicit non-diagnosis (e.g., John does not have a mental illness). To examine the effect of legitimacy, three sources of labels are considered: expert others (e.g., physician), non-expert others (e.g., friend or layperson), and the survey respondents themselves. Finally, to account for features of mental illness known to cause high levels of stigma, the co-PI will conduct four replications of this study, examining mental illnesses that: induce fear, disrupt social interaction, both, or neither. The researchers predict that when mental health labels are given to explain individual's deviant behavior, stigma will be reduced because the individual will not be held responsible for his/her behavior. They also predict that because of the physicians? perceived legitimacy, mental health labels that are applied by medical professionals, will be more effective at reducing stigma than labels that are applied by lay persons. Results will inform efforts to reduce the stigmatization and status loss of individuals with mental illness.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In this project, I investigate how a mental illness labels affect two forms of inequality: stigma, a driver of social exclusion, and status, the extent to which one is perceived as respected and competent. Specifically, I examine how the presence of a medical label, the source of that label (e.g., physician or layperson), and the mental illness to which it is applied affect processes of stigmatization and status loss.       This project accomplishes five objectives: (1) identifies situations under which mental illness labels may reduce stigma in interpersonal interactions; (2) determines the effect of both applied and denied mental illness labels; (3) pinpoints blame as a fulcrum between stigma and status; (4) isolates effect of fear of mental illness on stigma; and (5) considers the role of legitimacy in mental illness labeling processes.     To study these questions, I conduct a series of four vignette-based survey experiments which vary in the amount of uncertainty and fear present in the vignette: (1) high uncertainty/high fear, (2) high uncertainty/low fear, (3) low uncertainty/high fear, (4) low uncertainty/low fear. The high-uncertainty vignettes describe a brief encounter with a person with a mental illness, whereas the low-uncertainty vignettes describe year-long snapshot of the vignette character?s life. Vignettes that are designed to depict the character as more dangerous and elicit more fear describe someone with schizophrenia, whereas the vignettes designed to elicit less fear describe an individual with depression.     Within each study, participants are randomly assigned to conditions where upon reading the vignette they are either told no additional information (control condition), that the vignette character has a mental illness (label condition), or that the vignette character definitely does not have a mental illness (denied label condition).
