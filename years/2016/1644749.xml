<AbstractNarration>Distributed and Event-based System Conference Student Travel Grant&lt;br/&gt;The aim of the student travel grant to the ACM International Conference on Distributed and Event-based Systems (DEBS) in Irvine, CA June 20-24, 2016 is to provide doctoral students a supportive scientific forum to engage in inter- and multi-disciplinary scholarship focusing on distributed and event-based systems. The Scholar Roundtable provides a forum for expert and peer critique of students' doctoral work with the goal of improving their dissertation. Student participants will also have the opportunity to receive networking support and career advice from internationally-recognized experts. Overall, the student travel award enables the 'cross-pollination' of students, researchers, developers, and users as they explore research ideas, evaluate maturing technologies, and develop novel applications using these technologies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aim of the Distributed and Event-based System Conference Student Travel Grant is to support doctoral students through constructive remarks and feedback on their interdisciplinary research from prominent researchers and through interaction with other students. Student participants from a broad range of disciplines will give short presentations of their work and receive constructive feedback from internationally respected experts in the areas of distributed and event-based systems. The expert panelists will also provide student participants with career guidance and mentoring through presentations and small group advising throughout the day. In addition, support for travel and registration will allow student participants the opportunity to see the conference and network with conference attendees.</AbstractNarration>

In 2016, DEBS received about 100 full-paper submissions and the highly accomplished international program committee created a top quality technical program. The US program chair, Prof. Nalini Venkatasubramanian obtained funds to provide travel grants to US student attendees of DEBS 2016.

In addition, the scope of DEBS 2016 included the increasingly important area of Internet of Things. New advances in distributed and event-based systems pose a great potential for a major contribution in this area.  The outstanding technical program of DEBS 2016 featured research presentations, keynote talks, industry talks, tutorials, plenary panels, workshops, poster sessions, research exhibits, demos etc. This event:    Provided an environment for discussion of major challenges in next-generation distributed systems and event-based computing.   Promoted collaboration and cooperation between industry, academia, and researchers on topics related to DEBS 2016 focus.    Communicated experiences and visions through invited talks, plenary and industrial panels from leading researchers and practitioners who have actively researched and deployed in this field, with the goal of identifying specific future challenges in the purview of the rise of the Internet of Things.   Motivated and engaged future generations of researchers via conference and workshop presentations, interactive poster sessions, panel and breakout sessions.   Student Attendance and Involvement at ACM DEBS 2016: The award created a valuable forum for our next generation of student researchers; it exposed the student awardees to new topics and leaders in the community .  The DEBS 2016 event had approximately 30 student attendees who participated in the entire conference including tutorials, workshops, talks, poster/demo sessions and the associated networking events (at a much reduced or waived registration).  The DEBS conference fostered interactions between senior DEBS community members and the younger generation of student attendees in multiple events that were designed to facilitate such formal and informal networking.  Given the highly international nature of DEBS, the US-based students were able to interact  and network with a broader group of students and researchers  from multiple universities around the world including UK, Japan, China, Australia, Greece, Germany, Italy, Portugal, Switzerland, Israel and Brazil.  Student awardees attended a Ph.D.  forum where selected doctoral students presented their proposed and ongoing work to distinguished researchers around the world in a mock thesis proposal style presentation.     Intellectual Merit Outcomes:    Specific technical activities and their outcomes are:  * Talks, presentations and tutorials from leading researchers and practitioners informed students and provided insight into  specific challenges. * Keynote talks by 1. Dr. Peter Pietzuch, Imperial College, London UK; Talk Title: How Event-Based Systems Took Over the World. 2. Prof. Raj Rajkumar, Carnegie Mellon University, USA; Talk Title:  The Journey Ahead for Driverless Vehicles, 3. Dr. Karthik Ramasamy, Twitter Inc, USA; Talk Title: Real Time Analytics - Why?, What? And How The NSF award was used to also enable student attendance at the conference through travel grants/stipends to partially cover the airfare, registration and local expenses of graduate students.   An interactive poster/demonstration session was organized where student researchers presented software demonstrations, research projects and new ideas in emerging applications and technologies.Students obtained access to a conference tutorial on "Stream Reasoning: Managing Velocity and Variety in Big Data" that was delivered by researchers from the Politecnico di Milano. Workshops on state of the art topics were selected, organized and presented at the conference and were attended by students - (a) Workshop on Streaming Big Data and Publish-Subscribe Systems and (b) Workshop on Scientific Challenges in Data and Event-Driven Smart City Service and Applications. During the conference, an interactive Student Scholar Roundtable and Luncheon was held where student participants at the conference had a chance to informally interact with senior researchers in the community on a one-on-one basis.  Students were able to attend the Ph.D. forum where selected students  were able to participate and present their work in a mock-defense setting. Broader Impact Outcomes:  The DEBS 2016 conference was able to facilitate the diverse participation of senior and junior US researchers, including Ph.D. students and postdoctoral researchers. A particular attempt was made to broadening the participation of student and senior researchers from women and underrepresented groups. The conference thus helped in training the next generation of scientists, engineers and application designers who are both consumers and developers of distributed event-based systems and distributed computing technologies. The event succeeded to foster interactivity through the ample time for poster discussions, roundtables, networking events, Ph.D. forum presentations, and breakouts.
