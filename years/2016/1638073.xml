<AbstractNarration>Virtual reality has enabled surgeons to train on procedures without risk to patients. However, the feedback surgical trainees receive is delayed, subjective, and qualitative, thereby lacking support for rapid acquisition of skill. This project will enhance surgical performance and training by providing performance feedback using touch-based cues that convey movement quality and strategies rather than task outcomes like procedure time. This will allow trainees to get feedback that is immediate and quantitative, and result in improved performance in difficult-to-train motor skills. Should this research prove successful, there is an opportunity to make meaningful changes in how surgeons are trained. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Co-robots in the endovascular surgical domain can take several forms, from a virtual reality simulator that mimics patient-specific procedures, enabling high-fidelity procedural rehearsal, to telesurgical systems that are used to navigate flexible robotic tools to anatomical locations. Such systems require significant skill to use and, in turn, a rigorous training protocol before certification to operate with the robot is granted. To date, training protocols rely on practice and subjective feedback by a skilled observer, and acquisition of skill on these systems can be inefficient. Furthermore, there is a lack of objective metrics of skill acquisition. This project will investigate the use of haptic feedback to trainees based on motion-based performance metrics, and will evaluate the potential role of this feedback modality during performance and training for simulated and robotic endovascular surgical tasks. In particular, the project will evaluate the benefit of providing specific performance feedback that highlights task strategies in the motion space, and the effect of providing such directed feedback on learning and retention of the task.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The aim of this project was to develop methods for real-time haptic feedback to improve surgical skill training. Endovascular surgery entails delivering stents and other devices to target locations in the vasculature by feeding flexible guidewires and catheters through an incision in the femoral artery. To date, assessment of surgical skill for endovascular navigation tasks has relied on subjective methods or structured grading scales that are filled out by expert surgeons who observe the task completion by the trainee. In prior work, the team demonstrated that smoothness of endovascular tool tip movements, computed from tool tip velocity profiles, correlates with skill. In this prior work, all of the data analysis was carried out after the tasks were completed, and the results were not provided to the trainees as feedback.</p> <p>There were four primary outcomes demonstrating the intellectual merit of this research effort. First, the team developed and validated methods for real-time assessment and haptic-based performance feedback for a complex motor task similar in nature to endovascular navigation. Second, the team explored methods of modeling skill acquisition to better characterize the individual variability in performance over time. Third, the team developed methods for real-time estimation of movement smoothness from endovascular tool tip movements in a surgical simulator. Finally, the team demonstrated the utility of these motion-based metrics for assessing skill of vascular trainees in real-world settings, not just in a controlled laboratory environment. As part of the Broader Impact for the project, the team used haptic paddles in an undergraduate mechanical engineering course to expose students to the underlying technology and the value of interactive laboratory experiments when learning engineering concepts. Students in the course were also able to participate in the human-subject experiments that were part of the research effort. The team disseminated the results in a number of ways, including invited talks at universities, workshops, and conferences; via lab tours for K-12 students, teachers, and community members; and through outreach activities.</p> <p>Regarding the first outcome, the team developed a novel approach to haptic guidance for training using tactile cueing (vibration cues provided to the user's arm) of movement smoothness, which is shown to correlate with high performance in terms of the primary outcome measures of the task. Movement smoothness, a characteristic associated with skilled and coordinated movement, was measured by spectral arc length, a frequency-domain measure of smoothness. The smoothness-based performance metric was encoded as a vibrotactile cue and displayed on the user?s arm. Performance on a mirror tracing task with smoothness-based feedback was compared to position-based feedback (where the subject was alerted when they moved outside the path boundary) and to a no-feedback control condition. Results were statistically significant with subjects receiving smoothness-based feedback showing improved speed and smoothness. Subjects receiving smoothness-based feedback altered their task completion strategies, resulting in faster task completion times with minimal loss in accuracy.</p> <p>Regarding the second outcome, the team explored methods of modeling skill acquisition. Mathematical modeling of skill acquisition curves has been dominated by the "power law" since the early 1980s, though there have been challenges suggesting an exponential function works better, particularly for individual-level data. Both functions predict decreasing and monotonic improvement with practice. In recent years, dynamical models of learning have been proposed, since such models capture the subject-level variability in performance that is typically observed experimentally. The team examined the fits of power functions, exponential functions, and these newer dynamic models to the mirror-tracing performance data. The dynamic state-space-based model consistently outperforms both power and exponential functions in fitting the data, and provides additional insights--in particular, providing an explicit method for incorporating the role of feedback in learning.</p> <p>The third outcome, demonstration of real time estimation of movement smoothness, is critical to translating the method of real-time haptic feedback of movement smoothness from the mirror tracing task to the surgical domain. The team validated computational methods of estimating spectral arc length using sliding and overlapping windows of data during task completion, showing the correlation of estimated spectral arc length, idle time, and average velocity to end-of-trial measures of spectral arc length.</p> <p>Regarding the fourth outcome, the team developed a program that automated the recording of subject user names and collected simulated guidewire and catheter tip kinematics transmitted by a virtual reality endovascular surgery simulator. They collected data from individuals of varying surgical experience levels at four professional meetings and at the Methodist Institute for Technology Innovation and Education (MITIE). Results of the data analyses showed the effectiveness of performance metrics derived from the tool velocity profiles for assessing expertise, compared to existing metrics implemented on the ANGIO Mentor.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 01/30/2021<br>      Modified by: Marcia&nbsp;K&nbsp;O'malley</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1638073/1638073_10456786_1612043361807_System-feedback-diagram--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1638073/1638073_10456786_1612043361807_System-feedback-diagram--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Real-time surgical performance assessment and feedback"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1638073/1638073_10456786_1612043361807_System-feedback-diagram--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Real-time surgical performance assessment and feedback"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Surgical skill performance is assessed on manual and virtual training platforms by tracking tool tip velocity profiles.
