<AbstractNarration>With partial funding from the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program, this project supports the Gordon Research Conference and Gordon Research Seminar on Colloidal Semiconductor Nanocrystals, specifically facilitating the participation of students, postdocs, and early career scientists. The Conference program is inclusive of diverse participants as presenters and discussion leaders, including an emphasis on women, underrepresented minorities, and early career researchers. The Gordon Research Seminar, to be held on this topic for the first time, is organized by graduate student co-chairs with presenters and discussion leaders also being graduate students, postdocs, and early career scientists. This topical area holds great relevance for the advancement of knowledge that can enhance or even revolutionize energy storage, conversion, and conservation technologies, elevating the importance of the scientific discussion and especially the education of a new generation of researchers in this area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Colloidal nanocrystals are chemically synthesized in organic media and their surfaces are passivated with organic surfactants that solubilize the nanocrystals in solvent dispersion, and perform a range of functions, including electronic passivation of surface states, mediation of chemical interactions with other materials, and electronic exchange with the environment. Recently, it has become clear that controlling the chemistry of the surfaces of the nanocrystals is critical to observing the special properties promised by quantum confinement. The goals of this Gordon Research Conference are to explore the photophysical and materials properties of colloidal nanocrystals in terms of the chemical structure of both the core and the surface. The Conference program highlights: (i) synthetic methods to tune the composition, shape, and surface chemistry of nanocrystals, (ii) new analytical methods to quantitatively characterize the core and surface chemistry of the nanocrystals, (iii) photophysical studies of nanocrystals that relate activity in chemical and electronic systems, (iv) doping and plasmonic behavior in semiconductor nanocrystals, (v) the bio-compatibility and bio-applications of nanocrystals, and (vi) methods to form and properties of assemblies of nanocrystals. The program also features a session on emerging nanocrystal materials, specifically pnictides and halides. The value of this conference, with respect to pushing forward fundamental work in this field, lies in its compilation of advancements in these diverse topics into a single program addressed to a single interdisciplinary audience.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Operational Summary  The Gordon Research Conference (GRC) and Gordon Research Seminar (GRS) on Colloidal Semiconductor Nanocrystals were held at Mount Snow in West Dover Vermont from July 30 &ndash; August 5, 2016.   The meeting covered a variety of scientific topics and the content presented was highly rated by participants.    Conference Participants  The Conference was well-attended with 189 participants. Scientists from academia represented 91% of the participants while attendees from government accounted for 8% and those from industry totaled 2%. The meeting also attracted a strong mix of young investigators and senior scientists.  Students and post-docs accounted for 57% of all attendees. Approximately 28% of the participants at the 2016 meeting were women.    Seminar Participants  The Seminar was well-attended with 51 participants. Scientists from academia represented 92% of the participants while attendees from government accounted for 8%. Students and post docs combined accounted for 90% of all attendees. Approximately 31% of the participants at the 2016 seminar were women.     Conference Program  The 2016 Gordon Research Conference focused on emerging topics in nanocrystals.  From early spectroscopic observations that quantum confinement in semiconductor nanocrystals could shift the optical bandgap, this field has blossomed to encompass diverse chemistries, photophysical phenomena, and applications. The importance of surface chemistry was recognized from the beginning and refined understanding and sophisticated control of nanocrystal surfaces have recently been emphasized. Expanding from traditional II-VI compositions, researchers have lately overcome synthetic challenges to prepare high-quality nanocrystals of pnictide and multinary semiconductors. Meanwhile, spectroscopic observations have enriched our understanding of carrier dynamics in nanocrystals, connecting structure and composition with the photophysical processes underlying energy harvesting, conversion, and transfer. Recent progress integrating semiconductor nanocrystals into functional materials and devices has advanced in tandem with understanding of the mechanisms controlling electronic transport. The conference encompassed these and other emerging topics of interest to the nanocrystal community.     The seminar focused on two primary sessions. One devoted to expanding from traditional II-VI compositions: research directed at overcoming synthetic challenges to prepare high-quality nanocrystals of oxide, chalcogenide, pnictide and multinary semiconductors as well as advances in doping and complex structures. The other session focused on advances in nanoscale characterization techniques. Nanocrystals push the limit of instrument sensitivity and many new techniques have been developed to address specific properties of these systems.    Conference Feedback  Participants had an opportunity to provide feedback at the end of the Conference. The feedback collected from the meeting was extremely positive. Evaluations included numerous positive remarks regarding the diversity of speakers, opportunities for informal discussions, and lively discussion sessions.  The evaluations also included comments about the excellent speakers and highly interactive poster sessions at the GRS.   GRC would like to thank the National Science Foundation for its continued support of the meetings.  The contributions received from the National Science Foundation have been critical to the success of the conferences and are having a measurable impact in advancing the frontiers of science worldwide.
