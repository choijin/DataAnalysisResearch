<AbstractNarration>The general goal of this project is to develop a pan-Pacific drought atlas using tree-ring records.  This research specifically aims to explore: 1) drought occurrences and dynamics across the Americas; 2) inter-hemispheric regimes of decadal-to-centennial hydroclimate variability; 3) large-scale footprints and temporal properties of extreme events (including responses to volcanism, solar forcing and internal variability); and 4) past hydroclimatic drought events in reference to their underlying dynamics thereby offering insight into some of the most disruptive climatic events of the last millennium. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hydroclimate patterns will be analyzed for their associated dynamics and diagnosed for their connection to large-scale modes of variability and/or forced patterns of change. Multidecadal hydroclimate anomalies (e.g. megadroughts or pluvials) will be evaluated to determine if they arise from inter-hemispheric-scale climate regimes with coherence across continents or as more local continental-scale phenomena. Similarly, extremes in individual years will be assessed for their dynamic origins and probability of occurrence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Why this research? Characterizing and understanding large-scale hydroclimate variability during the last millennium is a critical means of evaluating and improving projections of future hydroclimate change. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Why this research now? Two recent developments make the time ripe for significant advances in this area of research.  First, fully pan-Pacific reconstructions of last-millennium hydroclimate variability are now within reach. Second, the large and growing ensemble of last-millennium simulations with fully-coupled climate models make dynamic investigations of past hydroclimate change possible thereby providing potentially improved assessments of projected future risks and impacts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will help improve the understanding of extreme climatic events climate and includes a substantive leveraging of international collaboration with South American colleagues in Argentina and Chile, creation of a user-friendly drought atlas, and public outreach on science and education.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Countries across South America have seen significant social and economic challenges tied to hydroclimatic variability over the last several decades.  Severe water shortages occurred in central Chile and western Argentina during the droughts of 1968-1969, 1976-1977, 1996-1997, and 2010-2019. During the 1968-69 event, farmers in western Argentina reported crop losses of up to 50% due to reduced water supply and in Chile cereal and vegetable production dropped by 65%, irrigation areas contracted by 40%, and livestock numbers decreased by 45% across the country. Chile is also currently experiencing the most severe decadal drought over the last millennium.  Socioeconomic disasters tied to these historical events highlight the acute vulnerability of South America to hydroclimatic variability and motivate research to better understand what drives variability in the region for predictive purposes.  These urgent questions motivated the goals of our project, which were to document temporal and spatial variability of hydroclimate in South America over the last millennium, while working to understand the large-scale climate factors that give rise to such variability.  These insights were then used to better understand and interpret the reliability of model simulations of past and future hydroclimatic change in South America.   Our project produced the South American Drought Atlas (SADA), an annually-resolved hydroclimate atlas that spans the South American continent south of 12?S from 1400 to 2000 CE. The SADA was derived from 286 tree-ring chronologies, which were calibrated on records of soil-moisture balance based on observed climate data.  All of the SADA data have been made publicly available at the National Centers for Environmental Information: https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/paleo-search/study/30612  The SADA complements six drought atlases worldwide and filled a geographical gap in the Southern Hemisphere.  Once the SADA was derived, we were able to interpret joint hydroclimate extreme patterns in South America and in the Australia-New Zealand Drought Atlas to determine that large-scale variability in these two regions is strongly associated with two important climatic patterns: the El Ni?o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the Southern Annular Mode.  These findings have implications for modeling and prediction of hydroclimatic extremes in the Southern Hemisphere.  We also found that hydroclimate extremes have increased markedly across the SADA domain since the mid-20th century, thus providing an important historical baseline for future studies seeking to understand how climate change will impact hydroclimate in South America.   Our project also looked at connections between multidecadal droughts in central Chile and the American Southwest, and found that ENSO causes these droughts to often occur simultaneously in both locations.  These results indicate that damaging multi-decadal droughts may occur simultaneously in the future in two important agricultural regions.  Our findings also led us to investigate whether climate models can simulate simultaneous multi-decadal droughts in the American Southwest and central Chile.  We found that models do simulate such simultaneous multi-decadal droughts, but the simulated global and regional patterns of these droughts are different, relative to the proxy-derived estimates.  Moreover, the frequency of these simultaneously occurring droughts is different in the model simulations and the proxy-derived products.  Our findings suggest that the risk of co-occurring multi-decadal droughts in two important locations may be incorrectly quantified in climate model simulations.  What this means for projections of future climate change is a critical remaining question.  Our results also have implications for seasonal to decadal forecasting of hydroclimate on both continents.  Without tree-ring reconstructions of hydroclimate in South America, our understanding of the link between ENSO and hydroclimate on either continent would be based largely on the short observational interval of the past several decades and climate modeling.  Discovery of hemispheric synchrony in the tree-ring records of North and South America reveals that ENSO has been a dominant driver of hydroclimatic variability in specific regions of both continents for centuries, providing critical strength to the interpretation that ENSO will continue to be a dominant driver of hydroclimatic variability on both continents in the coming decades.  Finally, our project investigated more recent precipitation changes in Chile and Argentina, the ability of models to reproduce the observed trends, and the implications for precipitation projections into the 21st century.  Models and observations agree that all three southern hemisphere Mediterranean-type climate regions, including Chile, have dried due to human-driven climate change. These same climate models robustly project that these regions will continue to dry over coming decades due to Hadley Cell expansion.  In southeastern South America (SESA), a strong observed precipitation trend exists over the 20th to 21st century, but is not reproduced in climate model simulations.  Future projections of precipitation over the 21st century do indicate that greenhouse gases will force precipitation increases over SESA, but considerable variability in the sign and magnitude of projected trends make these projections subject to great uncertainty.  The work on this project partially complemented the research projects of one graduate student and one postdoctoral fellow.
