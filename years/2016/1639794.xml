<AbstractNarration>This award will support graduate student and/or postdoctoral participation in the 2016 Gordon Research Conference on the Molecular Basis of Microbial One-Carbon Metabolism (GRC-C1). The main goal of the conference is to present and discuss new, fundamental research findings related to the activities of microorganisms that grow on one-carbon compounds such as methane, carbon mono- and dioxide, and methanol. The GRC-C1 embraces the philosophy that early dissemination of pioneering basic research facilitates translation of fundamental knowledge into practical application.  Advances in understanding the metabolic and evolutionary diversity of microbial life and the complex roles that microorganisms play on Earth will lead to applications in biotechnology, the food industry, agriculture, and medicine by conference participants from industry, colleges and universities, research foundations, and government laboratories.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The GRC-C1 program will cover considerable scientific breadth. Overarching themes will include discovering new organisms and investigating microbiomes from a wide variety of environments, elucidating the connection between gut microbiota and human health, decoding genomes, unraveling metabolic pathways, and developing new bio-inspired networks for new research and application. It will cover all aspects of anaerobic and aerobic microbial C1 metabolism, from molecules to ecosystems, and aim to provide complementary cross-disciplinary perspectives from microbiology, biochemistry, structural biology, biogeochemistry, ecology, evolution, and synthetic biology. Topics will cover the wide-ranging metabolic diversity of autotrophic microbes, methanogens, acetogens, methylotrophs and methanotrophs. Innovative applications of C1 metabolism for production of biofuels and high added value chemicals, as well as for remediation of environmental contamination, will be presented. The GRC-C1 meeting will contribute to critical understanding of microbial metabolic processes crucial for key ecosystem services and the global functioning of our planet, thereby generating large and crucial societal impacts. The conference will attract a broad array of people including: biochemists, microbial and molecular geneticists, bioinformaticists, virologists, computational biologists, mathematical modelers, population biologists, evolutionists, and molecular, medical and environmental microbiologists. NSF support will enable this cadre of graduate students and postdoctoral researchers to meet and learn from early career and senior scientists who are the leaders in this field.</AbstractNarration>

The meeting covered a variety of scientific topics and the content presented was highly rated by participants.     Conference Participants                The Conference was well-attended with 156 participants. Scientists from academia represented 93% of the participants while attendees from government accounted for 4% and those from industry totaled 3%. The meeting also attracted a strong mix of young investigators and senior scientists. Students and post-docs accounted for 49% of all attendees. Approximately 35% of the participants at the 2016 meeting were women.       Seminar Participants    The Seminar was well-attended with 63 participants. Scientists from academia represented 97% of the participants while attendees from industry accounted for 3%. Students and post docs combined accounted for 89% of all attendees.   Approximately 37% of the participants at the 2016 seminar were women.     Conference Program   Metabolism of one-carbon (C1) compounds is shared by all living organisms today, yet microorganisms growing on one-carbon compounds established C1 metabolism as a major driver of global elemental cycles in the biosphere.  Microbial C1 metabolism involves transformations of key molecules such as methane, methanol, formic acid, and carbon dioxide; metabolic intermediates including formaldehyde and corrinoid and tetrahydrofolate derivatives; and organic compounds without carbon-carbon bonds, such as methylated amines and dimethyl sulfide. Several of these molecules (in particular methane) are important energy sources, some (e.g. carbon dioxide and methane) are potent greenhouse gases, and others (e.g. chlorinated methanes, carbon monoxide, and methanethiol) are toxic chemicals, produced and used naturally and industrially in large quantities.     The conference highlighted the most recent research on all aspects of microbial one-carbon metabolism, spanning natural and synthetic systems, under oxic and anoxic conditions, and at scales from molecules to ecosystems. It featured the wide-ranging metabolic diversity of autotrophic microbes, methanogens, acetogens, methylotrophs and methanotrophs. Complementary cross-disciplinary perspectives on C1 metabolism from microbiology, biochemistry, molecular biology, structural biology, microbial ecology, and systems and synthetic biology will be provided. Innovative applications of C1 metabolism for production of biofuels and high added value chemicals, as well as for remediation of environmental contamination, will be presented.     As in previous editions of this long-running meeting, the 2016 conference, with its associated GRS, brought together junior and senior investigators from the open and vibrant research C1 community. The time-proven GRC format, with extensive discussions, interactive poster sessions, and informal gatherings in the afternoons and evenings, provided an ideal setting for researchers from different fields and generations, to exchange ideas, brainstorm, and discuss opportunities for collaboration.     The Gordon Research Seminar on Molecular Basis of Microbial One-Carbon Metabolism was a unique forum for graduate students, post-docs, and other scientists with comparable levels of experience and education to present and exchange new data and cutting edge ideas.     Microbial metabolism of one-carbon compounds is pivotal to life: a key to its origins and a crucial player in the production and transformation of greenhouse gases. The focus of this meeting is on all microbially mediated processes that generate and consume carbon dioxide and methane as well as other ecologically relevant one-carbon compounds. Discussions of current challenges as well as emerging concepts and approaches in this interdisciplinary field included research areas ranging from biochemistry, genetics, ecology and evolution, to geochemistry and synthetic biology.     Conference Feedback  Participants had an opportunity to provide feedback at the end of the Conference. The feedback collected from the meeting was extremely positive. Evaluations included numerous positive remarks regarding networking, inventive and exciting talks, and multiple times for discussions. Evaluations from the GRS included positive comments regarding the mentorship component, discussions following talks, and the diversity of presentations.     GRC would like to thank the National Science Foundation for its continued support of the meetings. The contributions received from the National Science Foundation have been critical to the success of the conferences and are having a measurable impact in advancing the frontiers of science worldwide.
