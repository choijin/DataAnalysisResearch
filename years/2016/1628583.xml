<AbstractNarration>There are gender differences in both spatial cognition and experiences in navigating space, and these differences are found across a wide range of societies. Out of doors, males tend to range farther than females and are more confident in their navigational abilities, and males also outperform females on many spatial tasks. One explanation for these effects is that having the opportunity to navigate through larger areas may enhance both spatial skills and confidence. These behavioral differences appear in middle childhood, and have the potential to shape spatial learning throughout life. This study will investigate these relationships among children in three foraging societies, to explore how children's mobility affects spatial learning and confidence, and why these often differ between girls and boys.  Children in these societies have greater exposure to the natural environment than children in industrialized societies, and are given greater latitude for independent spatial exploration, which are likely to provide a learning environment conducive to good spatial and navigational ability.  As a result, studying this question cross-culturally provides an opportunity to more directly examine the impact of spatial exploration and navigation on the development of spatial cognition. The outcomes of the research will have important insights for optimizing spatial reasoning across cultures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The study will include children 7 to 12 years old, and will take place in three populations that depend in whole or part on foraging for sustenance and therefore permit significant opportunities for ranging across large natural spaces: the Hadza (Tanzania), the Twe (Namibia), and the Tsimane (Bolivia).  Data on natural mobility (from GPS tracking and interview), spatial performance (spatial visualization and navigation), and spatial risk-taking will be used to answer three questions: (1) Is greater mobility in childhood associated with enhanced spatial confidence and performance?  (2) Do gender differences in mobility stem from gender differences in risk preference?  (3) How are mobility and wayfinding shaped by environmental factors?  The three societies live in habitats that vary in both resource patchiness and in landmark visibility; based on their earlier work with adults, the investigators expect greater resource patchiness to increase male mobility, and greater landmark visibility to enhance reliance on male-typical wayfinding strategies. The project will provide valuable opportunities for training students in cross-cultural research approaches and in inter-disciplinary collaboration.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Gender differences in mobility and spatial ability, with males ranging farther and doing better on some spatial tasks, are widely reported in Western industrialized societies, beginning in middle childhood.  Little is known about whether these gender differences are also found among children in small-scale, mobile populations, where children are typically given far more autonomy than is typical in the U.S., and regularly travel along small footpaths outdoors in play and subsistence-related tasks.  If larger ranges provide navigational challenges that enhance spatial learning and confidence, individual differences in natural spatial exploration that begin in middle childhood may have the potential to shape spatial learning throughout life.  We addressed these questions using data from three small-scale societies:  the Hadza of Tanzania, who subsist primarily by hunting and gathering, the Tsimane of Bolivia, who practice subsistence horticulture with some supplementary foraging, and the Twe of Namibia, who practice a mixed subsistence that includes small-scale pastoralism and some supplementary foraging.  We measured natural mobility (by GPS tracking and interview), spatial ability (navigation and performance on small-scale spatial tasks), and parental attitudes, as well as variation in access to formal education.       Gender differences in childhood mobility and spatial ability were small in these societies, although we had previously found large gender differences in Hadza and Twe adults.  Although boys and girls did not differ significantly in average distance traveled or range size, the longest trips among both Hadza and Twe were consistently by older boys.  This was especially notable among the Hadza, where boys' hunting trips can take them far afield.  Hadza and Tsimane boys also spent more time than girls in the forest habitats,  while girls spent more time in cleared and developed zones.  These patterns can be seen in the figures associated with this report.  Hadza boys were significantly better than girls at mental rotation (a small-scale spatial task that shows a consistent gender difference in Western societies), but no gender differences were found among Twe and Tsimane children.  One reason for the absence of gender differences may be the considerable outdoor exposure and mobility of both girls and boys in these three societies. However, the children also performed better than adults in the same populations when tested on abstract small-scale spatial tasks (mental rotation and water-level). The enhanced performance on the abstract spatial tasks appears to be due to the recent introduction of formal schooling, which was unavailable or highly limited for most adults in all three groups.

As one Tsimane woman explained, "you don't have to know where your kids are, just know where they aren't."       Last Modified: 07/30/2020       Submitted by: Elizabeth A Cashdan]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
