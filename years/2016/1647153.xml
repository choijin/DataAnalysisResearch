<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will be better preservation of perishable food produce.  The proposed new functionalized packaging film for perishable foods, incorporates innovative technologies to eliminate harmful microbes, lock in just-harvested aroma and taste, extend shelf-life from field to the kitchen table, and reduce food waste. These benefits will accrue to farmers and field workers, to shippers and truckers, to retailers who realize less produce waste, and o consumers. The proposed technology incorporates a novel nano-adsorbent metal organic framework (MOF) a molecular 'sponge' into a multi-layer packaging film which can deliver microbial protection, slow down the ripening process during shipment and deliver just-harvested quality in our fruits and vegetables. MOFs are a novel material technology which potentially could transform packaging from ?just plastic bags? to true active packaging.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The technical objectives in this Phase I research project are to determine the technical feasibility to extrude a multi-layer film with the nano-adsorbent metal organic framework (MOF) material incorporated in a layer within linear low density polyethylene (LLDPE) film. This functionalized film structure will be selectively permeable via the embedded MOF structures to allow the exchange of gases, including ethylene, O2, CO2, other biologically active gases and certain antimicrobial compounds such as chlorine dioxide. Control of fruit and vegetable respiration (O2/CO2 balance), control endogenous and exogenous ethylene, and the delivery antimicrobial gases via MOFs could be the single most important recent technology breakthrough that allows producers in distant markets to delivery fresh produce. This research project will seek to identify MOFs with the appropriate gas exchange properties, heat stability in the blown film extrusion process and proper orientation within the film structure. Collaborative research is needed to select likely MOF candidates, to incorporate these MOFs in films extruded on pilot scale equipment, and to characterize effectiveness at a university-based postharvest laboratory to enable rapid technology development, impartial assessments, and effective reduction to practice.</AbstractNarration>

To mitigate this problem, MirTech Inc. collaborated with Rutgers University to develop a novel nano-adsorbent based technology to sequester ethylene to improve perishable food quality and storability management.

In Phase I of this NSF SBIR project, we successfully embedded the MOF nanoparticles into packaging films, coatings, and sachets; these different package forms are needed for different applications. Prototype packages were constructed using the nano-adsorbent materials, and their bio-efficacy for extending the shelf life of packaged perishable products was validated with the assistance of our industry partners. We believe that the encouraging results obtained from Phase I will generate further interest from our industry partners, as well as from the industry at large and the scientific community, to further develop the technology and apply it to fulfill the unmet needs of the perishable food industry. The commercialization of this technology will benefit the consumers with high quality packaged perishable foods for better health, as well as benefiting the food producers, the distributors, and the retailers with the ability to reduce packaged product loss, extend product shelf life, and increase profits.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 09/27/2018<br>      Modified by: Nazir&nbsp;Mir</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
