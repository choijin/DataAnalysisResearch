<AbstractNarration>Until recently, organic matter decomposition (respiration) was thought to occur primarily in oxygenated seawater; however, evidence has surfaced that respiration can occur under low oxygen conditions (anaerobic) similar to those found within microenvironments of suspended particles.  As such, the possibility exists that these anaerobic reactions are more widespread than previously thought and could play a significant role in the cycling of sulfur, nitrogen, and some trace metals.  Researchers from the University of California-Los Angeles and the University of Washington plan to study these reactions by developing a particle-redox model to simulate the biogeochemistry of anaerobic microenvironments and make predictions which can be tested against available ocean data (GEOTRACES program).  The study is intended to understand the conditions needed to cycle nitrogen and sulfur in these particle microenvironments, the scavenging of trace metals during sulfide precipitations, and develop a tracer for particle bound denitrification (removal of nitrogen by microbes).  This project will be the first funding support for two tenure-track faculty who are dedicated to education and public outreach to help broaden involvement in ocean sciences. One of the investigators will be involved as a youth educator in the "Students on Ice" program which conducts workshops that allows youth to gain experience at sea learning about oceanography, whereas the other would organize a series of workshops to engage students from the Rochester City School District in science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project seeks to investigate the evidence that has been coming out in recent years that anaerobic microenvironments within organic particles are widespread throughout the ocean and are a significant contributor to denitrification and sulfur reduction rates in otherwise oxygenated waters. To do so, the researchers plan to develop a new modeling framework to simulate the biogeochemistry of anaerobic microenvironments and make predictions which can be tested against available observations such as those from the GEOTRACES program.  Overall the objectives of this research are to (1) understand the water column conditions and particle properties that lead to these anaerobic microenvironments, (2) test whether sulfate reduction rates are consistent with the metal precipitation signatures known for low oxygen water, and (3) predict the geochemical signature of particle bound denitrification and determine its rate from the large-scale distribution of nitrogen tracers.  Understanding the anaerobic processes taking place within anaerobic microenvironments of organic particles in the water column is likely to update the biogeochemical cycles of nitrogen, sulfur, and trace metals.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p class="Body">Sinking organic particles transport organic matter to the deep ocean, where aerobic (i.e., based on oxygen) microbial respiration returns carbon and nutrients to the dissolved components. When oxygen is absent, microbial respiration proceeds anaerobically, i.e., in using chemicals such as nitrate (denitrification) or sulfate (sulfate reduction). In the ocean, anaerobic respiration should be rare, and confined to low oxygen waters found in OMZ. However, observations have pointed to a much broader distribution. In this project, we tested multiple hypotheses related to the distribution and consequences of anaerobic respiration in the ocean.&nbsp;</p> <p class="Body">In a first line of investigation (Bianchi, Weber et al., 2018,&nbsp;<em>Nature Geosciences</em>), we tested the hypothesis that anaerobic respiration occurs in oxygen-deprived microenvironments that develop inside sinking organic particles. We developed a new size-resolved model of sinking particles to predict the occurrence of anaerobic respiration from particle size and seawater chemistry (<strong><span>Figure 1</span></strong>). We combined this model with observations of particle size distribution from Underwater Vision Profilers (UVP), to show that denitrification and sulfate reduction can be sustained throughout vast, low-oxygen expanses of the ocean (<strong><span>Figure 2</span></strong>), changing our understanding of the marine nitrogen cycle in a changing climate.</p> <p class="Body">In a second line of investigation, we explored the effect of microenvironment formation on the depth at which sinking particles are decomposed, which in turn controls how efficiently carbon is sequestered in the deep ocean (Weber and Bianchi, 2020,&nbsp;<em>Frontiers in Earth Science</em>). We showed that, compared to the surrounding tropical waters, OMZ consistently exhibit higher particle fluxes where low-oxygen waters reside, sequestering carbon more than twice as efficiently. Using our particle model, we showed that three different mechanisms might explain the shape of particle fluxes in OMZ (<strong><span>Figure 3</span></strong>), each leaving a unique signature in the size distribution of particles, and that UVP observations hold great promise for understanding the drivers of efficient carbon sequestration in OMZs, allowing more accurate prediction of future changes in carbon sequestration as the ocean loses oxygen in a warming climate.</p> <p class="Body">We further continued analysis of UVP observations (Clements et al.,&nbsp;<em>in preparation</em>), with the goal of understanding what controls the abundance, size, and downward flux of organic particles in the ocean. To this end, we used machine learning techniques to reconstruct global particle size distributions from sparse UVP observations. We combined these reconstructions to in-situ observations to extrapolate carbon fluxes globally, providing a novel estimate of carbon sequestration by sinking particles (<strong><span>Figure 4</span></strong>), and demonstrating the utility of UVP observations for three-dimensional reconstructions of the oceanic biological "carbon pump".</p> <p class="Body">In a last line of research, we investigated the role of physical circulation in sustaining "pockets" of low-oxygen that could support anaerobic respiration in otherwise well-oxygenated waters. We focused on "subsurface eddies", i.e. swirl-like currents, usually smaller than 100km in diameter, that trap oceanic water for months to years, transporting it from coastal OMZ into the open ocean (<strong><span>Figure 5</span></strong>). In a first paper (Frenger, Bianchi et al., 2018,&nbsp;<em>Global Biogeochemical Cycles</em>), we analyzed a high-resolution global ocean model to show that low-oxygen subsurface eddies occur broadly, for example offshore California, Peru, and West Africa, expanding the regions where anaerobic respiration can be found. In a second paper (McCoy et al., 2020,&nbsp;<em>Progress in Oceanography</em>) we analyzed the global array of observations with Argo floats, which measure temperature and salinity in the upper 2,000 m of the ocean, to provide the first global detection and characterization of these subsurface eddies (<strong><span>Figure 6</span></strong>), revealing many previously unknown eddy populations, and laying the basis to estimate their importance for ocean biogeochemistry.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 12/28/2020<br>      Modified by: Daniele&nbsp;Bianchi</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1635632/1635632_10444204_1609210549859_Slide1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1635632/1635632_10444204_1609210549859_Slide1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 1"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1635632/1635632_10444204_1609210549859_Slide1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 1"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">(a) Schematic of the particle microenvironment model, simulating a size spectrum of sinking particles evolving over depth due to size-dependent sinking, decomposition and fragmentation.
