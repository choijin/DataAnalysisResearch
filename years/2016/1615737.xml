<AbstractNarration>To navigate in a constantly changing world, humans and other animals continually make decisions and store memories. Since the world is noisy and brain activity is highly variable, it is remarkable that organisms can perform cognitive tasks as accurately as they do. One feature of the human brain that may account for its exceptional computational ability is its modular structure. The entire network of the brain is organized into a collection of densely connected subnetworks, helping to localize certain neural computations. Studying the effects of this underlying structure could ultimately help in the analysis of increasingly large data sets collected by experimental neuroscientists. This project will consider the impact of modular structures in the brain, focusing on networks known to perform specific cognitive tasks like categorization, short-term memory, and spatial navigation. These computations are performed by networks that can represent spatial position, and the associated mathematical models often describe variables that change in space and time. This project will facilitate the development of new methods for studying how noise impacts the dynamics of neuronal networks with multiple temporal and spatial scales, specifically in networks with a multi-layered structure. This project will contribute to the national BRAIN initiative by identifying new computational tools for understanding the role of the brain's network architecture in cognition. Furthermore, trainees supported by this award will learn cutting-edge methods in statistics, nonlinear dynamics, and stochastic processes. These methods are broadly applicable to many fields in science that utilize large-scale data such as genetics, social science, and climatology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research project addresses the problem of understanding how the multi-layered structure of many areas of the brain shape neural computation. This problem will be addressed in three main ways: (i) building multi-layer network models of observed brain circuits that process spatial information; (ii) developing mathematical tools for studying these equations to extract information about their dynamics; and (iii) corroborating this work with experimental collaborators that record and image propagating activity in brain tissue. The cognitive tasks of spatial navigation, spatial working memory, and visual input categorization will be studied. Spatial navigation requires the integration of both angular and linear self-motion cues, and models developed in the project will explore different ways multi-layered network architecture can dampen variability in position codes. The investigation of how multi-layered architectures with different scales of spatial heterogeneity can robustly represent spatial position will improve our insights into the function of spatial working memory. Experimental recordings from visual brain areas have found that interfaces between network layers modify the propagation of stimulus-related activity. The impact of this phenomenon on stimulus processing will be explored in detail using mathematical models of sensory brain activity. All these projects require the development of new tools for determining how noise influences multi-scale systems, metastability, and spatiotemporal patterns, of broad applicability to other scientific fields including epidemiology, systems biology, and ecology.</AbstractNarration>

We focused specifically on the neural dynamics responsible for working memory and decision making. Working memory is the process by which pieces of information are stored for a short period of time and used to perform some calculation or computation. Decision making requires the accumulation of evidence to determine the best choice between multiple alternatives. We studied these phenomena by building neuronal network models which generated spatiotemporal activity to encode these cognitive processes.</span></p> <p class="p1"><span class="s1">Intellectual Merit: First, we showed how the multilayered structure of cortex is important for making these computations robust. One common working memory task developed for test animals is that of a spatial navigation task in which the subject must remember their location along a linear track. We showed that encoding position with a neural activity bump that spans multiple layers of a network can reduce encoding error that might arise due to internal noise or network variability. Moreover, we showed that such position encoding networks can be utilized to store information about previously visited locations, not just an animal's current location, when neural activity propagates as a moving front. This work also prompted further study for conditions of wave propagation in neural activity models, providing a fundamental mathematical framework for understanding propagation thresholds in nonlocal models. The idea of modeling memory for previously visited locations also springboarded additional work studying optimal strategies for animals foraging in an environment that they slowly deplete. This study pushed forward new theory on the statistics of first passage times in discrete models.</span></p> <p class="p1"><span class="s1">A second aim of the project was to understand how the dynamics of the synaptic connections of neural networks may shapes information storage. A key study focusing on this aim explored how short term facilitation, the process by which synapses of frequently active neurons are strengthened on the timescale of seconds, may contribute to the interaction of multiple items stored in memory over time. Interference is a commonly observed phenomenon in working memory experiments whereby previously remembered items can bias one's memory for currently stored items. We found that short term facilitation can account for this in a neuronal network model, as the facilitated synapses from previously remembered items can attract the neural activity representing the currently remembered item. Our model made a number of experimentally testable predictions concerning the behavioral responses of subjects performing back-to-back working memory trials, and potentially the neural activity recordings to be expected in non-human primates. We are currently in the process of working with experimental collaborators to test these predictions in collected behavioral data and neural recordings.</span></p> <p class="p1"><span class="s1">In related work, we have explored how neural activity interactions within a single trial might account for working memory item interference of simultaneously stored items. Indeed, we found that the distance between items in feature space can strongly shape the nature of item interference, in the context of a neural network model. These predictions are also being validated currently with collected behavioral data from collaborators.</span></p> <p class="p1"><span class="s1">We also studied how multiple layers of a network could implement adaptive decision making. A key finding was that the rate of environmental changes can be encoded by the strength of synapses between the layers which is tuned by long term plasticity. This suggests a fundamental neural mechanism for adaptive evidence integration in networks, which we are exploring currently in a subsequent funded project.</span></p> <p class="p1"><span class="s1">Broader impacts: These results were disseminated broadly through papers (9) in refereed applied math and neuroscience journals; conference talks and seminars; and tutorials. One tutorial was given at the International Conference on Mathematical Neuroscience in June 2019 to 60 students from all over the world, about half of whom were women. One PhD student, Daniel Poll, graduate in May 2017, and is currently a postdoc at Northwestern. Another PhD student, Kate Nguyen, will likely graduate in August 2020. Three undergraduates were funded, leading to two publications. At present, the PI is training two female students from countries underrepresented in science, a female undergraduate, and a female postdoc, so more than half of the trainees in the group are from underrepresented groups in STEM.</span></p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 11/12/2019<br>      Modified by: Zachary&nbsp;P&nbsp;Kilpatrick</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1615737/1615737_10452635_1573603794169_particle--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1615737/1615737_10452635_1573603794169_particle--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Low-dimensional projection of plastic neural network accounting for intertrial interference."><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1615737/1615737_10452635_1573603794169_particle--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Low-dimensional projection of plastic neural network accounting for intertrial interference."></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Low-dimensional system captures the motion of the bump and the evolving potential shaped by short term facilitation.
