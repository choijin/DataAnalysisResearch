<AbstractNarration>This award funds the research activities of Professors Jacques Distler, Willy Fischler, Can Kilic, Sonia Paban and Steven Weinberg of the Theory Group at the University of Texas at Austin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since its foundation, the Theory Group has had a strong track record of conducting research on a broad range of topics with the goal of exploring the fundamental laws of nature.  These topics include the dynamics of the very early universe, the relationship between information and black holes (which may lead to crucial insights into the fundamental theory of gravity), the possible extensions of the Standard Model of particle physics (which describes all known particles and their interactions) and the experimental signatures of such extensions, and the exploration of string theory and formal aspects of quantum field theory.  This diversified effort to improve our understanding of nature at the deepest levels is well aligned with the goal of advancing the national interest by maintaining and further boosting the role of the United States as the global leader in theoretical high-energy physics.  The Theory Group is also actively committed to making physics accessible to a wider audience and achieving a substantial impact outside of academia.  This is achieved through popular lectures given to live audiences as well as over other media, through the publication of books at both the public and technical levels, and through the development of web technologies.  In addition, the Theory Group takes pride in the training of graduate students and postdocs who continue on to successful careers in this field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specifically, the avenues of research to be conducted during the term of this project include, but are not limited to, the following:   Distler will extend the classification of N=2 four-dimensional superconformal field theories and explore a generalization of important results in topological string theory. Fischler will continue his exploration of the physical effects of theta angles on black hole horizons and their experimental signatures as seen by observers hovering at a fixed distance from black holes. He will complete his research on the effects of shockwaves in de Sitter space and the implications for holographic information. He will study the description of mixmaster universes in the context of AdS/CFT. Fischler will also continue his longstanding work on holographic space-time and revisit the initial conditions for inflation.  Kilic will explore aspects of collider physics as well as models of dark matter and their experimental signatures.  Paban will study theories of inflation with many fields and the conditions under which they reach the adiabatic limit at the end of inflation.  Weinberg will continue the search for a modified version of quantum mechanics that will avoid the usual unsatisfactory aspects while retaining the successes of the existing theory.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[      One of the great intellectual challenges of our time is to better understand quantum field theory, beyond the regime of weakly-coupled Lagrangian field theory. The generic quantum field theory is controlled by an interacting UV fixed point with no Lagrangian formulation. During the period of this grant, Distler applied insights from string theory to study the properties of a large class of such non-Lagrangian (super)conformal field theories with N=2 supersymmetry.         A fundamental challenge in theoretical physics is the connection between quantum mechanics and gravitational physics. In the past decade one of the most fundamental properties of gravity, which points to a vast reduction of degrees of freedom, which is known by the name of holography, has become a central point in attempts to overcome the aforementioned challenge. It is fascinating that a theory in three space dimensions and one time could be described by a theory in a lesser number of dimensions somewhat like a hologram, thereby the name of holography.        During the period covered by this grant, Fischler and his students focused on various topics at the interface between the physics of gravity and its connection to quantum computing where holography is a central theme. With his longtime collaborator Tom Banks, Fischler continued their attempt to construct a theory of quantum gravity where holography plays a central role.  Several papers were written and talks given about the work of Fischler and students as well as the work with Banks.       During the lifetime of this NSF grant, Kilic has worked on a number of models of physics beyond the Standard Model, as well as methods for discovering such models in an experimental setting. Kilic, students and collaborators published five papers that explored the use of kinematic observables to enhance prospects for discovery and mass measurement in particle colliders. Kilic was also a co-author on two conceptual design reports for future colliders. Kilic and collaborators published three papers where they studied prospects for not only discovering new physics, but experimentally testing its connection to the naturalness problem of the Higgs sector. In three papers, Kilic, students and collaborators studied theoretical implications and experimental signatures of the related scenarios of Flavored Dark Matter and Secretly Asymmetric Dark Matter, where dark matter particles exist in multiple generations, similar to the matter particles in the Standard Model. The Secretly Asymmetric Dark Matter was shown to have intriguing cosmological and astrophysical implications which may help address open observational questions.       Kilic makes public science engagement a priority. He supervises the physics circus at UT Austin which conducts demonstrations to audiences of elementary school students (roughly 10000 students served each year). Kilic also organizes other major public science engagement activities: The physics department annual open house event, where UT freshmen attend presentations by faculty and tour labs; the annual physics undergraduate poster competition; and the annual Saturday Physics Workshop serving students from local middle and high schools. Outside campus, Kilic regularly participates in public science engagement events.       Paban and collaborators have constructed two families of multi-field models of cosmic inflation that predict the measured values for the cosmic microwave background (CMB) observables while satisfying a new set of theoretical constraints that go under the name of Refined Swampland Conjectures (RSC). This result is relevant because it disproves claims of the incompatibility of cosmic inflation and the RSC. Satisfying these conjectures narrows the possible values of observables, for which we presently only have upper bounds, such as the amplitude of the tensor perturbations and the bispectrum.       During the life of this award, Steven Weinberg's work spanned three quite different areas.  First, in astrophysics, he with a former student studied the effect of intervening matter on the gravitational waves from distant sources discovered in 2015, and concluded that no such effect was likely to be observable.  A by-product of this work was a new analysis of the emission of radio waves from hot gases. Weinberg's book Lectures on Astrophysics was published by Cambridge Press.  Second, Weinberg continued his examination of the foundations of quantum mechanics, searching for a formulation that did not assume the existence of human observers in its postulates.   Anticipating that in the absence of any such formulation we may be led to modifications of quantum mechanics, he showed how the great precision of atomic clocks could be used to set stringent limits on departures from quantum mechanics in any new theory.  Third, Weinberg returned to an old problem in elementary particle physics, trying to understand the peculiar pattern observed in elementary particle masses.
