<AbstractNarration>The brain research community needs to increase the practice of sharing and combining data sets to increase the power of statistical analyses and to gain the most knowledge from collected data. This project aims to build a prototype system called BrainLab CI that will facilitate meaningful integration of thousands of publicly available Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and neurophysiology data sets, and allow researchers to define and conduct new large-scale community-level experiments on these data. BrainLab CI has the potential to transform research practice in neuroscience by overcoming major obstacles to data sharing: Scientists will be able to share data without losing control over data quality, and will maintain full visibility into how all subsequent experiments use their data and algorithms. This project may consequently drive a change in scientific culture by encouraging data sharing and the development of common analysis tools, and resulting accelerated discovery from connecting ideas, tools, data, and people. This project therefore aligns with the NSF mission to promote the progress of science and to advance the national health, prosperity and welfare. &lt;br/&gt;The BrainLab CI prototype system will provide new paradigms for combining different analytic methods, meta-analysis with raw data, comparing the results of different laboratories and even synthesizing new experiments by combining different studies. An experimental-management software system will be deployed that allows users to construct community-wide experiments that implement data and metadata controls on the inclusion and exclusion of data. Example of controls include: requiring specific metadata, that data are registered to a given atlas, or that data are collected using specific experimentation protocols.  BrainLab CI will initially focus on two different experimental patterns: (1) An incremental experiment defines an experiment against an existing data set which then opens to additional community contributions of data; and (2) a derived experiment forks/branches an existing experiment, allowing a researcher to change properties, such as an acceptance criteria or analysis algorithm, but otherwise run the same pipeline against the same inputs. The system will allow each experiment to maintain online dashboards showing how additional data changes results with complete provenance. To develop and validate the BrainLab CI prototype, several community experiments will be developed for MRI and for neurophysiology (including both optical and electrical physiology) data. These research domains were chosen because of the great potential gains for increased sharing of laboratory data in these domains. &lt;br/&gt;This Early-concept Grants for Exploratory Research (EAGER) award by the CISE Division of Advanced Cyberinfrastructure is jointly supported by the SBE Division of Behavioral and Cognitive Sciences, with funds associated with the NSF Understanding the Brain activity including for developing national research infrastructure for neuroscience, and alignment with NSF objectives under the National Strategic Computing Initiative.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goal of the BrainLabCI project was to advance the state of the art of for reproducible data science and analytics in the field of neuroscience. Software reproducibility methods were inspired by and derived from best-practices in software development, including versions, data provenance, and containerized runtimes. In addition, the project explored the use event-based triggers to implement data-quality and data-verification checks.   One phase of the project built an open-source software prototype of BrainLabCI that implemented data checks in a continuous integration system that launches computation when data are created or changed.  Another aspect of the project hardened existing pipelines for the generation of human connectomes from diffusions and functional MRI data.  Scaling MRI We employed a suite of community resources and open-source tools to help scale MRI pipilnes on the cloud.  A first step was to unify connectome processing pipelines. We integrated the Neurodata MRI Graphs (NDMG) pipeline into the leading analysis tool, the Configurable Pipeline for the Analysis of Connectomes (C-PAC). NDMG runs as a configurable option that is 10 times as fast as standard pipelines.  Through integration, we can cross verify the faster runtime with standard results.  This pipeline was then implemented in reproducible environments so that it is available without installation or configuration and runs repeatedly.  It has been released as a BIDS app: BIDS is a community standard for neuroimaging pipelines and leading clearinghouse for sharing and disseminating tools.  It was also released in reproducible software environments for interactive analysis, including GIgantum and Binder.  The project also supports the development of machine learning tools that support connectome analysis and contributed to open-source projects for graph analysis and clustering.  This includes graphyti, which is a parallel, NUMA-optimized library of graph algorithms in the semi-external memory model. Algorithms include: coreness decomposition, betweenness centrality, pagerank, Louvain modularity, triangle counting, and diameter.  It also includes clusterNOR, a library for iterative clustering algorithms that follow the Majorize-Minimization pattern using a a fast, scalable k-means implementation in C++ as a building block. Algorithms include fuzzy c-means, k-mediods, spherical k-means, hierarchical X-means, and Gaussian means in addition to more standard clustering variants.  Both systems include R and Python bindings so that algorithms can be called as functions in high-level languages.       Last Modified: 06/09/2019       Submitted by: Randal Burns]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
