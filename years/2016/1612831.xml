<AbstractNarration>The project will research and further develop an interactive platform, Visitor Interactions in Microbiology (VIM), that enables museum visitors to influence and learn about the behavior of live microorganisms.  Hands-on museum exhibits encourage visitors to engage with, and manipulate, scientific content. Currently, museum visitors experience microbiology by observing microorganisms through a microscope, through models, or through simulations, all of which limit interactivity. With the VIM platform, visitors draw on a screen or use a Kinect motion sensor to generate microscopic light images.  The single celled organisms respond to these images in real-time.  Preliminary testing shows that the platform has significant potential to promote prolonged engagement and science inquiry by visitors.  The project will develop and research additional technological and design considerations to understand how VIM can be translated into effective museum exhibits.  This project is supported by the Advancing Informal STEM Learning (AISL) program which funds research and innovative resources for use in a variety of settings as a part of its overall strategy to enhance learning in informal environments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Project researchers will first compare VIM to existing microscopic exhibits to investigate both advantages as well as limitations with the platform.  Based on that research, three iterations of prototypes of VIM and user testing will explore possible extensions of VIM with respect to modes of visitor interactions, types of organisms and types of stimuli.  In addition to improving the VIM platform, the knowledge gained from this study will inform a new approach to informal science learning  -- an approach that supports self-directed inquiry, interest in microbiology, and interest in underlying technology.  The project will produce: (1) research results concerning the potential of VIM and the variety of interaction modes that are effective using the system and (2) an open-source catalogue of hardware, software and protocol instructions that will enable other institutions to take advantage of the research on VIM.  Project research findings and resources will be widely disseminated to practitioners via conferences and professional journals.  The research will provide the foundation for future work that will include the design of a permanent exhibition.</AbstractNarration>
