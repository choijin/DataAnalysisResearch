<AbstractNarration>This STTR Phase I project will study the storage of hydrogen on a novel material produced from silicon - the same substance used to make solar panels and computer chips. This unique and patented approach has the potential to eclipse all prior methods of hydrogen storage in terms of pressure, temperature, safety, cost, and convenience. Silicon is earth-abundant and benign to humans - it is even promotes healthy skin, hair, and fingernails. The implication of hydrogen-in-silicon is that fuel cell-powered vehicles, homes, and electronics can be far more efficient and clean than any other source of energy. Of great significance is that this technology will allow homeowners and businesses to generate their own hydrogen by splitting water using rooftop solar panels. By storing this as hydrogen-in-silicon a home can be run overnight or for many days during a cloudy spell. Hydrogen can replace the batteries in portable electronics so they can last up to 20 days without a recharge - far longer than with batteries. And if the rooftop system is of sufficient size, one can produce the hydrogen needed for a fuel cell vehicle, such as those already on the market. The implications of this are far-reaching, allowing complete energy independence for all, for all time to come, with minimal environmental impact and using almost completely renewable and low-cost resources which are easy to recycle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Porous silicon is easy to synthesize but requires a catalyst to recharge from a gaseous source. The introduction of the catalyst is critical as it must be controlled spatially and positioned to effect spillover onto and off of silicon. Density Functional Theory studies show this is energetically favorable and first-order macroscopic calculations indicate that recharge can be effected in 3.5 minutes at 8 bar and 250 C. The overall energy difference between fully-charged and fully-discharged silicon-hydrogen is an amazingly low 1 kcal/mol. The energy barrier is the strong H-H bond which dominates the kinetics. The course of this project is to strategically place palladium atoms at specific sites on the matrix of porous silicon so that it can mediate the H-H bond energy and allow spillover onto the 800 m^2/gm surface area of microporous silicon. This has been patented but never demonstrated in the laboratory, which is why this funding from NSF is needed. A further goal of this work is to demonstrate the viability of low-cost silicon using metallurgical grade material instead of the single-crystal silicon which has been used to date.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Green Fortress Engineering, Inc.,  Greensburg, Indiana  NSF Phase I STTR 1648748  The objectives for "Hydrogen Storage in Catalytically-Modified Porous Silicon" are to demonstrate technical performance and economically viability for what amounts to a fuel tank for fuel cells &ndash; a simple, safe, and effective means for storing pure hydrogen.  The key finding discovered during Phase I research work is the favorability for hydrogen to transport onto and off of the surface of a porous silicon matrix, mediated by strategic placement of gate-keeper atoms such as palladium or platinum.  Using quantum chemistry mathematical techniques this theory was verified by simulations run on one of the most power supercomputers in America.  Laboratory work supported these predictions and the results will be the subject of a Masters thesis, and submitted to a technical journal for publication.  These promising outcomes align with already-issued US patents in which this technology was conceived and disclosed to the public.  The state of progress requires optimization of experimental variables so that prototype storage vessels can be fabricated and provided to interested customers.  Glowing support letters have been received from financiers, systems integrators, and hydrogen equipment firms, identifying markets such as long-duration aerial drones running on hydrogen-powered fuel cells, fork-lift trucks for clean indoor warehouse use, personal vehicles with a 500 mile driving range, and even large scale grid-level energy storage for utility companies.  At the small scale, technology from Green Fortress Engineering can enable applications such as ?smart dust?, or self-refueling insectoid robots which draw upon sunlight and water to keep themselves active indefinitely.  Porous silicon is an amazing material whose intellectual merits are only just now emerging.  Silicon is one of the most well-characterized elements known to man because of the huge integrated circuits industry and the burgeoning solar power market.  Making this material porous at the nanometer scale introduces entirely new modes of behavior which are impossible to predict from macroscopic crystals.  New contributions to the dynamics and chemical pathways of hydrogen dissociation, spillover, and bond-hopping on the patented Green Fortress Engineering technology open up further possibilities for quantum computing, three-dimensional structural control at the atomic layer without the need to manipulate individual atoms, and for lowering the barriers between gaseous and solid states of matter.  Hydrogen storage is a vast field yet the idea of using porous silicon has, until now, been entirely overlooked.  It is only through visionary funding by the National Science Foundation that this exciting new technology is getting serious attention, and will soon be published to the benefit of multi-disciplinary researchers everywhere.  Hydrogen is made of one proton and one electron.  Energy storage using hydrogen has tremendous weight advantage over battery storage using lithium ions which weigh 6.9 times as much per electron stored!  With breakthrough technology from Green Fortress Engineering, energy storage can be made smaller, lighter, cheaper, and more green than battery technology.  The silicon used for this solid-state (not gaseous) hydrogen storage material can be harvested from waste biomass using silicate nanoparticles drawn up gently out of the soil by green plants as they grow.  That same biomass can be gasified using additional Green Fortress technology to make pure hydrogen.  Taken together, the cost of producing and storing hydrogen from low-value materials available everywhere on earth could fundamentally transform how humans gather, store, and utilize energy.  Silicon is benign in humans, being already part of hair, skin, and fingernails; and the catalyst metals are already used in jewelry and medical implants.  These environmentally-friendly materials hold gently onto the most abundant element in the universe:  Hydrogen.  This makes the Green Fortress technology the ultimate in clean, sustainable, renewable energy, and available to every human on the planet.
