<AbstractNarration>The efficiency of patent systems has direct effects on the transformation of innovation from licensing, investment and industrial collaboration. This project conducts a longitudinal comparison of patent uncertainties (i.e. patenting delays and granting) and the role that foreign applicants play between the US and China, the top two patent filing nations in the world. The project compares and contrasts the treatment toward different types of patent applicants, and recognizes the relative strengths and weaknesses of patent practices between the two nations. The findings fill an intellectual void on the theoretical and empirical understanding of patent internationalization and are relevant for innovation policy makers and industrial practitioners.  Policy recommendations are provided for resolving international tension and enhancing bilateral collaboration.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Multiple patent data sources are consulted for data triangulation and to avoid mono-method bias. The research conducts lagged regression modeling, and multiple equality test comparisons using invention patent data. The longitudinal investigation of patents, patent offices, and technologies between the U.S. and China also reveals the changing nature of patent internationalization over the past 20 years. The new datasets generated from the statistical modeling are to be made available to relevant stakeholders to enhance future research.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The efficiency of IP systems has direct effects on the transformation of innovation from licensing, investment to industrial collaboration. This project conducts a longitudinal comparison of IP uncertainties (i.e. patenting and trademark delays and granting) and the role that foreign applicants play between the US and China, the top two IP filing countries in the world.

(2) NTPU is comparatively divergent between the countries in pendency and granting due to national variations. (3) Regressive and progressive changes in NTPU are evidenced since both countries provide equal or higher granting, but longer pendency than before.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We have also compared and contrasted patents and trademarks and concluded that national treatment for trademarks is upheld in the past 12 years due to equal or favorable treatment for foreigners in granting for both countries, and in pendency for China, but not upheld against pendency due to shorter duration for US locals.
