<AbstractNarration>1603316 - Fletcher&lt;br/&gt;1603947 - Mahalingam&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will study how two or more flames in close proximity merge into a single flame. The immediate application for this information is wildland fires in live shrubs, like in the California chaparral. Living vegetation is characterized by its ability to hold large quantity of moisture, unlike dead vegetation. A few leaves are initially ignited, and the flames from the separate leaves merge into one large flame. In a similar manner, flames from individual shrubs merge to often form a more intense fire, capable of spreading faster. For example, flame heights from individual leaves are only 2 to 5 cm, but flames from shrubs may reach heights of 10 to 12 m due to flame merging. Small-scale experiments will be performed on leaves, wood dowels, or popsicle sticks in 3-D geometries to examine how spacing affects flames-merging behavior. Correlations that describe flame-merging will be based on spacing, heat release, and other variables, and then compared with physics-based fluid dynamics simulations. The simulations will further enable direct investigation of merged flame behavior in shrubs and between adjacent shrubs. Generalized correlations of flame-merging behavior derived from the combined experimental and modeling activities can possibly be applied to fires in buildings, factories, fuel piles, and other combustible materials. Findings from this research will be used to develop educational materials for STEM educators and students. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Flame merging has been studied for jets or pool fires spaced in a horizontal plane, and correlations for flame merging behavior have been developed. However, three-dimensional flame-merging is important for ignition of live shrubs, as well as building fires. Small-scale experiments will be performed on solid fuel elements such as leaves, wood dowels, or popsicle sticks as a function of vertical and horizontal separation distance. Experiments will be performed with and without wind. Flame behavior will be monitored with video and IR cameras, and correlations of flame behavior will be developed. Physics-based modeling of the small-scale experiments will be performed to help identify the most important mechanisms for flame merging. The simulations will then be extended to describe flame merging of adjacent shrubs, with and without wind. The scalability of the empirical correlations will be determined by comparison with the multiple shrub simulations. It is expected that such correlations of flame merging behavior will provide a reasonable alternative to time-consuming computational fluid dynamics simulation of large landscape fires.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Accurate predictions of the path and rate of spread of wildland fires are critical to alleviate the damage to property and loss of lives. Fire managers utilize operational wildland fire spread models to predict fire spread in the field and to make decisions about where to place firefighters, retardant drops, and backfires. The operational models are based primarily on empirical correlations developed from beds of ?dead? fuels such as cast pine needles or milled woody fuels. These operational models predict fire spread rate well for the conditions for which the model was correlated (e.g. dry grass or dead, single layer fuel beds), but they do not perform as well for live fuels that are typically shrubs or trees.</p> <p>One of the main needs for accurate shrub combustion modeling is the complicated flame growth pattern due to merging of flames from multiple leaves and small branches. The interactions of neighboring flames have only been studied using regularly spaced fuel sources, such as pool fires, located on a horizontal plane. Flames in a burning shrub or tree merge or coalesce to form large flames from fuel arrangements which are not described by horizontal plane geometries. A careful study of flame interactions from fuels in three-dimensional arrangements is a necessary step in strengthening operational field models in complex fuel structures.</p> <p>The overarching objective of this research is to gain a fundamental understanding of conditions that could lead to enhanced dynamic behavior when flames from two or multiple independently burning fuel elements merge. Experiments were carried out using thin ceramic felt pads (1.5 inch x 1.5 inch) soaked in n-heptane, designed to reproduce the behavior of solid fuel sources such as leaves in a bush. The structure of ceramic felt did not change during combustion, and therefore did not affect the flame. This experimental setup provided buoyant flames for about 60 s.</p> <p>An extensive set of 2-pad experiments was performed, varying both the horizontal and vertical spacing. Videos of the flames were analyzed frame-by-frame using image recognition software in Matlab. Data were obtained on the heights, areas, and widths of the flames and compared with flames from single pads. A separate image analysis provided the percentage of time that the flames touched (termed the merging probability). The duration of the flame from each pad was also recorded, and the data showed that at low horizontal separation distances the upper pad burned faster due to heating from the lower pad.</p> <p>The 2-pad merged flame heights did not increase significantly when corrected for the vertical separation distance of the pads. The maximum corrected merged flame height was only 20% higher than the single flame height. Corrected flame widths from the 2-pad data generally increased by as&nbsp; much as 50%, although a few cases increased by as much as 200%. Flame areas increased by a maximum of 40% for merged flames.</p> <p>A method was developed to use machine learning to determine flame merging in images processed in the Google Colab environment, using Google?s GPU computing resources. 89 images from the two-pad data were were used to train the neural network, and 19 images were used to test the network while training. Each of these 89+19 images were classified as either a merged or unmerged flame based on visual criteria. Figure 2 illustrates the labeling for two merged and two unmerged images. A movie showing the application of the classification to a given experiment is at <a href="https://youtu.be/BGPtdRVsvg8">https://youtu.be/BGPtdRVsvg8</a>.</p> <p>The 3-pad flame images were analyzed in a manner similar to the 2-pad experiments, resulting in data on combined flame heights, areas, and widths, as well as merging probability. The 3-pad data were more complex than the 2-pad data, as expected. However, some trends in the 3-pad data were similar to the 2-pad data. The total flame area did not increase more than 40% for the merged 3-pad flames. The corrected flame heights did not increase by more than 40%. The merging probability for most configurations followed a similar correlation to the correlation developed from the 2-pad data. Merged flame areas from the 3-pad data were relatively constant, increasing by a maximum of 30%&nbsp; more than the three single flames in a few cases. Most increases in flame area and height occurred when separation distances were smaller than about 4 times the pad width.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 08/31/2020<br>      Modified by: Thomas&nbsp;Fletcher</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1603316/1603316_10424874_1598636060637_2-padflame--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1603316/1603316_10424874_1598636060637_2-padflame--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 1."><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1603316/1603316_10424874_1598636060637_2-padflame--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 1."></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Figure 1.
