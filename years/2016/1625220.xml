<AbstractNarration>Title: Student Travel Support for 43rd ACM SIGPLAN-SIGACT Symposium on Principles of Programming Languages (POPL) 2016&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports student travel to the 2016 ACM SIGPLAN-SIGACT Symposium on Principles of Programming Languages (POPL). The conference takes place in St. Petersburg, Florida, USA, in January 2016. POPL is a forum for the discussion of leading work on all aspects of programming languages and programming systems. The conference has a rich tradition of supporting ideas that have made enduring contributions to the theory, design, implementation or application of programming languages. Supporting student travel to attend professional conferences and workshops is a very important mission of the NSF. The broader significance and importance includes supporting travel for women and underrepresented minorities, thereby fostering a diverse pool of next generation researchers in this important research area. In particular, students have the opportunity to learn state-of-the-art methodologies, be exposed to novel techniques, and interact with senior researchers in their areas of expertise.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The ACM SIGPLAN Symposium on Principles of Programming Languages (POPL) is one of the top technical forums for the presentation and discussion of advances in programming languages and systems. The symposium welcomes a wide range of topics both theoretical and experimental in nature and presentations can include papers from proposals for formal models to analysis of experience reports.

Broader Impacts  The funding received from NSF for this proposal (1625220) has allowed for greater student participation in the symposium, especially for those students who may not be able to receive the equivalent support from their educational institution. The extension of the support for not just POPL 2016 but for POPL 2017, enabled us to support participation of two different sub groups of students across two conferences, thus making the greatest use of funds possible. Additionally, since POPL 2017 was held in Paris, France, the travel funding supported the exchange of information and increased opportunities for collaboration between U.S. and French students? engaged in research in programming languages and systems.  The students supported by the NSF travel funds were able to create and strengthen research ties with individuals in the programming languages community from around the world. This increased collaboration has wider impacts in the general research and education communities and for future innovation and research.  In a post-travel survey students indicated several benefits of the support:  -I was able to form research connections.  -I was able to expand/refine my research interests.  -I had networking opportunities that I would not have otherwise had.  -I was able to present my work.  -I was able to learn from fellow graduate students and faculty.  -I was able to learn about conferences, in general.  -I was able to learn more about other research going on in the community.  Below are comments from students regarding their how the NSF travel funds supported their academic career:  Thanks to the NSF travel funding, I was able to meet interesting people and renew the connections. I had made at previous conferences. I was able to do some work with international collaborators and learned presentation skills by attending parts of PLMW. I would not have been able to attend without the NSF travel funding.  While at POPL, I was able to connect with several researchers that were presenting their recent work, which is closely related to my own work. We were able to compare our work and learn from each other, and arrange further meetings and collaboration. I was also able to discuss some of my work-in-progress with researchers and get valuable feedback.  The NSF travel funds allowed me to participate in the workshop CPP (Certified Programs and Proofs). At CPP I gave a talk about homotopy type theory, a promising new area of type theory, and about Lean, a new interactive theorem prover currently under development as an collaboration by Microsoft Research and Carnegie Mellon University. It also allowed me to see the other developments in interactive theorem proving, and allowed me to have real-life discussions with the main developer of Lean.
