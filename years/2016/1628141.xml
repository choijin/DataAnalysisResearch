<AbstractNarration>SES- 1628141&lt;br/&gt;Jon Miller&lt;br/&gt;Ronald  Inglehart&lt;br/&gt;University of Michigan&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports the participation of the United States in the 7th cycle (2016-7) of the World Values Survey (WVS). The WVS was initiated in 1981 with substantial leadership from the United States. Over the last 36 years, the WVS has been the only source of information on mass values and attitudes from countries containing the majority of the world's population. The availability of data from the WVS makes it possible to analyze (1) the impact of economic and technological change on people?s values, and (2) the impact of individual-level values and beliefs on societal-level characteristics such as the extent to which a society has democratic values. The WVS includes a set of items measuring attitudes toward science and technology. Current controversies over topics such as global climate change, genetically modified foods, and infectious diseases illustrate the importance of understanding the formation and distribution of these attitudes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The WVS is built on a general model of individual attitude formation that includes the early influence of family, the social norms and culture of an individual?s community, and broader societal beliefs about religion and economic systems. A common questionnaire is constructed by scholars from more than 50 countries and is administered in each country using methods and modes appropriate to that country. The social, economic, and political values of individuals are changing and these changes have a major impact on a wide range of societal expectations and public policies. These values also have a major influence on the extent to which a society has good governance and democratic institutions. In order to make effective policy, it is important for policy makers to be informed about these trends and the reasons underlying them. Numerous scholars have used WVS data in analyzing social change, producing hundreds of books and more than 1,000 articles. More than 100,000 students and faculty from all six continents downloaded data and information from the 6th cycle of the WVS. These data have also been used for instructional purposes by many social scientists : one publisher estimates that more than 50,000 students use WVS data with their textbooks each year.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The World Values Survey (WVS) was launched in 1980 to provide cross-national information about the formation and distribution of social, religious, personal, and political values. It is repeated once every five years and currently more than 90 countries participate in the WVS. Each country is expected to fund its own study. This grant supported the participation of the United States in the 7th cycle of the WVS.  The four decades of WVS data have been invaluable to graduate students and scholars throughout the world. The cost of data collection is high and few scholars (and few nations) could afford to conduct surveys in 90 countries. This international collaborative study provides comparative data for thousands of students and scholars in countries around the world. The resulting social science reports and literature help inform public policy in these countries.  The quality of the scholarship produced from WVS data testify to the intellectual merit of the project. Scholars and public policy leaders in participating countries are asked for suggestions for questions for each cycle of the WVS which assures its relevance to both public policy needs and scholarly inquiry. The impact of this work, however, goes beyond publications by scholars and can be seen in the use of WVS data in public policy discussions in many countries.  The 7th cycle of the WVS included new sets of items concerning attitudes toward immigration and immigrants, which is a timely and important subject throughout the world. Although approximately 20 countries are still collecting their national surveys, preliminary results demonstrate the importance of this issue in many countries.  The 7th cycle also included an expanded set of items about the integrity of elections in each country. Given the variety of political systems represented in the 90+ WVS countries, these results (still awaiting the last 20 countries) will provide useful insights into the health of democracies throughout the world.  All of the WVS data are available to interested users through the WVS website www.worldvaluessurvey.org .                Last Modified: 12/26/2019       Submitted by: Jon D Miller]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
