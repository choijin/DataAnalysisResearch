<AbstractNarration>International trade is the outcome of ongoing interaction between individual buyers and sellers. Official statistics have historically revealed only the aggregate trade flows that their activity generates. Quite naturally, trade theory sought to model these aggregates with little attention to the role of individual interactions, which were hidden from view. A limitation is that research was unable to delve into the underlying reasons for such phenomena as the decline of trade with distance or the sluggish response of trade to changes in international prices. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research exploits newly available data on individual international transactions, from the United States, Colombia, and China, to study the trading relationships among individual exporters and importers. The project has four components. The first is the construction of panel datasets linking domestic buyers and foreign sellers through their international transactions. Each commercial shipment generates a customs record that reveals the identity of both the importing and exporting firm. In addition, the United States, Colombia and China all collect extensive firm- or plant-level panel data on their domestic producers. By merging China-U.S. shipments and Colombia-U.S. shipments with these producer-level surveys, the researchers on this project will create large panel data sets that follow importer-exporter relationships through time, with information on the current state of both parties to each transaction. These data sets will permit very detailed analyses of a wide range of issues concerning trade dynamics and firm-level performance. They will be made available through the Census Bureau to all researchers with the proper security clearance, and they will provide the basis for further analysis within the remainder of this project. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The next component of the project will examine the quality of trade statistics generated from the shipments data. Inconsistency between exports reported by one country and the corresponding imports reported by another has plagued the analysis of international trade. For example, what Colombia reports exporting to the United States in 2007 differs by 8 percent from what the United States reports importing from Colombia. These datasets provide a tool to diagnose the discrepancies. Combined, the shipment records of the exporting and importing country reveal, for example, whether discrepancies arise in the aggregate statistics because they are based on different sets of shipments or different valuations placed on the same shipments. This component of the research should prove useful to the construction of trade statistics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The third component of the project will describe buyer-seller interactions. These datasets connect firms to each other through their trading relationships. Network theory, which provides various metrics for describing the potentially very complex connections among members of a network, is a natural means of interpreting these connections. The metrics thus provide insight, for example, into the extent to which a single widely-connected buyer or seller contributes to international trade. The matched datasets will allow the observation of the propensity with which different types of firms form links with each other. Copula theory provides a natural means of describing the matching behavior of different types of firms. Preliminary evidence suggests, for example, little tendency for large firms and small firms to differ in the extent to which they match with other large or small firms. In terms of size, in other words, matching is neither positively nor negatively assortative. This component of the research provides insight, for example, into the vulnerability of trade to the potential collapse of a single entity and the extent to which growth in trade is the consequence of new trading relationships or expansion of trade within existing ones. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The final component of the project will use the data to guide the design of economic models of international trade. Recognizing the discrete nature of individual transactions and the behavior of individual firms involved requires a radical reformulation of international trade theory. The dynamics of network formation can be described in terms of a paired set of generation-recombination processes. A generic model that is fairly devoid of specific assumptions about behavior can thus be applied to examine features that a wide class of economic models must satisfy to explain basic features of the data. The research will then turn to specific formulations of firm behavior that connect trading relationships to other decisions, such as hiring and investment. This component of the research should prove useful to the development of a measurement-based dynamic theory of international trade that reflects the interaction of individual firms.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[Work completed on this project has made a number of advances to our understanding of how shocks are transmitted internationally, and the role of trade in transmitting those shocks.  It has developed tools to enhance the ability of researchers to use a wide range of economic data to understand forces at work in the global economy.   One aspect of the research has advanced our understanding of how business cycles operate in a world in which countries are subject to various shocks whose impact gets transmitted globally.  While the shocks that led to the great recession hit most countries individually, trade place a role in exacerbating their effect across countries, particularly to small countries with large neighbors.   The collapse of trade associated with the great recession was largely the result of a decline in investment opportunities around the globe, lowering the demand for durable manufactures which are a major component of trade.   Another aspect of the research has been how exporting and importing firms interact in international markets.  Customs records provide a means of understanding how individual firms create networks across countries.  Exploiting these records for France and the United States shows how firms increase their exports in new markets by finding new buyers.  Firms buying these products may use them as inputs into production to perform tasks previously performed by workers.  Workers most easily replaceable by such inputs will lose while workers whose productivity is enhanced by these inputs will gain.  Our framework allows us to quantify these gains and losses.  We can also use the analysis to assess how a disruption of trade can lead to the destruction of firm-to-firm relationships and estimate how long it takes for relationships to recover.   How much countries spend on each others’ goods depends on how many different products they buy from each other and how much they spend on each.  How much they spend on each in turn depends on how many of them they buy and the price they pay for each.  The overall value of bilateral trade breaks down quite systematically into these dimensions.  Countries with high per capita, incomes, for example, both charge more for what they export and pay more for what the import.  A component of this research has adopted a Ricardian model of trade to interpret these regularities.   An implication of the analysis is that these differences in what countries pay don’t systematically skew the gains from trade in favor of richer or poorer countries.
