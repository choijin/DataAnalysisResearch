<AbstractNarration>In light of the increasingly urban future of our planet, a thorough understanding of the biological processes at work in urban areas is necessary for the continued survival of Earth's inhabitants, including humans. The first step in that understanding is to know what thrives, survives, or perishes in cities, now and in the past. The Mid-Atlantic Megalopolis (MAM) Project begins this study by looking at vascular plants, with the digitization of roughly 700,000 herbarium specimens from eleven institutions, including public and private universities, state agencies, arboreta, museums, and botanic gardens, in the urban corridor from New York City to Washington, D.C. As the largest, oldest, and most populated urban corridor in the U.S., this area and its flora present a unique opportunity for the study of urbanization, particularly given its rich herbarium collections, containing specimens collected over the last 400 years. The data mobilized in this effort will help us achieve a better scientific understanding of living urban systems, a critical need for urban planners, restoration ecologists, environmental engineers, (landscape) architects, and conservationists engaged in creating more sustainable and better designed cities, including the constructed and restored natural environments of our urban areas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Digitization of each specimen in the MAM Project will result in a high resolution image, a databased record of collection metadata, and a georeferenced point, all of which will be made publicly available online. Building on already successful regional programs, the MAM Project will partner with schools, universities, botanical clubs, and the general public to crowd source databasing efforts and to recruit citizen scientists to help build urban floras online, enabling not only increased digitization efficiency, but educational and research opportunities as well. The MAM Project also includes new developments for data cleaning and standardization in Symbiota, which will expedite the use of digitized specimen data for research, and new reporting features which will advance digitization workflow and project management. This award is made as part of the National Resource for Digitization of Biological Collections through the Advancing Digitization of Biological Collections program, and all data resulting from this award will be available through the national resource (iDigBio.org).</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The Mid-Atlantic Megalopolis (MAM) Project digitized over 1.1 million specimens (+23% over targeted goal) from 13 herbaria across the Mid-Atlantic, here defined as the area including Delaware, Maryland, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, New York, and Washington D.C. Our digitization process included taking a high-resolution image of a specimen, transcribing the specimen data (generally, who collected the specimen, when, and where, as well as what the specimen is) into an online database, and then georeferencing, or ascribing a latitude and longitude point to the collection locality for the specimen. The primary product of the MAM Project was the Mid-Atlantic Virtual Herbarium Consortium, or the MAM portal (midatlanticherbaria.org). This is a database and image portal managed by each collaborating herbarium and maintained by the Symbiota team at Arizona State University. The MAM portal is where the entirety of the 1.1 million specimens from the project are all freely accessible online to researchers and the public. The MAM Project has engaged 492 volunteers and student-volunteers who transcribed roughly 211,000 records in the portal, learning about herbaria, plants and geography in the process. Super-volunteers were incredibly important to this effort, with roughly 75% of those records being transcribed by just 13 MAM volunteers.&nbsp;</p> <p>Our ultimate goal with the MAM specimen digitization is to improve our scientific understanding of the flora of the Mid-Atlantic region and, with regards to Delaware in particular, to address questions such as "how many plant species are found here", "how species composition has changed over time, and with urbanization or land use", and "how species range and/or flowering time has changed with a changing climate". The Claude E. Phillips Herbarium (DOV) at Delaware State University digitized 53,300 specimens representing more than 5,000 species of vascular plants and providing over 200 years of data from the Mid-Atlantic region. Most specimens on the local flora do not have duplicates elsewhere and represent a unique dataset of valuable information that is now publicly available online. The MAM Project also allowed improving specimen curation at DOV. All of these facts were highlighted at a poster presentation given at the Botanical Society of America meeting.&nbsp;</p> <p>The MAM Project provided much opportunity for training and outreach. Overall, DOV trained 50 students on the job and in the classroom. The MAM Project was used in two botanical courses to teach students digitization techniques, checklist creation, and research project development while it also gave them exposure to natural history collections and familiarity with classification, scientific names, and geography. In addition, DOV also held three public training events that included each a lecture on natural history collections followed by digitization workshops on data transcription and floristics. These events were attended by over 30 people, including students, staff from private and state institutions, and the general public, and led to the recruitment of 13 volunteers who participated in specimen sorting and barcoding as well as in data transcription. Moreover, 65 tours were given throughout the project as part of regular outreach activities at DOV and were used to discuss the importance of digitization and to promote the MAM Project. These tours were attended by nearly 1,000 students, professionals, amateurs, and members of the public. Six tours were specifically designed to show the behind-the-scenes of the digitization work at DOV.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 12/18/2020<br>      Modified by: Cynthia&nbsp;Hong-Wa</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
