<AbstractNarration>The achievement gap begins well before children enter kindergarten. Research has shown that children who start school having missed critical early learning opportunities are already at risk for academic failure. This project seeks to narrow this gap by finding new avenues for bringing early science experiences to preschool children (ages 3-5), particularly those living in communities with few resources. Bringing together media specialists, learning researchers, and two proven home visiting organizations to collaboratively develop and investigate a new model that engages families in science exploration through joint media engagement and home visiting programs. The project will leverage the popularity and success of the NSF-funded PEEP and the Big Wide World/El Mundo Divertido de PEEP to engage both parents and preschool children with science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To address the key goal of engaging families in science exploration through joint media engagement and home visiting programs, the team will use a Design Based Implementation Research (DBIR) approach to address the research questions by iteratively studying the intervention model (the materials and implementation process) and assessing the impact of the intervention model on parents/caregivers. The intervention model will include the PEEP Family Engagement Toolkit that will support 20 weeks of family science investigations using new digital and hands-on science learning resources. It will also include new professional development resources for home educators as well as and the implementation process and strategies for developing and implementing the Toolkit with families. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research focuses first on refining and improving program design and implementation, and second, on investigating whether the intervention improves the capacity of parent/caregivers to support young children's learning in science. Ultimately this research will accomplish two important aims: it will inform the design of the PEEP family engagement intervention model, and, more broadly, it will build practical and theoretical understanding of: 1) effective family engagement models in science learning; 2) the types of supports that families and home educators need to implement these models; and 3) how to implement these models across different home visiting programs. Given the reach of the home visiting programs and the increasing interest in supporting early science learning the potential for broad impact is significant. This project is funded by the Advancing Informal STEM Learning (AISL) program, which seeks to advance new approaches to, and evidence-based understanding of, the design and development of STEM learning in informal environments.</AbstractNarration>

The goal of this research and development project was to foster <strong>joint media engagement</strong> and <strong>hands-on </strong><strong>science exploration</strong> among diverse, low-income 3- to 5-year-old children and their parents, specifically English and Spanish-speaking families who attend <strong>home visiting programs</strong>. (Home visiting programs serve families living in poverty, providing parents, who don't send their children to preschool, support and educational resources to use at home.)</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Using resources from the preschool public television science program <em>PEEP and the Big Wide World</em>,<em> <strong>PEEP Family Science</strong></em> includes animated stories, live-action videos with real children, hands-on science activities, and educational resources for parents and home visiting educators, delivered in the form of free, easy-to-use apps. There are <strong>four apps in English and four in Spanish</strong>, each devoted to a science unit that's especially appealing to young children: ramps, colors, sounds, and shadows. And each foster a set of three pedagogical engagement strategies that parents can use when exploring science with their children: <em>Play and Explore Together, Ask Questions and Talk About Ideas, </em>and <em>Explore More! </em>Videos for parents, which are embedded in the apps, model these pedagogical strategies and provide important guidance for parents in how to do the hands-on activities with their children. Once downloaded, the apps can be used <span><span>offline.&nbsp; P</span></span>arents do not need to have Wi-Fi or to use their phone's cellular data.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The design of <em>PEEP Family Science</em> rests on the central conjecture that, <strong>with resources that engage and scaffold their own learning, parents can learn about and implement practices to support their children's science learning</strong>. Researchers from Education Development Center (EDC) tested this assumption over a two-year period with more than 200 diverse families and 20 home educators from two long-established home visiting programs, HIPPY USA and AVANCE. Testing took place in Arkansas and Texas, in both English and Spanish. <strong>K</strong><strong>ey findings </strong>included <strong>positive differences in</strong> <strong>parents' attitudes and knowledge</strong>: parents reported doing substantially more science activities with their children and in using the three engagement strategies, and; parents who were initially less confident in helping their children learn science developed more confidence. Families were also observed <strong>engaging in important science content </strong>and<strong> using science practices together</strong>, including asking questions, planning and carrying out investigations, and communicating information. Educators reported that this <strong>video-based guidance was particularly valuable</strong> for parents with lower reading abilities.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p class="Pa5">Our findings suggest that the <em>PEEP Family Science</em> model holds <strong>substantial promise for engaging diverse, low-income families and their young children in science</strong>. Results suggest that the <strong>app format</strong> <strong>has potential to bring joint media and hands-on engagement together in a way that is manageable and engaging for caregivers and their children</strong>. <em>PEEP Family Science</em> did not start out as an app but rather as online videos and printed guides for families. We learned through the iterative design process that apps can be valuable for improving the accessibility of science materials. Feedback from parents and educators suggest the value of the apps rested in their accessibility (they can be used offline and with older technology), developmentally appropriate content, engaging characters, and supports to connect media experiences to the off-screen world. Specifically, our findings suggest that features of the apps that are likely to engage families in science exploration include: video that models developmentally appropriate science exploration; bite-size, concrete steps using accessible language; and parent-facing elements that help parents guide their children through media and hands-on activities. <strong>Media can engage young children and their families by providing parents, as the primary users of the media, guidance on how to mediate their young children's media experiences and ways for understanding strategies they can use to support their children's learning and develop science-related academic talk, which can help children be ready for school</strong>. A close analysis of the complexity of the language that parents use with their children while engaging with the <em>PEEP Family Science</em> materials also suggests that the intervention holds promise for <strong>supporting language-rich talk within families from diverse backgrounds</strong>.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><em>PEEP Family Science </em>was <strong>disseminated through</strong> <strong>12 partner organizations</strong> (HIPPY USA, Avance, Parents as Teachers, Healthy Families America, National Head Start Association, Military Child Education Coalition, National Parent Teacher Association, Association of Library Service to Children, Boston Children's Museum, Association of Science and Technology Centers, National Center for Families Learning, and ParentChild+). The program has been the recipient of several <strong>awards</strong>: a 5-star rating on Common Sense Media, Facilitator's Choice Award in the 2019 STEM for All Video Showcase, a Parents' Choice Award, and a Teachers' Choice Award.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 09/28/2020<br>      Modified by: Marisa&nbsp;Wolsky</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div
