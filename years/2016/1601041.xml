<AbstractNarration>This project will study the evolutionary relationships of Porroglossum, an endangered Neotropical orchid genus are distributed in the Andes. The flowers of Porroglossum are unique because the labellum or 'lip' actively snaps inward when touched in order to trap pollinators and ensure successful pollination. The research will combine modern molecular approaches, high-speed videography, and floral fragrance sampling to gain a multifaceted understanding of the evolutionary relationships within the group and the processes underlying its diversification. This project will train both undergraduate and graduate students in modern molecular systematics techniques, including members of under-represented groups, and will enhance collaborations with orchid researchers in Ecuador.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project aims to fully resolve phylogenetic relationships within the Neotropical orchid genus Porroglossum. Researchers will use reduced representation genome sequencing (e.g., genotyping by sequencing) to collect a large number of SNPs from each species within the genus. The project also will use high-speed videography to examine floral snap-trap kinematics among species of Porroglossum. Velocity, acceleration, and kinetic energy data will be collected from high-speed videos of the active floral snap-traps and mapped onto the fully resolved phylogenetic tree, and phylogenetic signal will be estimated for each data type. Lastly, this research will employ dynamic headspace adsorption and a gas chromatography/mass spectrometry instrument to investigate the patterns of floral fragrance evolution within Porroglossum.</AbstractNarration>
