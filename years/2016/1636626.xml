<AbstractNarration>This award will make the Las Cumbres Observatory Global Telescope (LCOGT) network of optical telescopes available to the US astronomical community over a period of 3.5 years. The network consists of two 2m telescopes, 9-12 1m telescopes, and many 0.4m telescopes at multiple locations around the world. Broader impacts of the work include training of students and postdocs, and public outreach. LCOGT provides telescope time and other resources for many astronomy education programs, including the Faulkes Telescope Project, the International Astronomical Search Collaboration, Hands On Universe, Universe Awareness, Universe in the Classroom, Galileo Teacher Training Program, Astronomers without Borders, Our Solar Siblings, and Astrofactum.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Observing time will be made available over 7 semesters, with 214 hours/semester on the 2m telescopes and 1287 hours/semester on the 1m telescopes, plus some community involvement in key projects. Unique capabilities of the facility include continuous monitoring (24H/day), flexible cadence, long-term stable observations, and rapid target-of-opportunity response. Access to the telescopes will allow interesting individual projects to be conducted by the US community, enhance on-going surveys at other telescopes, and provide opportunities to prepare for NSF's Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (currently under construction).</AbstractNarration>

This award provides the U.S. astronomical community with access to this unique resource. LCO was designed to support time domain astronomy - the capability to continually watch astronomical phenomena as they change. Continuous observations from the ground are possible because, with telescopes located around the world, at least one of them will always be in the dark. A telescope can be directed to observe newly discovered phenomena at any time. At the heart of LCO operations sits an amazing bit of artificial intelligence called the scheduler. Working without human intervention the internet-based scheduler takes requests for observations from scientists and education observers, analyzes everything from competing observation requests to conditions at each telescope site, directs individual telescopes to make the desired observations, and compiles the results. Investigators can make requests for observations at any time as the scheduler updates the entire network plan about every 5 minutes. In addition to providing unique observing resources, LCO is helping the U.S. science community prepare for future time domain astronomy facilities, particularly for following up discoveries that will be made with the NSF Vera Rubin Observatory.&nbsp; All of the observatory control software and science program management tools created by LCO are being made freely available for use by other scientists and facilities.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p><br />Through this award LCO provided the U.S. community access to the 0.4-meter, 1-meter, and 2-meter telescopes that make up the LCO global network.&nbsp; Over 10,500 hours of telescope time was awarded in 2017 through 2020 to 158 competitively selected observing proposals.&nbsp;</p> <p>The mission of LCO is to "advance our understanding of the universe through science and education with our unique global telescope network."
