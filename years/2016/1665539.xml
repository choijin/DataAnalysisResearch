<AbstractNarration>The Phenome 2017 Conference will be held February 10-14, 2017 in Tucson, Arizona. This international meeting intends to be an annual venue to both showcase and accelerate basic research and the development of novel remote sensors, imaging technologies, and robotics in the field of high throughput plant phenotyping.  The meeting will bring together scientists with expertise in fundamental plant systems biology, epigenetics, quantitative genetics, and metabolic and network analyses with those in the fields of computational science, and engineering to identify the challenges and needs required to translate research findings for the public good. Phenome 2017 is a joint effort of the National Plant Science Council (NPSC) and the American Society of Plant Biologists (ASPB). As such, the organizers will be able to leverage existing resources to keep costs low to allow for participation of those with limited funds. Funding from NSF will broaden the scope of the meeting by supporting participation of graduate students, postdocs and junior faculty, especially women, minorities, and underrepresented groups.</AbstractNarration>

The focus of this grant was to support establishment of a recurrent annual meeting of plant scientists, engineers and computational scientists to focus on the latest advancements in phenomics technologies.  Funds from the award were used to broaden participation and enhance diversity of scientists, particularly junior scientists and women. The meeting was held in Tucson, Arizona, and included 3.5 days of sessions.  Funds supported attendance and researcn presentation by students, postdocs and junior scientists, as well as meeting organizational functions.  The most important outcome of this support was an extremely high level of enthusiasm from attendees about the quality of the meeting, leading us to propose that the meeting be held annually.
