<AbstractNarration>The Directorate of Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences offers postdoctoral research fellowships to provide opportunities for recent doctoral graduates to obtain additional training, to gain research experience under the sponsorship of established scientists, and to broaden their scientific horizons beyond their undergraduate and graduate training. Postdoctoral fellowships are further designed to assist new scientists to direct their research efforts across traditional disciplinary lines and to avail themselves of unique research resources, sites, and facilities, including at foreign locations. This postdoctoral fellowship award supports a rising scholar at the University of California-Davis exploring the STEM engagement of minority and women college students. Currently, women and ethnic minorities are significantly underrepresented in science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) related fields. This underrepresentation is a problem because it can serve as a hindrance to advancements in all areas of STEM.  Previous research has started to identify factors both pre- and post-college that may encourage people from underrepresented groups to continue in STEM-related fields. However, we know little about students' day-to-day experiences as they go through the early college years, when many students exit STEM majors. There is reason to expect that diversity in the STEM workforce can lead to innovative solutions to very complex problems.  Thus, findings from this project will impact not only emerging scholars in STEM fields, but also future academics, researchers, and STEM employees. This project will broaden the participation of scientists from currently under-represented groups: 1) the project aims directly address the underrepresentation of women and ethnic minorities in the US STEM workforce and identifies solutions to improve this; and 2) during the 2-year fellowship, the principal investigator will engage in mentoring activities to encourage other women and ethnic minorities to become or stay involved in the sciences. As part of the project, study findings will be broadly disseminated to inform and transform existing interventions implemented by various entities within the university community (i.e., dorm administration, student service groups, university administration).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the United States, women and ethnic minorities continue to be underrepresented in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) areas of study This is despite the fact that women make up slightly more than half of the US population and ethnic minority groups are increasing their representation in the US, including in undergraduate institutions. The proposed study will offer critical insights to share with the university community on ways to increase the numbers of underrepresented groups in STEM, as well as ways to retain them.  In the proposed study, 300 college freshmen majoring in a STEM field will be recruited (projected ethnic breakdown based on oversampling are 25% Caucasian, 20% Black/African American, 25% Hispanic/Latino, and 30% Asian descent; 60% women) from a larger study of 1800 college freshmen in order to: 1) explore the daily associations between stereotype threat (feelings of being treated a certain way due to race or ethnicity) experiences and STEM satisfaction, and whether this association strengthens over time; 2) evaluate self-efficacy for STEM field success as a mediator of the association between daily stereotype threats and daily STEM satisfaction; and 3) examine the potential protective role of diversity exposure on continuation in STEM-related fields.  To address these aims, the study will use a structural equation model within in a longitudinal framework (four time points across 2 years) with 5-day daily report periods embedded within 3 of those time points.</AbstractNarration>

Then, the study aimed to explore how friend group diversity may serve as a buffer to protect the self-efficacy of ethnic minorities experiencing microaggressions.

Attrition rates averaged 24% across the study with nine students switching out of a STEM-related major within the study time span.

However, for racial microaggressions, no significant mediation effects were found.
