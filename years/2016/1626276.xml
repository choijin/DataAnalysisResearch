<AbstractNarration>This Major Research Instrumentation award supports the acquisition of a state of the art X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) system that will support multidisciplinary research and education in institutions throughout West Michigan. This modern XRD enables cutting edge research in nanotechnology, physics, materials science, chemistry, electrical engineering, and other areas. The knowledge generated will be used to design new materials and processes, and "tailor" their structure and properties to specific demands, such as materials for green energy production, medical devices, sensors, flexible electronics, and more. The XRD will help educate future researchers by providing opportunities using modern research instrumentation. In addition, the PI's university has strong outreach programs, including training and retaining science teachers and providing opportunities for high school students. The XRD instrument will greatly benefit these programs and attract students to STEM research as a career path. In addition to serving as a shared, multi-user, multi-purpose facility for the Western Michigan University and other area institutions, it will also be used by local high-tech businesses. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A modern X-ray powder and surface diffraction system is an essential tool in multiple scientific research fields. Knowledge gained from diffraction analyses is critical for the determination of crystalline structure, phases and phase transformations, thickness of thin layers, size of nano-particles, crystallographic preferred orientation, residual stresses, and as a result, is critical for the design of new materials. This instrument will enable numerous research projects, including the creation of nanostructured magnetic and thermal shape-memory smart alloys for new applications, such as developing new micro- and nano-electromechanical systems.  It will also enable determination of the surface properties of thin films being developed for semiconductor gas sensors for detecting chemical species. Other studies include the properties of semiconducting films that may be suitable for low cost solar cells and determination of the nanoparticle properties in ferrogels for drug delivery purposes.  The structure and degree of crystallinity of 3D printed materials will be measured to help improve the technique for printing biocompatible materials.  Developing better high temperature superconductors is another goal. High tech applications include the development of machining materials, using Laser Augmented Diamond Drilling for materials that are not machinable using conventional techniques.</AbstractNarration>
