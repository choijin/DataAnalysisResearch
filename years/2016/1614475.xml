<AbstractNarration>This award will support the Particle and Nuclear Physics group at James Madison University as a key contributor to state-of-the-art research in intermediate energy nuclear physics while providing an outstanding educational experience for undergraduate students. The group's research is focused on exploring the structure of the basic building blocks of matter, protons and neutrons. It is known that protons and neutrons are composed of three interacting quarks but the mechanisms that produce and govern the evolution of multi-quark systems are not fully understood.  The group will address this by scattering photons from protons and neutrons to detect and analyze the resulting particles.  The group is also involved in measuring fundamental properties of the muon, which can be thought of as a heavy electron.  The Particle and Nuclear Physics group at James Madison University group has an established track record of strong undergraduate student involvement in research. This award will provide enhanced educational opportunities for students as well as significant outreach activities, promoting science and educating beyond the university. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The members of the group are spokespersons on two experiments approved to run at Jefferson Lab. One of these experiments was identified is currently scheduled to run in March 2017. The group is also an important contributor to the BONuS12 experiment, which was identified as a high priority Jefferson Lab experiment, and is currently scheduled as the second physics experiment to run using the CLAS12 detector in Hall B. The main activities for the duration of this proposal include commissioning detectors built by the group for Jefferson Lab, participating in data taking and analysis for various Jefferson Lab experiments, as well as installation and commissioning of the g-2 detector at Fermilab. The members of the JMU-PNP group will continue their R&amp;D detector work for future nuclear physics experiments. This work, carried out in the group's labs at James Madison University, will augment the group's capabilities and expertise in scintillator-based detectors and associated readout electronics.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>For more than fifty years, humankind's knowledge of the subatomic world was summarized in what is called the "Standard Model of Particle Physics" (SM). With the support of the National Science Foundation, the James Madison University Particle and Nuclear Physics group (JMU-PNP) is involved in a number of high-profile experiments meant to, on one hand to complete our SM picture of the world and on the other hand, to explore physical phenomena not accounted for in this theory. This seminal work is carried out at Fermi National Laboratory (FNAL), at the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility (JLab), and in the group&rsquo;s research laboratories at JMU.</p> <p>As part of the G-2 collaboration, which seeks to explore physics beyond the SM, JMU teamed up with the University of Virginia to design high voltage supplies for elements of 24 calorimeters. In addition, the power management systems for the readout of these calorimeters was designed, built, and tested at JMU. Currently, our group is involved in the effort to chart the magnetic field used in this experiment, with a member of JMU PNP serving in the oversight committee that supervises this difficult and critical task.</p> <p>JMU PNP involvement in JLab-based research spans all four experimental Halls, with significant hardware contributions to Hall A (photomultiplier tube testing for multiple detection systems, conception and design of the Compact Photon Source) and Hall B (testing of the Forward tagger of the CLAS12 detector). As spokesperson, a JMU PNP member leads the data analysis and publication effort for one of the Hall C commissioning experiments, E12-10-002, which aims to understand the dynamics of the quarks that form the proton and the neutron.</p> <p>The JMU-PNP research program provides many opportunities for undergraduate students to acquire and hone their expertise in all aspects of experimental nuclear and particles physics work: mechanical and electronic design, fabrication, and testing, coding, data analysis, publication and dissemination of scientific results. The group has been fortunate to recruit and maintain a solid pool of students who, based on the experience acquired, went on to take industry or government positions, or to pursue advanced degrees in physics, engineering, or, more recently, in data analytics.</p> <p>Fully aware of the large societal strides still needed to achieve diversity, equity, and inclusion the JMU-PNP group attracts and retains students from underrepresented groups, armed forces veterans, as well as high school students seeking to broaden their knowledge through research projects. This makes our group a vibrant, welcoming environment mirroring the 21<sup>st</sup> century US work force, where top-notched scientific output symbiotically combines with mentoring and early career advice for aspiring scientists and engineers. In the words of a JMU-PNP alumna, Morgan Heckman, who as a high school student spent a year and a half carrying out research in our lab and who is currently pursuing a career in neuroscience: &ldquo;One of the grad students I work with here had asked me why I had studied physics, and my honest answer is because of all the things I learned from you guys.
