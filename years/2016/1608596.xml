<AbstractNarration>The Alpine Conference on Algebraic and Applied Topology will take place August 15th through August 21st in Saas-Almagell, Switzerland.  The conference will bring together experts in  both the theoretical aspects of algebraic topology and the growing range of scientific applications of topology.   The conference program will consist of lectures by the invited plenary speakers, together with contributed talks from other conference participants.  The plenary speakers will inform participants about recent advances in their fields, and provide insight into possible directions for future work.  All participants will have the opportunity to discuss their work with and receive feedback from others experts in the field, to continue existing and form new collaborations, and to learn more about potentially useful tools and techniques outside their areas of expertise.  This award will ensure that the US algebraic topology community is well-represented at this important conference, and, in particular, that early-career topologists from the US have the opportunity to participate.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The invited plenary speakers for the conference are Agnes Beaudry (Chicago), Andrew Blumberg (UT-Austin), Pedro Boavida de Brito (Louvain-la-Neuve), David Chataur (Lille), Cristina Costoya (Coruna), Emanuele Dotto (MIT), John Greenlees (Sheffield), John Harer (Duke), Lars Hesselholt (Copenhagen), Marc Hoyois (MIT), Nitu Kitchloo (Johns Hopkins), Vidit Nanda (Penn), and Vesna Stojanoska (UIUC).  As evidenced by the choice of plenary speakers, the conference will cover a broad spectrum of subjects within algebraic topology, including chromatic and stable homotopy theory, manifolds and functor calculus, K-theory, homotopy theory and algebraic geometry, equivariant stable homotopy theory and commutative algebra, applications of homotopy theory to group theory, and operads and rational homotopy theory.  In addition, this conference will feature an emphasis on the use of techniques from algebraic topology in applications, including data analysis, shape recognition, and networks.  This conference will enable  researchers to survey the state of the art in algebraic topology, provide theoretical algebraic topologists a forum in which to learn about recently developed applications of topology, and give applied topologists an opportunity to become acquainted with the latest theoretical results and methods.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additional information the conference can be found at the conference website: http://www.math.univ-paris13.fr/arolla2016/.</AbstractNarration>
