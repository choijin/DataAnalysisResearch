<AbstractNarration>This project supports hosting a Global Environment for Network innovations (GENI) Regional Workshop (GRW) on May 23, 2016 at Boston University in Boston, Massachusetts. The intent of this GRW is to continue to broaden the GENI user community, introducing new educators and researchers in the northeastern US geographic region to GENI. Four GRWs in total are planned for 2016, one held about every three months (i.e., March (most recent workshop),  May (this workshop), September, and December), scattered geographically across the U.S. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed GRW will promote innovations in research (e.g., network science, security, services, and applications) and education (e.g., the development of new coursework assignments and projects using the GENI infrastructure). The workshop will enable participants to engage in a range of activities designed to improve their understanding of and expertise in: &lt;br/&gt;1) Resources available for utilizing GENI in undergraduate and graduate education. &lt;br/&gt;2) Utilizing the GENI infrastructure in experimental research, including state-of-the-art developments in wired, wireless, cloud computing, software defined networking, and network function virtualization. &lt;br/&gt;3) Working through a variety of "hands on" tutorials, obtaining network and compute resources at locations around the United States. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop serves as a venue for the exchange of ideas, a discussion of challenges of experimentation in research and classroom settings, and a showcase for technology experimentation on GENI.</AbstractNarration>

Additional tutorials were led by Steve Jarvis, Manu Gosain, Charles Carpenter, and Abraham Matta.&nbsp; Summer camp participants learned to run advanced software defined and network function virtualization experiments, wireless experiments and to use tools such as GENI Desktop to instrument their experiments.&nbsp;&nbsp; Participants formed four teams based on their research interest.&nbsp; Each team defined and worked on a project during the week and did a demo and presentation on the last day of the camp. The four projects were:</p> <ol> <li><strong>A      Software Defined Networking (SDN) based firewall</strong>.&nbsp; Only known      switches were allowed to connect to their OpenFlow controller and only      traffic from whitelisted networks were allowed into the internal network.</li> <li><strong>Covert      channels in GENI</strong>.&nbsp; Information was coded as delays between packets using      a scheme similar to Morse code; each letter of the English alphabet was      coded as a sequence of long and short delays between packets.&nbsp;      Decoding error rates were compared over low-latency GENI rack-local links      and over high-latency links between GENI resources on the east and west      coasts of the US.</li> <li><strong>Software      defined radio</strong>.&nbsp; The team programmed a software defined radio at New      York University to receive and decode transponder transmissions from      aircraft flying over Brooklyn, NY.</li> <li><strong>Using      SDN to reduce the complexity of iBGP peering</strong>.&nbsp; Their OpenFlow      controller acts as an iBGP peer and installs flow rules on internal      routers.&nbsp; This eliminates the need for all iBGP routers to form a      full mesh.</li> </ol> <p>The feedback from camp participants was overwhelmingly positive.&nbsp; All respondents to an online survey said the camp was well organized and met their expectations.&nbsp; Coming into the camp, 80% said they have very little to no knowledge of GENI, but by the end of the week, 80% rated their knowledge of GENI to be high.&nbsp; All respondents said they plan on using GENI for their research or teaching.&nbsp; Many attendees said they would have liked more time to work on their projects.</p> <p>All presentation slides and tutorial material are available online from <a href="http://sites.bu.edu/geni/agenda">http://sites.bu.edu/geni/agenda</a>&nbsp;</p> <p>Many thanks to the staff of the Hariri Institute at Boston University for helping with the workshop and summer camp logistics.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 07/06/2018<br>      Modified by: Abraham&nbsp;I&nbsp;Matta</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1641412/1641412_10425228_1530892016858_GRW-BU-RussClark--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1641412/1641412_10425228_1530892016858_GRW-BU-RussClark--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Russ Clark"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1641412/1641412_10425228_1530892016858_GRW-BU-RussClark--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Russ Clark"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Russ Clark of Georgia Tech presenting his research on GENI including Software Defined Exchanges (SDXs).</div> <div class="imageCredit">Boston University</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Abraham&nbsp;I&nbsp;Matta</div> <div class="imageTitle">Russ Clark</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1641412/1641412_10425228_1530892102594_GRW-BU-TilmanWolf--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1641412/1641412_10425228_1530892102594_GRW-BU-TilmanWolf--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Tilman Wolf"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1641412/1641412_10425228_1530892102594_GRW-BU-TilmanWolf--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Tilman Wolf"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Tilman Wolf presenting ChoiceNet, an economy plane for the Internet.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Boston University</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Abraham&nbsp;I&nbsp;Matta</div> <div class="imageTitle">Tilman Wolf</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1641412/1641412_10425228_1530892183699_GRW-BU-KobusVanderMerwe-KirkWebb--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1641412/1641412_10425228_1530892183699_GRW-BU-KobusVanderMerwe-KirkWebb--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Kobus Van der Merwe and Kirk Webb"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1641412/1641412_10425228_1530892183699_GRW-BU-KobusVanderMerwe-KirkWebb--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Kobus Van der Merwe and Kirk Webb"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Kobus Van der Merwe and Kirk Webb delivered tutorials on CloudLab and PhantomNet.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Boston University</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Abraham&nbsp;I&nbsp;Matta</div> <div class="imageTitle">Kobus Van der Merwe and Kirk Webb</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1641412/1641412_10425228_1530892342788_GRW-BU-camp-Hariri--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1641412/1641412_10425228_1530892342788_GRW-BU-camp-Hariri--rgov-800width.jpg" title="BU GENI summer camp"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1641412/1641412_10425228_1530892342788_GRW-BU-camp-Hariri--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="BU GENI summer camp"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Summer camp participants learned to run advanced software defined and network function virtualization experiments, wireless experiments and to use tools such as GENI Desktop to instrument their experiments. </div> <div class="imageCredit">Boston University</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Abraham&nbsp;I&nbsp;Matta</div> <div class="imageTitle">BU GENI summer camp</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
