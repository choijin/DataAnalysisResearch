<AbstractNarration>This project will support travel and meeting registration for a group of exceptional early career scientists to attend and network the combined Gordon Conference/Graduate Research Seminar (GRC/GRS) on ?Flow and Transport in Permeable media: Bridging the gap between scales and processes for strongly coupled systems? to be held in Girona Spain July/August 2016.  The Graduate Research Seminar will proceed the GRC and will focus on understanding and controlling material and process interfaces including flow and reactive transport in porous media with well-known senior mentors. The GRC will cover a diversity of common issues in porous media systems and will have broad international attendance. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gordon Research Conference is an intensive, dedicated meeting that will critically define not only challenges in the subsurface flow and transport but also approaches that have the potential to provide significant progress. The GRC will focus on nine research themes with invited speakers for each theme will come from different disciplines, but will address the questions so as to cut across the various disciplines. These research themes will cover a diversity of common issues in porous media systems, including scaling from pore to field systems, different flow regimes, new thoughts and ideas on relative permeability in multiphase modeling, process identification in diverse porous-media systems, coupling of porous media to free fluid flow systems, characterization of reactive and biological systems, storage of mass and energy in the subsurface, bio-fluid mechanics and life in bio-porous media. This GRS will focus on understanding and controlling material and process interfaces including flow and reactive transport in porous media. Topics of the GRS will therefore cover the influence of interfaces between rocks and fluids, pairs of immiscible fluids, high- and low-conductive zones, and between porous media and the atmosphere or sea, on length scales ranging from micrometers to kilometers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Operational Summary  The Gordon Research Conference (GRC) and Gordon Research Seminar (GRS) on Flow &amp; Transport in Permeable Media were held at the Melia Golf Vichy Catalan in Girona, Spain from July 30 &ndash; August 5, 2016.   The meeting covered a variety of scientific topics and the content presented was highly rated by participants.    Conference Participants  The Conference was well-attended with 134 participants. Scientists from academia represented 93% of the participants while attendees from government accounted for 3.5% and those from industry totaled 3.5%. The meeting also attracted a strong mix of young investigators and senior scientists.  Students and post-docs accounted for 44% of all attendees. Approximately 28% of the participants at the 2016 meeting were women.   Seminar Participants  The Seminar was well-attended with 50 participants. Scientists from academia represented 98% of the participants while attendees from government accounted for 2%. Students and post docs combined accounted for 80% of all attendees. Approximately 32% of the participants at the 2016 seminar were women.       Conference Program - GRC  The dynamics of porous-media flows in environmental, technical, and biological applications are quite complex and span a very wide range of disciplines and interests, including physics, chemistry, biology, computational mathematics, hydrology, reservoir and geothermal engineering. The scales of interest also span an incredibly wide range, from tiny (micrometer and smaller) scales to enormously large terrestrial (energy, water, and climate) systems.

The highly interactive poster sessions were a critical part of the conference, and all the GRC attendees were strongly encouraged to submit a poster on their latest research work.     Conference Program &ndash; GRS  The Gordon Research Seminar on Flow and Transport in Permeable Media was a unique forum for graduate students, post-docs, and other scientists with comparable levels of experience and education to present and exchange new data and cutting edge ideas.     This GRS focused on understanding and controlling material and process interfaces including flow and reactive transport in porous media. Standard models on the continuum scale often do no fully capture these coupled processes, thereby posing particular challenges for environmental, technical and biological applications. Topics of the GRS covered the influence of interfaces between rocks and fluids, pairs of immiscible fluids, high- and low-conductive zones, and between porous media and the atmosphere or sea, on length scales ranging from micrometers to kilometers. These scientifically challenging topics are essential for society's management of water resources, environmental protection, and energy solutions such as carbon capture and storage, geothermal energy production and energy storage.     Conference Feedback  Participants had an opportunity to provide feedback at the end of the Conference. The feedback collected from the meeting was extremely positive. Evaluations included numerous positive remarks regarding the diversity of topics covered, benefits of informal discussion periods, and excellence of the poster sessions.  There was positive feedback on networking opportunities and benefits of the poster sessions at the GRS.    GRC would like to thank the National Science Foundation for its continued support of the meetings.  The contributions received from the National Science Foundation have been critical to the success of the conferences and are having a measurable impact in advancing the frontiers of science worldwide.
