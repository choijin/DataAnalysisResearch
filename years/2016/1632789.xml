<AbstractNarration>This research provides performance metrics for cooperative research centers that enhance translational research through partnerships formed by government, industry and academia. Centers are part of complex ecosystems and vary greatly in the type of science conducted, organizational structures and expected outcomes.  The ability to realize their objectives depends on transparent measurement systems to assist in decision making in research translation.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research introduces a hierarchical decision model that uses both quantitative and qualitative metrics. A generalizable model is developed based upon program goals. The results are validated through consultation with experts. The method is validated using data from the National Science Foundation's industry/university cooperative research centers (IUCRC).   The methodology provides a basis for a generalizable model and measurement system that compares performance of university science and engineering focused research centers supported by industry and government.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This research provides performance metrics for cooperative research centers that enhance translational research formed by the partnership of government, industry and academia. Centers are part of complex ecosystems that vary greatly in the type or research conducted, the way they are organized and the expected outcomes. They are expensive to support and maintain. The ability to realize their objective depends on transparent measurement systems to assist in decision making for research translation.  A generalizable, hierarchical decision model using both quantitative and qualitative metrics compares the effectiveness of the cooperative research centers through case studies. A three- phased expert validation was used:  1) model concept and content validation, 2) construct validation and 3) criterion-related validation.  This research adds value to the field by offering a generalizable, mission-oriented model and measurement system to the field.  This new scoring method compares and evaluates different centers within a program using a holistic set of metrics to provide decision support for program managers and evaluators.  This research also provides a new method to highlight disagreements. Disagreement is important because it can help drive discussion leading to transparent decision-making processes. Dendrographs were used to analyze different group perceptions about the importance of the mission-oriented criteria. This research begins to open up the box within the center by examining some of this disagreement.  The results of this study have been published in a dissertation and presented at several conferences. This benefits the research community by applying a flexible approach that combines qualitative and quantitative output indicators.
