<AbstractNarration>This proposal requests continued support for the highly-successful Undergraduate ALFALFA Team (UAT), which has over the past 8 years provided research-based educational opportunities for 253 students closely collaborating with 25 faculty from a diverse range of universities.  Astronomy faculty from 20 institutions, predominantly small colleges in the northeast, carry out several related scientific programs that involve a radio survey of hydrogen in and around nearby galaxies.  They obtain new data at several observatories and analyze catalog data obtained at Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico.  Undergraduates will be intimately involved in all aspects of the scientific program, including planning and carrying out the observations. They will attend an annual workshop at either Green Bank Observatory or Arecibo Observatory. This program serves as a prime example of the value of scientific collaboration, particularly for faculty and students at isolated schools, and of the importance of research as a component of undergraduate education.  This exposure to front-line astronomical research enhances the educational infrastructure and the quality of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) at a large number of schools.  The program has an even wider impact through the curriculum and outreach materials they produce and share, and through broadening the participation of groups underrepresented in STEM.  Most students who go through the program continue in STEM-related careers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;UAT projects will address major outstanding problems in astronomy and cosmology, such as the number and origin of optically-dark dwarf galaxies, the structure of large-scale filaments, pre-processing of HI gas outside clusters, and star formation in low-metallicity systems.  All of these programs are enabled by and make use of the ALFALFA (Arecibo Legacy Fast ALFA) HI survey, as well as new observations.  The main components of the program are (1) an annual workshop at either Arecibo Observatory or Green Bank Observatory; (2) observing runs at these and other radio and optical facilities; (3) summer and academic year undergraduate research projects; (4) collaborative research among faculty and students at the member schools.  The broader impact also has 4 main components: (1) enhancement of undergraduate education through direct involvement in research; (2) enhancement of educational infrastructure; (3) broad dissemination of curriculum and outreach materials; and (4) broadening participation of underrepresented groups.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   Empowering Research by the Undergraduate ALFALFA Team (UAT) is a collaborative, multi-faceted program of faculty and undergraduate research at a consortium of 23 diverse U.S. institutions. The UAT advances discovery while promoting teaching, training, and learning via direct involvement of undergraduates in basic ALFALFA research. The College of St. Scholastica?s participation included one faculty member and one undergraduate conducting research over two summers. These individuals worked to reduce and analyze spectroscopy of the HI hydrogen 21cm line using data taken at the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico.  St. Scholastica participated in the UAT workshop held at Green Bank Observatory in West Virginia in early summer 2017, where the student researchers from across the consortium worked interactively to learn about radio astronomy, star formation, and structure in the local universe. They also learned how to reduce, analyze, and interpret HI spectroscopy. The St. Scholastica team had the opportunity to participate in observations with the Green Bank Telescope on site, obtaining more data for the project.  Over summer 2017, the St. Scholastica undergraduate reduced around 150 spectra and determined HI integrated line fluxes and central frequencies for all detected sources, which were then converted into HI masses and galaxy velocities. These results are part of a larger dataset that the UAT is using to investigate galaxy infall onto the Pisces-Perseus Supercluster. This research was presented by the St. Scholastica undergraduate student at the January 2018 American Astronomical Society conference held in Washington, DC.  Over summer 2018, we used machine learning algorithms (specifically, gradient boosting regression implemented in python) to predict the cold gas content of galaxies based on their fluxes, compactness, and colors at UV, optical, and IR wavelengths. The St. Scholastica undergraduate student presented preliminary results to the wider UAT group. Our proof-of-concept shows it is possible to achieve improved accuracy over the previously utilized heuristic method which can provide the UAT consortium with better ability to optimize their future radio telescope target selection and exposure time calculations.  One goal of the UAT project is to reach undergraduates at a variety of institutions and from a variety of backgrounds, introducing them to a world they may not know exists and broadening their perspective of potential careers, particularly STEM careers. The St. Scholastica undergraduate who participated in the UAT went on to do an REU over summer 2019, enabled and inspired by her UAT experiences, and is considering graduate school.

An initial version of the paper is available on the public astronomy preprint server.  Overall, St. Scholastica participation in the UAT met the key program goals of participating in the annual UAT workshop, observing at national radio observatories, conducting collaborative research projects, and providing training and development of undergraduate student skills.
