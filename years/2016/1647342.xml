<AbstractNarration>In order to reduce time-to-market and development costs, families of safety-critical software systems are increasingly developed as product lines. Examples include the software in medical devices, airplanes, assistive robots, and self-driving vehicles. Product lines provide structured reuse of a wide range of software artifacts including requirements, architecture, design, code, and test cases.  For safety-critical product lines, a safety case must be constructed for each product to provide evidence that it is safe for use. Constructing these safety cases is time-consuming and slows industries? time-to-market of new products. This project develops a solution for product lines that partially automates the construction of a product?s safety case from existing software artifacts and that guides the developer through the needed safety analysis and refinement steps. The goal of the project is to reduce the cost and effort of developing a safety case while leveraging product-line reuse to increase the quality and safety of delivered products. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ability to reuse variability-aware safety assets can transform the way manufacturers of safety-critical product lines analyze the safety of their products and construct safety cases. Solutions are evaluated on real-world product lines with industrial collaborators. The underlying traceability techniques and tools, developed under this grant, will benefit a broad set of software-intensive systems by addressing the ongoing problems of trace link evolution and safe reuse.  The project cross-trains students in traceability, software safety and product lines, and produces training materials to encourage transition to practice of the solutions developed.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Highly dependable systems, such as pacemakers, medical infusion pumps, and caretaker robots, are frequently developed as software product lines (SPL).  SPLs are epitomized by the strategic reuse of existing assets to reduce cost and enable faster time-to-market.  However, SPLs also introduce well-known safety-related risks, such as the risk that a feature that was deployed successfully in a previous product might experience safety-related faults when used in a new product.   Teams building safety-critical software products are therefore required to perform a rigorous hazard analysis to identify potential faults and to select and apply mitigations. They must also construct either a formal or informal safety case which provides claims, arguments, and evidence to demonstrate the safety of the product, typically to a government certification body.   In practice, most organizations reconstruct safety cases from scratch, primarily because there are no systematic processes or supporting tools available to facilitate reuse.  To address these problems, this project developed rigorous and safe processes for systematic reuse of safety-related artifacts to enable the dynamic composition of safety cases from existing assets.    A core part of the work focused on techniques for detecting the impact of change upon known system hazards.  Algorithms and tools were created to dynamically generate hazard slices from artifacts stored in common software engineering repositories.  The slices visualized exactly how each hazard was mitigated in the system.  As the system evolved, the delta between two versions was visualized making it quick and easy for developers to explore the impact of change upon existing hazards.  This task is particularly important given that new faults are often introduced when a system changes.  Common problems were encoded as change patterns. As an example, the case in which a requirement has been replaced without any corresponding changes to the design, code, or test cases represents a potentially unsafe change pattern. Warnings and recommendations are raised whenever a pattern is detected, to allow the engineer or developer to assess the safety impact.  A user study showed that developers found the visualization helpful for evaluating safety in a changing product and a clear improvement over current state of the practice.  By establishing links from elements of the hazard tree to fault trees and other assets it is also possible to evaluate the impact of change upon other safety assets.   The project addressed a specific problem associated with environmental assumptions.  Every system operating within the real-world makes assumptions about that world.  For example, a small Unmanned Aerial System (sUAS) might assume the GPS (global positioning) to be accurate within one meter, but if that assumption were incorrect then a collision could ensue.  Environmental assumptions must be stated and checked in new products. The funded work proposed algorithms for detecting missing, modified, or new environmental assumptions, so that warnings could be raised and engineers could assess their impact upon system hazards.  The work also delivered an approach for achieving reuse of safety assets through composability. The Safety Assurance Case (SAC) was split into different parts representing an Infrastructure level SAC and a product-level SAC, which could be interlocked to create a complete SAC.  The approach provides flexibility while enabling reuse of shared (infrastructure-level) components. The infrastructure can enforce runtime monitoring, allowing the behavior, performance, and reputation of each individual product to be checked with respect to its runtime requirements.  The approach was applied to the application domain of unmanned aerial vehicles (products) flying in a shared urban airspace (infrastructure); however, the notion of composability could be applied to other product-line environments.  Additional work focused on building a safety-critical product line for multi-sUAS emergency response scenarios.  The goal is to provide an exemplar project and its environment to support and advance research in the evolution of safety-critical product lines.   Numerous graduate and undergraduate students have had research opportunities this this research project.       Last Modified: 09/28/2020       Submitted by: Jane L Huang]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
