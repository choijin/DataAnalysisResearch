<AbstractNarration>Civil infrastructure systems are among the largest local, state and Federal investments, and these infrastructure systems are critical to U.S. economic, environmental, and social outcomes. Engineers design some types of infrastructure to have useful lives of 30 to 50 years or more, and many systems are operated decades beyond their planned lives without major upgrades. The inherent uncertainty about local extreme events in the future affects the design of robust infrastructure management strategies, resulting in tradeoffs between the desire for high-resolution climate projection data by stakeholders and the potential design consequences from false precision. This research will fill this knowledge gap through a cross-disciplinary collaboration to create translational science reconciling the data needs of the engineering community to the projections of extremes generated by the climate science community. This research will a) characterize the change and uncertainty in precipitation and temperature extremes for 21st century engineering designs, b) analyze adaptive engineering designs and robust strategies for transportation infrastructure and c) develop risk communication recommendations to increase adoption of these strategies by infrastructure designers and managers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research develops an integrated, replicable approach for generating and using information about 21st century precipitation and temperature extremes for robust infrastructure designs. The approach recognizes and accounts for uncertainty and complexity in interdependent environmental and technological conditions. The anticipated outputs of this research will be methods advances for infrastructure design and management concepts and communications under 21st century extremes to enable stakeholders to maximize lifetime performance for resilience to extreme events. Results of this research will be broadly disseminated to academic, practitioner, and stakeholder communities, as well as incorporated into educational activities to prepare the next generation of engineers.</AbstractNarration>

Engineers design some types of infrastructure to have useful lives of 30 to 50 years or more, and many systems are operated decades beyond their planned lives without major upgrades. The inherent uncertainty about local extreme events in the future affects the design of robust infrastructure management strategies, resulting in tradeoffs between the desire for high-resolution climate projection data by stakeholders and the potential design consequences from false precision. This research helped fill this knowledge gap through a cross-disciplinary collaboration to create translational science reconciling the data needs of the engineering community to the projections of extremes generated by the climate science community. This research helped a) characterize the change and uncertainty in precipitation and temperature extremes for 21st century engineering designs, b) analyze adaptive engineering designs and robust strategies for infrastructure and c) develop recommendations to increase adoption of these strategies.<br /><br />This project found there are considerable uncertainties across downscaled climate projection data sets, and these uncertainties can affect infrastructure designs and performance. The research developed an analysis approach that recognizes and accounts for uncertainty and complexity in interdependent environmental and technological conditions. The research developed a framework that can guide the revision of engineering design standards, as well as engineering practice, through the use of publicly available downscaled climate model outputs of future precipitation. By applying the framework, stakeholders will be able to define relevant aspects of the historical method that need to be updated, select the relevant climate data sources and extract output, manage model reliability and bound uncertainty, adjust for spatial and temporal resolution, and apply results to engineering design under climate nonstationarity. The framework developed can serve as a guide for agencies and civil engineers to update current infrastructure design standards to incorporate future nonstationary trends. The research also developed an index to characterize risks of stormwater infrastructure under current and future climate change within and across states. Another project output is an open data set analyzing five publicly-available downscaled data sets for the continental U.S. The research advances infrastructure design and management concepts and communications under 21st century extremes to enable stakeholders to maximize lifetime performance for resilience to extreme events. <br /><br />The research was broadly disseminated to academic, practitioner, and stakeholder communities, as well as incorporated into educational activities to prepare the next generation of engineers. Several graduate and undergraduate students were trained through this project, and they developed the interdisciplinary skills to become future leaders, researchers, and practitioners. The project enabled deep interdisciplinary collaboration and connections between Carnegie Mellon University and the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR). Two Carnegie Mellon PhD students spent summers at NCAR as research fellows, which resulted in co-authored publications between these institutions. The project produced more than nine journal papers, a published open data set, more than twenty conference presentations, and multiple engagements with stakeholders.<br /><br /><br />Intellectual Merit: The research developed an integrated, replicable approach for generating and using information about 21st century extremes for robust transportation infrastructure designs. Particular intellectual challenges in the work include testing the relevance of various levels and methods of climate downscaling for infrastructure decisions, and characterizing the uncertainty across multiple time series of climate projections. The work is highly relevant to multiple research domains including civil and environmental engineering, infrastructure management, climate science, policy analysis, and resilience planning.<br /><br />Broader Impacts: Longstanding underinvestment in infrastructure has resulted in the poor condition of much of U.S., and infrastructure reinvestments will also need to perform well under a changing climate. The research helped create new knowledge to deepen understanding and expand capabilities to ensure infrastructure reinvestment includes robust management of 21st century extremes. The outputs were also incorporated into Carnegie Mellon?s engineering courses on climate change adaptation for infrastructure.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 01/11/2021<br>      Modified by: Constantinos&nbsp;Samaras</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1635638/1635638_10445292_1610347422658_imee1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1635638/1635638_10445292_1610347422658_imee1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Uncertainties across downscaled data sets"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1635638/1635638_10445292_1610347422658_imee1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Uncertainties across downscaled data sets"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Project found there are considerable uncertainties across downscaled climate projection datasets, and these can affect infrastructure designs and performance.Project developed an open data set analyzing five publicly-available downscaled data sets for the continental U.S.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Tania Lopez-Cantu, Andreas Prein, and Constantine Samaras</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Creative Commons</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Constantinos&nbsp;Samaras</div> <div class="imageTitle">Uncertainties across downscaled data sets</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1635638/1635638_10445292_1610347260592_imee12--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1635638/1635638_10445292_1610347260592_imee12--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Evaluating stormwater standards risk under climate change"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1635638/1635638_10445292_1610347260592_imee12--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Evaluating stormwater standards risk under climate change"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Research found some states have more stringent stormwater engineering standards than others within the same climate region</div> <div class="imageCredit">Tania Lopez-Cantu and Constantine Samaras</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Creative Commons</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Constantinos&nbsp;Samaras</div> <div class="imageTitle">Evaluating stormwater standards risk under climate change</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1635638/1635638_10445292_1610347177550_imee2--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1635638/1635638_10445292_1610347177550_imee2--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Evaluating rainfall changes over time"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1635638/1635638_10445292_1610347177550_imee2--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Evaluating rainfall changes over time"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Research evaluated differences between old and new rainfall depths in engineering standards</div> <div class="imageCredit">Tania Lopez-Cantu and Constantine Samaras</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Creative Commons</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Constantinos&nbsp;Samaras</div> <div class="imageTitle">Evaluating rainfall changes over time</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
