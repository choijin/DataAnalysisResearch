<AbstractNarration>The Artic Research Consortium of the U.S. (ARCUS) will administer and implement, "Teachers and Researchers Exploring and Collaborating (PolarTREC)", an international program that brings together U.S. teachers to participate in cutting-edge field research with polar scientists in various, and often remote, locations in the Arctic and Antarctica. Through hands-on field experiences in the Arctic and Antarctica, participating teachers (pre-service and in-service) will improve teaching strategies, develop resources for their careers, and change how they teach STEM in the classroom. The program goal is to invigorate polar science education and understanding by bringing educators and polar researchers together in professional collaboration. By integrating research and education, PolarTREC will help sustain and grow the considerable scientific and public enthusiasm for polar research and education. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ARCUS will support a total of twelve teachers for Arctic field seasons in 2017 and Antarctic field seasons in 2017/2018. ARCUS will recruit, select, and match teachers and researchers, maintain a website for dissemination of information about the expeditions, provide orientation training for the teachers that includes field safety and communication training, provide travel support for the teachers to meet with scientists prior to deployments and for them to join the scientific expeditions in the field, and evaluate results of the program. Dissemination efforts via the website and public presentations are expected to reach many additional teachers, students, scientists and the public.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>U.S. students' academic achievement in science continues to lag behind that of their peers in other countries. Research indicates that one way to improve student outcomes is to put highly trained and confident science teachers in classrooms. To that end, Arctic Research Consortium of the United States (ARCUS) has developed a teacher professional development program that provides teachers with an authentic research experience. PolarTREC<em>-</em>Teachers and Researchers Exploring and Collaborating, is a professional development opportunity that pairs U.S. middle and high school teachers with scientists that conduct research in the Arctic and Antarctic, to provide an authentic hands-on research experience. The program goal is to invigorate polar science education and understanding by bringing educators and researchers that work in the polar regions, together in professional collaboration. PolarTREC seeks to sustain and grow the considerable scientific and public enthusiasm for polar research and education.</p> <p class="Pa0">In 2017-2018, ARCUS recruited, selected, and matched 11 classroom teachers with research teams conducting research in the Arctic and Antarctica. Of the 11 teams, 8 were in the Arctic and 3 were in Antarctica. The selected teachers were from around the U.S. and taught at a variety of school settings, including urban, rural, public and private schools. The research they participated in was very also varied and ranged from studying jellyfish in the Bering Sea, Alaska to gathering data from the Automated Weather Stations in Antarctica.</p> <p>Communicating science and making it accessible to "all" can be challenging in remote settings. To help share the experience, the PolarTREC website (<a href="http://www.polartrec.com">www.polartrec.com</a>) is designed to share information as well as assist the teachers in their professional development and outreach activities. Each research expedition has its own page that includes journals written by the teachers for their audiences, photos, comments, and links to resources created by the teacher (e.g. lesson plans, webinars). Additionally, there is a back side to the website for the program participants which includes training modules, additional resources, and planning tools related to their professional development.

Analyzing and interpreting data Using mathematics and computational thinking Engaging in argument from evidence Developing and using models Obtaining, evaluating, and communicating information Asking questions and defining problems Students of PolarTREC teachers reported a statistically significant improvement in content knowledge about general science practices and about Polar science topics like tundra systems, ocean systems, and ice and snow knowledge. Researchers reported that the PolarTREC program was beneficial to the scientific process of their projects.
