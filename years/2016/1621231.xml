<AbstractNarration>The 2016 JSM Diversity Workshop and Mentoring Program will take place during the Joint Statistical Meetings (JSM), July 31 - Aug 3, in Chicago, Illinois.  It will consist of a series of interactive career development sessions and small group and 1-1 mentoring sessions. The goals are to establish critical mentoring and networking relationships for minority statisticians at early- to mid-career levels, to motivate students to pursue careers and graduate study in the statistical sciences, to share best practices for recruiting and retention of minority students, faculties, and non-academic professionals, and to increase the active participation of minorities in the American Statistical Association and other professional statistics societies or organizations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Participants in the workshop and mentoring program include underrepresented minority graduate students in statistics or biostatistics programs; top minority undergraduates in statistics, mathematics, or related disciplines; minority statisticians in academia, government, and the private sector; key faculty from minority-serving institutions who advise and mentor undergraduates in math and related disciplines; and faculty influential in the faculty and/or student recruitment processes at their home institutions. This program is unique in that it does not limit its focus to students, but also includes early career professionals in its scope. It is further unique in its holistic approach which allows individuals to mentor more junior colleagues while themselves being mentored by more senior colleagues.  These elements help create a community of support and accountability for the career success of all involved.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop's website is located at: http://community.amstat.org/cmis/events/dmp</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The 2016 JSM Diversity Workshop and Mentoring Program took place Sunday, July 31 through Wednesday, August 3, 2016 at the Joint Statistical Meetings in Chicago, Illinois.  Approximately 86 individuals, including 20 protege/mentor pairs, participated in the program. The full day Sunday workshop began with a keynote given by Dr. Dubois Bowman, Chairman and Professor of Biostatistics at Columbia University?s Mailman School of Public Health, who spoke from the topic "Paving the Way in the Big Data Era."  Keyout outcomes emerged from the panel presentations. These outcomes are summarized in the following narrative. Since many of the participants were also presenting at JSM, follow up and continued discussion took place for the duration of JSM.   A panel of successful statisticians in academia, government and industry offered advice for career success and responded to questions from a highly engaged audience.  The role of mentoring throughout one?s career was a prominent theme.   A panel of current and recent graduate students, as well as select faculty members, offered candid feedback and advice to current students.    Dr. Brian Millen (Lilly) facilitated a discussion on the importance of trust in workplace relationships, potential cross-cultural barriers to trust, and tools for giving and earning trust in the workplace.  The session consisted of case studies and discussion of practical applications.  Leaders from ASA shared the many opportunities to get involved in service to the profession through ASA and other societies.    Ric Weibl, retired Chief Learning Officer for Association for Women in Science, offered foundational principles for effective networking, including practical tips for networking at conferences and the use of online networking tools such as LinkedIn.  This included tools for evaluating your current network and identifying areas for growth.  A panel of academic leaders who have been very successful in recruiting and retaining diverse students and faculty shared advice on successful approaches.   Dr. Sonia Ruiz, psychologist, facilitated discussion on potential barriers to success (such as stereotype threat) for members of underrepresented groups, along with means to overcome these barriers.  Participants in the 2016 JSM Diversity Workshop and Mentoring Program provided ratings for each Workshop (Sunday) session. Ratings were on a scale of 1=Disappointing to 5=Great.  A summary of ratings for each day is provided below.  Session - Mean Rating, Median Rating  Overall - 4.8, 5  Career Success: Tips and Traps - 4.7, 5  Graduate School Success - 4.5, 5                        Dynamics of Trust - 4.3, 5                               Interview and Career Search Tips - 4.9, 5            ASA: More than Just JSM - 4.3,4.5                        Strategic Networking - 4.8, 5                                  Follow-up from the program has revealed enduring relationships between mentors and prot&eacute;g&eacute;s.
