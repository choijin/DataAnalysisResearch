<AbstractNarration>Proposal: 1643087&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title: The 13th U.S. Korea Forum on Nanotechnology: Brain Inspired Computing and Nano Biomimetics for Energy &amp; Water Sustainability- Sept.26-27,2016, Seoul Korea&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PI: John Myung&lt;br/&gt;Institution: Carnegie-Mellon University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Workshop Goal:  To empower a common platform for scientists and engineers from both countries to accommodate urgent technology contribution brain-inspired computing and sustainable Water &amp; Energy (WE) technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nontechnical:&lt;br/&gt;This Forum will actively encourage partnerships in nanotechnology for novel computer architecture and WE sustainability to have a huge impact in nanoscience, in addition to strengthening achievements and assessing the progress on recommendations made during the previous Forums. We also aim for exchanging young scientists, including the graduate students. The Forum proceedings and findings will be published on Carnegie Mellon website,  and will be available to a broad audience in addition Published as a special issue journal publication.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical:&lt;br/&gt;The novel contribution of this Forum is its ability to bring together a bi-national community of expert researchers and innovators who are working on the leading edge of brain-inspired computing and nano-biomimetics for sustainable WE. The proposed forum will simulate efforts to promote nanotechnology for the next generation by fully utilizing nanotechnology convergence and biomimetric methods. The outcome will lead to milestone for the timely technology. Along with the exchange of ideas among the leading scientists and engineers in nanotechnology area, this Forum will recommend timely new paradigms in this field for the next decade and promote collaborative initiatives between the two countries. This Forum will contribute to society, and the global environment and econo.</AbstractNarration>
