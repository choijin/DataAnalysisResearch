<AbstractNarration>This NSF EAGER award addresses two of the National Academies' fourteen grand challenges in engineering and aligns with the Common Guidelines for Education Research and Development report from the Institute of Education Sciences, U.S. Department of Education, and  National Science Foundation. As an exploratory research project, the project seeks to establish initial connections (e.g., improvement of sleep quality and/or duration) to the outcome of interest (e.g., increase in number of underrepresented minority and women college students majoring in STEM fields, particularly noted "brilliance" fields of bio-/biomedical/neural engineering, or entering STEM careers. This project builds on existing educational research and theory by examining factors or conditions that mediate or moderate the relationship between learning outcomes and presents a unique intervention in underrepresented college student populations for increasing interest in bio-/biomedical/neural engineering careers to inform future practice, design, and development in increasing the number of underrepresented students majoring in STEM fields.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Extant research has shown that variable sleep schedules, going to bed thirsty, environmental noise, and worrying while falling asleep contribute to poor sleep quality. This corpse of research has also demonstrated that college students' knowledge of sleep hygiene is related to sleep practices, which is closely associated with overall sleep quality. Participation in sleep education programs has been associated with significant improvements in children's and young adult sleep and academic performance. Using a mixed method, experimental research design, this project tests the ability of a sleep intervention to increase non-STEM majors' interest in STEM fields and their engagement in a STEM course based on sleep quality and/or duration. Further, this project will test the ability of a sleep intervention to increase interest in STEM fields/careers among African-Americans and women, who are current non-STEM majors. Finally, this project includes an educational plan, incorporating engineering into biology and behavioral neuroscience undergraduate research and education in an effort to significantly advance the interests and strengthen the academic attractiveness of underrepresented groups to bioengineering graduate programs and bioengineering workforce engagement.</AbstractNarration>

Research supplies, training, and conference attendance were provided to 18 undergraduate students. Research stipend support (in addition to research supplies, training, and conference attendance) was provided to 16 undergraduate students majoring in STEM fields. Thirty-two (32) out of 34 of the students are minorities underrepresented in their respective STEM fields. All but five of the students are women. We received over 1200 survey responses from students in various STEM courses over multiple semesters and multiple years. Further, students received in-class education on electrical engineering and bioengineering techniques, particularly in electrical engineering and agricultural engineering technology courses, biology, chemistry, physics, and computer science courses. This material was also presented in more general terms in courses for non-STEM majors. In each of the courses where the engineering education module was presented, the goal was to foster a sense of belonging, continued STEM motivation, and relevance, particularly for underrepresented and underserved populations regardless of the STEM courses they were engaged in. Initial feedback concluded that the connection to an issue of broader societal relevance was effective in encouraging students to remain in STEM, particularly in engineering majors of relevance, and for students who were non-STEM majors to consider STEM fields. We had students switch their majors to STEM fields and two switched to electrical engineering technology. Numerous undergraduate students presented research data and information at national conferences. Four students completed their senior research projects through work on this project and one student was awarded her master's thesis degree through her work on this project. Three journal articles, two book chapters, and a follow-up grant application was submitted because of this project.
