<AbstractNarration>NSF 1637214 RAPID: Using an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle and Increased Autonomy to Improve an Unmanned Marine Vehicle Lifeguard Assistant Robot&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The United States is at risk for a mass marine casualty event, such as the Costa Concordia, or MV Sewol ferry sinking, but fortunately robots, such as the EMILY tele-operated unmanned marine surface vehicle (USV) can assist as mobile life preservers. EMILYs are now in use by the Hellenic Coast Guard and Red Cross throughout Greece. The responders have requested that EMILY navigate autonomously so that a lifeguard could designate a cluster of people in the water and then EMILY would autonomously drive to the victims in the water who would grab, hold, and wait while the human lifeguards focused on other people needing immediate assistance due to unconsciousness, risk of hypothermia (especially children), or high distress. Prof. Robin Murphy will engage 44 graduate and undergraduates in implementing an upgrade to EMILY so that it can use the view from a small tethered UAV combined with onboard thermal sensing to autonomously navigate to a cluster of people. The project will bring 11 of these US students to Greece for two field research expeditions to work with lifeguard teams actively responding to the shifting, but ongoing, patterns of boat refugees. The students will participate in two international workshops. The National Technical University of Athens (NTUA) is a partner in this research activity, and will be providing thermal imaging expertise. The project will introduce the students to participatory research with international collaborators in Greece, and train them to be technically competitive in an innovative, global workplace. It will potentially save lives in Greece and Europe, and ultimately  contribute more effectively in search-and-rescue missions in the U.S. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This 9-month project will involve 5 graduate students and 39 undergraduates in field robotics research. The students will address how to navigate and reach poses in waves and surf with a non-holonomic, under-actuated marine vehicle that cannot back up, has momentum, and a limited turning radius. They will employ known behavioral sensor fusion methods for reliable and efficient navigation targeting people using thermal imagery. They will collect data from the smart EMILY in the field with responders in uncontrolled weather and waves and make additional rounds of appropriate improvements and evaluation. Finally, the project will produce a longitudinal case study of how to work with users. The research will advance the theory of intelligent robotics-- especially interoperable and reliable computer systems, unmanned marine systems in shallow littoral operations, tethered unmanned aerial systems, heterogeneous teams, and human-robot interaction-- by implementing and field testing promising algorithms and known principles. The participating American students will be globally competitive, the data will give US companies a competitive edge, and the project will serve the use of autonomous systems in accordance with US and international regulations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant was funded by NSF Directorate of Computer &amp; Information Science &amp; Engineering (CISE), and Office of International Science and Engineering (OISE).</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Over 4,500 migrants have drowned in the Mediterranean Sea this year, Al Jeezera computes this as 14 deaths a day or one every 100 minutes. &nbsp;Since January 10, 2016, the Texas A&amp;M Engineering Experiment Station&rsquo;s Center for Robot-Assisted Search and Rescue has been assisting the Hellenic (Greek) Coast Guard and Hellenic Red Cross in preventing refugee drownings with two Hydronalix EMILY unmanned marine vehicles. EMILY is a miniature teleoperated jet-ski covered with a flotation device sufficient to support five people. EMILY It is in operation by beach lifeguards in 10 countries to quickly reach people trapped in rip currents and to transfer a line to boats or kayaks trapped on rocky shores. To date, EMILY was used by Hellenic Coast Guard patrol boat 618 in February 2016 to pull refugees washed up on inaccessible rocks in high seas to safety. Patrol boat 618 could not get close enough to the trapped refugees without EMILY; the high seas were so extreme that one of the Coast Guard sailors fell overboard and the Captain was severely injured rescuing the sailor. The Hellenic Coast Guard, Red Cross, and volunteer life guard teams have used EMILY to escort dozens of boats carrying over 500 refugees to safe shores.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>This ongoing project added autonomous capabilities and an aerial robot, Fotokite, to amplify what lifeguards can do in marine mass casualty events. Lifeguards normally work with one to two other lifeguards plus an EMILY to save one or two people (3:1 ratio) but now are trying to save 50 people (1:16 ratio) at a time. &nbsp;&nbsp;Under funding from the National Science Foundation and private donations, we are implementing artificial intelligence capabilities. These capabilities are enabling the lifeguards to task EMILY to autonomously go to a group of refugees who are in a lower degree of distress, freeing the lifeguards to spend their time and attention on people who are at higher risk of drowning. Texas A&amp;M students have programmed autonomous navigation capabilities and increased the lifeguard&rsquo;s confidence in EMILY by adding a return to home upon loss of signal. A Fotokite tethered UAV, provides situation awareness. Lifeguards can designate victims to assist on the UAV video feed and the UAV can direct EMILY to autonomously navigate to them. The UAV can be easily flown from a response boat and will automatically drift and move with the boat, requiring no attention. Moreover, its tether can provide unlimited power. Added LTE networking capabilities allowed incident commanders at a recent disaster exercise with the US Coast Guard to see streaming video from EMILY&rsquo;s and the Fotokite&rsquo;s cameras over 100 miles away.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 10/03/2017<br>      Modified by: Robin&nbsp;R&nbsp;Murphy</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1637214/1637214_10432568_1507041852407_summerInstitute--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1637214/1637214_10432568_1507041852407_summerInstitute--rgov-800width.jpg" title="2016  Summer Institute"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1637214/1637214_10432568_1507041852407_summerInstitute--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="2016  Summer Institute"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">2016 Summer Institute where EMILY is being tested to autonomous navigation to multiple victims.
