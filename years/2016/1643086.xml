<AbstractNarration>This award provides funding for US participation in the conference entitled, "Conference on Mathematical Results in Quantum Physics," to be held in Atlanta, Georgia, with events at Georgia Tech and Emory University on October 8-11, 2016. The interaction between mathematics and quantum physics dates from the very beginning of quantum theory, and to this day it continues to provide fundamental ideas for both mathematics and physics. Among many significant implications for physics, mathematical analysis helps to understand physical and electrical properties of large-scale matter, nanoscale devices, and atoms and molecules.  The growing field of quantum information provides new mathematical challenges together with potential applications to area outside mathematics and physics.  The latest developments in each of these topics will be recounted at the meeting, and made available afterwards through a proceedings volume and archiving of selected talks and events.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This conference focuses on recent developments in Analysis, especially in the subfield of mathematical physics. Cutting edge research will be presented on topics such as quantum mechanics with random features, quantum mechanics on graphs, many-body systems, statistical mechanics, and quantum information science. In addition, a number of speakers have been asked to discuss new mathematical challenges currently arising in theoretical physics.  This award gives early-career researchers, researchers who are members of underrepresented groups, and researchers who are not funded by NSF an opportunity to attend and participate in this conference. The organizing committee will strive to make this funding opportunity known to target groups. More information can be found at: http://qmath13.gatech.edu.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Conference on Mathematical Results in Quantum Physics (QMATH) was a major international meeting bringing scientists in from 25 countries to Atlanta to exchange progress in the mathematics of quantum phenomena, including quantum mechanics with random features, quantum mechanics on graphs and similar structures, many-body systems and statistical mechanics, Quantum information, and new mathematical topics arising in current theoretical physics.  Both established leaders and selected young researchers made plenary presentations.  In addition there was a public-science event, by R. Benguria, on the legacy of Maxwell.   One year later, selected speakers and organizers were invited back to give updates on progress in these fields and help plan for future meetings.  In half of the cases the visitors returned in pairs to address a coherent subject from different persectives.  These "Quolloquia" were advertised widely in the Atlanta area and in one case took place in Birmingham.   At least one related meeting proposal has been funded for 2019, by the American Institute of Mathemaitcs, as a result of the Quolloquia.  The QMATH meeting made creative use of web resources, and videorecordings continue to be available through a Georgia Tech respository., SmarTech  Finally, a refereed conference proceeding volume was published by the American Mathematical Society: Mathematical Problems in Quantum Physics, Contemporary Mathematics 717.
