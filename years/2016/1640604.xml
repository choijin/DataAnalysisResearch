<AbstractNarration>In order for our nation to maintain its competitive edge, it is imperative that we increase the number of qualified STEM professionals and that those who do graduate from our programs enroll in high-quality courses, taught by engaging and knowledgeable faculty, about topics relevant in the 21st century. In order for higher education faculty to maintain their skills in this rapidly changing world, opportunities for professional development must be abundant, cost effective, and meaningful. This project represents a first step in achieving a goal of ubiquitous professional development for faculty who seek to improve their pedagogical skills or who seek to branch out into a new area of endeavor. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Chautauqua professional development workshops for university faculty resulted from a successful program that operated for nearly two decades. Over the project duration, thousands of faculty received vital training in up-to-date research topics and educational practices. The Chautauqua series also played an important role for investigators who sought to broaden the impact from their funded projects. The original Chautauqua series ceased in 2007 due to various factors. Through this project, a model for a cost effective and sustainable 21st century version of the Chautauqua program is being developed.  This model takes full advantage of internet-based conferencing and collaborating technologies, including MOOC-like approaches, to reduce cost and increase impact. The model for the second generation of Chautauqua short courses to be developed through this project will serve as a resource for the implementation of a comprehensive professional development strategy for higher education faculty into the future.  Faculty who are from underrepresented groups or who are teaching in programs with significant enrollment of underrepresented students are being targeted for participation, meaning that this project could serve to broaden participation in STEM.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

Specifically, the project studied the efficacy of three modes of professional development delivery:  face-to-face, synchronous online and asynchronous online.  The results revealed that face-to-face professional development is the most preferred by participants and presenters and also the most effective.  However, there are many barriers, primarily financial and geographical, that limit the ability of interested people to actually participate in face-to-face professional development.  These is a willingness by both presenters and participants to engage in some form of online professional development.  However, the results of this project suggest that the appropriate technology and delivery mechanism do not yet exist and need further development. Additionally, the project conducted an extensive survey of computer science and engineering Professionals about professional development. The survey identified barriers and facilitating factors for the participation in professional development activities for computer science and engineering professionals.
