<AbstractNarration>In this EArly-concept Grant for Exploratory Research (EAGER) project, the team conducts research leading to software design tools for automated and reconfigurable robotic systems that manufacture at the nano scale. They define these systems as Wafer-Scale Nanofactories.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The key ingredient in realizing this vision is full automation of the production of millimeter scale robots, and the ability to install and reliably operate a few hundred such robots on the nanofactory wafer. Before physically building the nanofactory, users will design and optimize its layout using assemblable building blocks through a novel software design tool - NanoLRM. This tool utilizes Lean Robotic Micromanufacturing (LRM) principles, through which tradeoffs related to resource allocation, precision requirements, production yield, rate and cost can be judiciously studied. Specifically, the following work is part of this project: modelling assembly, motion, and processes uncertainties using interval analysis, to select and simulate precision-based planners and controllers in the nanofactory, and employ parametric optimization tools for cost, yield and production rate trade-off studies.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This EAGER project was conceived as a vehicle to jump start collaboration between micro-nano robotics and manufacturing experts at University of Louisville and University and Texas at Arlington, and planning experts at Georgia Tech Research Institute. The collaboration lead to breakthrough research on new software tools that model and utilize uncertainty in assembly process optimization.   The goals of this grant were to develop new software tools and apps for manufacturing at micro and nano scales using modular robots. Applications include future wafer-scale microfactories that will employ large numbers of microrobots. As a case study, we modeled and simulated the operation of a workcell containing AFAMs (Articulated Four Axis Microrobots) that cooperatively manipulate carbon nanotubes.  Our research led to formulating and validating a new modeling approach for parallel and flexible robots that was coded as a public repository using the Robot Operating System (ROS) framework. In the future, the resulting apps can be used to simulate microrobots working cooperatively, and can be deployed directly on future microrobotic hardware.  Another major contribution was the formulation of  a motion-primitive planning system that employs set-theoretic action predicates to simultaneously reason about capabilities, constraints, and uncertainty. Such a planner can be used to scalably program microrobots for microfactory applications. To our knowledge, this is the first time that task planning advances enabled by the new IEEE RAS P1872-2015 Ontologies for Robotics and Automation standard have been employed for manufacturing at the micro and nano scales.   Front-end apps such as Microguard were also created to analyze tradeoffs in yield, cost and throughput of modular robotic assembly cells. Simulations work in tandem with 3D printed robotic modular hardware that can be reconfigured for various assembly applications.  7 publications, including 3 joint publications were submitted during this 2 year grant to international journals and conferences. The research of 4 doctoral students, 3 masters students and 2 undergraduate engineering students was supported in part by this grant.  A software repository written in C++ was made publicly available to the community. We hope that this software will be used and extended by others to simulate and visualize parallel and flexible microrobots.  Microfabrication and microassembly activities at University of Louisville were also strengthened as a result of this grant. Two REU students recruited through NSF's NNCI REU Site at University of Louisville have worked on cleanroom fabrication of AFAM components, while the Nexus microassembly platform for MEMS components was set up at the Next Generation Systems Group laboratory.  Two startup companies, one in Arlington, Texas, and one in Louisville, Kentucky are currently on route to commercializing assembly planning and microrobot technology with tools enabled in part by this grant.
