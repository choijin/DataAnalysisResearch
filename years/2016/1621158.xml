<AbstractNarration>With National Science Foundation (NSF) support, the Archaeometry Laboratory at the University of Missouri Research Reactor (MURR) is a world leader in compositional analysis of archaeological materials like ceramics, chert, obsidian, and metals. Such chemical analyses are essential pieces of evidence used by archaeologists to investigate the technology, economics, social and political organization, identity, and religious practices in ancient societies. Understanding past human behavior can inform modern efforts to address issues such as population movement, resource exploitation, group interaction, and internal group social stress.  The long-term success of the Archaeometry Laboratory has resulted in an unparalleled database of artifact and raw material chemical compositions that greatly enhance the explanatory power of future analytical studies as well as provide the raw material for large-scale research projects using existing data. The laboratory is able to support a wide variety of projects and numerous students, researchers, and visiting scholars every year, and contributes to knowledge diffusion through close scientific collaborations between MURR staff and outside researchers, student education, and professional publications. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The MURR Archaeometry Laboratory focuses on elemental and isotopic analysis in order to examine the production, exchange, and movement of a broad variety of artifacts including ceramics, lithics, and metals, using neutron activation analysis (NAA), X-ray fluorescence (XRF), and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) including a laser ablation system and a multi-collector. The laboratory also supports geochemical research on the petrogenesis of various igneous, metamorphic, and sedimentary rocks. Broader impacts of the Archaeometry Laboratory at MURR include: (1) availability of affordable chemical and isotopic analyses for students and faculty from academic departments in the US; (2) training of undergraduate and graduate students in the selection and use of laboratory methods of analysis; (3) advice in project design, statistical analysis, and interpretation of the chemical and isotopic data; and (4) public access by archaeologists, geologists, and scientists from many disciplines to the compositional database.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Archaeometry Laboratory is unique in that we are the only laboratory in the world making access to three of the most powerful analytical techniques (NAA, XRF, and ICP-MS) possible for archaeologists. Large-scale research projects addressing significant archaeological questions are addressed through access to these multiple techniques and the funding support from NSF.   In addition to our efforts to make chemical analysis more affordable, the Archaeometry Laboratory is involved in training visiting researchers and students from the University of Missouri and other academic institutions concerning research design, sample preparation, and interpretation of the chemical data obtained from analysis of archaeological samples.  Projects submitted to the Archaeometry laboratory undergo an internal and external review to ensure proper integration of research questions, sample design, and analytical techniques.  During the three-year grant period, more than 100 faculty and graduate students submitted over 22,000 archaeological samples to the Archaeometry Laboratory for investigation by one or more of the available analytical techniques. This work has produced more than 75 publications as either journal articles or book chapters, and supported more than 20 new graduate theses in anthropology, archaeology, geoscience, and chemistry. The total number of archaeological samples in our geochemical database now exceeds 200,000.  The majority of these data are available for use by archaeologists and other researchers from around the world.  Some of the broader impacts of NSF support to the Archaeometry Laboratory include raising the profile of archaeological science through public lectures and direct involvement of undergraduate and graduate students from the University of Missouri and other institutions in the application of analytical techniques to archaeological science.  This training is preparing students for careers in archaeology, chemistry, forensic science, cultural resource management and other disciplines where collaborations across disciplines are important.  Finally, the Archaeometry Laboratory is better preparing undergraduates in these disciplines for advanced graduate work.  The Archaeometry Laboratory at MURR continues to provide arguably the greatest publication to cost ratio of any long-term program funded by NSF, and these research results continue to further understanding of the natural world and the role of humans in it &ndash; both past and present.
