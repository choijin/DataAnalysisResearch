<AbstractNarration>This award provides support to enable US. students and lecturers to attend the fourth "Biennial African School on Fundamental Physics and its Applications" in Kigali, Rwanda 1-19 August 2016. The schools are based on a close interplay between theoretical, experimental, and applied physics, and Grid computing. They cover a wide range of topics: particle physics, particle detectors, astro-particle physics and cosmology, computing, accelerator technologies, medical physics, condensed matter, light sources and their applications. The participating students are selected from all over Africa and beyond. Scientists from Africa, Europe and the USA are invited to prepare and deliver lectures taking into account the diverse levels of the students. The duration of the school allows for networking -- interactions among students and between students and lecturers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This effort will expand the scope of existing collaborations; bringing more African, American and European researchers and students together. An explicit goal of this School is to promote collaboration with Africa. US students and faculty will be involved.&lt;br/&gt;This proposal significantly leverages the support of domestic and international organizations including: the NSF (MPS/PHY division and OISE), ICTP, IN2P3, INFN, CERN, DESY, Brookhaven and other National Laboratories and the American Physical Society.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ To increase the capacity in Africa to participate in this exciting field of particle physics, and to profit from the applications and technologies developed alongside it, the African School of fundamental physics and its application is offered every two years. The forth school of African School of Fundamental Physics (ASP) series was held August 1 &ndash; 19, 2016 in Kigali, Rwanda, on the campus of the University of Rwanda. This outcome report covers the grid computing portion of the school which occurred in the last week of ASP2016.  These sessions covered a range of topics related to Grid computing theory and applications in conjunction with a large fraction of time dedicated to hands-on practice.     The six lecturers of this session are from U.S. institutions which employ OSG software stack and play significant role in the forefront of continued grid computing software development. OSG provides in-kind support by permitting many of the lecturers? times paid through their own funds independent of the specific ASP funding.   Total of 6 sessions of about 12 hours throughout one and a half day of the third week were devoted to grid computing technology.  The configuration of the lectures was as follows;  High Throughput Computing and HEP Technical Introduction to High Throughput Computing Running HTC jobs locally with Condor: Hands-on as shown in Fig. 1 Lecture on Condor More on HTC with Condor: Hands-on Introduction to Grids and Workflow Systems Running Jobs with DAGan The Grid and Its Use in Workflow Systems Introduction to Analysis Example &amp; Tutorial Analysis job examples: Tutorial and hands-on Strategies and Technologies for Handling Large Workflows Wrap-up and pointers to further exercises    Students were led through a variety of exercises that showed basic concepts of Distributed High-Throughput Computing, such as sustained computation, reliability, and workflow management.  While many of these concepts were new to most students, they began to pick up on the concepts and to understand how these computing resources could be used to further their own research.  The final example was to use a program called ROOT to do an analysis of actual data from the LHC at CERN in Switzerland.  The exercise showed just a small part of the massive workflow that the ATLAS experiment uses to analyze their dataset, and students were able to see the results on their computers.  All of the student respondents to post-grid school survey said they would recommend hosting another Grid computing portion in future ASP?s. Half the students rated their personal improvement to be 4 or greater on a 5-point scale. The students expressed an overall satisfaction with the helpfulness of the materials.  The survey question for grid school materials revealed that the students learned most from hands-on exercises but the Twikis needs improvements for ease of understanding and better work flow. All the exercises are available to the students to work through after the school. Special care was taken to communicate to students how to contact DOSAR and OSGrid for aid in utilizing or starting their own grid computing node from their home universities. Thus far, three students have contacted DOSAR to join in meetings. These students are from Senegal and Kenya, with a group at the University of Nairobi expressing special interest.  The computing grid school at ASP2016 has proven again to be one of the most popular classes for the participating students and regarded as a program that provides important skills for the participants.  The continued support from NSF allowed the US lecturers to leverage it to draw additional in-kind support from their own institutions and enabled NSF to provide full supports for three students.    The ASP2016 program cleared helped students explore fundamental nature of the universe and its forces and promoted deeper understanding of the origin of the universe. In particular, the characterization and deeper understanding of dark matter and dark energy that make up over 95% of the universe and a fuller understanding of the symmetry breaking mechanism. The program aksi introduced state of the art technologies in high throughput, high performance and high availability computing that are essential to modern scientific experiments.  The advanced grid computing technology introduced in ASP2016 may be immediately used for other areas of scientific research and education, in addition to a wide range of sectors in society. This school helped to establish a greater pool of highly technical human resources in sub-Saharan African countries and promoted close collaboration with U.S. in academic and scientific research.  In conclusion, given these proven successes of grid computing school in three consecutive ASP series, it is clear that the strong support from NSF for offering grid school at ASP enables US to maintain leadership in disseminating and training of the application of the grid computing, the NSF supported OSGrid to African continent and continue strengthening the relationship with these important countries for the future.
