<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to expore the commercializtion potential of NSF funded research on nanocomposites based on butyl rubber. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nano-composites have potential for numerous versatile applications including coatings, adhesives, pharmaceutical stoppers and medical devices. The rubber nanocomposites are recyclable, eliminating waste during device manufacturing and after use. A similar rubber nanocomposite is used as a coating on drug eluting stents, generating billions of dollars in revenue which further highlights the commercial potential.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Butyl elastomer, a copolymer of isobutylene with a small amount of isoprene, has outstanding low temperature properties and very high damping, but has very high creep without crosslinking.  It is likely that a blend of poly(styrene-isobutylene-styrene) thermoplastic rubber and butyl elastomer, reinforced with nanofillers such as carbon, silica or iron oxide, would be promising nanocomposites for a broad range of applications.  Future potential improvements include replacing the polymer mix with a single poly(alloocimene-isobutylene-alloocimene) thermoplastic rubber. This project will explore market development and commercialization for various potential blends and applications.</AbstractNarration>
