<AbstractNarration>This project entails the organization and execution of a conference on the issue of women in astronomy.  As its name implies, this is the fourth in a series of conferences over a period of two decades.   While the number of women astronomers has increased over that period, women are still underrepresented in the science.  This conference will address these issues, and build on the success of past meetings.  It will also set the framework for continuing meetings of this topic in a more regular way.  The American Astronomical Society will organize these future meetings.  The current meeting is expected to take place after the American Astronomical Society meeting in July 2017.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A key component of this conference is support for participants who would not normally be able to attend such a meeting:  students and early-career professionals.  These are the target demographic to attend such a meeting, so their inclusion is vital.  The support provided for the workshop will ensure that those most in need will be able to attend.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dissemination of the conference proceedings will ensure that best practices provided by conference presenters will be shared to a broader audience.  Goals for follow-on meetings will be formalized, and this workshop will form the basis for future activities designed to ensure a more equal environment for students and practitioners of astronomy.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Women in Astronomy IV: The Many Faces of Women Astronomers, a conference sponsored by the National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO) and the American Astronomical Society (AAS), with support from the National Science Foundation (NSF), took place June 9 - 11, 2017, following the 2017 AAS Summer Meeting in Austin, Texas. Funding under the NSF grant supported the participation of typically underrepresented women and minorities in STEM, and specifically, the field of astronomy.  Through extensive use of workshops, panels, and small group discussions, WIA IV focused on issues that affect a broad spectrum of women in astronomy. WIA IV addressed challenges specific to women, and what institutions can do to create welcoming, equitable workplaces.  Intellectual Merit  WIA IV was designed to contribute to understanding of issues related to the climate and barriers for women as an underrepresented group in the field of astronomy. The meeting included workshops and sessions designed to encourage discussion of issues faced by women in astronomy, at all career levels, and to facilitate the production of White Papers that can inform policy decisions related to the development and maintenance of an appropriate climate for women in astronomy.  Broader Impacts  The WIA IV meeting was designed to be inclusive in both content and participation. All members of the astronomy community were invited. Those represented at the meeting (177 registered participants) included students, administrators, data analysts, software engineers, educators, education and public outreach professionals, engineers, technicians, and others who contribute to the field of astronomy.educators, education and public outreach professionals, engineers, technicians, and others who contribute to the field of astronomy.  Significant Results:  Importantly, the WIA IV meeting directly addressed the issue of broadening participation of women and other underrepresented minority (URM) groups in astronomy-related fields. Funding provided by this grant supported participation of 30 URMs &ndash;specifically, students and early career professionals- in the meeting and workshops. URM students and early career professionals were invited to submit requests for travel grants; these requests were reviewed by a sub-committee of the Organizing Committee (OC). Nearly all requests were funded, covering airfare, mileage, hotel, and registration costs, as needed (Figure 1).  Key outcomes of other achievements:  Four papers and reports were prepared in consultation with WIA IV participants:  Inclusion and Access in Universities and Research Institutions Graduate Admissions in a Post-GRE World (WIA IV White Paper) Providing a Timely Review of Input Demographics to Advisory Committees Benefits &amp; Rights: Supporting Academic Workers   The meeting website (go.nrao.edu/wiaiv) will remain live, and serves as a record of the WIA IV meeting.
