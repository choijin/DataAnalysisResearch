<AbstractNarration>This award supports graduate student participation at four workshops presented by the Association for Women in Mathematics (AWM) during major US mathematics meetings in 2016-2018. These meetings are the annual meeting of the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics in 2016 (held in Boston, MA) and 2017 (held in Pittsburgh, PA), and the Joint Mathematics Meetings in 2017 (held in Atlanta, GA) and 2018 (held in San Diego, CA).  These Meetings Workshops will bring the rising women stars and current mathematical leaders together with graduate students and recent graduates from a variety of fields in pure and applied mathematics. By creating a rich intellectual community centered on shared research interests, the activities promise to generate new mentoring relations, new research collaborations, and increased activity in the associated research areas. Such relationships can lead to a lifetime of professional success. Moreover, these events at highly visible national meetings benefit the entire mathematical community by showcasing the excellent mathematical work done by women.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each Meetings Workshop has a research focus derived from a prior AWM Research Collaboration Workshop, a week-long event where participants work together on open research problems. At the Meetings Workshops, leaders in each research field will introduce younger mathematicians to a deeper understanding of the field and its connections with their own work. Graduate students will, in turn, share their research during poster sessions and small group interactions. The research topics that will be highlighted in the next four workshops include Dynamical Systems with applications to Medical Problems;  Number Theory;  Numerical Partial Differential Equations; and Noncommutative Algebra. These topics span a broad spectrum of current mathematical problems, and will correspondingly enhance the future careers of many young women mathematicians.  For more information on the first two conferences, please see https://sites.google.com/site/awmmath/programs/workshops/SIAM-workshop and https://sites.google.com/site/awmmath/programs/workshops/jmm-workshop.  This award is jointly funded by the Infrastructure, Algebra and Number Theory, Mathematical Biology, and Computational Mathematics Programs within the NSF Division of Mathematical Sciences.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The purpose of the Association for Women in Mathematics is to encourage women and girls to study and to have active careers in the mathematical sciences, and to promote equal opportunity and the equal treatment of women and girls in the mathematical sciences. The AWM workshop is designed with the goal of increasing the visibility of women in mathematics by providing an opportunity for early-career women, including graduate students, to present their work at a national conference. Networking events facilitate interactions among graduate students, postdocs, faculty and other professional mathematicians.   Financial support provided by the NSF was used to provide travel funding for graduate student to participate in workshops at four national meetings in 2016, 2017 and 2018: the annual Joint Mathematics Meetings (JMM) and the annual Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics (SIAM). The students were able to present research posters, attend the AWM special sessions, the AWM career panel, and participate in the AWM mentoring program and luncheon.
