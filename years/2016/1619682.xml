<AbstractNarration>The objective of this grant is to provide travel support to graduate and undergraduate students in the field of industrial engineering to enable a selected cohort of students to attend the 2016 Industrial and Systems Engineering Research Conference (ISERC), to be held in Anaheim, California, May 21-24, 2016. The ISERC is a major venue for US and international researchers in both academia and industry to showcase research results and exchange ideas. As such, the ISERC provides an excellent opportunity for students to broaden the impact of their work. By attending the conference, students will have the opportunity to explore the frontiers of industrial and systems engineering research. The ISERC will also enable students to network with peers, mentors, potential employers, and future collaborators. In addition, a select subset of students will participate in the doctoral colloquium hosted by the Council of Industrial Engineering Department Head (CIEADH) and the IIE. These students will have the opportunity to listen to leaders in the field of industrial engineering speak on a variety of topics. The ISERC also provides students with the opportunity to publish their work in the high quality conference proceedings, indexed by ProQuest. Furthermore, this grant will support the broader participation of students from underrepresented groups at the conference.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The award will help stimulate broader student attendance and participation at the 2016 ISERC. The student travel grant program will subsidize travel expenses of approximately 30 students who plan to attend the 2016 ISERC. These travel grants will be awarded through a competitive process and thus receipt of these travel awards will be considered an honor by the recipients. Applications will be evaluated by an evaluation committee consisting of three conference program chairs, along with one additional member nominated by the Council of Industrial Engineering Academic Department Heads. Selected students will have the opportunity to attend the conference and to participate in activities specifically designed for students. By attending the conference, students can present their research, attend tutorial sessions on advanced and emerging research methods, attend panel discussions on research frontiers, participate in student paper competitions, and explore research and industry-focused career paths. In addition, the Applied Solutions Conference, which showcases industrial engineering solutions to real-world industrial problems, is being held concurrently with the ISERC 2016. This joint conference provides an opportunity for students to network with potential employers, to explore collaborations and to become familiar with potential applications for their future research.</AbstractNarration>

The conference offered various activities specifically designed for student attendees. By attending the conference, students presented their research, attend tutorial sessions in a variety of areas in order to learn advanced research methods, attend panel discussions on a variety of topics, participated in a variety of student paper competitions, and explored research frontiers and alternative career paths. For graduate students, the conference provided a doctoral colloquium, pre-conference workshops, networking receptions, best student paper awards from a variety of tracks, and a best dissertation award from the Institute of Industrial and Systems Engineers (IISE).</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>This NSF travel grant was highly competitive as we have received more than 140 applications and awarded only 30 grants with $500 each from NSF funds and another $500 from their respective departments. We received more than $38,000 pledge from various Industrial Engineering department heads as matching funds. Out of these 30 students, 11 of them are undergraduate students. With the generous support from this grant, 30 student awardees were able to present their papers at the conference, networked with international researchers from both academia and industry, shared their on-going research, discussed future research topics, and exchanged ideas. The ISERC provided an excellent opportunity for these students to network with peers, mentors, potential employers, and future collaborators.
