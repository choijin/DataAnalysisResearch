<AbstractNarration>1605290&lt;br/&gt;Cusick&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Waters that are salty, not to the extent that sea water is, present a new source of water for beneficial use in many areas and cost efficient methods for treating them are a high priority. The proposed research and educational activities will advance the sustainability of brackish (salty) groundwater and reclaimed wastewater desalination by establishing an integrated multi-scale modeling and experimental framework for capacitive desalination technologies. Research will pursue financially viable desalination strategies with renewable carbon resources and will focus on overcoming knowledge gaps that limit our ability to design energy efficient and cost effective membrane capacitive deionization systems. This framework will be leveraged to teach undergraduates and high school students about water scarcity, sustainable water management and freshwater production through desalination. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Reducing the energy intensity of freshwater production, while increasing water recovery, from reclaimed and saline sources will be critical to minimizing economic costs and environmental impacts. The overall goal of this work is to increase access to renewable freshwater resources in water stressed regions by addressing existing economic and energetic barriers to brackish and reclaimed water desalination. By coupling freshwater and brine production to capacitor electrode charging and discharging respectively, membrane capacitive deionization systems have the potential to remove ions from water near the thermodynamic limit of desalination, requiring far less energy than reverse osmosis. Producing potable water from low salinity sources (i.e., brackish water and reclaimed wastewater) is currently economically infeasible in most areas due to energy, maintenance and brine disposal costs of reverse osmosis. This research seeks to address critical barriers currently limiting membrane capacitive deionization, a potentially low cost and sustainable alternative to reverse osmosis, by developing novel electrode geometries and operating schemes within an integrated modeling and quantitative sustainable design framework that links microstructure composition, reactor design and operation decisions to predictions of treatment efficacy, freshwater production costs and environmental sustainability. The hypothesis is that capacitor-based deionization may enable energy efficient and cost effective production of freshwater from brackish and reclaimed water. The objectives of this proposed work are: i) to uncover mechanisms of electrochemical energy loss in membrane capacitive deionization systems through integrated modeling and experimentation; ii) to develop novel high performance electrode morphologies that address major energy loss mechanisms; iii) to develop a membrane capacitive deionization process model calibrated to the limits of technology for energy and water recovery; and, iv) to establish a path forward for membrane capacitive deionization development by integrating the process model into a quantitative sustainable design framework that integrates environmental, economic, and performance metrics under uncertainty.</AbstractNarration>
