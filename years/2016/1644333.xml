<AbstractNarration>A graph signal is a signal in which relationships between its components follows the structure encoded in a weighted graph. The purpose of graph signal processing is to exploit this underlying structure to analyze and process graph signals. The last few years have seen significant progress in the development of theory, tools, and applications of graph signal processing. The Graph Signal Processing (GSP) Workshop is a forum intended to disseminate ideas to a broader audience and to exchange ideas and experiences on the future path of this emerging field. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main goal of the funds requested in this proposal is to facilitate the participation of students by providing a limited number of travel grants. The recipients of the travel awards will be selected by the organizing committee among students who apply for them and who are principal authors of papers presented at the workshop. These awards will be based on merit (e.g. novelty of the research) but also on distance. We expect to provide a $500 travel awards to 20 students.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This award supported travel for 17 graduate students to attend the Graph Signal Processing Workshop which was hosted by the University of Pennsylvania on May 25-27 2016.  The first day of the workshop was devoted to tutorial/overview presentations by senior researchers in the area of Graph Signal Processing (GSP). In the next two days the program consisted of oral presentations and poster sessions, where researchers (including postdoctoral researchers and graduate students) were able to present some of their recent work.   The workshop was single-track, in order to facilitate interactions, and most of the oral presentations were recorded in order to maximize dissemination of research presented at at the workshop.   The complete program along with videos of the talks and the corresponding slides can be found in the following link:  https://alliance.seas.upenn.edu/~gsp16/wiki/index.php?n=Main.Program   While work in GSP research is published in major conferences and journals, the goal of this workshop was to bring together most active researchers in this community to a single much smaller meeting in order to facilitate interactions.   Thanks for the NSF funding there was substantial student involvement in the workshop, including both senior students, who are already active in GSP, and junior students who did not have work to present but were interested in learning more about this field.  The workshop was very successful and led to numerous interactions between researchers. There is a plan for a second edition in 2017.
