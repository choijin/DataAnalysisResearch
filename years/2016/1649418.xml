<AbstractNarration>The University of Wisconsin-Madison will organize a workshop for REU Site Program Directors who are currently funded thru the NSF Division of Biological Infrastructure. The workshop will be held on March 28-April 1, 2017, in Arlington, VA. The goal is to share best practices and discuss important issues associated with training undergrads in the REU Site program, including designing program evaluation, enhancing mentoring experience, implementing strategies for successful recruitment of underrepresented groups, communicating scientific results to stakeholders and the public, preparing undergrads for all types of careers in STEM, and others. An existing website (www.bioreu.org) will be used for registration and submission of abstracts for the poster session scheduled at the beginning of the workshop.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop will bring together approximately 140 REU Program Directors and three plenary speakers with expertise in selected areas covered by the workshop. A Planning Committee, comprised of members of the BIO REU Leadership Council, will be formed to ensure representation by a diverse group of Program Directors and institution types at the workshop. The Planning Committee will gather input from attendees on the selection of plenary speakers, topics of discussion, and format of workshop sessions. A Final Report will be produced and disseminated to the entire BIO REU community. An online survey will be administered immediately following the workshop to assess the effectiveness of the workshop. The results of this evaluation will be included in the Final Report to be submitted to NSF. More information is available by contacting the PI, Dr. Janet Branchaw at branchaw@wisc.edu.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ A workshop for the Principle Investigators (PIs) of the Biology Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site programs was held in April of 2017. The theme of the 2017 Bio REU PI workshop, "Enhancing and Strengthening the REU Experience Through Program Evaluation and Effective Communication." The major goal of the workshop was to help Principle Investigators improve their REU programs by learning from expert speakers and from one another.  During the workshop there were structured networking activities and panels, including orientation activities for new PIs that cultivated and engaged the experiences of long-time PIs, plenary presentations given by experts, small breakout group discussions where PIs engaged the plenary topic and generated recommendations, and poster presentations that highlighted best practices in REU programming.  Overall the workshop served to build community among the BIO REU PIs, enhance diversity across the BIO REU programs, support excellence in mentorship across the BIO REU programs, and train PIs to use existing tools and resources to enhance their programs. In particular, PIs reviewed the common assessment tool that they are using to evaluate their programs and provided feedback to the Leadership Committee regarding future modifications of the survey tool. Nearly all Bio REU sites were represented at the workshop, with 124 attendees.  Key recommendations from the Bio REU community were generated at the completion of the workshop. These included 1) adoption of a new platform for a common assessment tool and 2) inclusion of and feedback from the PI community in a project to develop a tracking system for REU program student alumni.
