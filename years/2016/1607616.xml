<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award: DMS 1607616, Principal Investigator: Ruth Charney&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mathematics is used to model physical systems and to analyze data sets.  Increasingly, these models take the form of geometric objects. This project focuses on a class of geometric objects that arise as models in a number of contexts, including robotics and genetics. Geometric properties of these models and their symmetry groups are reflected in properties of the physical systems. Questions may involve either local geometry (what happens near a particular point) or large-scale geometry (the structure of the object viewed from a distance). This project concerns large-scale geometry.  By introducing a new notion of a "boundary" for the geometries in question, we are able to identify and quantify certain types of behavior, known as hyperbolic behavior.  The study of these boundaries, and their implications for the geometry and symmetry of the objects in question, is the main theme of this project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Boundaries of geodesic metric spaces have played an important role in the study of hyperbolic groups, for example in proving rigidity theorems and dynamical properties.  Boundaries can also be defined for CAT(0) spaces, however they are not quasi-isometry invariant, hence do not give a well-defined boundary for a CAT(0) group.  In recent work, the principal investigator and Sultan introduced a new boundary, called the Morse boundary, for CAT(0) spaces which is quasi-isometry invariant and behaves more like the boundary of a hyperbolic space. Subsequently, Cordes generalized this construction to obtain a Morse boundary for any proper geodesic metric space.  This offers a potentially powerful new tool for studying large classes of groups, such as acylindrically hyperbolic groups.  The first part of this project will investigate properties of these boundaries and their implications for the groups in question.  The second part of the project concerns automorphism groups of right-angled Artin groups (RAAGs).  Automorphism groups of free groups, mapping class groups, and linear groups have many properties in common.  Automorphism groups of RAAGs give a context in which to study these commonalities.  As Teichmuller space has been central to the study of mapping class groups, Culler and Vogtmann's Outer space has been a fundamental tool in the study of automorphism groups of free groups.  Similarly, analogues of the curve complex of a surface have been introduced for free groups and shown to be hyperbolic.  The second part of this project seeks to find an analogous Outer Space for RAAGs and to study generalizations of the free factor and free splitting complexes for all RAAGs.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Differential geometry is the study of smooth manifolds with Riemannian metrics.  It underlies our understanding of many phenomena arising in physics, astrophysics, and engineering.  In the 1990?s Mikhail Gromov showed that certain fundamental ideas from differential geometry, such as the notion of negative curvature, could be generalized to much broader classes of metric spaces.  Metric spaces satisfying Gromov?s negative curvature property are known as hyperbolic spaces.  This property has many powerful implications for both the spaces themselves and the groups that act as symmetries on these spaces.  Recently, there has been a major effort to extend the techniques of hyperbolic geometry to more general spaces and groups.  The key strategy is to identify aspects of a space that behave in ways similar to a hyperbolic space.  In previous work of the PI, it was shown that one can encode such hyperbolic-like aspects of a space in a "boundary", called the Morse boundary.  Understanding the structure of this boundary and what it can tell us about the space in question was the focus of the first part of this project.  During the period of the grant, together with various collaborators, we established a variety of new properties of Morse boundaries.  Most importantly, we determined when and how the topology of the Morse boundary determines the underlying metric space.  In addition, we explicitly described the structure of the Morse boundary for some spaces of interest such as graph manifolds and cusped hyperbolic 3-manifolds.   The second part of this project concerned Artin groups.  This is a broad class of groups that include braid groups, free groups, free abelian groups and many others.  These groups arise naturally in many contexts and have played a central role in low-dimensional topology and geometric group theory.  In this project, we introduced new geometric tools for studying Artin groups and their automorphism groups. Automorphism groups of free groups have been extensively studied using their action on space known as Outer Space constructed by Culler and Vogtmann in the 1980s.  A major result of this project was the construction of an analogous space with similar properties for a large class of Artin groups, known as right-angled Artin groups.  In addition, we made progress on proving some long-standing conjectures about more general Artin groups using the action of the group on a non-positively curved cube complex.   The project also provided opportunities for training graduate students and mentoring recent PhD recipients. Four graduate students (two of them female) completed their PhD?s on topics related to this project and a fifth will complete his this spring.  The PI has put considerable effort into supporting students and early career mathematicians and increasing diversity in the field, working both within her university and through public events. She helped organize and participated in numerous workshops for early career mathematicians.  In several of these she gave mini-courses on topics related to this project.  She also served on panels focused on mentoring and professional development, several of which were aimed specifically at increasing the participation of women in mathematics.  She continues to be very involved in professional organizations, having served as President of the Association of Women in Mathematics and currently as President-elect of the American Mathematical Society.
