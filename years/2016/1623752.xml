<AbstractNarration>During November 16-17, 2015, a rare tornado outbreak produced at least 17 tornadoes in Texas, Oklahoma, and Kansas, including an Enhanced Fujita (EF) EF3 tornado, which damaged a group of engineered structures at an oilfield services facility near Pampa, Texas and nearby engineered center-pivot irrigation system structures.  Structural resistances for these structures can be estimated, enabling the estimation of tornado wind speeds associated with the damage.  This Rapid Response Research (RAPID) project will investigate tornado wind structure and estimated wind speeds through three-dimensional (3-D), digital data preservation of the tornado damage to the oilfield facility and irrigation system structures.   Preservation of this 3-D structural damage data will enable future researchers to validate wind-damage prediction models, via physical modeling, computer modeling, and other predictive damage modeling (for example, loss estimation and risk assessment modeling).   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using a suite of remote-sensing data collection methods, the project team will rapidly collect high-resolution, 3-D structural damage data through photography and photogrammetry, laser scanning, unmanned aerial vehicle visual imaging, and satellite imaging.  The data collected from this project can serve as the basis for collaborative, multi-disciplinary studies emphasizing the accurate and highly detailed preservation of structural damage from tornadoes, heightened understanding of the complex wind structures of tornadoes, validation or refinement of tornado wind speed estimates, and development of more resilient infrastructure.  Undergraduate students will participate in data collection and then use this data to collaborate on future research alongside graduate students and faculty researchers from three institutions, thus training future leaders in the mitigation of natural hazards damage.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ BACKGROUND  Tornadoes are known to produce some of the strongest winds on earth; however, a sufficient understanding of the magnitude, frequency, and structure of these winds has not yet been obtained. Gaining this knowledge is critical for emergency planning and engineering designs that enhance life safety and minimize damage.  Direct measurements of tornado winds are rare and difficult to obtain, and it is thus necessary to use proxy methods (most notably wind damage to structures) to estimate tornado wind speeds. These tornado wind speed estimates are necessary for the production of safe designs that protect lives and property.  On November 16-17, 2015, an intense tornado outbreak severely damaged a group of engineered structures at the Halliburton Oilfield Services facility east of Pampa, TX.  The Halliburton facility contained multiple types of engineered structures for which structural resistances could be estimated, thereby enabling the estimation of tornado wind speeds required to cause the observed damage. Due to safety and security concerns, the facility owners prohibited access to the facility, so that it was not possible for investigators to make contact measurements or conduct close-range forensic investigations of the damaged structures. The facility owners were agreeable to the research team acquiring photographs and lidar scans from the fence line and to the use of unmanned aerial systems above the property. To collect this critical damage data, it was therefore necessary to utilize remote-sensing platforms.     The major goals of this project are:  to rapidly preserve      perishable evidence of damage to engineered structures caused by a severe      tornado, using multiple remote-sensing (i.e. non-contact) measurement and      recording platforms, to facilitate future investigations of      tornado-structure interactions as well as estimations of wind speeds      causing these damages for use in validating or revising wind speed estimates      in the Enhanced Fujita (EF) Scale of tornado intensity; to rapidly preserve      a visual record of contents and locations in the debris field extending      approximately 1 mile downwind of the Halliburton facility to facilitate      future investigations of debris flight and tornado actions; and to archive the      evidence and make it available to other researchers through the NHERI      DesignSafe-ci system, to facilitate the validation of tornado loss models,      debris-flight models, and further studies of tornado-structure interaction.      INTELLECTUAL MERIT  The resulting data have served as the basis for collaborative, multi-disciplinary studies emphasizing the accurate and highly detailed preservation of damage scenes; heightened understanding of the complex wind structure of tornadoes; validation or refinement of tornado wind speed estimates employed in the EF Scale; inclusion of new damage indicators in the EF; and development of more resilient infrastructure.    Preservation of 3-D damage scenes enables researchers to validate wind-damage prediction models, via physical modeling, computer modeling and other predictive damage modeling (e.g., loss estimation and risk assessment models). Preservations using remote-sensing platforms minimize collection times, costs, and efforts and also facilitate forensic structural engineering investigations whenever access is limited due to safety and security concerns.   These data also promote the investigation of rapid remote-sensing-based damage assessments using a variety systems and platforms and can serve as a basis for future comparative research examining the utility of various view angles, platforms, and image resolutions which will facilitate progress toward automated damage assessments. Each platform has potential use in preservation of damage conditions for all types of wind storms and in the rapid, automated detection of wind damage.      BROADER IMPACTS   This endeavor has advanced the natural hazards research emphases in three university programs: the WTAMU School of Engineering, the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, and the Texas Tech University National Wind Institute. This endeavor has substantially benefitted WTAMU?s young and growing undergraduate engineering program by supporting growth of a long-term, multidisciplinary research program.  The project has been of significant benefit to WTAMU in providing a basis for an NSF Major Research Instrumentation Grant for acquisition of a terrestrial laser scanner (2016), as well as a basis for the CAREER Award for PI Dr. Womble (2018). The data acquired for this project also provided a basis for an internal grant from the WTAMU Killgore Research Center for acquisition of PhotoModeler Scanner digital photogrammetry software. The project has involved participation from 4 undergraduate engineering students. Other undergraduate students have been exposed to the effects of severe wind loading through integrated presentations in structural analysis courses.  Middle- and high-school students as well as junior-college students have been exposed to the effects of tornado actions through the WTAMU Engineering Summer Camp and "Discover WT" recruitment events. Regional STEM teachers have also been exposed to the project through a presentation session at the Panhandle Math-Science Teachers Conference. The project has helped to elevate the education of students by exposing them to undergraduate research opportunities at WTAMU and graduate research opportunities at major research institutions.
