<AbstractNarration>Amidst today's data explosion, demand for computing power is accelerating, and the energy requirements for solving critical problems in science, engineering, business, and intelligent processing are increasing dramatically.  In order to address this critical issue, the scientific and engineering community is beginning to explore new approaches to computing, such as mimicking the brain's structure or the dynamical behavior of coupled particles.  However, implementing these approaches with conventional computer architectures is highly inefficient from both energy and computing standpoints. As a result, there is a pressing need to develop revolutionary computer architectures that overcome these severe roadblocks. An ambitious program is to be pursued within the framework of this project in which light, rather than electrons, is used to realize new computing paradigms with superior energy scalability. Specifically, computing architectures will be explored that exploit the wave nature of light (i.e., its amplitude and phase) harnessing the remarkable advancements over the past decade in nanofabrication of complex photonic chips with thousands of high-performance devices. These photonic platforms would have the potential to be computationally powerful, operate with unparalleled energy efficiency, and are scalable and highly reconfigurable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To fulfill this vision of energy efficient photonic computing, the proposed research efforts will focus on the following two types of photonic processors: (1) Ising Machine and (2) Neuromorphic Computing Machine.  The unifying aspect of these photonic processors is that they consist of dynamic networks of coupled photonic units and rely on the wave nature of light to solve problems which has no analogy in electron-based computing systems. Beyond developing new types of optical processors, photonics technology will be developed as the cornerstone of future computer systems.  A novel architecture will be explored that integrates photonic processors and interconnects with electronic memory and processors to maximize the benefits of each technology. Research will also be undertaken to map complete, challenging problems to combinations of photonic accelerators and electronic processors, and to determine how to best scale them to maximize full-system performance.  By innovating at all levels of the system - from devices to architectures including systems, compilers, and algorithms -  the project would aim to achieve advances that cannot be realized within any single field.</AbstractNarration>

Another architecture that was studied was an integrated silicon photonic matrix multiplier for deep neural network (DNN) applications that can multiply an N?N matrix and a vector of dimension N. While DNNs are widely used for many artificial intelligence applications, the training and inference involve intensive matrix multiplications, resulting in high computational complexity. The target co-designed system was able to accelerate matrix multiplications using silicon photonics. Lastly, reconfigurable photonic interconnects were investigated as scalable and efficient solutions to enable efficient use of disaggregated memory resources for deep-learning computations. The proposed architecture utilizes a ?lite? (de)serialization scheme for memory transfers via optical links to avoid network overheads and supports the dynamic allocation of remote memories to local processing systems with constant reconfiguration latency. An experimental testbed with a processing system and two remote memory nodes using silicon photonic switch fabrics were created and evaluated. The results demonstrated the potential of integrating the photonic switched optically connected memory to state-of-the-art processing systems. The students funded by this program have been exposed to a wide range of science and engineering associated with our research effort on developing a photonic computing system. These areas include nonlinear photonics, photonic devices, nanofabrication, and computing architectures.       Last Modified: 05/26/2021       Submitted by: Alexander L Gaeta]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
