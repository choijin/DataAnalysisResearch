<AbstractNarration>Imaging in the millimeter-wave to terahertz (mmw-THz, 30GHz-3THz) region of the electromagnetic spectrum provides a new dimension to the investigation and perception of the world around us.  Millimeter wave imaging has been extensively used for threat detection at airports and for scientific discovery in radio astronomy to identify particles in gas clouds thousands of light years away.  Terahertz imaging has shown a new means to investigate biological tissues, in particular in tumor screening. While the scientific and societal benefits are enormous, the field of mmw-THz imaging is still in its infancy. A particularly acute challenge is that it is impractical to integrate a large number of mmw-THz sensors on a circuit board, because the size of each "pixel" must be at least proportional to the wavelength. Unfortunately, using a single sensor or small number of sensors renders current mmw-THz imaging systems far too slow. In this work we will investigate a new method for mmw-THz imaging that uses compressive sensing and a digital mmw-THz configurable lens to provide up to a 32x improvement in resolution or speed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Compressive sensing allows a reduction in the information needed to reconstruct an image, thus enabling optical imagers that require 70-80% fewer measurements. Key to this reduction is the use of pseudorandom spatial modulators, or masks.  In the mmw-THz frequencies, however, such spatial modulators do not exist, due to the size of each modulator "pixel" needing to be at least proportional to the wavelength. Consequently, mmw-THz has not been able to leverage these new approaches. In this project, we will investigate a transformative solution to mmw-THz imaging by combining several research areas. First, photon induced dynamic spatial modulators will be used for mmw-THz frequencies. Second, advanced compressive sensing algorithms will reconstruct high fidelity images from a reduced number of measurements. Third, multi-sensor arrays will accelerate the image acquisition, and signal processing algorithms will account for the shared structure of the image being acquired by all the sensors. The resulting system has the potential to provide speeds of 50-100 frames per second and greatly increased signal-to-noise ratio.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merits  This work investigated compressive sensing in millimeter-wave imagining for a optically reconfigurable lens. During this research we applied approximate-message-passing (AMP), which is an iterative algorithmic framework that converts between(complicated) noisy linear inverse problems and (simpler) denoising problem. We found that less advanced approaches minimized total variation in experimental analysis.   We developed an optical reconfigurable mask using ultra-violet light to create small regions of high carrier density which reflected incoming microwave radiation. These small regions were used to create a compressive sensing pseudo random mask. We compared hard-coded masks using copper masks and the optically generated masks. We found that we could create a &gt;30dB ration of reflection vs. transmission with the optical system.  In performing our hardware experiments, we realized that diffraction was a major issue for millimeter imaging since our compressive sensing masks were on the order of 0.35-0.75 lambda (wavelength of the microwave radiation). This led us to an analysis of diffraction limited compressive sensing. We achieved two key results. The first is that in the absence of hardware limitation, diffraction does not affect compressive sensing performance. However, in the presence of a finite lens and energy capture, diffraction results in a lower signal power and thus high SNR. This affected compressive sensing results and is an important limitation in diffraction limited systems.     Broader Impacts  This work provide new insights into advanced imaging which can be applied to medical, astronomical and security applications. The results of this work show that diffraction limited imaging is not a fundamental roadblock to enable these important application areas.  This work supported the mentoring and education of 5 graduate students and 4 undergraduate students. In addition this work supported 7 publications in peer reviewed conferences and journals.
