<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is that it will benefit healthcare by improving patient outcome and procedural efficiency. While Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is increasingly used to guide interventions, this is challenged by the limited access to the patient inside the scanners. Current practices - either removing the patient and manually inserting the tools or moving the patient to another modality - lengthen the procedures, reduce accuracy, and increase possible trauma. The proposed novel robotic and MRI technologies will address those limitations, enabling performing procedures with the patient inside the MRI scanner. Thus continuous MRI images can be used for diagnostic and therapeutic interventions offering more accurate lesion targeting, shorter procedure times, reduced patient trauma, faster recovery, lower cost, and improved patient outcome. This would transform interventional medicine by improving diagnostic and therapeutic interventions with high impact to patients, their families, and society. With faster patient recovery, this technology will reduce the overall cost of healthcare and enable faster return of patients to the workforce. The novel robotic technologies will generate new positions in R&amp;D and production in medical industries, as well as economic benefits from employing highly skilled personnel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project will develop novel technologies at the intersection of robotics and imaging. The solid-media transmission (SMT) mechanism offers the flexibility of fluidic lines but in a system that is leak-free and less complex and has a more compact power take-off arrangement. The SMT mechanism enables the development of an MRI-compatible manipulator that is adaptable and scalable for use in a wide range of medical interventions, carrying and maneuvering virtually any tool. The proposed research will elucidate the effect of geometric and material parameters on the operation of the SMT mechanism. A prototype SMT-actuated manipulator will be used to demonstrate the functionality of this technology in real-time MRI-guided procedures in-situ and disseminate it with on-site and hands-on demonstrations to clinical venues. Beyond the merit in medical applications, this research enhances scientific and technological understanding by demonstrating an alternative mechanism of remote actuation or local distribution of actuation within a manipulator, which creates the potential to generate novel mechatronic assemblies with applications in automation, oil/gas industries, and aerospace.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>In this STTR Phase I project, GuidaBot pursued the development of a robotic surgical intervention guidance system that is compatible with the strong magnetic field of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanners. Currently, MRI is used to guide various minimally invasive surgical interventions, such as tumor biopsies, laser ablations, and deep-brain stimulation electrode placement. While several MRI guidance systems exist, none enable real-time MR imaging for immediate needle placement adjustments. The objective of the GuidaBot system is to enable physicians to remotely maneuver a needle (or other surgical intervention tools) while simultaneously monitoring the position of the needle on the MRI display. This capability would provide users with greater accuracy of needle targeting compared to current procedures. The key benefits are that doctors can diagnose and treat cancers and other diseases more effectively, and that procedure time can be substantially reduced.&nbsp;</p> <p>Central to the GuidaBot design is a new technology termed &ldquo;solid-media transmission&rdquo;, or SMT, which enables the actuation of robotic manipulators using MRI-safe components. SMT comprises spherical beads and cylindrical spacers contained within flexible tubing/channels, which transmit force generated by electric motors to the manipulator. This core technology enables the robotic device to be fully MRI compatible and fit within the limited space of a scanner.</p> <p>During this STTR Phase I award, we focused our efforts on the following three areas:</p> <p>1. Benchtop Studies were performed to systematically characterize the performance of the SMT mechanism with a custom built one-degree-of-freedom (1-DoF) end effector. We tested different lengths of SMT lines, from 1 to 5 meters long, and different componentry material. The conclusions were that: for any length, SMT under closed loop control exhibits (a) accuracy of better than 0.05 mm, and (b) a settling time of less than 9 seconds. This demonstrates the suitability of SMT to actuate surgical robotics, as well as its potential for other applications beyond interventional medicine.</p> <p>2. An SMT Interventional Robot was prototyped using a 2-DoF manipulator that positions a swivel joint using rotational and translational motion within a plane. The robot is powered by two DC motor drive assemblies, each of which actuate a pair of SMT lines. Each individual DoF exhibited accuracy and response characteristics that were similar to the 1-DoF effector. Two of the 2-DoF manipulators can be stacked, with a needle guide passing through the swivel joints, to achieve 4-DoF motion of the needle.</p> <p>3. An In-Suite MR Electronics unit was developed that includes all the electronics needed to control and track the operation of the robot and acts as a Faraday cage to eliminate electromagnetic interference (EMI) that might affect the MRI data. The electronics unit was implemented so that the processor communicates with the control computer via an optical fiber. The 2-way optical fiber communication solution is critical for the commercialization of the GuidaBot system since it enables placement of the control unit inside the MRI scanner room. This feature eliminates the need for special hardware and filtering to pass electric wires through the wall of the MRI suite; instead, only a thin cable passes through the standard waveguide in the wall of the MR scanner room.</p> <p>This STTR Phase I award enabled the training of several individuals in robotics, computational methods, and medical device commercialization, including 4 graduate students at the University of Houston, and 5 entrepreneurial trainees (1 fellow and 4 interns) within GuidaBot. The results of the GuidaBot studies have been disseminated via journal submissions, conference proceedings, a PhD thesis, and press releases. In addition, GuidaBot won an award at the Texas A&amp;M New Ventures Competition for the best elevator pitch and as a result gained admission to the TMCx accelerator program hosted by the Texas Medical Center (TMC) Innovation Institute.</p> <p>In summary, the GuidaBot technology has the potential to greatly impact the procedures used for minimally invasive neurosurgical interventions. GuidaBot&rsquo;s robotic manipulator technology has the potential to reduce procedure times, improve patient comfort and outcomes, and enable new procedures beyond current capabilities. Due to the versatility of the GuidaBot platform, there is potential for performing a wide range of medical interventions by substituting different intervention tools and support frames. There is also potential for the GuidaBot technology to be applied to non-medical industries due its compact, leak-free actuation and the ability to 3D print manipulators and associated componentry.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 05/29/2018<br>      Modified by: Michael&nbsp;Heffernan</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1622946/1622946_10435721_1527620655005_Figure2--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1622946/1622946_10435721_1527620655005_Figure2--rgov-800width.jpg" title="2-DoF Manipulator"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1622946/1622946_10435721_1527620655005_Figure2--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="2-DoF Manipulator"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Prototype 2-degree-of-freedom (2-DoF) manipulator actuated by solid-media transmission (SMT).
