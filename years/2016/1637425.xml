<AbstractNarration>Proposal summary&lt;br/&gt;We propose to design, fabricate, and experimentally demonstrate a millimeter-scale, continuous-wave THz emitter based on a whispering-gallery resonator that is pumped by a standard telecom-compatible infrared light. Unlike existing THz sources based on nonlinear optical effects, where enhancement of nonlinear optical phenomena is by compressing light into ultra-short pulses our enhancement mechanism is based on multiple recirculation of an IR light in a high quality-factor whispering-gallery resonator enabling efficient THz generation.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit:&lt;br/&gt;The proposed work presents an entirely new perspective on the potential use of whispering-gallery resonators to radically improve the performance of existing THz sources. Theoretical investigations provide a deep understanding of fundamental conversion efficiency limitations of whispering-gallery enhanced THz emitters based on parametric oscillation and difference frequency generation. Additionally, the experimental efforts provide an intuitive insight to practical constraints and solutions to develop proper THz couplers and waveguides.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact:&lt;br/&gt;The success of the proposed research will enable high-performance medical imaging, biological sensing, security screening and chemical identification systems.&lt;br/&gt;Integration of education with research activities:&lt;br/&gt;Undergraduate students and summer interns will be recruited for the research activities, special priority will be given to women and the members of underrepresented groups. New graduate courses will be developed and new teaching modules will be included in undergraduate courses, an update on our research results and educational tutorials will be disseminated to the public via easy-to-navigate web pages, bi-annual seminars and open house visits and scientific demos will be arranged for high school students.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p class="Default">New generation of resonator-based terahertz devices and systems were studied during this research program. In the first phase of the project, novel continuous-wave terahertz emitters based on optically-pumped whispering-gallery resonators were studied. Unlike existing terahertz emitters based on nonlinear optical effects, where enhancement of nonlinear optical phenomena is achieved by compressing light into ultra-short pulses, the enhancement mechanism in this new type of terahertz emitters is through multiple recirculation of an optical pump beam in a high quality-factor whispering-gallery resonator enabling efficient terahertz generation. In the second phase of the project, novel terahertz phase modulators, phased arrays, and beam-steering devices based on resonant vanadium dioxide metasurfaces were studied and unprecedented functionalities for manipulating the spectral and spatial characteristics of terahertz waves were demonstrated. More specifically, reconfigurable metasurfaces capable of deflecting terahertz waves in an electronically controllable fashion were developed. This was accomplished by tilting the phase front of terahertz waves through a two-dimensional array of resonant metasurface unit-cells with electronically-controlled phase-change materials embedded inside. Such metasurfaces can be placed at the output facet of any electromagnetic radiation source to deflect electromagnetic waves at a desired frequency, ranging from millimeter-wave to far-infrared frequencies. Our design does not use any mechanical elements, external light sources, or reflectarrays, creating, for the first time, a highly robust and fully-integrated beam-steering device solution. We demonstrated a proof-of-concept beam-steering metasurface optimized for operation at 100 GHz, offering up to 44&deg; beam deflection in both horizontal and vertical directions. Dynamic control of electromagnetic wave propagation direction through this unique platform could be transformative for various imaging, sensing, and communication applications, among others.&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 02/09/2017<br>      Modified by: Mona&nbsp;Jarrahi</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
