<AbstractNarration>The NSF Sustainable Energy pathways (SEP) Program, under the umbrella of the NSF Science, Engineering and Education for Sustainability (SEES) initiative, will support the research program of Prof. Ben Stuart and co-workers at Ohio University  and Georgia Institute of Technology. This project will lead to a shift in the knowledge base required to address a significant national need for alternative energy for the next generation of sustainable buildings. It will provide the fundamental information required for designing, constructing, optimizing, and scaling up of an algae-based power system that will significantly contribute to the energy requirements of houses or residential communities. The project proposes the following aims: a) Evaluate the bench-scale feasibility of the technology through compositional analysis of various residential waste streams, determining biochemical methane potentials, calculating specific growth rates and biomass yields of local algae strains, and processing the cultivated biomass into biofuels. Process modeling software will employ comprehensive mass and energy balances to develop the descriptive and predictive understanding of system parameters necessary to design, construct and operate a pilot-scale system in both open- and closed-loop modes; b) Determine the interrelationships of architectural design and planning parameters for the algae-powered house at the rural, suburban, and urban scales using the design studio and GIS to test hypotheses and develop novel scenarios; and c) Evaluate elements of integration, constructability, reliability, safety and environmental impact on the use of the algae-based technology in residential structures using a comprehensive economic risk and feasibility assessment to investigate the costs of installation, training, operation, material transfer, maintenance, and evaluation of selected technologies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The economic analysis described in aim 3 above includes comprehensive surveys that will elicit public perceptions and tolerance for the costs associated with sustainable housing incorporating integrated material and energy flows. Investigating the holistic development of these communities will have positive impacts in the fields of architecture, building construction, engineering, sustainable/renewable energy, environmental stewardship, multi-scale economics, and education, and will lay the foundation for a significant shift in the approach to cross-disciplinary research in these fields. This effort will engage students from several of these disciplines, and will produce educational materials that will be incorporated into academic instruction as well as informative videos for younger students and adults. Jobs could be created for manufacturing the proposed algae-based systems in rural community developments of Appalachian counties with historically high unemployment rates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While biofuels hold the potential to contribute significantly to global energy demands, the majority of algal biofuel research to date has been directed towards meeting transportation needs. The proposed research will assess the potential of algal cultivation and processing in the management of liquid and solid waste streams, using the algae produced to supplement waste biomass in the production of energy for use in residential applications. Including water and waste management with the potential for food production and generation of biofuels will augment existing off-grid power technologies (e.g. solar PV, solar thermal, wind) that provide many homeowners with desired energy security, and will extend the sustainability and resource independence of residential communities.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The major goals of this project were to evaluate the feasibility of algae-based technology to manage the liquid and solid wastes from a dwelling, recycle the carbon stream into energy of sufficient quality to contribute power to the dwelling in a sustainable manner, determine the architectural design and planning parameters for the algae-powered house, and evaluate the elements of integration, cost, constructability, reliability, risk, safety and environmental impact on the use of the algae-based technology in residential structures.  Our first significant finding was that nutrient cycling employing anaerobic digestion to create biogas, followed by algae cultivation using the excess nutrients was the most efficient means to manage the waste streams while maximizing energy and biomass output.  Further, while algal biodiesel was an initial goal, the research shifted towards holistic resource management which suggested that algae biomass may better be utilized in food production and enhancing biogas yields than it is for bio-oil fuels.  A second significant finding was the realization that, while sustainable communities utilize less energy, they produce significantly less waste, thus reducing the feedstock for biogas production and other resource generation.  It was only when the sustainable community imported excess waste from neighboring communities that sufficient organic matter was available to meet the energy needs of the sustainable community.  Fortunately, this resulted in a scenario where the sustainable community was a net importer of waste, net zero in energy demand, and could be a net exporter of water and food.  A Geodesign method was developed for managing data representation, performance analysis and design scenarios for making a closed-loop urban system through algae cultivation.  The design of an algae cultivation system forms a new closed-loop network configuration to contribute to the increase of energy performance and biofuel production and the reduction of fossil fuel consumption, waste stream flow and the carbon emissions of the urban system.  It extends the system boundary from a closed algae cultivation system to an open neighborhood-scale urban environment.  The Geodesign method consists of: (1) an objective model to set the research aim of a ?net-zero? neighborhood; (2) a representational model to collect and organize data from both the urban system and algae system; (3) a performance model to measure the energy flow, biomass and waste stream balances; (4) a scenario model to propose different levels of integration of the two systems as possible future paths that drive the system change at different spatial scales; (5) an evaluation model to re-examine the overall performance of the system; and (6) a decision making model to make decisions based on the evaluation results.  Sources of sustenance, waste streams, energy demands, energy production, and recycle methods were evaluated for life cycle assessment (LCA) and technoeconomic analysis (TEA) in order to determine if a rural community can achieve a state of neutrality and self-sustainability.  In order to reach a Profitability Index of 1 (a break-even community), the algae cultivation area was determined to be 1.5 ha.  This resulted in an Energy Return on Investment of 3.87, also resulting in a community with greenhouse gas offsets larger than what they were producing.  Two surveys were conducted in order to estimate consumers? willingness to pay (WTP) for a biodigester system.  It was estimated that the average consumer will not be willing to pay an amount above $0 for such a system ? even though the results indicate a positive amount would be paid for energy generated from solar or wind sources.  Additional analysis suggests that consumers who are knowledgeable about biodigesters would be willing to pay $6.09 per month for a biodigester system, while consumers who believe that climate change can be linked to human activity would be willing to pay $2.35 per month.  These results suggest that education and beliefs are important determinants for the economic viability of biodigesters.  Because very little can be done to better educate respondents in a simple survey beyond what was already done, the second survey was conducted to explore how information about human-caused climate change alters their WTP.  In the survey, it was shown that those who choose to read stories which highlight the dangers of humans on climate change were willing to pay $13.99 per month for a biodigester while those who chose to read stories which downplayed human?s role had a willingness to pay that was no different than $0.  Subsequent analysis highlighted that it was the choice, and not the information, which led to the divergent results.       Last Modified: 11/20/2018       Submitted by: Ben J Stuart]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
