<AbstractNarration>The project will convert the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide (CO2) to chemical and fuel products utilizing electrocatalysis in combination with liquid-phase CO2 media known as Carbon dioxide eXpanded Liquids (CXLs).  Capture and valorization of CO2 produced by combustion processes is one of the greatest technological challenges faced by society.  The project represents a new approach that concentrates CO2 via CXLs, thereby improving the selectivity and faradaic efficiency of the electocatalytic process leading to product generation. This innovation overcomes the key challenge of processing dilute gaseous CO2, and enables development of a practical process for converting CO2 to value-added products.  The project will broadly train graduate and undergraduate students in electrochemistry, materials science, and reaction engineering, and will share the importance of managing emissions of greenhouse gases with elementary school children through summer science camp experiences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The study will develop the first proof-of-concept demonstration of electrochemical cells that interface the traditional three-electrode configuration of physical electrochemistry with reactors designed to allow generation of CXLs from solvents pressurized with CO2. Fundamental research on these new conditions will reveal how CXLs influence the rates and selectivities of CO2 reduction, important considerations because CO2 serves as both the reactant and a co-solvent. This approach is expected to overcome the major challenges that hinder electrochemical CO2 conversion: CO2 starvation and parasitic proton reduction (i.e., generation of hydrogen gas).  More broadly, the research has potential to transform the field by expanding the range of catalytic materials and electrolytes that can be deployed in CXL media. By paving the way for effective CO2 utilization both as co-solvent and reactant, the CXL-based technology will contribute to the reduction of global warming and the adverse effects of climate change, while easing industrial dependence on fossil fuels. Educational aspects will include the recruitment of underrepresented groups through existing and new partnerships with Historically Black Colleges &amp; Universities (HBCU). Results from this research will be used to develop case studies for current graduate and undergraduate courses.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This project studied conversion of the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide (CO2) into carbon monoxide (CO), a chemical and fuel precursor, utilizing electrocatalysis in combination with new CO2-rich liquid media developed through the project that have been termed Carbon dioxide eXpanded Electrolytes (CXEs). Capture and conversion of CO2, which is produced by combustion processes and contributes to anthropogenic climate change, is one of the greatest technological challenges faced by society. The project developed a new approach to handling CO2, which is generally difficult in part due to the nature of CO2 as a gas at room temperature and pressure. In the new approach, CO2 was concentrated into liquids (CXEs) that could be interfaced with catalysts for CO2 conversion, and tremendous increases in the rate of conversion were obtained under these new conditions. High selectivity and electrical (e.g., faradaic) efficiency were obtained for the electocatalytic processes that afforded product generation. The development of CXEs represents an innovative new strategy for overcoming the key challenge of processing dilute gaseous CO2, and could enable future development of practical processes for converting CO2 to useful products and chemicals for society. The project offered training to graduate and undergraduate students in electrochemistry, materials science, and reaction engineering, and led to the dissemination of lessons on the importance of managing emissions of greenhouse gases to various student groups and the general public.<br /><br />Through this project, the first electrochemical cells that interface the traditional three-electrode configuration of physical electrochemistry with reactors designed to allow generation of CXEs from solvents pressurized with CO2 were demonstrated at proof-of-concept scale. Fundamental research on these new conditions revealed how CXEs influence the rates and selectivities of CO2 reduction. These are important considerations because CO2 serves as both the reactant and a co-solvent in CXEs. This approach led to new insights into strategies for overcoming the major challenges that hinder electrochemical CO2 conversion under aqueous conditions: CO2 starvation at electrode surfaces due to slow mass transport and sparing solubility, and parasitic proton reduction (i.e., generation of hydrogen gas) due to the high concentration of protons in water. More broadly, the research expanded the range of conditions that are accessible for testing of catalytic materials and electrolytes for use in CO2 conversion chemistry, by providing the quantitative data needed for development of CXE-based media.
