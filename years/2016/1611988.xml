<AbstractNarration>The Department of Chemistry at Armstrong Atlantic State University will develop "Polymer Chemistry: Crosslinking the Curriculum" (PC3). Natural and synthetic polymers are important materials found in almost all biological systems and durable products, and approximately half of all professional chemists work with polymers at some point in their career. This project will allow students to experience the interconnectedness of chemistry in the context of studying polymers. It will develop new polymer-themed materials for existing courses and laboratories, and develop new introductory and advanced polymer courses for chemistry majors. Together, these efforts will intertwine a polymer paradigm across multiple chemistry sub-disciplines and strengthen students' foundations in polymer chemistry. PC3 will promote faculty collaboration and facilitate team teaching by having multiple faculty members coordinate their instruction to address a complicated topic in a coherent manner. The project will offer a comprehensive curricular approach to meet the recently revised ACS Guidelines and Evaluation Procedures for Bachelor's Degree Programs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PC3 will focus on two polymeric systems, polyaspartic acid and ring opening metathesis. In these contexts, students will be introduced to historically and industrially relevant polymer synthetic procedures, and will learn modern polymer characterization techniques using gel permeation chromatography, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and infrared spectroscopy. Incorporating problem based learning in the laboratory is expected to improve students' competency in understanding the primary chemistry literature, better prepare students for careers in local polymer-specialized chemical industries, and increase student interest in and engagement with chemistry. Working with a project evaluator, the investigators will study how integration of polymer chemistry across the curriculum increases student understanding of fundamental chemical principles, and how curriculum-wide teaching reforms influence non-cognitive student outcomes.</AbstractNarration>
