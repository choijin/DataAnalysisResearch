<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will be a reduction in human exposure to harmful chemicals, reduced greenhouse gas emissions, and reduced volumes of solid waste for biodegradable foam plastic products. This project describes a project to develop biodegradable plastic cups and other products using a sandwich process that includes a foam core. The strength provided by the sandwich structure is designed to allow weight reduction which reduces the environmental impact. Grow Plastics? technology replaces petroleum-based polymers with reduced amounts of plant-based polymers.  The plant-based polymers used in Grow Plastic's process contain no harmful chemicals to leach into humans and the environment and generate as little as 1/3 the CO2 emissions per pound used.  Grow Plastic's technology enables the replacement of petroleum based plastics with as little as 1/3 the plant-based plastic, reducing solid waste by up to 67% by weight, and CO2 emissions from raw materials by as much as 90%.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The technical objectives in this Phase I research project are to increase the service temperature of foam plastic products to at least 95 Celsius, while maintaining polymer densities below 0.1 grams/cubic centimeter.  In polymer products, the weight of plastic used is a key driver in product cost.  This Phase I research project, a partnership between Grow Plastics and Western Washington University, will use polymer blending, solid state foaming and polymer crystallization in order to generate samples for evaluation.  Samples will be evaluated in terms of thermal performance through dynamic mechanical analysis, differential scanning calorimetry, scanning electron microscopy, and evaluation of product rigidity for final products.  The research project will seek to develop extremely lightweight products with service temperatures of at least 95 Celsius.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Compostable bioplastics are generally believed to have lower environmental impact than traditional petroleum-based polymers, but their price and performance have limited their application. The goal of Grow Plastics technology is to increase the adoption of bioplastic products by improving performance and reducing cost through material source reduction.  Replacing conventional plastic products with a reduced amount of bioplastic would result in elimination of plastic waste, lower risk of chemicals leaching into foods from plastics, and reduced greenhouse gas emissions from materials.  Grow Plastics will manufacture in the US and displace foreign manufactured goods, creating US jobs.  At the start of Phase I, Grow Plastics had demonstrated the ability to produce high quality products from bioplastics with a sandwich core structure (similar to cardboard) at the prototype level.  This efficient structure improves the performance of bioplastic end products, and reduces the amount of material needed to produce parts of equivalent strength to solid plastic products.  During Phase I, Grow Plastics and its research partners developed new material blends, processing machinery, and processing methods that resulted in high quality finished products.  The end products exhibited equivalent or superior mechanical and thermal performance to existing products, and a cost model was developed showing that Grow Plastics' technology can produce packaging products at lower costs than competitive products.  The technology was demonstrated at the pilot scale in all stages (raw material to end products), market acceptance has been demonstrated by securing letters of support and prototype product sales, and a manufacturing partner has been selected in order to scale the technology.  Grow Plastics technology may help to eliminate billions of pounds plastic waste, reduce greenhouse gas emissions from materials, create American jobs, and eliminate chemicals leaching into foods from plastic packaging.
