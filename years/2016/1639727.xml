<AbstractNarration>Forecasts of urban heating and energy demand for cities in different climate zones are essential for energy resources management. Accurately predicting electricity need will help energy companies, financial companies, insurance companies, and local government to manage energy resilience. This I-Corps team proposes to develop a web-service that forecasts surface temperature, electricity need, and energy efficiency in big urban regions. A web-based, high resolution (10m) skin temperature forecasting service will be a highly useful input for electricity load forecasting, building energy use efficiency assessment, and energy insurance.  The prediction will be on a daily, weekly, monthly and on an annual basis. These forecasts can be directly used to guide energy distribution management, and improve energy grid efficiency, security and resilience.  Identifying the current energy-load forecasting approaches used in energy-industry and their limits is the first priority for this project.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project has two goals: Market Evaluation and Product Development.  For market evaluation, the team will evaluate the energy industry needs and demand through 100+ market interviews, and through development and partner review of a prototype product demonstration. For product development, using a  NOAA Global Forecasting System (GFS)weather forecast model, NASA satellite remote sensing observations, and the previously developed urban skin temperature forecasting and downscaling techniques, this team proposes to develop a web-service that forecasts daily seasonal surface temperature and energy demand for urban regions. These forecasts can be directly used to guide energy distribution management, and improve energy grid efficiency, security and resilience.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ During April 2016 to June 2017, as supported by NSF national I-Corps program, we learned innovation concepts, custom discovery skills, and prototype development. This is a rich learning experience. It proves that our NSF and NASA funded technology &ndash; downscaling the surface  temperature provided by the model forecasting and satellite remote sensing observations from 1 km to 10-meter resolution &ndash; is very valuable to energy industry.     In I-Corps project, we made our 1st baby step from research to innovation startup. Specifically, we conducted &gt;170 customer interviews, learned skills to objectively assess the interviews, and explore to the key concepts for transferring technology to industry.     Prototype Development   Our ongoing pilot study at University of Maryland, College Park (UMCP, see http://www.sgweatherinfo.com/umd) shows that when high temperatures are forecasted, the facility manager can use campus-plant-produced electricity rather than electricity from the market, which is in peak demand and thus pricy during heatwave events. This management strategy can save ~$200,000/yr for the UMCP facility.  Project Business  Outcome  We launched a new startup company in March 2017. The name of the startup company is  "SpringGem Weather Information, LLC". The website for the company is http://aoscdemo.x10host.com/wordpress/ Successfully raised funding to keep our commercialization activity. We received Maryland Innovation Initiative (MII) Phase 1 funding in June 2017.    Students Training   Warren Porter, April 2016-June 2016, paid as full-time RA (student Entrepreneurial Lead) for customer discovery.   Rebecca Huff June 2016-August 2016, paid as undergraduate summer intern.  Eric Yang, June 2016, paid as hourly undergraduate student for prototype development.      Vision for Post-award  After I-Corps award, customer interviews should be continued but with a focus on building facility managers/building owners. This direction would be our first commercialization product. We need to in depth discuss with the facility managers to seek practical ways to use our hyper-local weather forecast with their HVAC control strategy.  A pilot study on real buildings are critical to valid our concept that implementing weather forecast on HVAC strategy control  can save electricity bills. Both NASA GSFC facility managers and UMCP facility managers are willing to work with us for a pilot study.   We need to seek funding to support a real-world large-building pilot study. In addition to the MII funding we received at the end of I-Corps project, we plan to also apply for SBIR program.
