<AbstractNarration>In this SaTC-EDU project at Virginia Tech, faculty members and graduate students in the Engineering Education, Computer Science (CS), Electrical &amp; Computer Engineering (ECE) and the Hume Center for National Security and Technology in College of Engineering are collaborating to develop and implement a unique curriculum delivery model in cybersecurity into the CS and ECE curricula using Jerome Bruner's spiral theory approach. A theme of software security for cyber applications is chosen to develop and implement cybersecurity learning activities across several required courses in CS and computer engineering curricula impacting more than 300 students each year. Investigators are also conducting cybersecurity learning research using a mixed methods research design. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two research questions are being investigated: (i) How effective are the spiral theory-based learning levels in enhancing students' core knowledge and skills in cybersecurity?, and (ii) How does students' motivation vary across gender, ethnic backgrounds, academic levels, and disciplines when participating in the cybersecurity learning levels? This research contributes in identifying characteristics of cybersecurity learners and developing education and training programs targeted at engaging a broad range of students (e.g., students from various ethnic backgrounds) in STEM education, particularly in cybersecurity. The investigators plan to conduct a workshop at the site of Special Interest Group on Computer Science Education (SIGCSE) to share results with national and international educators.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  This project involved a 4-year collaboration between faculty and students in 3 departments at Virginia Tech.  The key goal was to integrate Cybersecurity education into core courses using a spiral theory approach, which dates back to the seminal work done by Jerome Bruner.     In this widely used approach, concepts are being first introduced, and then repeated at increasing levels of detail.  Each level contains a well-defined set of learning objectives and is accompanied by an authentic activity to further learners' engagement.     This project introduced these modules into core courses in Computer Science (4 levels) and Computer Engineering (1 level), where they can now be experienced by over 1,100 sophomores, junior, and senior levelstudents each year.   Examples of these authentic activities include a project in which students prototype a heap spraying attack that may be performed against a vulnerable system and learn how to defend it; and the development of a personal secure server using web tokens for authentication.   The project team developed these modules and introduced them into these courses over a span of 4 years.  Each introduction was accompanied by an evaluation using a pre- and post test survey instrument that measured student perception and increase of knowledge in the taught areas.   Ultimately, the courses' syllabi were updated to include Cybersecurity-related learning objectives.   Our findings include that our modules were well received and showed significant improvement in students' perceptions towards a possible specialization or career in CyberSecurity.  We expect this to increase recruitment and retention for CyberSecurity-related career and study paths. The project team published the results of the work at the SIGCSE 2018 and 2020 conferences, which are attended by thousands of practitioners of CS education. We also created a website and are making our modules available for interested adopters on request. Moreover, the project trained multiple graduate students, one of which is now an CS educator as an assistant professor at UNCC.   The team also had to address challenges related to sustainability when introducing multiple changes to multiple courses taught by a variety of instructors.  These valuable learning experiences will be helpful for future intra- and cross-departmental collaborations.       Last Modified: 09/11/2020       Submitted by: Godmar Back]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
