<AbstractNarration>It is well known that protons and neutrons are made from constituents, called quarks and gluons. The quarks and gluons give rise to a finite size of the proton, which is about 10,000 times smaller than the size of a single atom. The goal of this project is to measure the size of the proton.  An on-going puzzle is that the proton size appears to be different when measured with atomic hydrogen as compared with its counterpart, called muonic-hydrogen, where the electron in a hydrogen atom is replaced by its heavier cousin, the muon. This project will specifically build equipment to be used in an experiment to provide an independent measurement of the proton radius. In addition to the direct scientific goals of the project, the experiments provide students and young scientists experience and training in working in the international collaborations of modern scientific experiments, with state of the art technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The seven standard deviation discrepancy between the proton radius measured with muonic hydrogen and with electron-proton scattering may point to physics beyond the standard model of particle physics, or result from novel aspects of conventional physics or from issues in extracting the radius from experimental data. The Muon Scattering Experiment (MUSE) aims to resolve the proton radius puzzle. MUSE uses a mixed pion, muon and electron beam at the Paul Scherrer Institute (PSI) in Switzerland. MUSE will determine the proton radius through both muon-proton scattering and electron-proton scattering, in addition to performing these reactions with positive and negative leptons. This not only reduces systematic uncertainties but also provides sensitivity to two-photon exchange contributions that may be responsible for some of the discrepancies seen in earlier experiments. This collaborative project supports the construction of MUSE over the period September 2016 - August 2018. There will also be ongoing testing and commissioning activities at PSI, including a dress rehearsal run with a partial spectrometer in late 2017. George Washington University is the lead institution (working with Montgomery College) on the computer data acquisition and associated electronics.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit:  In 2010, the CREMA collaboration released a new measurement of the size of the proton, the proton radius, measured using muonic hydrogen: hydrogen where the electron had been replaced by a muon.  This measurement was an order of magnitude more precise than, but 4% smaller than, and completely inconsistent with, the accepted value of the proton radius. This discrepancy became known as the Proton Radius Puzzle.    There havve been many proposed solutions to the Proton Radius Puzzle, but, to date, no one has conculsively proved which radius is correct and why the other radius appears the way it does.  Many new measurements have been published, but these too are split between the smaller and larger radii, and so no conclusion can be reached.  This project funded the construction of the MUon Proton Scattering Experiment detector system. MUSE will measure the proton radius by scattering both muons and electrons simultaneously on protons. It will provide the first measurement of elastic muon scattering on the proton with sufficient precision to address the Proton Radius Puzzle, will be the first measurement to use both muons and electrons, and will be able to study particles of both positive and negative changes, which makes it unique.  The work supported entailled the construction of the readout electronics and data acquisition system (DAQ) for MUSE. These components take the electrical signals generated in the particle detectors when a particle passes through them, and convert them into digital signals stored on computer disk, which can be analyzed and interpreted as times and energies, which in turn can be interpreted as particle identities and trajectories to allow the reconstruction of the physics which happens in the detector system.  Throughout the life of the project, we designed, constructed, and commissioned a DAQ system which reads out the signals from approximately 4000 detector channels.   The MUSE system is fully constructed and being commissioned in order to take engineering data in 2020 and production data in 2021 and 2022.  Broader Imapcts:  The proton radius puzzle recieved coverage in popular media such as the Huffington Post and New York Times - it captures the public's imagination and can result in increased interest in science and careers in science. The detctor system constructed for MUSE can be used at many other facilities after MUSE has completed.          Last Modified: 02/03/2020       Submitted by: Evangeline J Downie]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
