<AbstractNarration>Forests play a key role in regulating climate due to their ability absorb and store CO2 from the atmosphere. While often treated as a whole, the properties of forests are the aggregated outcome of processes happening on the level of thousands of individual trees. Individual trees within and between species in a forest vary in their physiological and growth response to the environment. Quantifying this variation is critical for understanding how forests regulate the carbon cycle and therefore for improving models that project how forests will respond to future fluctuations in climate. The present research project uses cutting edge genetic technology coupled with detailed measurements of individual tree growth and physiology to address these outstanding grand challenges in forest biology. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Forested ecosystems are key players in the global carbon cycle. A grand challenge for those investigating current and projecting future forest functioning is linking processes occurring at the level of a leaf to those occurring at the level of a forest. Critical to these efforts is an understanding of where variation exists and the degree to which knowing that information improves projections. Individuals interact with their environments via their phenotypes and the resulting performance ultimately scales up to provide emergent ecosystem-level properties. Thus, acute and chronic changes to the environment are inherently an individual-level phenomenon. Rich assays of leaf level functioning and linkages of such information to individual tree and whole forest carbon flux are rare in tree ecology due to logistical constraints and a focus on a handful of leaf properties. The present project assays leaf level functioning throughout several growing seasons through the quantification of leaf physiological traits and gene expression. The sampling is performed at two NEON sites where significant infrastructure exists allowing us to link these leaf level properties to forest scale measures of carbon flux and the environment.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p><span>A grand challenge facing forest ecologists is improving our understanding of how forests respond to climate change in a mechanistic way. This means that patterns of weather and forest productivity, while indicative of the processes that will determine the future of forest health, are not specific enough for prediction. This is in part because ecosystem changes emerge from how individual trees function, and how that functioning changes within and across years. What is function? This term can mean many things, and any one 'mechanism' identified can be seen as a 'pattern' at another scale. But there are new technologies that are allowing ecologists to ask questions about function at a very specific level: that of the genome. Our project applied those technologies with the goal of linking gene expression (what the plant is producing in the moment) to tree growth and whole-forest productivity. To do this we studied the gene expression and growth dynamics of 500 trees (50 individuals of five species monitored at two sites, one in Maryland (the Smithsonian Environmental Research Center [SERC]) and the other in Massachusetts (Harvard Forest [HF]).</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Starting in 2017 in the Spring, we implemented two protocols at these sites. The first was the installation of metal band dendrometers (Figure 1), which are spring-loaded bands that can be measured with digital calipers that capture very detailed intra-annual growth (Figure 2). These five hundred trees were measured every week of the growing season for the next three years. The second protocol involved collecting leaf samples from all trees initially, and then a subset of 20 trees / species / site (for a total of 200 individuals) three times in 2017, 2018, and 2019. These samples were collected in the spring, soon after leaf flush, the middle of the summer, and the late summer. Although due to some technical issues and COVID, all samples have not been processed (they are being sequenced in the Spring 2021), every leaf collected will be tested for which genes it was expressing at the time of sampling. We currently have samples from American beech processed, so that the workflow that will be used for all samples is established.</span></p> <p><span>At any time, a leaf may be expressing more than 20,000 genes. Many of these genes are always expressed, and expressed similarly across leaves, trees, and species. Why? Because all trees have some similar cellular, metabolic, and maintenance strategies. For example, genes are expressed when cells divide. This is constantly happening. However, some genes (sometimes many genes) are unique to conditions at a certain time under specific conditions. It is this <em>differential</em> expression that begins to tell a story about the function of trees during the year under different conditions.</span></p> <p><span>From our processing of the beech leaves from two years, we found several fascinating outcomes.</span></p> <p><span>1)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span>There is a lot of congruence in expression across trees in both sites.

We also were able to sample in the Spring of 2020, and those show even more divergent patterns.</span></p> <p><span>These are particularly interesting findings in light of the fact that our growth data show that most of the increase in tree diameter (which is how the tree locks in carbon) early in the growing season. By mid-august at both sites, long before leaf fall, most of the annual increase in bole diameter is complete (see example Figure 3). Our next steps in this project will not only complete the sequencing of all samples, and integrate growth data into these patterns statistically, but explore <em>which </em>genes are expressing differently. We know from species that are studied in great detail in greenhouses that certain genes are linked to important responses like stress, protection, and allocation of resources to different tissues (such as roots, stems, or leaves). The expression differences that demonstrate interesting patterns, therefore, should lead to some important mechanisms that determine how forests function from the leaf to the ecosystem.</span></p> <p><span>This project involves three PIs, a post-doc researcher, a technician, PhD students, and a number of interns, collaborators, and administrative support.
