<AbstractNarration>Title: 3D C-NEMS Based Aptasensors&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Brief description of project Goals: Design, fabricate, evaluate and optimize three dimensional on-chip electrochemical aptasensors based on Carbon-NanoElectroMechanical Systems (C-NEMS).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nontechnical Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;The increased amount of proteins such as platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) can be observed in the early tumorigenesis as well as cancer progression. The PI will focus on developing on-chip capacitive aptasensors employing aptamers as recognition element using unique three dimensional graphene based micropillar arrays, which could deliver high sensitivity, good stability and low detection limits. The miniaturized reconfigurable electrode design is geared to take advantage from the scalable relationship between the interfacial area and overall volume. This project will contribute to the research, education, and diversity goals and strongly support FIUBeyondPossible2020 strategic plan. It will broaden the participation of minority students and women in science and engineering, and foster interdisciplinary interactions. Beyond the impact on the microfabrication research community, this project will have broader impact on cancer diagnosis. The knowledge generated and the key issues identified in this project will impact a broad area of sensor fabrication and development.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;The increased amount of proteins such as platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) can be observed in the early tumorigenesis as well as cancer progression. In this project, the PI will focus on developing on-chip aptasensors employing aptamers as recognition element based on unique 3D C-MEMS (Carbon-MicroElectroMechanical Systems) and C-NEMS (Carbon-NanoElectroMechanical Systems) platforms. The goal of this project is to design, fabricate, evaluate and optimize the 3D C-NEMS based on-chip electrochemical aptasensors that deliver superior performance (i.e., high sensitivity, good stability, low detection limits).The PI plans to (1) fabricate 3D high-aspect-ratio microelectrode arrays with interdigital fingers by C-MEMS technique; (2) deposit carbon based nanomaterials onto the C-MEMS using electrostatic spray deposition and electrophoretic deposition; (3) functionalize the whole-carbon platform with active chemical groups for efficient and stable immobilization of aptamers; (4) develop and evaluate an electrochemical label-free aptasensor for PDGF protein detection based on characterizing electrochemical impedance and capacitive behaviors. 3D C-NEMS platform will have great advantages and is one of the best solutions to achieve high-sensitivity biosensors. Employing unique C-NEMS technique aptasensors can be fabricated repeatedly with desired dimensions, structures, and material properties. The miniaturized electrode design is geared to take advantage from the scalable relationship between the interfacial area and overall volume.  This project will contribute to the research, education, and diversity goals and strongly support FIUBeyondPossible2020 strategic plan. It will broaden the participation of minority students and women in science and engineering. The newly developed technique will be highlighted in the PI's graduate/undergraduate courses. Beyond the impact on the MEMS and NEMS community in academia, the proposed research will have broader impact on cancer diagnosis. The knowledge generated and the key issues identified in this project will impact a broad area of sensor fabrication and development. It is anticipated that the successful implementation of this device in the clinical arena will have significant impact on the early detection, morbidity, and mortality for the large number of patients with cancers, as well as establishing an innovative realm of biomedical technology.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Cancer is the second cause of death, with millions of fatalities every year. The early detection of cancer can tremendously increase the survival chances of the patients. An effective approach for early detection of cancer is developing reliable and relatively cheap biosensors that can quantify the cancer biomarkers from blood samples. These classes of the biosensor are commonly referred to as point-of-care (POC) cancer biomarker biosensors. The label-free electrochemical biosensors based on carbon derivative materials can be feasible for POC cancer biomarker biosensors. The present project aimed to design, develop, and optimize carbon-based biosensors for label-free detection of lactic acid and platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB) cancer biomarkers. The biosensors developed in this project involve carbon-microelectromechanical systems (aka. C-MEMS) and bipolar electrochemistry approach. In the first phase of this project, enzymatic biosensors based on interdigitated C-MEMS microelectrodes were developed and investigated. The achieved results confirmed that the C-MEMS-based sensing platform functionalized with oxygen-plasma treatment could provide a stable sensing structure with low background noise, which can be used for label-free detection of cancer biomarkers. In the second phase of the project, C-MEMS electrode functionalized with oxygen-plasma was adopted for ssDNA aptamer-based electrochemical biosensors (aka. aptasensors). The attained results confirmed that the developed aptasensors are highly sensitive, selective, and robust, and the developed system is adaptable for turn-on and turn-off sensing strategies. In the third phase of the project, the adaptability of the in-situ bipolar exfoliated graphene for biosensing application was investigated. The achieved results revealed that the graphene deposited on a negative feeding electrode (i.e., reduced graphene oxide) is more suitable for label-free electrochemical aptasensing. Hence, novel POC PDGF-BB aptasensors based on bipolar reduced graphene oxide were developed and investigated. The achieved results were highly promising for feasible POC cancer aptasensors. The last phase of this project explored the in-situ integration of bipolar exfoliated graphene on C-MEMS microelectrodes. The biosensor developed based on this integration showed enhanced sensitivity and reduced background noise. In summary, novel carbon-based electrochemical biosensors were developed and optimized.
