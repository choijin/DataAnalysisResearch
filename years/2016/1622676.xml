<AbstractNarration>Infrared and solar radiation absorbed by atmospheric water and trace gases drives atmospheric chemistry and climate. Individual species absorb radiation in unique spectral bands and windows and the amounts vary with pressure and temperature for each molecule. In order to accurately compute the energy absorbed by our atmosphere and to use remote sensing to detect these molecules accurate line by line spectral absorption parameters including their variation with environmental parameters is needed. This research uses fundamental physics to construct accurate line shape parameters of key atmospheric species that will be used in atmospheric radiation and remote sensing retrieval models to advance our knowledge of atmospheric chemistry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will develop a unified theoretical framework to calculate pressure-broadened half-widths and pressure-induced line shifts, their velocity and temperature dependences for gases important in the Earth's atmosphere. The improved formalism will go beyond the current Voigt profile approximation to enhance remote sensing retrievals and line-by-line computations of radiative forcing of climate. The research will develop the new Hartmann-Tran profiles that require velocity dependent line shape parameters that will be estimated from thousands of ro-vibronic transitions that will be computed using ab initio and Modified Complex Robert-Bonamy codes. It will target H2O, CO2, O3 and CH4 line broadening in collision with N2, O2, and self-collisions at atmospherically relevant temperatures and pressures. Specifically, the effects of line coupling and mixing on half-widths will be rigorously treated and calibrated using available observations. In addition to advancing the U.S. community HITRAN database focused studies will enrich remote sensing retrievals and radiative forcing by trace gases to advance atmospheric chemistry and climate.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The study of the structure, composition, chemistry, dynamics, and evolution of an atmosphere, whether Earth’s or the atmospheres of other planets, is generally done by remote sensing techniques due to the sheer size of an atmosphere.  This is especially true for other planets where in situ measurements are rarely done due to the expense.  A method that yields high quality data is to measure the spectrum of the atmosphere using spectroscopic instruments.  As light energy passes through layers of an atmosphere, the molecules in the atmosphere absorb radiation at particular frequencies, thus changing the amount of radiation that can pass to the next layer, resulting in a spectrum.  The composition, structure, and some clues to the evolution of the atmosphere can be determined by reducing the measured spectrum, a process called radiative transfer.  It is essentially tracking the radiation (light) as it passes through the atmosphere.  At each layer the spectrum must be modeled.  To model the spectrum at each layer, one must have the parameters that describe the spectral lines for the molecules in the atmosphere: the position, intensity, half-width, line shift, and their temperature dependence, and the lower state energy.  The half-width and line shift are called the line shape parameters (LSP).  For the majority of gases in the Earth’s or planetary atmospheres, the line positions and intensities are very well known.  The half-widths are the weak link in the retrievals with the resulting uncertainty in the retrieved concentrations (mixing ratios) often having a 1:1 relationship with the uncertainty of the half-width.  The half-widths on the molecular spectroscopic databases are often only known to 30-50%.  Line shifts are also not well known but have a smaller, but sometimes important, influence on the reductions.   The work done here was the development of a theoretical method, the modified complex Robert-Bonamy formalism (MCRB), to calculate the line shape parameters and their temperature dependence.  The MCRB model is what is called a semi-classical method, meaning the dynamics are solved by classical physics (Hamilton’s equations) and the internal structure of the molecules is solved using quantum mechanics.  The calculations give the Lorentz line shape half-width and line shift as a function of temperature.  The formalism was used to calculate LSP for thousands of lines for the main infrared (IR) absorbing gases in the atmosphere: H2O and CO2.  The results of these calculations give the half-width with average uncertainty of ~0.2% and a standard deviation of ~5% for H2O and average uncertainty of ~0.2% and a standard deviation of ~2% for CO2 when compared with measurement. These data have greatly improved the LSP on the available spectroscopic databases.   From our work we were able to create a LSP prediction routine for CO2 with uncertainty similar to the calculations.  This routine allowed us to provide line shape information for 0.65 billion transitions of CO2.  On Earth it is now possible to make higher resolution measurements that require line shape models beyond the Lorentz model.  In collaboration with French researchers, we were able to determine an extremely accurate line shape, using the Kielson-Storer (KS) kernel, for a number of water vapor transitions with nitrogen or water vapor as the colliding partner.  The KS method takes into account the collision-induced velocity changes, the speed dependences of the broadening and shifting coefficients as well as the partial correlation between velocity and rotational-state changes.  While computationally intensive, the results give a standard to which other line shape models can compare.   From this grant, my lab also worked on other molecular parameters important for understanding molecular spectra and remote sensing.  We have had a series of papers producing the best available energy levels for 9 isotopologues of water vapor determined from measurement.  We calculated total internal partition sums (TIPS) for 166 isotopologues of 51 molecules important in planetary atmospheres.  The TIPS are determined by various methods from 1 K to a Tmax that ensures the TIPS reported have converged.   All of the data we generated during this NSF grant are available at the website http://faculty.uml.edu/Robert_Gamache and often through the supplementary information of the journals where the work has been published.  The line shape parameters of our research have been added to the HITRAN, GEISA, Ames, and CDSD spectroscopic databases.  The TIPS data are provided with HITRAN2016 and a new version of the TIPS code is available in both FORTRAN and python languages at my website and the HITRAN website.  Also available at my website are many of the analysis plots used to produce the data in the published journal articles.
