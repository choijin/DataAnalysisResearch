<AbstractNarration>This award provides funding to help defray the expenses of participants in the conference "Analysis and Beyond" that will be held May 21-24, 2016, at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference program will feature lectures delivered by a host of international mathematical leaders and will highlight a wide range of disciplinary topics, including the following: dynamical systems, ergodic theory, functional analysis, harmonic analysis, mathematical physics, number theory, partial differential equations, and theoretical computer science. A unifying theme of the event is the contribution that Fields Medalist Jean Bourgain has made to each of these areas.</AbstractNarration>

The conference highlighted recent developments in a wide variety of fields, including  ergodic theory, functional analysis, harmonic analysis, mathematical physics, number theory, partial differential equations, and theoretical computer science.   Jean Bourgain's far-reaching contribution to each fo this fields was the unifying theme of the conference.</p> <p>&nbsp;The conference was a complete success.   The program featured lectures delivered by outstanding speakers: Enrico Bombieri, Emmanuel Breuillard, Haim Brezis, Ciprian Demeter, Alireza Salehi Golsefidy, Larry  Guth,   Gil Kalai, Carlos Kenig,   Alex Kontorovich,   Sergei  Konyagin,   Elon Lindenstrauss,  Vitali Milman,  Andrea Nahmod, Gilles Pisier,  Wilhelm Schlag,  Avi Wigderson and  Tamar Ziegler.  The talks, aiming at the broad audience, were recorded and are available on IAS website.  More than 180 participants registered for the conference, including many junior researchers supported by this award.  Some of their testimonials from exit survey are reproduced below:</p> <p>&nbsp;-Being able to attend the Analysis and Beyond conference was an enormously rewarding experience. One aspect of the conference I especially appreciated was the wide variety of topics discussed and talks that were correspondingly aimed at a broad audience. From the talks I got both a better sense of modern developments in areas I haven't directly worked and, in areas with which I have more familiarity, new problems that I hope to try my hand at. I was also able to meet and discuss ongoing mathematical work with collaborators during the event. The financial support offered to me is greatly appreciated -- without it I would not have had sufficient funds to attend.</p> <p>&nbsp;-The conference was a terrific experience and I appreciate for having the opportunity to participate in this event. It was amazing to see so many different areas of mathematics connect in such a beautiful way. The organization of the conference was great; the program was at a very good pace and the lectures were thematically very nicely distributed. I am really thankful for having the chance to listen to some of the best mathematicians in the world. Coffee breaks provided a perfect opportunity to discuss math with other participants.</p> <p>&nbsp;-The conference was quite productive for me and I am extremely thankful for the financial support I received. Before I went to the conference, I didn't know too many people who were thinking about the question I'm thinking about, but when I got to the conference I was quite surprised that quite a few people were interested in what I had to say and the current results I had. They also posed to me related open problems that I didn't know about. Attending the conference has made me more motivated to finish my current result and keep in contact with the friends I made at the conference. Thanks for the support!</p> <p>&nbsp;-About the conference: I would like to thank the Institute for the wonderful opportunity to meet so many great mathematicians and hearing them talk in person. I personally did not find anything worth of any kind of negative comments. The organization, the food, the talks, everything was absolutely faultless. As a beginning PhD student, going to this conference made a huge difference in my perspective towards mathematics. It really meant a lot to me.</p> <p>&nbsp;- I really enjoying the conference. It's probably the highest level of a mathematical conference I have ever attended. All the speakers did a great job of explaining the results both to experts and non-experts and creating a good picture of Jean Bourgain's contributions to these areas, in most cases revolutionary. The organization was also flawless and very thoughtful. I would like to thank all the organizers for setting up such a historical event.</p> <p><!--EndFragment--></p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 05/29/2017<br>      Modified by: Alexander&nbsp;Gamburd</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
