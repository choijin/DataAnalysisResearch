<AbstractNarration>This award provides funding for the conference Symmetry, Integrability, and Special Functions, to be held at the Centre de Recherches Math√©matiques at the University of Montreal from July 3 to July 9, 2016.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference focuses on recent developments in Analysis, especially in the fields of difference equations, orthogonal polynomials, and integrable systems.  A number of distinguished mathematicians have agreed to attend and speak at this conference. The award gives early career researchers, researchers who are members of underrepresented groups, researchers not funded by NSF a chance to attend and participate in this conference.  The organizing committee will strive to make this funding opportunity known to target groups through a number of different activities.  More information will be made available at:&lt;br/&gt;http://www.crm.umontreal.ca/2016/SIDE12/index_e.php</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The funds covered travel and housing for some attendees from US, mainly for students, postdocs and young researchers. There were two parts to the meeting: a summer school (Abecedarian of SIDE, June 27 &ndash; July 1, 2016: http://www.crm.umontreal.ca/2016/ASIDE16/index_e.php) preceded the conference (SIDE 12, July 3 &ndash; July 9, 2016: International Conference on Symmetries and Integrability of Difference Equations: http://www.crm.umontreal.ca/2016/SIDE12/index_e.php). The summer school was held at CRM of the University of Montreal and the conference was held at St Adele about 30 minute drive from Montreal.  The summer school program was very interesting: the goal of the school is to prepare participants to the SIDE conference. Its format was a series of mini-courses of up to four lectures given by one or two lecturers. The lecturers were all very young and within 8 to 9 years of their doctorate. They are the future leaders of the field. The summer school lectures started at an introductory level and reached the level of current research topics. The lectures were very well presented and had time for questions and queries. Lecture notes were available to participants and the lectures were well attended. The audience were an international mix. Some research problems were proposed and the meeting covered current research topics. There were several exchanges of ideas that led to further progress. For example Mourad Ismail pointed out to S. Nalci a different conceptual way to look at her thesis results and when the thesis was written they adopted his approach which helped to motivate and discover new results. We do not have a record of all such conversations but we knew about this because he is a PI for this proposal.  The conference had nine special sessions and was focused on current research topics in integrable systems and special functions. Topics included:  discrete, continuous and ultradiscrete Painlev&eacute;      equations; orthogonal polynomials, special functions and their      relation to discrete integrable systems and their elliptic analogs; integrability criteria for single and multivariable      difference equations and differential difference equations; discrete differential geometry; discrete integrable systems and isomonodromy      transformations; Yang&ndash;Baxter maps and quantum discrete integrable      systems; continuous symmetries of discrete equations; structure preserving discretization of differential      equations and numerical methods; cluster algebras and discrete integrable systems; dynamics on graphs and combinatorics; difference Galois theory; lattices and symmetries in physical applications.   The venues were very appropriate and convenient. CRM is easily accessible by the Metro (underground) and the university library was available to all participants. The St Adele venue was in a resort used for skiing in winter time and the housing was in the same place and very convenient.
