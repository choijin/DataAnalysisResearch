<AbstractNarration>Title: Collaborative Research: Understanding Ion Solvation Effects in Nonaqueous Oxygen Electroreduction Reactions&lt;br/&gt;Bryan D. McCloskey/ Venkatasubraman Viswanathan&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: 1604927/1604898&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Of all battery chemistries currently being explored to power next-generation electric vehicles, metal-air (O2) couples possess some of the highest known theoretical specific energies and volumetric energy densities.  In particular, the aprotic nonaqueous Li-O2 battery has recently received significant attention because of its superior specific energy. Yet many of the challenges facing Li-O2 battery development remain unsolved.  One of these challenges involves understanding the link between electrolyte composition and the discharge/charge electrochemical processes. The proposed research will address the fundamental dependence of the Li-O2 electrochemistry mechanism on both cation and anion solvation, thereby providing a better understanding of how to improve the performance of high-energy nonaqueous Li-O2 and other metal-O2 batteries.  If successful, Li-O2 batteries could advance and accelerate the adoption of electric vehicles for reduced emissions, improved efficiency, and domestic energy security.  The PIs are committed to broad dissemination of their results. As such, they will develop online video modules to make publicly accessible the prospects of this exciting new area of energy storage. The online modules will be structured for simple incorporation into energy and electrochemical system courses, including those taught by the PIs.  The PIs will also develop a broader and more engaging educational content on electrochemistry/batteries with a vision to run a massive online open course.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The overall objective of the proposed research is to elucidate the effect of ion solvation on the fundamental oxygen electrochemistry in nonaqueous electrolytes, with a particular emphasis on oxygen reduction in Li+-bearing electrolytes.  Recent studies have identified the importance of electrolyte composition on both the ultimate oxygen reduction product formed and the mechanism by which it forms. For example, a 2 e- oxygen reduction to form lithium peroxide, Li2O2, is found to occur in nonaqueous Li-O2 batteries, whereas a 1 e- reduction process to form sodium superoxide, NaO2, occurs in Na-O2 batteries.  Furthermore, the Li-O2 discharge mechanism was recently shown to be affected by a delicate interplay between anion and solvent selection, as the Lewis acidity and basicity of both components affected the lifetime of oxygen reduction intermediates in solution. The PIs used this knowledge to improve the discharge capacity (or usable energy) of a Li-O2 battery four-fold. However, the understanding of the complex role of electrolyte constituents (ions, additives, and solvents) on electrode reactions and ion solvation is not complete.  This understanding potentially has far-reaching implications in many other electrochemical systems (e.g., CO2 reduction, Li-S batteries, and other metal-air batteries). The proposed research tasks will leverage unique experimental and theoretical capabilities developed by the PIs to study Li-O2 batteries, including Differential Electrochemical Mass Spectrometry (DEMS) to quantify Coulombic efficiency of batteries employing different electrolyte compositions, and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy to probe cation and anion solvation in these electrolytes.  The theoretical capabilities to describe non-equilibrium charge transport, and solution and surface electrochemistry, will be based on density functional theory calculations.  Through a well-developed theoretical and experimental framework, the PIs will identify novel electrolyte compositions that can trigger solution electrochemistry, thereby improving discharge capacity while maintaining chemical stability.   The PIs will then experimentally link ion solvation effects in the most promising electrolyte compositions to stability and capacity enhancements.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   Advanced batteries are critical for accelerating the electrification of transportation and aviation.  Li-oxygen based batteries could provide much higher energy density than current Li-ion batteries but they suffer from poor rechargeability.  The project aimed to develop a detailed understanding of the synergistic effects of electrolyte constituents on the mechanism of oxygen reduction in non-aqueous electrolytes, and identify important electrolyte composition criteria that can improve the energy efficiency of non-aqueous Li-oxygen batteries without compromising on other performance metrics such as rechargeability and discharge capacity.  A key outcome from this project has been to propose a mechanism to rationalize the degradation observed in Li-oxygen batteries related to singlet oxygen formation.  Singlet oxygen has been observed in experiments during charging of lithium-oxygen batteries and is considered to be highly detrimental. We have proposed a mechanism of singlet oxygen production that unifies its formation in both metal-air and Li-ion batteries.  In particular, we show that the mechanism of singlet oxygen generation is through the chemical disproportionation of superoxide anion in solution leading to singlet oxygen and peroxide anion.  Thus, singlet oxygen yield is controlled by free superoxide anion which can be suppressed through the formation of alkali superoxide ion pairs in solution.  Thus, suppression of singlet oxygen formation could be done through careful selection of electrolyte constituents. In addition, instability at the cathode-electrolyte interface limits performance of lithium-oxygen batteries.  Based on a thermodynamic analysis, we have identified two important requirements for the cathode: the cathode should preferentially nucleate the desired discharge product, lithium peroxide and suppress lithium oxide, undesired secondary discharge product.  In addition, the cathode should be chemically stable.  We have established a set of stability criteria and identified that cathode materials which resist oxide formation and do not form mixed oxides in the presence of lithium peroxide are promising cathode candidates. We have identified the possible decomposition pathways at the interface between the primary discharge product, lithium peroxide, and cathode material. We identify that there exist two thermodynamic driving forces for decomposition that an active cathode material should resist: (i) direct oxidation of the cathode, and (ii) lithium peroxide mediated cathode oxidation to form a mixed oxide. We have formulated the criteria for cathode stability as positive (unstable) free energy of formation of a mixed oxide with lithium, oxygen and the cathode material referenced to the discharge product, in addition to a positive (unstable) free energy of formation for the oxide product of the cathode material.  This selection rule identifies noble metal material candidates that are generally stable towards oxidation or oxidized materials which cannot undergo further oxidation. The fundamental understanding developed in this project outlines approaches to addressing the rechargeability issues related to oxygen electro-reduction reactions in nonaqueous lithium-oxygen batteries.  If these rechargeability issues can be addressed, this could lead to lithium-oxygen batteries that can provide much higher energy density for electric vehicle and aviation applications.
