<AbstractNarration>With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation Program (MRI) and support from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program (CRIF), Professor Michael Doyle from the University of Texas San Antonio (UTSA) has acquired a 500 MHz NMR spectrometer equipped with a broadband probe. This spectrometer allows research in a variety of fields such as those that accelerate chemical reactions of significant economic importance, as well as the study of biologically-relevant species. In general, Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is one of the most powerful tools available to chemists to determine the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the changing interactions between molecules in solution or in the solid state. The results from these NMR studies have an impact in synthetic organic/inorganic chemistry, materials chemistry and biochemistry. This instrument is located a general user facility managed by highly qualified scientists and is an integral part of research, research training and teaching in the Departments of Chemistry and Biochemistry at this institution. The spectrometer helps in the overall university mission by providing students in South Texas with NMR knowledge and enabling their success in the chemical/engineering workforce.  Several other regional universities: Texas Lutheran University, St. Mary's University, TAMU Kingsville and the University of Incarnate Word also use the instrument through collaborations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The award is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels, especially in: (a) synthesizing heterocyclic compounds enantioselectively; (b) exploring new catalytic approaches to the highly stereoselective syntheses of structurally complex organic compounds; (c) characterizing the dynamic conformational changes of proteins; (d) exploring bioinorganic chemical catalysis, and (e) synthesizing and biophysically understanding biomaterials.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The 500 MHz nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometer purchased with funding from the National Science Foundation has provided new capabilities that dramatically improved the diverse research capabilities in chemistry, biochemistry and materials science at UTSA and allied units, as well as regional colleges. This instrument is operating an average of 480 experiments per week for 13-18 hours per day. In addition to routine carbon and hydrogen spectra and 2D and 3D experiments, phosphorus-31, fluorine-19, boron-11, nitrogen-15, deuterium, and silicin-29 nuclei are routinely accessed. With support from the university the purchase of the 500 MHz instrument aided the upgrading of an existing 300 MHz instrument that now serves our undergraduate chemistry courses and routine H/C spectral acquisitions. These new capabilities have had a significant impact on externally funded research at UTSA in projects that range from the development of new catalytic methodologies for the enantioselective synthesis of heterocyclic compounds (Prof. Doyle), new catalytic approaches to the highly stereoselective syntheses of structurally complex organic compounds (Profs. Doyle, Frantz, Han, Larionov, Zhou), site-directed fluorine-19 nuclear magnetic resonance (<sup>19</sup>F-NMR) spectroscopy for characterizing the dynamic conformational changes of proteins (Prof. Liu), inorganic chemical catalysis (Prof. Musie and Tonzetich), and to characterize the structures of novel organometallic complexes (Prof. Schanze). Acquisition of the 500 NMR spectrometer has also had a strong impact on the career development of junior faculty (Profs. Larionov and Tonzetich) and helped us to recruit and support new faculty to UTSA (Francis Yoshimoto). In addition, two groups from engineering and one from physics at UTSA have used this instrument. External users include faculty and students from St. Mary's College and Texas Lutheran University, as well as a user from the US Air Force base in San Antonio. With the arrival of the 500 MHz instrument at UTSA, a new NMR course was introduced to aid our students in understanding NMR interpretation and advanced techniques (average annual enrollment is 18 students): Chemistry 4953/6973 introduces the techniques of 1H, 13C, and multinuclear NMR spectroscopy for structure elucidation in organic chemistry and also describes the use of multi-pulse experiments (spin decoupling, NOE, APT, INEPT, DEPT etc.) and 2-dimensional techniques (COSY, NOESY, ROESY, etc.) in structure elucidation of complex natural products. Two examples illustrate the diverse uses of the instrument acquired with NSF-MRI funds: (1) Dr. Yoshimoto synthesized 3,3-dideutero-dihydroartemisinic acid in seven steps. This deuterated isotopologue was used to measure the non-enzymatic rate of conversion of dihydroartemisinic acid to artemisinin, a cascade process involving C-C bond cleavage, peroxide incorporation, and endoperoxide formation, to form the antimalarial natural product, artemisinin. Deuterium NMR confirmed the regioselective deuteration at the C3-position in the final product with chemical shifts observed at 1.8 and 1.9 ppm.

In the case of the phosphine complexes, the capability to observe the 31P spectrum is essential in allowing the assignment of the complexes? stereochemistry since the chemical shift and Pt-P coupling is diagnostic.
