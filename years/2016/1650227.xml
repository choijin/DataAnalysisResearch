<AbstractNarration>This project seeks to develop a facile method to mine plant-microbe interactions for key molecular targets of microbial factors that influence plant performance. Plants and microbes traffic molecules to each other during interactions that range from symbiotic to pathogenic. Plant biologists are beginning to appreciate the continuum of these interactions at the molecular level. Most current experimental paradigms center on pathogenic or symbiotic microbes in mono-association with a specific plant. These systems are highly developed and feature various molecular and genetic tool kits for research. However, many important plant-microbe interactions, especially those causing devastating diseases, are experimentally under-developed.  Here a method will be developed that can serve as a general tool to understand protein-protein interactions in any plant-microbe interaction. The project is expected to produce original insights into the dynamic and intimate interactions between plants and their microbiota. The method could be subsequently widely deployed as an integral part of functional study of plant microbiota, thereby broadly impacting plant science research. The project will provide interdisciplinary training for undergraduates, doctoral and post-doctoral as well as outreach to high school and undergraduate students.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The method to be developed can serve as a general tool to understand protein-protein interactions in any plant-microbe interaction. If successful, the project will provide an unprecedented source of plant microbe protein interactome information that will be easily accessed and utilized by the research community.  The data will be made publicly available via a curated PPIN database. The method is a high-throughput yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) system named ProCREate which exploits Cre-lox recombination to enable proteins to induce reporter gene expression of Cre Recombinase and subsequent Cre-recombination of plasmids containing mutant loxP sequences. The irreversible double mutant loxP linkage of each protein's corresponding coding sequence allows the identification of protein interactions using Illumina paired-end sequencing and bioinformatics analysis.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>All organisms use the DNA of their genomes to encode proteins. Proteins are the cellular machinery that performs all of the work required for cells to survive, divide and defend against pathogens. But proteins do not work alone; they typically function in complex nanomachines made up of several up to hundreds of different proteins. During infection of higher organism, like plants, by bacteria and fungi, the pathogens &lsquo;inject&rsquo; their own proteins into the host cell to disrupt the function of normal cellular machines that make up the immune system. These pathogen &lsquo;effectors&rsquo; block the plant immune response making the plant susceptible to infection. Therefore, understanding how the pathogen blocks immune machinery in the plant cell is an important step to understanding the causes of disease at a molecular level. Because we lose up to 30% of our crops to pathogens, this is an important thing to understand. But identifying the protein-protein interactions that define multiprotein complexes is very difficult, and teasing out the subset of pathogen protein-host protein interactions among the larger set of interactions is extremely difficult and costly. We developed a new, high throughput method that takes advantage of next generation, low costs DNA sequencing to study protein-protein interactions. In this NSF EAGER project, we adapted that method to identify interactions between plant proteins and pathogen proteins from three distinct classes of plant pathogens, bacteria, fungi and oomycetes. We carefully optimized the steps required to make the libraries of DNA representing the genes expressed in plant cells growing normally or under attack. We used these libraries in test experiments against a panel of know bacterial effector proteins to benchmark our technique. We are now prepared to perform the large scale experiments to identify novel plant targets of pathogens from which no set of effector proteins is available. This project combined two complimentary sets of expertise from two labs and could not have been done without a funding mechanism like EAGER which supports the development of novel ideas for which little or no previous data is available.
