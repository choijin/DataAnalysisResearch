<AbstractNarration>The Workshop on Higher-Order Asymptotics and Post-Selection Inference (WHOA-PSI) will be held on the campus of Washington University in St. Louis from September 30-October 2, 2016. (See http://www.math.wustl.edu/~kuffner/WHOA-PSI.html.) Post-selection inference is relevant to virtually all areas of statistical application. Higher-order asymptotics provides the tools and insights needed to refine basic large-sample results for post-selection inference procedures, and make them more accurate in the practically realistic setting of small to moderate sample sizes. WHOA-PSI seeks to merge these fields, foster collaboration and discussion, and push forward the post-selection inference research frontier in the direction of higher-order accuracy for inference procedures. NSF funding will provide travel support for junior researchers to attend this conference.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Washington University will host a workshop on higher order asymptotics and post-selection inference September 30 ? October 2, 206. Speakers include Brad Efron, Jianqing Fan, and Rob Tibshirani. This workshop attempts to address the needs of applied statisticians utilizing model selection procedures who also need extremely accurate inference procedures. The workshop will begin with tutorials on the main topics. This award provides funding for junior researchers to attend the conference.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The purpose of this project was to provide support for junior and underrepresented researchers to participate in the Workshop on Higher-Order Asymptotics and Post-Selection Inference (WHOA-PSI), which took place at Washington University in St. Louis from September 30 - October 2, 2016. The primary scientific goal of the workshop was to improve the accuracy of existing methods of post-selection inference, and to use insights from other inferential problems to develop new methods for inference after model selection which are valid, accurate, and powerful. This was accomplished by bringing together researchers from the relatively new field of post-selection inference, and experts on analytic- and resampling-based refinements to large sample distribution theory. Other goals included advertising applied problems in need of post-selection inference procedures, and encouraging the higher-order asymptotics community to turn its attention towards the challenge of inference after model selection. Of the 78 total participants from 35 institutions, there were 24 were graduate students, 1 undergraduate student, 4 post-docs, and 15 assistant professors. Participants attended tutorials on both higher-order asymptotics and post-selection inference, given by the PI. The research program gave participants the opportunity to learn about the frontier of statistical inference methodology. The workshop included a broad selection of different viewpoints, which enhanced the participants' understanding of the challenges that are unique to post-selection inference. In particular, researchers from the high-dimensional inference paradigm, as well as those working on simultaneous and selective inference, were all represented in the research program.&nbsp;</p> <p><br />The workshop program featured 24 invited talks and 10 poster presentations. The organizing committee members were Todd Kuffner (Washington University in St. Louis), John Kolassa (Rutgers University), Nancy Reid (University of Toronto), Ryan Tibshirani (Carnegie Mellon University) and Alastair Young (Imperial College London). The senior invited speakers included Xiao-Li Meng (Harvard University), Jianqing Fan (Princeton University), Xihong Lin (Harvard University), Peter McCullagh (University of Chicago), Florentina Bunea (Cornell University), Richard Samworth (University of Cambridge), John Robinson (University of Sydney), Daniel Yekutieli (Tel Aviv University), Nicola Sartori (University of Padova), Don Fraser (University of Toronto), Annie Qu (University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign), Robert Tibshirani (Stanford University), Larry Brown and Andreas Buja (both from University of Pennsylvania). This project provided financial support for 18 junior participants, including many from underrepresented groups. Of these 18 junior participants, 10 presented posters, and 8 were invited speakers. The NSF support for this workshop significantly increased the number of junior speakers and poster presenters from other universities. The talks were followed by lively discussions, and frequent breaks for collaborative interactions. The junior participants had ample opportunities to interact with all of the senior researchers.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 08/01/2017<br>      Modified by: Todd&nbsp;A&nbsp;Kuffner</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
