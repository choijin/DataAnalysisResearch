<AbstractNarration>The Discovery Research K-12 program (DRK-12) seeks to significantly enhance the learning and teaching of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) by preK-12 students and teachers, through research and development of innovative resources, models and tools (RMTs). Projects in the DRK-12 program build on fundamental research in STEM education and prior research and development efforts that provide theoretical and empirical justification for proposed projects. This proposal seeks to design a next generation diagnostic assessment using learning progressions and other research (in the learning sciences) to support middle grades mathematics teaching and learning.  It will focus on nine large content ideas, and associated Common Core State Standards for Mathematics.  The PIs will track students over time, and work within school districts to ensure feasibility and use of the assessment system. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The research will build on prior funding by multiple funding agencies and address four major goals. The partnership seeks to address these goals: 1) revising and strengthening the diagnostic assessments in mathematics by adding new item types and dynamic tools for data gathering 2) studying alternative ways to use measurement models to assess student mathematical progress over time using the concept of learning trajectories, 3) investigating how to assist students and teachers to effectively interpret reports on math progress, both at the individual and the class level, and 4) engineering and studying instructional strategies based on student results and interpretations, as they are implemented within competency-based and personalized learning classrooms. The learning map, assessment system, and analytics are open source and can be used by other research and implementation teams. The project will exhibit broad impact due to the number of states, school districts and varied kinds of schools seeking this kind of resource as a means to improve instruction.  Finally, the research project contributes to the nationally supported move to create, use, and apply research based open educational resources at scale.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   Students, parents, and teachers need to know what students know, what they need to know, and how to get there, especially now when education relies on extensive online learning. To provide more precise and reliable feedback on student learning, we created a digital diagnostic assessment system, "Math-Mapper 6-8" (MM6-8) (at sudds.co), that measures students' progress along learning trajectories (LTs). Learning trajectories, which are research-based detailed descriptions of how students make progress toward target math concepts and skills, allow us to give precise feedback to students--and their teachers--about how they are progressing. We liken an LT to a set of possible paths up a climbing wall, showing handholds and footholds for learning and warnings of the predictable obstacles along the way. Students may take various paths, but if teachers know the common ones, they can strengthen learner-centered instruction and support greater proficiency (figure 1). MM6-8 assessments are integrated into students' ongoing instruction. The data allow teachers and students to take immediate action to meet individual needs: the assessments are scored digitally and returned in easy-to-read and -understand reports (See figures 2 and 3). The teachers? reports show them which students need more help in a particular concept and which particular LT-levels need to be retaught.  These diagnostic assessments are situated in an intuitive learning map, which identifies 11 big ideas of middle grades mathematics and Algebra 1 (figure 4). Zooming in on the map reveals clusters of related concepts, and, ultimately, the underlying learning trajectories by grade and level (figure 5). The map also links to free online set resource materials organized by those same clusters.  The project's intellectual merit rests in the depth of its synthesis of the international research into LTs  for an entire grade band 6-9. The project contributed to a new genre of "classroom assessments", intended for formative use, to systematically provide evidence of all students' learning over time and identify their learning needs. In contrast to tests designed to directly measure standards or to simply sample topics from across sub-domains, LT-based assessment provides "ordered feedback" telling users what they have learned, what is missing, and what needs to come next. The suite of assessment types include: single items from a 2200 item bank written expressly for the levels of the trajectory, assessments of single LTs, or of entire clusters, tailored to the student's grade level. Students can independently access practice and tests.  Research on the project occurred in two threads:   1. Development of a process to continuously validate the LT structure and associated item difficulty, using item response theory and sequential regression. Importantly, this involved a novel collaboration of psychometricians, learning scientists, and practitioners. After three rounds of validation, 97% of the 61 LTs showed moderate (27%) or strong (70%) correlations to the expected item difficulty by levels. 2. Study of partner teachers' use of data to improve instruction. Three factors differentiate more vs. less effective use of the MM data. More successful teachers are able to: a) successfully and supportively shift from a summative to a formative orientation, b) show their own stronger understanding of the content of the LTs (concepts), and c) take specific actions warranted by the data. Less successful teachers' use of data was characterized by failure to attend to the overall structure of the LT, excessive focus on the item without considering the meaning of its LT level, and less precise language to describe and diagnose students' difficulties. The project's broad impact has been demonstrated in a variety of ways. Across three collaborating districts in 3 states, 391 teachers received significant professional development in the underlying learning trajectories, and 12,969 students have taken 55,907 assessments. During frequent grade-level professional learning communities (PLCs), teachers shared data, collectively discussed successful approaches, and planned for long term curricular changes when warranted. The project team named this ongoing use of feedback to adjust and strengthen curriculum and instruction in short and long feedback cycles as "the agile curriculum" (figure 6). An investigation into the data used multiple regression to include MM usage (count of assessments taken), performance variables (mean percent correct on assessments), previous End-of-Year (EOY) performance, and context variables (e.g., grade, gender, race, year). The regression results universally suggest that MM usage and performance variables are significant positive predictors of EOY score across districts and years (although there are variations). The results suggest that, after controlling for previous EOY performance, there are no significant differences in MM performance by race or gender, meaning that MM is neither creating nor increasing gaps among student groups, showing MM6-8 benefits accrue equally to all students.  The project also resulted in the formation of a start-up company, The Math Door, which is commercializing the product and working to extend the underlying model to additional grades and subjects.
