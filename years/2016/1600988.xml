<AbstractNarration>The Historically Black Colleges and Universities-Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP) Research Initiation Awards (RIAs) provide support to STEM junior faculty at HBCUs who are starting to build a research program, as well as for mid-career faculty who may have returned to the faculty ranks after holding an administrative post or who need to redirect and rebuild a research program. Faculty members may pursue research at their home institution, at an NSF-funded Center, at a research intensive institution or at a national laboratory. The RIA projects are expected to help further the faculty member's research capability and effectiveness, to improve research and teaching at his or her home institution, and to involve undergraduate students in research experiences. With support from the National Science Foundation, West Virginia State University (WVSU) will conduct research to provide in-depth knowledge on the molecular mechanisms that regulate seed storage compounds, including the identification and characterization of genes that regulate the storage of lipids, starch, and proteins in seeds. This project will strengthen WVSU's plant biosciences research program, ensure student achievement in research, and the creation of a pipeline of graduates who will go on to pursue STEM careers in the plant sciences.  In addition, this project will enhance intra-and inter-institutional interdisciplinary research collaborations and provide collaborative mentoring of students. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this project is to elucidate the mechanisms of action of cupins and their associated gene networks in plant nutrient metabolism and storage pathways using the Arabidopsis model. Specifically, this study aims to: 1) determine whether cupins are required for seed storage compound regulation in Arabidopsis, 2) determine if ectopic expression of cupins in Arabidopsis alters the production of seed compounds and plant physiology and growth, and 3) characterize the transcriptome signature of wild-type and cupin mutant Arabidopsis plants that produce varying levels of seed storage compounds.  Findings from this work will determine whether cupins, a previously unidentified network of proteins, are master regulators of seed storage compound metabolism. Cupins may significantly reduce the negative effects of current agricultural practices on the environment, including overuse of arable land and water and increased use of fertilizers and pesticides. This work will be conducted in collaboration with the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. The research and educational activities will advance the academic mission of WVSU.</AbstractNarration>
