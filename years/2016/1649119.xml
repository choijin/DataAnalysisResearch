<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project involves a low cost, highly versatile platform technology for development of bioassay systems. The initial objective is to be able to evaluate biomarkers of health and disease using point-of-care and/or in-the-field-settings. A set of minimal requirements to make high impact applications include turn-key operations, ultra-sensitivity, and superior accuracy for internal standardization to allow for simultaneous analysis of multiple biomolecules. Using  specialized nanomaterials as sensors for trace amounts is an arena ripe for development. The integration of molecular sensing technologies with biomolecular detection and separation on a simple, adsorbent sensor creates opportunity to pursue unmet medical needs for early detection and diagnosis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project is based upon self-assembly of chemical components to create new organometallic composite materials with molecular signatures suitable for single molecule detection by Raman spectroscopy. A growing family of chemical sensors capable of quantitative analysis using surface-enhanced Raman opens avenues for both fundamental and applied inquiry. In complex mixtures, the special 'fingerprints' of specific chemical dyes become characteristics that are uniquely detectable by Raman. The use of stable isotope variants of these dyes provides a series of chemically-identical materials whose distinctions can be revealed by Raman. What is available now are a set of 'chemical barcodes' that stimulate intense interest in several fields ranging from theoretical studies of single molecule detection to the field of molecular diagnostics in medicine. The creative methods for making the new materials and the resulting physiochemical properties open distinctive new avenues for creation of nanoscale optical sensors. New substrates for embedding the resulting nanomaterials for practical assay development is integral to the next phase of technology development. The creation of materials with robust single-molecule signals, new substrates, and assay work-flows will also inspire new design and fabrication of instrumentation that can move applications directly to the field for consumers.</AbstractNarration>
