<AbstractNarration>The International Conference on Cognitive Modeling (ICCM) brings together researchers who use computational modeling to understand human cognition. ICCM is a forum for presenting, discussing, and evaluating the spectrum of cognitive modeling approaches, including connectionism, symbolic modeling, dynamical systems, Bayesian modeling, and cognitive architectures. It encompasses basic and applied research across a wide variety of domains. Major research areas include perception, attention, problem-solving and learning as well as using computational models to better understand neuroimaging data.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will serve to enhance student participation and enrich diversity in the conference by providing support for graduate students from groups that are underrepresented in science who would not otherwise be able to participate. A special event will bring together student awardees with faculty mentors, to facilitate student involvement in the meeting. The award will also fund an early-career invited speaker with expertise in cognitive modeling who might serve as a possible role model to the sponsored students.</AbstractNarration>
