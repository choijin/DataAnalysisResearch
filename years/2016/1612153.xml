<AbstractNarration>This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology for FY 2016, Research Using Biological Collections. The fellowship supports a research and training plan for the Fellow to take transformative approaches to grand challenges in biology that employ biological collections in highly innovative ways. The title of the research plan for this fellowship to Michael Landis is "Modeling ecological niche and geographical range co-evolution in the nightshade family (Solanaceae)." The host institution for this fellowship is Yale University, and the sponsoring scientist is Michael Donoghue.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this research project is to develop a model of geographic range and ecological niche evolution, and apply the model to a family of ecologically diverse and geographically widespread plants, the nightshade family (Solanaceae). Adaptation to novel ecological conditions is common throughout the tree of life, and understanding how, when, and why ecological adaptation occurs has far-reaching applications in areas such as conservation biology, epidemiology, and agricultural science. Because species tend to conserve the ecological niche of their ancestors, and because species adapt to the local conditions found within or abutting their geographical ranges, analyzing this process requires a unified approach that incorporates ecological, geographical, and evolutionary perspectives. Advanced statistical models and inference approaches can be a powerful means of reconstructing evolutionary histories, especially in absence of hard evidence such as fossils. To this end, the Fellow is producing software to estimate how groups of closely related species evolve in response to ecological and geographical factors. Applying the method to environments everywhere from the Atacama Desert to the Tibetan Plateau, the Fellow is characterizing how plants in the Solanaceae family colonized Earth's most extreme environments. To inform the method, the Fellow is developing 'pipeline' tools to integrate molecular, geographical, and ecological data from online biological databases. These data will be supplemented with museum specimens from several major national botanical collections, including the Missouri Botanical Garden, the New York Botanic Garden, and the Harvard University Herbaria, and the Yale Peabody Museum.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Fellow is gaining valuable experience in conducting empirical research, a significant departure from his dissertation research, which was theoretical and consisted entirely of modeling. By working with the curators and collections of various museums, the Fellow is learning how to diagnose morphological characters using preserved and fossilized specimens. The Fellow is leading workshops in statistical phylogenetics, thereby allowing him improve his teaching skills and develop new collaborations. To advance his mentoring skills, the Fellow is training biology undergraduates through the Yale Science, Technology and Research Scholars (STARS) program, focusing on computational and statistical skills. Through community outreach programs, the Fellow is refining his ability to communicate scientific findings in plant evolution to high school students (Yale Science Diplomats) and amateur botanists (Green Caf√©). Software produced during the fellowship is open-source and freely available to the research community.</AbstractNarration>

We expect, for example, that ancestral lineages are unlikely to shift biomes into the cold temperate forests of the Northern hemisphere during the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM; ~55 million years ago) when tropical and warm temperate forests extended to the North Pole. Similarly, any lineage located in an equatorial region would always find it difficult to shift into cold temperate biomes, since those regions have been dominated by hotter and more tropical biomes for hundreds of millions of years. Gaining insight into how easily ancestral lineages evolved to shift between biomes provides crucial context for understanding how modern lineages might adapt or migrate in response to today's changing climate.<br /><br />To study this problem, I developed a new phylogenetic model that captures the time-dependent and region-dependent nature of modeling how lineages shift between biomes (Figure 1). The project involved translating stochastic process theory for modeling continuous-time Markov chains with time-heterogeneous rate matrix structures to represent the spatiotemporal biome shift process. Applying the model to a biological system, I worked with my Scientific Sponsor---evolutionary biologist and botanist, Michael Donoghue at Yale---to develop a phylogenetic dataset for the predominantly northern, temperate plant group, Viburnum (Adoxaceae). Collecting this dataset required me to learn new concepts in planty diversity and anatomy, molecular biology, paleontology, paleoclimatology, and systematics. As part of this training, I participated in botanical fieldwork, to work with the Peabody Museum, and to take several courses in botany and systematics. Applying our new model to estimate the ancestral biome affinity of Viburnum shows they probability originated in warm temperate or tropical forests ~65 Mya during the hot and humid PETM mentioned earlier (Figure 2). I contrasted this result with a naive analysis that represents current practice of ancestral biome estimation: using models that ignore spatiotemporal effects or assume that Earth's current distribution of biomes (which are relatively cold and arid) recover ancestral biomes for Viburnum that prefer cold temperate origins (Figure 3).<br /><br />What this work shows is that by integrating evolutionary, geographical, and palebiological data and by designing more realistic evolutionary models, we improve our understanding for how lineages adapt to changing ecological and climatological conditions on Earth. Because the modeling software is open source, the work provides a framework for other scientists to reconstruct how lineages evolved to new biomes over space and time.<br /><br />The NSF PRFB granted me many opportunities to share my research with a wider community of biologists, broadening its impact. I taught in several workshops, including at the Workshop in Molecular Evolution at Marine Biology Laboratories in Woods Hole, the Applied Bayesian Phylogenetics Workshop at Bodega Bay (UC Davis), along with a short course in Bayesian phylogenetics using RevBayes for Yale graduate students and postdocs. During my fellowship, I presented my NSF-funded research at two international conferences, four departmental seminars, and numerous local seminars.<br /><br />The NSF PRFB also allowed me to develop several new collaborations to studying related topics on phylogenetic models of evolution, including models of host-parasite evolution, geography-dependent diversification models, models of pulsed trait evolution, models of interspecific trait and range evolution, and two book chapters teaching concepts in the application of phylogenetic models.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 04/27/2019<br>      Modified by: Michael&nbsp;Landis</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1612153/1612153_10423623_1556384820935_fig1_biome_shift_cartoon--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1612153/1612153_10423623_1556384820935_fig1_biome_shift_cartoon--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 1 - Cartoon of biome shift model"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1612153/1612153_10423623_1556384820935_fig1_biome_shift_cartoon--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 1 - Cartoon of biome shift model"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Cartoon of relationship between paleobiome structure and a regional biome shift process.
