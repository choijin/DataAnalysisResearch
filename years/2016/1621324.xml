<AbstractNarration>The creation and dissemination of new and useful research tools and data is critical to scientific progress. This workshop will bring together groups from such diverse and varied science research domains as biomedicine, physical sciences, computer science, linguistics, information science, and the social sciences to collectively discuss areas of interest, share findings and methods, and coordinate future goals and planning related to improving the norms and practices for scientific software and data citation and attribution. This work will contribute to properly recognizing and rewarding those who create and add value to the data and software tools relied on in scientific research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Participants in this workshop hail from highly diverse and scientifically distinct areas and fields of research, and as such, have relatively few opportunities to interact face-to-face to share ideas, exchange knowledge and coordinate efforts. This workshop will offer an opportunity for cross-domain coordination, interaction and collaboration between a diverse set of researchers committed to the common goal of improving the systems and methods of citation and attribution of scientific software and data. Workshop participants will engage in extensive attendee-wide discussions on topics related to tools and resources, cross-domain convergence of efforts, and previous and ongoing community efforts regarding software and data citation in science research. Participants will also engage directly with external experts invited to give their perspectives and facilitate community discussion. Written reports suitable for publication from all sessions and panels will be prepared by meeting participants at the culmination of the workshop. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Recognizing an ongoing need to improve the practices, systems and metrics for measuring, promoting and incentivizing the creation and dissemination of scientific data and software tools, the National Science Foundation through its DCL on Supporting Scientific Discovery through Norms and Practices for Software and Data Citation and Attribution, has engaged multiple, interdisciplinary, cross-domain research groups to address and investigate these issues.  In June of 2016, researchers, librarians, advocates and policy makers met for a two-day conference at Harvard Medical School to discuss how to repair and improve the current system of citation and attribution that is failing to incentivize, reward and recognize critical contributors to research data and software. Sponsored by the National Science Foundation Software Infrastructure for Sustain Innovation (SI2), attendees hailed from backgrounds and areas of science as diverse as biomedical research, geophysics, linguistics, social sciences, atmospheric research, astrophysics, engineering, scientific computation, information science, and others. Each came representing their particular field, but all came to address and discuss common problems of how to fairly and effectively give credit and recognition to those individuals who create and add value to the data, tools and resources scientists rely on in their research.   A key topic of discussion was the role of intra and cross-disciplinary citation and attribution standards. While the details of these standards differ across research disciplines, many seemed to have independently arrived at a common set of general data and software citation and sharing principles. The summary of the workshop has been submitted for publication as a workshop report.           Last Modified: 01/03/2018       Submitted by: Piotr Sliz]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
