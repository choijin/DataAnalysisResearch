<AbstractNarration>This is an INSPIRE award that was co-funded by the Biosciences Directorate, Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences (MCB), Systems and Synthetic Biology (SSB) program, and the Engineering Directorate, Division of Civil, Mechanical, and Manufacturing Innovation (CMMI), Dynamics, Control and System Diagnostics (DCSD) program. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Beneficial and pathogenic bacteria alike, commonly interact with host cells along mucosal epithelia. These surfaces are often lined with dense fields of motile cilia that serve both a biomechanical function for generating mucociliary flows, and a biochemical function to detect and present molecular signals. The goal of this project is to investigate a the dynamic association of healthy and diseased ciliated tissues.  The project posits that cilia-generated flows influence bacteria-host interactions, thereby challenging the conventional view in biology that attributes bacterial recruitment mostly to active bacterial behavior and passive diffusion, ignoring the effect of cilia-generated flows on both motility and mass transport.  The broader impacts of this study are that this project provides excellent educational and training opportunities at the intersection of disciplines, while also generating new insight in microbial host colonization that are likely to reveal avenues for impactful strategies to block pathogenic bacteria from colonizing the host, while enhancing the colonization potential of beneficial organisms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The approach incorporates interdisciplinary methods, ranging from cutting-edge imaging and genetic tools to novel microfluidic technologies, all combined with powerful mathematical and computational framework, to investigate this fundamental problem in bacteria-host associations, namely, the role of cilia-generated flows in shaping these associations. The project will build a quantitative and predictive model that is informed by experimental assays in two complementary model systems:&lt;br/&gt;1.  In vivo invertebrate model: the squid-vibrio system, an intact animal host operating in its natural fluid environment, will be used to study how the host's ciliated epithelium initiates contact with its native, flow-borne bacterial community. Events in the squid-vibrio association share remarkable similarities with host responses to human-relevant pathogens, while still being accessible to imaging and experimental manipulation.&lt;br/&gt;2. In silico microfluidics: properly designed microfluidic channels will be used as a tool to analyze the response of bacterial cells to carefully controlled microenvironment. This approach is aimed at complementing the  squid-vibrio studies by providing a platform that isolates the chemical gradients and flow shear gradients observed in the in vivo model, thus allowing to unravel the mechanisms dictating bacterial behavior and possibly triggering the changes in bacterial gene expressions causing the transition from free-swimming to biofilm state.</AbstractNarration>

However, ciliated surfaces seem to also provide an entryway and habitat for co-evolved symbionts, suggesting that the view of a strict barrier function to mucociliary flows is too simplistic.  In this INSPIRE grant, we examined the flow physics of ciliated tissues in association with environmental bacteria and demonstrated that mucociliary membranes can create fluid-mechanical microenvironments for the active recruitment of the specific microbiome of the host, thus challenging the conventional view of a strict barrier function to mucociliary flows.  Mucosal tissues in the upper airways, for example, are home to complex microbial consortia containing but are inaccessible to observation.

This cilia-mediated process represents a previously unrecognized flow-based mechanism for symbiont recruitment.   Together with this major discovery, we made contributions in the following areas.   (1) We developed in-vivo experimental assays using the squid-vibrio system and in-vitro microfluidic assays for quantifying cilia-driven flows using Particle Image Velocimetry techniques and examining bacterial behavior in flows.   (2) We developed light field microscopy (LFM) for visualizing fast 3-dimensional (3D) flow patterns in which a 2D camera captures the complete spatial angular information of a visual scene and computation is applied to reconstruct the 3D visual scene.
