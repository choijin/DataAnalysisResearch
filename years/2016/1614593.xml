<AbstractNarration>The 13th meeting of the International Society for Bayesian Analysis (ISBA) will take place in Cagliari, Sardinia, Italy, from June 13-17, 2016. (See https://bayesian.org/content/isba-2016-world-meeting.) The International Society for Bayesian Analysis (ISBA, www.bayesian.org) was established in 1992. Its mission is to promote the development and application of Bayesian statistical theory and methods useful in the solution of theoretical and applied problems in science, industry and government. The ISBA meetings are important venues for the exchange of research ideas in Bayesian statistics. This award will provide funding for US Ph.D. students to attend and participate in this meeting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This meeting on Bayesian analysis will be held June 13-17, 2016, in Sardinia. The conference will include short courses, oral presentations, and poster sessions. The oral presentations include the De Finetti Lecture by Persi Diaconis (Stanford University) and the Susie Bayarri Lecture by James Scott (University of Texas). NSF funding will allow US Ph.D. students to attend and participate in this meeting.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This is the interim report for the NSF Award 1614593, ''Travel Support for the 13th ISBA World Meeting on Bayesian Statistics.''  The conference was held in Sardinia on June 13-17, 2016.  I apologize for being tardy.  The Scientific Committee of the ISBA 2016 World Meeting received a total of 52 applications for travel support from graduate students at U.S. institutions.   The applications were reviewed and ranked by a selection committee, which consisted of the chair of the Scientific Committee of the ISBA 2016 World Meeting (Michele Guindani, Associate Professor, Deparment of Statistics, University of California, Irvine, USA), the ISBA 2016 program chair (Chris Hans, Associate Professor, Deparment of Statistics, The Ohio State University, USA) and the ISBA 2016 program chair-elect  (Clair Alston-Knox, Statistician, Griffith Social and Behavioural Research College, Queensland, Australia).  The committee members were asked to identify all women and minority  applicants who were judged to be within the top 50% of the applications. The final allocation aimed at funding  all women and minority applicants who were judged to be within the top 50% of the applications.  A total of 49 applications were deemed fundable using funds obtained from Federal agencies (NSF and ONR), as well as contributions from public companies (Google, STATA and RStudio), in addition to funds put forward  directly by ISBA.  No applicant was fully funded; rather, the committee's purpose was to supplement support from advisors or universities or other sources, thereby spreading the available money among as many applicants as possible to ensure maximum attendance.  As a result of the funding provided specifically by the NSF, we were able to provide supplemental support for 34 applications from graduate students at U.S. institutions.  Of the 34 applications directly supported through NSF funding, 14 were from female researchers. In terms of race ethnicity, 18 recipients identified themselves as White, 13 as Asian, 1 as Black African-American, 1 as Hispanic Latino, 1 as Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander.   Tables 1, 2, and 3 summarize the funded applications by gender, race ethnicity, and amount given to the recipient, respectively, for all of the US PhD student applicants funded by ISBA.  Those funded by the NSF are broken out separately in each table. The column Other US Funds refers to non-NSF money that was earmarked for US insitutions.   The following text is the template of the email communication sent to awardees to notify them of the grant support offered by the NSF:  Dear X,  I am particularly glad to confirm that the Scientific Committee will offer you a travel support grant for the participation at the ISBA World Meeting 2016.  The current support level is set at US $Y.  The funds are kindly provided by NSF.  In order to have your reimbursement processed, after the conference, you will need to upload a single pdf file with scanned receipts of your travel expenses (e.g., flight with boarding passes, registration, taxis, hotel), by accessing the following website:   http://travelsupport.isba2016.org   You will have to enter the following login information:  Username: Xname  Password: Ypassword  Please, save this information for your records.   You will need to be a current member of ISBA.  You should acknowledge the source of your funding in your presentation at the meeting, for instance, by adding the line:  Acknowledgment:  Participation in this conference was supported by the  "NSF ISBA junior travel support."  We request that you kindly let us know if your plans have changed and you are no longer planning to participate in the ISBA meeting, so that we can update the program and release the funds to other attendees.  Please, feel free to contact me for any clarification or specific need you might have.  We are all looking forward to seeing you in Sardinia!  With best regards, Michele Guindani on behalf of the Scientific Committee of ISBA 2016         Last Modified: 09/11/2017       Submitted by: David L Banks]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
