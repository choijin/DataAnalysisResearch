<AbstractNarration>With support from the Divisions of Chemistry (Chemical Measurement and Imaging) and Biological Infrastructure (Instrument Development for Biological Research), Drs. Kai-Mei Fu and Paul Wiggins and their groups at the University of Washington are looking to build on a generation of single-molecule techniques enabling visualization of biochemical processes one molecule at a time.  These methods facilitate a mechanistic understanding of the fundamental biology, chemistry and physics underlying many of the most important biological processes in the cell.  Specifically, the team is developing a novel sensor for biophysical applications that can simultaneously measure the three-dimensional position and orientation of a nanoparticle probe. The proposed Magnetic-Probe-Imaging platform (MagPI) is expected to be widely-applicable to a range of biophysical problems where orientation and position are both of significance to biological function.  Research results will be disseminated broadly through local, national, and international conferences, publications, and laboratory research websites as well as through an advertised technical workshop on the method to facilitate its adoption by the chemical, biological, and biomedical research communities.  This work will also support graduate and undergraduate student training in a rich, interdisciplinary environment that combines physics, chemistry, engineering, and biology. It will provide support for a focused unit on "Biosensing and the Five Senses" that will be developed for an elementary-school science outreach program, with lesson plans available to the public through the outreach website&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research addresses three specific aims: (i) the targeted development of a MagPI to complement commercially-available pre-functionalized nanoparticles for ease of adoption; (ii) the integration of this platform into a Tethered-Particle-Motion (TPM) assay to demonstrate platform tractability in biophysical contexts; and (iii) a demonstration of the potential for this platform by detecting expected interconversions between distinct transcription-factor-DNA complex conformations in TPM assays. The MagPI probe is unbleachable and unblinking and therefore is ideally suited to applications where precision tracking of probe 3D-position and orientation could provide significant new insights, but long-timescale and high-temporal resolution imaging is required which precludes the use of single-molecule fluorescent probes. The probe and sensor is complementary and compatible with existing contrast generation mechanisms, including brightfield, scattering, and fluorescence. Orientation and position sensing are performed by imaging the magnetic dipole field generated by the nano-particle probe. The physical mechanism for magnetic-field imaging is the B-field-induced shift of the photo-luminescence intensity of nitrogen-vacancy centers in a diamond sensor.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This award sought to develop a wide-field optical microscope to dynamically image orientation of nanoscale magnets. The nanomagnets are functionalized to a biological sample of interest, in which the orientation of the magnet provides information on the biological system.  The magnetic particle imaging (MagPI) system is based on a 150 nm-thick sensing layer of nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond, a crystalline defect capable of transducing a magnetic signal to an optical one. Intellectual merit: The sensing surfaces were fabricated in collaboration with Institute for Advanced Industrial Science and Technology in Japan and the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory for optimal sensitivity for MagPI, including utilizing isotope purified 15N and 12C carbon. In order to detect the small, nanoparticle field we developed a new sensing protocol, double-double quantum (DDQ) driving, which eliminated non-magnetic noise due to strain across the sensor surface. With DDQ we demonstrated 15 Hz dynamic imaging of orientation of 500-nm-diameter commercial magnetic particles, tethered by DNA to the surface of diamond.  Broader impacts: Two PhD, one master?s and six undergraduate students received training in microscopy, magnetic imaging based on quantum defects, biophysics, field simulation and image analysis supported by this award. The instrument is now developed and ready for biosensing orientation experiments.       Last Modified: 12/21/2020       Submitted by: Kai-Mei Fu]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
