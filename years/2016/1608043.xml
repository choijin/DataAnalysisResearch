<AbstractNarration>Active Learning and Active Learning Classrooms have proven themselves as a valuable means to better engage STEM students, enhance their learning experience and increase their performance with respect to learning outcomes. One difficulty in providing more student access to Active Learning Classrooms is the associated cost of constructing or retrofitting existing classrooms is expensive and cost prohibitive for many institutions. Newer, more economical tools and approaches are needed to increase access and the evaluation of this new technology will add to a growing body of knowledge as to how Active Learning Technology and pedagogy work together to enhance student collaboration in the classroom and increase student performance and satisfaction in introductory Computer Science courses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will develop, deploy and evaluate an economical means of adapting existing classrooms to facilitate Active Learning for Computer Science students. Lightweight, commodity hardware running flexible, open-source software will be used to create a network of self-contained practical, active learning stations (PALS). These stations will then be deployed in an existing classroom to transform it into an Active Learning Classroom. The effectiveness of the PALS system will be evaluated through qualitative and quantitative data collected on student learning outcomes for CS1 and CS2 and perceived learning experience.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   Active learning classrooms have demonstrated value by supporting student-centered pedagogies, student collaboration and increases in learning outcomes.  A challenge to increasing student access to active learning classrooms and related active learning technology has been the cost, as it is not uncommon for the construction of a state-of-the-art active learning classroom to cost $250,000 or more.  To increase access to active learning classrooms, we developed Practical Active Learning Stations (PALS).  The PALS system greatly reduces the cost of transforming existing classrooms into active learning classrooms by leveraging commodity hardware, open source software, and existing classroom infrastructure.  PALS can be permanently installed in a classroom or deployed on an as needed basis to create flexible, active learning classrooms.  The approximate cost of a PALS equipped classroom is around $10,000. The effectiveness of the PALS system was evaluated through performance data collected on student learning outcomes in introductory computer science courses.  Students in the PALS equipped classroom performed on par with peers that made use of a dedicated, state-of-the-art active learning classroom.  Students' perceptions of the PALS system were also favorable, with students noting the ability of PALS to enable peer collaboration and sharing.  In short, the PALS system can be used by institutions, departments, and even enterprising instructors to increase student access to flexible, active learning classrooms.  Such spaces allow instructors to align student-centered pedagogies with the learning environment and more broadly encourage the use of such pedagogies.  To date, the PALS project has led to eight peer-reviewed publications and ten presentations at regional, national, and international venues.
