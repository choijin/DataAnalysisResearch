<AbstractNarration>This SBIR Phase I project addresses a critical need in medicine ? the ability to deliver drugs selectively to parts of the body that need medication.  Targeted drug delivery improves patient outcomes by treating tissues locally while reducing overall exposure and side effects elsewhere. For example, a cream or lotion type product which moves anti-inflammatory drugs through skin specifically to an affected joint is better than taking a pill which medicates the entire body. Nanoparticles, especially liposomes (nanometer size water balloons consisting of a fatty wall surrounding an aqueous interior) are useful for targeted drug delivery because of their ability to move through biological barriers including skin. Unfortunately, use of liposomes is limited because the drug carrying capacity is too small, especially for water insoluble drugs.  Lipoleosomes are a new type of liposome with a much greater carrying capacity for drugs.  The objective of this project is to make lipoleosomes with ibuprofen, a water-insoluble drug and demonstrate the ability to move ibuprofen through skin for localized treatment of joints and muscles. This will be valuable for developing a lotion product to treat arthritis and injuries while avoiding stomach problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The creation of lipoleosomes resulted from a remarkable discovery ? that under certain conditions, flat fatty layers (lipid bilayers) existing in microemulsions can be reshaped by hydration into spherical liposome form. Because microemulsion lipid bilayers can contain large amounts of water-insoluble (hydrophobic) compounds (easily up to 65%), so can the product liposomes. Previously, hydrophobic drug content of liposomes rarely exceeded 5%. In light of the extraordinarily greater drug capacity, the new liposomes were named lipoleosomes, indicating a liposome into which organic compounds (oleo) have been inserted.  It is a scientific curiosity that some microemulsion lipid layers reshape to give membrane structures because in the past, hydration had only been known to give filled emulsion droplets which do not have the important biological features of liposomes. In this project, the quality and yield of lipoleosomes and their biological characteristics will be improved by understanding the influence of precursor microemulsion properties and processing conditions. This will result in the availability of new, biologically effective lipoleosomal ibuprofen compositions and methods of synthesis, plus physical and biometric data that supports submission of a new drug application for a topical ibuprofen lotion or cream. Establishing lipoleosomes as a new type of nanoparticle has implications for many other drugs and for routes of administration other than dermal.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Project Outcomes  Lipoleosomes as Carriers for Topical Ibuprofen Award Number 1647292  Dynation LLC, Principal Investigator Dr. Eric D. Morrison    Arthritis pain and inflammation is a chronic disease affecting 52.5 million United States (US) adults (23% of the population) and costing upwards of $189 billion annually.   Arthritis sufferers demand a therapy that is effective to eliminate pain and inflammation, be substantially free from side effects and risk, and can be used daily for years without any harmful side effects.   In this project, a new topical Ibuprofen lotion (current product form) was developed based on nanoparticle dispersions that provide up to 10X the dermal flux of pharmacologically active S-(+)-ibuprofen compared to that of Dolorgeit Proff Schmerz Cr&egrave;me, a commercial topical ibuprofen cream available in Europe.  Ibuprofen cream products are not available in the US, and Dolorgeit, among others, are not effective to treat arthritis.  It is estimated that the flux of active ibuprofen through skin from these products is about 4X too low.      In Figure 1 we show a comparison of the flux of ibuprofen for Dolorgeit Proff Schmerz Cr&egrave;me and our nanoparticles. These results were obtained by measuring the concentration of ibuprofen on the back side of human skin that has lotion or cream on the front side.   To be a viable product, other requirements must also be met including stable product form, patentable, non-irritating, economical, manufacturable, and composed of US Food and Drug Administration approved inert ingredients.   In Figure 2, we show our ibuprofen nanoparticles in a lotion product form.  Based on our exciting results, it is now conceivable to fill nanoparticles with other drugs in a way that allows them to permeate the skin. This supports a new technology for local delivery of drugs to specific tissues requiring medication.  We have also discovered a method of making nanoparticles that is scalable at the commercial level enabling production at facilities worldwide in the thousands of kilograms range to address the growing demand from arthritis sufferers.
