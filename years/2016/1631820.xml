<AbstractNarration>Proposal 1631820&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title: &lt;br/&gt;Focused Electrical Stimulator for Targeted Neuromodulation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nontechnical description&lt;br/&gt;In the past 150 years researchers have persistently explored how the brain works, the underlying function and mechanism of each individual anatomical brain structure as well as their combined brain networks. Invasive neuromodulation methods like deep brain stimulation are effective in treating essential tremor, Parkinson's disease, and dystonia. But it is not plausible to perform brain surgery for every research volunteer subject or to effectively research DBS effects across different brain regions. The ability to activate or block brain circuits at any desired location with innovative neuromodulation techniques can help to not only understand how the brain works but also aid in the development of novel approaches to treat neural diseases. The objective of this project is the development and application of a non-invasive technology to modulate neuronal activity in precise brain regions, to ultimately alter behavioral output. The technology will have a huge impact in both the science and the application to the brain to alter behavior. Development of such a technology can lead to selective non-invasive brain circuit targeting for therapeutic treatment of brain diseases. It will also lead to other new innovations through new understanding of brain function and circuitry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical description&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this project is the development and application of a non-invasive technology to modulate neuronal activity in precise brain regions, to ultimately alter behavioral output. Development of such a technology can lead to selective non-invasive brain circuit targeting for therapeutic treatment of brain diseases. The first aim supports this objective with development of a method to deliver a focused transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) tool, termed confocal alternating current stimulator (CACS), into deep (and superficial) brain regions. The second aim will test the ability of focused CACS to alter fine motor behavior (i.e limb movements). The third aim will use a valid model of depression to induce antidepressant outcomes with CACS treatment.  Aims 2 and 3 directly apply the CACS technology to specific brain regions for focused neuromodulation, to alter behavioral output. They will determine the efficacy and safety of CACS as a non-invasive neuromodulation technology by probing a neuronal activation marker, as well markers that indicate neuronal damage and death. The proposal builds upon a large body of evidence demonstrating altered behavioral output and improved symptomatology in neurological and psychiatric patients with invasive methodologies to alter brain circuit function. Once developed and tested, the CACS technology will have a huge impact in both the science and the application to the field of brain research.</AbstractNarration>
