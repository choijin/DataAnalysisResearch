<AbstractNarration>This project seeks to understand how inaccurate messages are propagated over large-scale information networks that are consumed by the general public, how the public responds to such inaccuracy, and what content- or metadata-related characteristics/features make certain messages more error-resistant or error-prone than others.  The results of the project have the potential to help build a platform that accurately identifies errors being propagated on an information network and effectively manages/controls such error propagation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The technical objective of this project involves the design of efficient information extraction techniques that properly extract features from microblog-like messages that are short and often noisy. Specifically, it aims to develop a variety of content models, e.g., graph-based modeling, sentiment-based coding, and shingle- and user-frequency based metrics to make the information extraction techniques more resilient to the noise and high volume commonly present on real-world microblog platforms.  The project also includes a case study over a large-scale real-world microblog platform to test the effectiveness of the proposed approaches and their superiority over the existing techniques.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit:  This research has developed a methodology to detect propagation of a rumor on social media, by tagging similar and rephrased messages to curb the reach of the malicious or mis-information. The same methodology can also be employed to trace the origin of a rumor and identify the user that started the mis-information campaign. On a manually tagged data set of tweets pertaining to the rumors associated with the Boston marathon bombing event, the method produced significantly better results than a standard text matching approach. One of the key issues, when dealing with data coming from social media platforms, is the volume of messages.  This research has also developed a methodology using the word-to-vector model to conceptualize more than 100 zika-related variables, such as diagnosis, symptoms, threat, etc. It investigated the role of several of these variables in error propagation. It found that threat and severity cues as well as protection and fear response significantly impacted the sharing of erroneous news. The research also examined the role of spatial distance and psychological distance (including social and temporal distance) in error propagation. More specifically, it found that closer proximity to virus outbreak both in time and space positively affected the sharing of erroneous news.     In a separate work, we have developed new methods to embed the unstructured text information into a fixed vector representation, in near-real time.     Broader Impact:  The outcomes have a potential to make a broad impact on the society, as it makes a key contribution towards understanding rumors and providing information to the social media platforms for taking action against the tagged social media messages and the origin of the rumor. The project partially funded one PhD student and one undergraduate student. The supported PhD student has graduated with his thesis making an important contribution to the project. The undergraduate student was trained in analytical tools through this project and was important in his academic preparation. The supported masters’ student was inspired by the project to join the PhD program at USF. Several papers have resulted from the research and have been disseminated (either published or forthcoming).
