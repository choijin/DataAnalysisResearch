<AbstractNarration>The significance of this I-Corps technology lies in its potential to dramatically facilitate and thus multiply the deployment of direct 2-way video/audio communication between a single control center and several geographically dispersed remote locations to fulfill a wide variety of business needs. This technology facilitates real time live video customer support as well as customer engagement; something that customers seek as shown by the increased use of chat or live video tools at company websites. This project enables more organizations to leverage the benefits of live video conversations to effectively support their clients and expand their markets by better serving their customers and becoming more competitive in the global markets. To facilitate this proactive detection of potential customers the technology will provide continuous video feeds from all the remote locations to the control center. In situations where expert advice is scarce and/or an expensive resource, this technology could dramatically increase the utilization, availability and accessibility of this resource at a cost significantly lower than that of deploying personnel to every location.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps team believes that the proposed product will be a novel subscription-based web technology enabling organizations to establish and manage interactive real-time two-way video/audio conversations using off-the-shelf portable devices over Internet access. This team further believes that the product could provide a simple web-based solution enabling a myriad of applications such as; Interactive Marketing, Security Concierges, Mall Directories and Live Customer Support among many others. The team intends to use the I-Corps funds to participate in related industry conferences and to conduct customer interviews in different sectors of the USA market. The ultimate goal of the team is to validate, at a national level: the need and acceptance of the proposed technology, that customers are willing to use video solutions as a means for a customer solution, and that retail stores in the USA have a need for a customer service solution.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ AskMe Now is a web-based platform to facilitate the deployment of video intercom systems using of the shelf tablet PCs and the Internet.   Our initial plan was to offer the product as an infrastructure as a service (IaaS) solution to companies over the Internet.   During our participation in the Atlanta GA Tech cohort of the I-Corps Teams program from January to March of 2016, The AskMe Now team from the University of Puerto Rico Mayag&uuml;ez conducted more than 120 customer interviews both in Puerto Rico and mainland US.  We explored a variety of customer segments that we believed could leverage our product to improve customer service and support:   Retailers of do-it-yourself products will buy AskMe Now by provide real time customer support and special offers over video Small professional practitioners such as engineers, doctors and dentist will use AskMe Now to manage multiple remote offices and projects more effectively and avoid losing customers Nursing home administrators will buy AskMe Now to monitors their patients and avoid accidents and injuries Psychiatric hospital administrators will buy AskMe Now to monitor their patients to avoid suicides and other self-injuries. Relatives of fragile and hospitalized patients will buy AskMe Now to remotely monitor their relatives and keep them company while not being present Malls and shopping center administrators will AskMe Now to provide live remote assistance to shoppers   Although we did confirm that the problems that we were trying to address with AskMe Now were real problems for all these customer segments, we could not identify one customer segment that felt absolutely and excitedly compelled to buy our product to address their problem.  At the end of the cohort we felt like we did not have a truly convincing business proposition for some customer segment, but we also felt like they were still some potential applications that we should explore further before letting go AskMe Now.
