<AbstractNarration>As the cornerstone of the global information technology infrastructure, large-scale parallel processing platforms host an ever-increasing amount of real-time in-memory computing applications (e.g., data/graph analytics, transaction processing, machine learning, and business intelligence). As a result, large-scale distributed in-memory data storage has become a very important component in large-scale parallel processing platforms. Nevertheless, conventional realization of in-memory data storage tends to occupy a large amount of memory capacity and consume substantial CPU cycles. This makes in-memory data storage subject to a significant cost overhead in terms of both memory and CPU resources. How well this cost challenge can be addressed largely determines the overall system performance and efficiency of future large-scale parallel processing platforms. This project will have significant impact on the research community and the industry, while providing interdisciplinary training of graduate and undergraduate students, and draw broad participation of students of different levels and backgrounds in collaborative research and education.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project proposes to improve the cost effectiveness of in-memory data storage by enhancing the function and data processing capability of the hardware memory controller. In particular, the in-memory filesystem and memory controller will explicitly cooperate together across the software/hardware layers and share the responsibility for optimizing the implementation of in-memory data storage. Such a cross-layer design framework enables the use of memory footprint reduction techniques to reduce memory resource cost without incurring CPU overhead. Moreover, the memory controller will integrate customized hardware engines that can carry out certain storage-oriented data processing tasks. Those customized storage data processing engines in the memory controller can be leveraged to directly reduce the memory and CPU resources overhead in the realization of in-memory data storage. An FPGA-based platform will be implemented to carry out experiments to further empirically validate the feasibility and potential effectiveness of the developed design solutions.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project aims to develop solutions that can facilitate future computing systems to conveniently adopt and deploy emerging new non-volatile memory technologies. As new low-cost, high-performance non-volatile memory technologies become increasingly mature, they bring an unprecedented opportunity to innovate the memory and storage hierarchy of the computing infrastructure. It is important to study how computing systems could smoothly employ such new technologies without demanding significant changes to the existing software ecosystem.   This project has developed techniques to architect memory and storage systems built upon new non-volatile memory technologies. The key is to cohesively consider the memory technology characteristics and the constraints of existing software infrastructure. Without demanding significant changes to the existing software infrastructure, the developed design techniques enable future computing systems conveniently benefit from the low cost and high performance features of new memory technologies. Design solutions have been comprehensively evaluated, and the research results have been published in technical papers in prestigious conferences.  The research accomplishments have significantly contributed to both academic and industry by developing innovative design solutions to effectively utilize new non-volatile memory technologies. The adoption of the design solutions by the semiconductor and computing industry will provide a direct benefit to this strategically important high technology sector critical to the economic health of the nation.
