<AbstractNarration>Rainfall varies extensively among biomes and over time with weather cycles like El Ni√±o. Lab studies have shown that warm-blooded organisms lose heat at a more rapid rate when wet and must spend more energy to regulate body temperature. Effects of rainfall on energy expenditure in the wild is unstudied, but may critically affect reproduction and survival of organisms. Energy is often most limited to animals when trying to raise offspring, with the latter especially vulnerable to increased energy costs of wetting because of poorly developed fur or feathers. This project examines energy costs of rainfall to parents and their offspring in tropical songbirds. Tropical organisms provide an important test because they are thought to be sensitive to heat loss and thermal conditions due to the narrow temperature variation in the tropics. Also, rain is a prevalent feature in tropical rain forests (often &gt; 2 m per year).  Investigations will examine energy expenditure of both parents and offspring on dry versus wet days and at nests where rainfall is experimentally modified. Measurements will be conducted across diverse species that differ in their behaviors, nest types and potential exposure to rain to advance understanding of the energetic costs and differential population vulnerabilities of species as a result of variation in rainfall. This work has important conservation implications because it identifies population sensitivities of endemic species in a biodiversity hotspot. In addition, many students from a variety of disciplines, including those outside of biology will be trained in the conduct of field work and scientific principles. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ecological and evolutionary influences of precipitation are poorly studied. Proposed work will significantly advance understanding of the energetic (field metabolic rates) and demographic consequences of variation in rainfall on coexisting songbirds in a tropical rainforest. These costs may be strongly expressed in tropical rainforests where rain is prevalent, thermal tolerances are narrow, and temperatures are often below thermoneutral levels. Yet, studies of the effects of rainfall and wetting on energetics, behavior and demography across diverse tropical species are lacking. The proposed work will use novel experimental and observational approaches to advance understanding of how nest structure affects energy use of parents due to heat loss under wet versus dry conditions. The proposed work will also elucidate how rain, temperature, nest structure, and parental behavior combine to affect energy expenditure of offspring and how energy is allocated to differing body components during growth. Finally, it will reveal demographic ramifications of the physiological costs of rain and nest structure to gain new insight into fitness consequences. Ultimately, this work will provide a new understanding of the influences of climate and nest structure upon heat balance and evolution of parental and growth strategies among diverse species. This work will also identify relative demographic sensitivities of species as a function of their nest types, ecologies and behaviors to aid prioritization schemes for conservation. A large number of undergraduate and graduate students, as well as a post-doctoral scholar, will receive training in diverse field methodologies and scientific principles.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>We conducted a detailed study of the demographic consequences of climate on tropical birds on the island of Borneo in Malaysia based on finding nests to examine reproductive output and banding to examine adult survival. Our studies focused on the importance of adult and offspring mortality and climate on reproduction, parental behaviors, and demography. We found the first nests ever reported for some of these species and provided the first studies of the demography of ca. 30 coexisting species at a mid-elevation (1400-2000 m) forest in a National Park (Kinabalu Park) that has been designated a World Heritage Site. We found that long-lived tropical birds may be more resilient to drought than previously thought because they reduced their reproductive effort by skipping breeding, which improves their survival during the drought. Shorter-lived tropical birds, however, maintained reproduction and paid a cost in terms of their own survival. We conducted population projection modeling that showed that these differing behavioral adjustments can minimize the population impacts of drought, except in species that rely on the wettest habitat. We also conducted the first-ever study of energy expenditure of parents and their offspring among a large number of coexisting species in the tropics. We found that, counter to long-standing assumptions, parental energy expenditure (i.e., how hard parents work to reproduce) was not related to brood size. Instead, the rates that parents fed and warmed their young explained parental energy expenditure. Mortality explained parental energy expenditure through these care behaviors independent of brood size, and these care behaviors can affect survival of young after leaving the nest. The independent evolution of parental care behaviors has critical implications for life history theory because it suggests, counter to long-standing assumptions, that energy expenditure may not constrain the evolution of brood size across species. Our studies of nestling energy expenditure showed that it increased with rainfall and colder air temperatures suggesting parents do not always offset energetic costs of weather on young. Energy expenditure of offspring also increased with fewer siblings indicating huddling benefits. Across species, offspring energy expenditure increased with nestling and adult mortality, but not growth rate, emphasizing the evolutionary effects of mortality on energy expenditure. Thus, climate has a strong effect, but differs among species. As a further test of rain and nest structure effects, we added experimental rain above nests of five songbird species in Borneo using two common nest types, cup-shaped and enclosed, and measured parental brooding and food provisioning behaviors, and offspring energy expenditure. Experimental rain caused parents in open, but not enclosed nests to increase their brooding time, and resulted in no effect of rain on energy expenditure of nestlings. Offspring provisioning rate also did not change with experimental rain. These results illustrate an important influence of nest type on parental activity during rainfall. Our results also suggest that substantial shifts in parental behavior should be expected in open-nesting songbird species in regions that are expected to experience heavier rainfall in the future. A constant issue for birds in the wild is discovery of nests by predators. Parents faced with a predator must choose between their own safety versus taking care of their offspring. Each choice can have fitness costs. Life history theory predicts that longer-lived species should be less willing than shorter-lived species to return to care for their offspring after a predator disturbance because they have more opportunities to reproduce in the future. We created a short-term perception of increased adult predation risk by presenting a model predator during incubation for 40 bird species in our tropical Borneo site, and in north temperate and south temperate sites. We found that species with higher adult survival probabilities were more cautious, waiting longer before returning to the nest to provide care. Contrary to other studies, we also found that parents were more risk-averse and waited longer to return in smaller than larger species, likely reflecting greater vulnerability of smaller species. Ultimately, the relative risk a predator poses to a species and the probability of future reproduction predict parental risk-taking across the world. This award provided extensive opportunity for training of undergraduate, post-undergraduate and graduate students, as well as a post-doctoral scholar. Training occurred at the University of Montana across disciplines where undergraduates were hired to watch videos to transcribe behaviors. Training also occurred in the field, where students were trained in large number of field techniques for finding and studying nests, offspring, and parents.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 06/17/2021<br>      Modified by: Thomas&nbsp;E&nbsp;Martin</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
