<AbstractNarration>PI:  Doyle, Patrick S.&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: 1602406&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Very long molecules, like polymers and DNA, can double over themselves and get entangled in knots. The goal of the proposed research is to study the processes of creating and relaxing these knots in single DNA molecules. Microfluidic channels and electric fields will be used to manipulate individual molecules. Discoveries from the project could impact the design of future instruments used in genomic analysis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Knots are among the most ancient human tools used for hoisting of sails, suturing of wounds, and weaving of clothing. They also naturally occur in very long polymers such as DNA. The central goal of this project is to develop an understanding of knot dynamics on single polymer molecules. Single molecule DNA experiments, computer simulations, and scaling theory will be performed. The three main objectives of the project are: (1) understand how physical knots on DNA relax, (2) study how knots on a polymer move when pushed by fields or freely diffuse, and (3) develop nanofluidic devices to probe processes which couple knot relaxation and convection. The project will further engage high school teachers and undergraduates in research opportunities. Materials will be developed that can be used by grade school teachers to introduce concepts in knots and topology by linking them to everyday phenomena, such as the entangling strings and headphone cords.</AbstractNarration>

The goal of this project was to study the processes of creating and relaxing these knots in single DNA molecules. Microfluidic channels and electric fields were used to manipulate individual molecules, and these were complimented with simulations. We showed that knots are highly dynamic features on a molecule which can diffuse due to thermal motion and also convect when fields are applied. One notable discovery was that knots on polymers can get jammed, much like macroscopic knots on shoe laces. Whether polymer knot is jammed or not depends on the tension applied. In flow, we discovered that knots can modify the overall polymer response. For example, they can change the relaxation time of the polymer and hence the response to flow, such as the famous coil-stretch transition. Since knots are dynamic, they can eventually leave a polymer. We found that the process of a knot leaving a chain is not an all-or-none process, but happens in discrete steps associated with topological transitions in the polymer. Models were developed which demonstrate both how knots change a polymer's relaxation time and how large knots tend to be on a chain given the physical chemical environment.&nbsp;&nbsp;Overall, this work provided fundamental new insights into the dynamics of self-entangled polymer systems which can find application in genomics applications such as DNA mapping and nanopore sequencing which is used for diagnostics.
