<AbstractNarration>Quantum field theories provide a conceptual framework for modern particle physics. Conformal field theories are quantum field theories that that have angle-preserving, or conformal, symmetries. Two dimensional conformal theories, which have important applications to string theory, can be rigorously constructed mathematically using what are known as vertex algebras. Over the the last thirty years, deep and surprising connections have been discovered between vertex algebras and other areas of mathematics. In this project, interactions between vertex algebras and topics in algebra and number theory will be investigated. The grant will also support the training of graduate students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In more detail, this project will deepen our understanding of irrational vertex algebras by investigating their representations, intertwining operators among modules, and modular transformation properties of characters of their modules. This will be done by using ideas coming from the theory of quantum groups and the theory of modular forms. In one direction, a Kazhdan-Lusztig-type correspondence between certain irrational W-algebras and certain quantum groups at roots of unity will be studied. The non-standard quantum groups that appear have recently been used to construct new powerful invariants of knots and 3-manifolds. In another direction, transformation properties of modular forms in connection with characters of modules of irrational vertex algebras will be investigated. In a third direction, a continuous version of the Verlinde formula in irrational theories and construction of projective covers for vertex algebras coming from kernels of screening operators will be studied. This project also has implications for the study of logarithmic conformal field theory in physics.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The PI continued to investigate irrational vertex algebras, quantum modular forms and quantum groups.     More specifically, we studied several topics:     1. modularity of characters of modules of irrational vertex algebras and W-algebras,     2. permutation orbifolds of vertex operator algebras and superalgebras.     3. Schur's indices in 4-dimensional super conformal field theory.     4. Z-hat invariants in Chern-Simons theory.     We settled several conjectures that originate in physics concerning the Schur index of certain Argyres-Douglas 4d N=2 SCFTs. We also confirmed on several families of examples a conjecture of Gukov on quantum modularity of the Z-hat invariants of plumbed 3-manifolds. These remarkable homological invariants were introduced a few years ago by Gukov-Pei-Putrov and Vafa. They originate from a physical system involving a 6d fivebrane theory and are closely related to 3-manifolds invariants coming from quantum groups.     Besides a better understanding of vertex algebra theory, other implications of this line of research include applications to number theory (quantum modular forms),  4d/2d dualities in physics, and quantum topology (invariants of 3-manifolds).      Broader impacts:  Other benefits of this program include training and education of students. Two PhD students (James Clark and Josh Wauchope) recently graduated on research problems related to unrolled quantum groups and permutation orbifolds of fermionic vertex algebras. Their thesis findings are published in several papers. The PI co-edited a conference proceedings on representation theory. We also presented three invited lectures.
