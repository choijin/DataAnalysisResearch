<AbstractNarration>With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation Program (MRI) and support from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program (CRIF), Professor Kying Ding from Middle Tennessee State University and colleagues Piotr Kaszynski, Scott Handy, Tibor Koritsanszky and Anatoliy Volkov have acquired a single crystal X-ray diffractometer. In general, an X-ray diffractometer allows accurate and precise measurements of the full three-dimensional structure of a molecule, including bond distances and angles.  It also provides accurate information about the spatial arrangement of a molecule relative to neighboring molecules. These studies impact a number of areas, including organic and inorganic chemistry, materials chemistry and biochemistry. This instrument is an integral part of teaching as well as research and training of undergraduate students in chemistry and biochemistry.  Collaborators from regional institutions such as the universities Motlow State, Volunteer State, Nashville State, Fisk, Alabama A&amp;M, East Tennessee State, Austin Peay, Belmont, Lipscomb, Memphis and Central Arkansas also use the instrument. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The award is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels, especially in areas such as: (a) characterizing molecular geometry in non-precious metal organometallic catalysts and intermediates, (b) confirming stereoisomers and molecular geometry in families of organic compounds, (c) determining intermolecular associations in heterocyclic stable radicals, liquid crystals and dyes, (d) incorporating high resolution charge-density data for small- and medium-sized structures into charge density calculations, (e) carrying out preliminary measurements before neutron and X-ray synchrotron diffraction studies, and (f) collecting structural data that can be used in computational predictive modeling.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The SCXRD is a direct contribution to the Universitys collection of capital equipment and complements our instrumentation for materials analysis.</p> <p>The Project PI, co-PIs, and key personnel have synthesized new materials and characterized them using SCXRD. The resulting publications have contributed to organic, inorganic, and organometallic chemical literature. Overall, data was collected on about 400 crystals and 41 deposition-ready samples were completed over the project period. The increase in articles produced by the MTSU Department of Chemistry after the arrival of the SCXRD is notable.</p> <p>&nbsp;The analysis of X-ray structures contributed to the research training, professional development, and education of 9 undergraduate and 2 M.S. students, 3 visiting scholars, 4 Ph.D. students, 1 high school student, and 6 faculty members whose groups submitted samples over the lifetime of the grant. Work began to be published in the second year of the grant increasing the output of the department. Overall, a total of 8 papers were published and &gt;25 presentations were delivered between Spring 2017 (when the SCXRD was installed) and Nov 2019 (final report). Five undergraduate students presented their work associated with this grant at the SERMACS Meeting in Augusta, SC, Oct 31-Nov 3, 2018 and three graduate students presented their work including X-ray structures at SERMACS in Savannah, GA, Oct 22-24, 2019.</p> <p>&nbsp;The SCXRD has already helped two assistant professors (Ding and Miller) to establish their research programs (Ding was tenured and promoted to Associate Professor in 2019 and Miller got a positive 4<sup>rd</sup> year review). This project has provided X-ray experience for 15 students and on-the-job training of three crystallographers in X-ray crystal manipulation and mounting, data collection, and structure solutions. In addition, as the nucleus for the XCEL-3D (X-Ray Crystallography and Experimental Labwork) center, which seeks to have a broad impact in research, education, and outreach, the SCXRD is more than just an instrument serving a specialized community. Finally, we hired a research faculty member grounded in spectroscopy for materials and expertise in X-ray crystallography, Dr. Oleksandr Hietsoi. Since coming to MTSU, Dr. Hietsoi solved 8 publication-ready structures including data collected for charge density.</p> <p>&nbsp;The SCXRD has generated significant impacts in science education. By incorporating X-ray structures into courses in Chemistry and Geosciences, we have increased the use of technology in education. Not only is 3D technology ubiquitous in the lives of students, but techniques for delivery are expanding. We are exploring new 3D technology using augmented reality to expand its use in education and combining it with the POGIL method to teach Chemistry in small groups, which has been shown to be effective. One new formal education module using X-ray was introduced during Y2, and X-ray experiments developed in Y2 were continued in classrooms and laboratory in Organic Chemistry I and Mineralogy. Drs. Ding and Friedli completed their XCEL program to improve retention rate for URM-LI (underrepresented group, minority and low-income students) groups in the chemistry department. They supported 6 students to do research from summer 2018 to summer 2019. The students associated with X-ray projects were disproportionately first generation college students (5) and/or African American (2).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;Lastly, the PI and a few team members applied for and received funding for an X-ray themed REU program for summers 2020-2022. The theme of the program is materials analysis using X-ray techniques, which builds our previous experience with synthesis, analysis, and instruction in this NSF-MRI project and TBR-SERS project.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 11/26/2019<br>      Modified by: Keying&nbsp;Ding</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1626549/1626549_10457768_1574797264195_Picture1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1626549/1626549_10457768_1574797264195_Picture1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Rigaku X-ray Single Crystal Diffractometer"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1626549/1626549_10457768_1574797264195_Picture1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Rigaku X-ray Single Crystal Diffractometer"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Graduate student Keshav Paudel and his research advisor Dr. Keying Ding are discussing the crystal mounting procedure in front of the Rigaku SuperNova X-ray diffractometer.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Keying Ding</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Keying&nbsp;Ding</div> <div class="imageTitle">Rigaku X-ray Single Crystal Diffractometer</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1626549/1626549_10457768_1574797592159_Picture6--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1626549/1626549_10457768_1574797592159_Picture6--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Plot of peer reviewed publications authored by members of the MTSU Chemistry Department appearing in Scopus between 2008 and 2018"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1626549/1626549_10457768_1574797592159_Picture6--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Plot of peer reviewed publications authored by members of the MTSU Chemistry Department appearing in Scopus between 2008 and 2018"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">The SCXRD has significant contribution to research productivity at the MTSU Chemistry department.
