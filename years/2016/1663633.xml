<AbstractNarration>The broader and commercial impacts of this I-Corps program are to improve the early-stage detection methods of breast cancer which is expected to reduce morbidity, mortality and rates of recurrence.  It is also expected to decrease the overall cost of cancer care and lost productivity from breast cancer treatment and impacts. This screening technology is based on surface-enhanced Raman scattering and offers a noninvasive, high sensitive, rapid and cost-effective method of detection and dynamic monitoring of a breast cancer biomarker sialic acid in saliva. The non-invasive nature of our method helps to accommodate cultural and religious sensitivities that decrease compliance with mammography among certain populations. Moreover, portability and affordability give this technique the potential to promote early diagnosis of breast cancer in low-income, rural or remote areas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project develops a surface-enhanced Raman scattering system for cancer screening.  This screening technology offers a noninvasive, high sensitive, rapid and cost-effective method of detection and dynamic monitoring of a breast cancer biomarker sialic acid in saliva. Currently available methods of specific detection and quantification of sialic acid (such as chromatographic methods) are complicated, expensive and time consuming, while more robust techniques (such as colorimetric assays) suffer from non-specificity and interference. This technology may present a versatile and age-independent alternative to standard mammography screening, holding promise for the improved management of breast cancer. Furthermore, it has been reported that sialic acid levels increased in the serum of patients with uterus, lung, colon/rectum, stomach and prostate cancer. Therefore, our method can be potentially used to detect not exclusively breast cancer, but also other types of cancer.</AbstractNarration>

One in eight women will develop invasive breast cancer at some point in her life and each year, approximately 40,000 women die of BC. Early-stage detection of breast cancer through screening plays a crucial role in saving women&rsquo;s lives as well as in reducing devastating emotional, physical and economical impacts of advanced stage cancer treatment. We have developed a novel method to measure levels of a biomarker in saliva for the risk assessment of BC that can lead to the early detection. Our technology was developed at the University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA) and a patent was filled by UTSA.</p> <p>We decided to pursue the NSF I-Corps Teams Award in order to develop a viable commercialization plan for our technology. Our I-Corps Team was composed of three members: Miguel Jos&eacute; Yacam&aacute;n (Principal Investigator, PI), Ekaterina Vinogradova (Entrepreneurial Lead, EL) and Diego Capeletti (Mentor). Dr. Yacam&aacute;n is a Professor and Chair of the Department of Physics and Astronomy at UTSA and world known researcher in Materials Science. Dr. Vinogradova is a Research Instrumentation Coordinator at UTSA with more than 10 years of research experience and has participated in the development of several applied technologies. Mr. Capeletti, MBA in Finance, BS in Accounting, is the Coordinator for the Center for Innovation, Technology and Entrepreneurship at UTSA and has first-hand experience with technology startups.</p> <p>Our I-Corps journey started at a 3-day Kick-off Workshop that for our cohort was held in Detroit, MI in October, 2016. We were told to &lsquo;get out of the building&rsquo; and speak with real people to start testing our Business Model Hypothesis that in the beginning was to develop and sell a BC screening kit to a broad range of health care providers. During next 6 weeks we have been interviewing oncologists, radiologists, primary care providers (PCPs), OB/GYN doctors, BC organizations and biomedical companies while working on our Business Model Canvas with help and guidance of the I-Corps program instructors. The first lesson we learned was that women with extremely and heterogeneously dense breast tissue (1 in 4 women) would benefit the most from our method because for these women, detecting cancer on a mammogram might be as difficult as finding a polar bear in a snow storm. Next, we learned that our customer segments were defined too broadly and discovered that our target customers will be PCPs and OB/GYN doctors.&nbsp; With a clearly identified target customers, it became much easier to define our value propositions to them. As a result of interviews with the target customers, a pivot occurred when we found that instead of selling screening kit, we would have to create a Clinical Improvement Amendment (CLIA) certified laboratory to perform our test. After completing 100 customer interviews we were able to formulate our final Business Model Hypothesis that PCP and OB/GYN doctors will use our risk assessment method that can lead to the early detection of BC (stage 0, I &amp; II) in women with high breast tissue density, reducing mortality rate by 28% minimum and cancer care costs by at least 36%.&nbsp; In addition, through customer discovery, we were able to spot early adopters of our technology.</p> <p>As an outcome of the I-Corps award, a startup company named G-Raman was formed in Texas with the direct involvement of the PI and EL from the I-Corps Team as shareholders.
