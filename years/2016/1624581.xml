<AbstractNarration>The PIPELINE Network project will significantly enhance physics education by developing and evaluating methods to incorporate workforce-relevant skills and activities in the student experience. The majority of physics graduates at all degree levels will become scientists and innovators working in the private sector, yet very little of the knowledge they gain while earning their degree specifically prepares them for these roles (for example, few physics programs emphasize real-world applications of scientific concepts, communication skills, or basic business concepts, all of which are important to successful private sector careers). Adding workforce-relevant learning to the discipline will attract a larger and more diverse student body to major in physics, and by extension improve the quality of the future STEM workforce. The PIPELINE project will bring together efforts of six institutions to create and document new approaches to teaching innovation and entrepreneurship in physics which can be shared with the broader community. The project will also advance our understanding of how these practices affect student and faculty attitudes towards innovation and entrepreneurship in physics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goals of the PIPELINE network are to build students' workforce confidence, improve physics faculty attitudes toward private sector careers, foster better integration of academic and industrial sectors, promote innovation in the physics discipline, and build a framework for wider adoption of physics innovation and entrepreneurship practices. The project will accomplish these by implementing physics innovation and entrepreneurship (PIE) approaches at member institutions during each year of the project, revising approaches between iterations, and finally documenting and disseminating curriculum. Most importantly, PIPELINE will develop surveys and interview protocols which will investigate the link between PIE experiences and student and faculty attitudes about innovation and entrepreneurship, and which can be used by other departments for gauging, monitoring, and improving institutional change around PIE. These research findings and tools will provide insights and utility that go beyond the immediate partner institutions, and live on beyond the duration of the project. PIPELINE will generate a core network of experienced PIE practitioners, a readily accessible body of tested PIE curricula deliberately varied in scope to fit unique needs and challenges of future adopters, and robust insight into the obstacles to PIE implementation and how future adopters might address them.</AbstractNarration>

Adding workforce-relevant learning to the discipline will attract a larger and more diverse student body to major in physics, and by extension improve the quality of the future STEM workforce. The PIPELINE project will bring together efforts of six institutions to create and document new approaches to teaching innovation and entrepreneurship in physics which can be shared with the broader community. The project will also advance our understanding of how these practices affect student and faculty attitudes towards innovation and entrepreneurship in physics.  The goals of the PIPELINE network are to build students' workforce confidence, improve physics faculty attitudes toward private sector careers, foster better integration of academic and industrial sectors, promote innovation in the physics discipline, and build a framework for wider adoption of physics innovation and entrepreneurship practices. The project will accomplish these by implementing physics innovation and entrepreneurship (PIE) approaches at member institutions during each year of the project, revising approaches between iterations, and finally documenting and disseminating curriculum.

PIPELINE will generate a core network of experienced PIE practitioners, a readily accessible body of tested PIE curricula deliberately varied in scope to fit unique needs and challenges of future adopters, and robust insight into the obstacles to PIE implementation and how future adopters might address them.  Project Outcomes Report  This grant was a collaborative project, the goal of which was to form a national network of physics departments who will perform, document and disseminate several physics innovation and entrepreneurship (PIE) implementation approaches, thereby seeding a community of expert practitioners of physics innovation and entrepreneurship education. This project, "Promoting Innovation and Physics Entrepreneurship through Institutional Engagement" or PIPELINE, created a core group of expert PIE practitioners. The contribution to this collaborative effort, described here, was led by Wright State University (WSU) Principal Investigator Dr. Jason Deibel and Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI) Co-Investigator Douglas Petkie. The goals for WSU and WPI were to advance first-year seminar courses to incorporate topics like communication skills, and career preparation. For WSU’s and WPI’s contribution to the NSF PIPELINE program, the seminar courses were to grow to include more of an entrepreneurial emphasis.  Primary contributions to the PIPELINE effort made by WSU and WPI include:     1. WSU and WPI utilized curricular activities and resources in its seminar courses that were developed and contributed by other members of the PIPELINE Network.     2. Both WSU and WPI contributed curricular materials from courses at their respective institutions to a central website for the PIPELINE Network with the aim that contributions from all of the network institutions will be made available to the public. Selected course materials, affiliated with both institutions’ first-year seminar programs, focused on activities and pedagogy associated with entrepreneurial mindset and professional skills development.     3. WSU and WPI jointly presented a poster, "Physics Innovation and Entrepreneurship (PIE) Education in First Year Physics Courses," summarizing their participation in PIPELINE activities at the 2018 American Physical Society Building Thriving Undergraduate Physics Programs workshop in February.     4. In June 2018, the American Physical Society hosted a Department Chairs Meeting. Members of the PIPELINE network facilitated a workshop, attached to the Chairs Meeting, "Phys21 in Practice: Building a Supportive Ecosystem for Innovation and Entrepreneurship in Physics Departments." In addition to assisting with the overall planning and execution of the workshop, WSU and WPI ran the breakout session on Communication Skills.     5. At the July 2019 Summer meeting of the American Association of Physics Teachers in Provo, Utah, the PIPELINE network planned and conducted the workshop, "Teaching Innovation and Entrepreneurship in Physics: Helping Physics Students Change the World." WSU and WPI participated in the planning and facilitating of this workshop.          Last Modified: 03/24/2021       Submitted by: Jason Deibel]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
