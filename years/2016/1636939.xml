<AbstractNarration>Breast cancer is the second most diagnosed and second largest cause of cancer-related deaths in women. Current treatments for invasive and metastatic breast cancer rely on non-specific drugs that destroy both cancer and non-cancer cells such as drugs used in chemotherapy. Such drugs also have limited efficacy and severe side effects. Thus, there is a need to develop drugs that specifically destroy only cancer cells. This I-Corps team has discovered a human protein that is made in large amounts in breast cancer cells. When this protein is present in breast cancer cells, it makes cancer more deadly. For this reason, the team has developed a drug that specifically kills breast cancer cells by targeting the protein. Early studies using this drug in the treatment of aggressive breast cancer in mice has shown great promise because when mice with breast tumors are given the drug, their tumors stop growing and spreading. In addition, the use of this drug on breast cancer patients who do not have metastasis will eliminate the need for surgical removal of breast tissue and the subsequent reconstructive surgeries. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps team has developed a biologic drug lead resulting in inhibition of (I) cancer cell clustering in vitro and (ii) tumor growth in vivo when administered to tumor bearing mice. Therefore, the overall goal of this project is to learn how to transfer this biologic drug lead (B49) from the PI?s laboratory to the marketplace for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer.  This team intends to establish the current unmet needs in the metastatic breast cancer treatment space by exploring potential for product development through customer discovery, development, and risk assessment. During customer discovery, the team will conduct interviews with oncologists and all physicians involved in breast cancer treatment, biotech/pharmaceutical companies, patients, hospital administrators, insurance companies, and FDA regulators. The team will also network with other teams, investors, and partners. At the completion of this project, the team will have a clear go or no go decision regarding the viability of B49. If the decision is to move forward with developing B49, the team will draft a transition plan that includes a mission statement, objectives, products/services, keys to success, and management plan.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Breast cancer remains an unsolved problem worldwide, with a reported 231,840 new invasive cases in the US alone in 2015. Although progress is being made with early detection and treatment, currently, there are no targeted therapies available for invasive/metastatic breast cancer, thus limiting treatment regimens to a combination of chemotherapeutic - taxanes and cytotoxic agents. In addition, chemotherapeutic agents have limited efficacy with 71.5% of chemo-treated patients failing to respond to 2<sup>nd</sup> line chemotherapy once cancer becomes resistant to 1<sup>st</sup> line drugs. These patients do not have an alternative treatment. Additionally, breast cancer patients with metastatic disease have higher rates of relapse and decreased overall survival compared to patients with non-metastatic disease. Although metastatic breast cancer patients may achieve some level of pathologic complete response after neoadjuvant chemotherapy, the rate of disease-free overall survival is still very low at about 25%. Therefore, the main OUTCOME of our I-Corps customer discovery process was the validation of a universal strong interest and support among interviewed breast cancer patients and practitioners for a new metastatic breast cancer therapeutic approach that can improve survival rates and reduce debilitating side effects associated with current therapies. This validation allows us to move forward with research and discovery (R&amp;D) to de-risk our technology, attract partners, and commercialize our technology for the benefit of breast cancer patients. &nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 11/21/2016<br>      Modified by: Chioma&nbsp;M&nbsp;Okeoma</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
