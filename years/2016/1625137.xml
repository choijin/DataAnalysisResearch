<AbstractNarration>1625137&lt;br/&gt;Carmichael&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) grant supports acquisition of a scanning electron microscope equipped with a high brightness electron source, an energy dispersive spectrometer, an electron backscatter diffractometer, and cathodoluminescence (CL) microscope to allow microscale textural and compositional imaging of solid earth, biological and synthetic materials as well as study of rock fabrics based on EBSD determination of crystallographic preferred orientation.  The instrument will replace an aging SEM rapidly nearing the end of its serviceable life and will support research and research training Appalachian State University, a non-Ph.D. granting institution.  This support is congruent with NSFs mission of promoting the progress of science and advancing the national health, prosperity and welfare given the importance of training the next generation scientific workforce in methods of analysis and scientific research methodologies.  Appalachian State University is a primarily undergraduate institution and the investigators have a strong track record of engaging undergraduate students in laboratory and field research.  Many of the students at Appalachian State are first-generation college students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The instrument will support and foster a range of investigator and student research including study of the role of microbes in manganese mineral formation, the geochemistry of mass extinctions, the extent of coal ash releases into river systems, the use of glacial grain roughness as a tracer for paleoclimate signals, applications to fission track thermochronology, thermobarometry, and analysis of deformation mechanisms to study dome formation in the Southern Appalachian mountains, the kinematics of faulting in the Southern Appalachians, plant root development, fluid-mineral reactions in volcanic ash, meteorite classification, metamorphism of ultra-high pressure systems, Ediacaran fossil assemblages, the effect of climate change on Fraser firs, vascular changes during pregnancy, the microbial ecology of peat bogs, and a variety of archaeological studies.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;***</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The goal of this MRI was to update Appalachian State University's existing SEM facility with new equipment adequate to accommodate our ongoing research objectives, and expand our current capabilities. This MRI grant provided funding for a JEOL&nbsp;JSM-IT-300LV low vacuum scanning electron microscope with LaB<sub>6</sub>&nbsp;filament. It also provided funding for an Oxford AZtecEnergy Xmax 150 silicon drift energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) system and&nbsp;integrated NordlysNano electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) capabilities, and a Gatan ChromaCL2 color cathodoluminescence (CL) detector. This SEM is the only instrument of its kind in the University of North Carolina system, and within a 3-hour radius of Appalachian State University. Our microscopy facility is now the primary facility for the entire region, and has been used by both students and faculty from other North Carolina institutions, and by users from institutions across the southeastern United States.</p> <p>Research involving the new SEM and its peripherals is varied and includes a multitude of topics across geology, biology, and archaeology. Projects include the role of microbes in manganese mineral formation, the mineralogy and geochemistry of mass extinctions, paleoenvironmental analysis of sediments, the extent of coal ash releases into river systems, grain shapes of glacier sediments as a paleoclimate tracer, grain shapes of sediment on the coastal plain of North Carolina to determine sediment transport mechanics, application of fission track thermochronology, deformation temperatures and strain histories across the southern Appalachian mountains, the frequency of partial melting along subgrain boundaries in quartz, enhancing the signal from quartz in determining rock deformation temperatures and strain histories, plant root development, fluid-mineral reactions in volcanic ash, meteorite classification, dinosaur coprolite analysis, assessment of Ediacaran fossil assemblages, bryozoan morphology, analysis of tools found at archaeological sites, and the microbial ecology of peat bogs.</p> <p>This new instrumentation has supported training of undergraduate and graduate students across four classes (Mineralogy, Petrology &amp; Petrography, Microscopy, Forensic Chemistry), and provided numerous outreach opportunities to students across western North Carolina. Students who use the SEM through courses and outreach gain an appreciation for how research is conducted and are exposed to cutting edge technology they might not experience otherwise. These students, who may not be actively engaged in research, have the potential to become part of the future STEM workforce and help fulfill NSF&rsquo;s goal of &ldquo;increased public scientific literacy and public engagement with science and technology&rdquo;.</p> <p>More than 30 undergraduate and graduate research students, over 50% of whom are women, have also been trained and mentored on the SEM, which has led to senior theses, Master&rsquo;s theses, conference presentations, publications, and acceptance into prestigious graduate programs. In several situations students have specifically been accepted into graduate programs because of their abilities to use the SEM, and to analyze complex datasets generated from SEM data. Collaborators at institutions across North Carolina and the southeastern United States have come to use the SEM, and many of them have brought their own undergraduate and graduate students with them. This has increased the ability of these collaborators to conduct research that they were unable to do at their own facilities, and shows the importance of having such a state of the art instrument at Appalachian State University.</p> <p>During the three years that the grant was active, research involving the new instrumentation resulted in ~ 50 conference presentations (nearly all with student lead authors or co-authors), five peer reviewed journal articles (Ariuntogos et al., accepted; Cowan et al., 2020; Gingerich et al., 2019; Gottardi et al., 2020; Paschall et al., 2019) and one article in review (Levine and Rahl, 2020).</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 07/27/2020<br>      Modified by: Sarah&nbsp;Carmichael</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1625137/1625137_10456167_1593959396921_dolxtal--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1625137/1625137_10456167_1593959396921_dolxtal--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Dolomite rhomb - EBSD"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1625137/1625137_10456167_1593959396921_dolxtal--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Dolomite rhomb - EBSD"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">EBSD map of a dolomite rhomb from the Latemar Carbonate Buildup, Italy</div> <div class="imageCredit">Virginia Brown</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Sarah&nbsp;Carmichael</div> <div class="imageTitle">Dolomite rhomb - EBSD</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1625137/1625137_10456167_1594399200590_SEM_Fig_Cowan--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1625137/1625137_10456167_1594399200590_SEM_Fig_Cowan--rgov-800width.jpg" title="sand particle morphologies"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1625137/1625137_10456167_1594399200590_SEM_Fig_Cowan--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="sand particle morphologies"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">SEM micrographs showing examples of grains influenced by meltwater transport, sea ice transport, and glacially modified grains (iceberg transport).</div> <div class="imageCredit">Ellen Cowan</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Sarah&nbsp;Carmichael</div> <div class="imageTitle">sand particle morphologies</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1625137/1625137_10456167_1593959301094_17349678_10212630130012785_1731376937641465102_o--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1625137/1625137_10456167_1593959301094_17349678_10212630130012785_1731376937641465102_o--rgov-800width.jpg" title="SEM-CL image of nepheline"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1625137/1625137_10456167_1593959301094_17349678_10212630130012785_1731376937641465102_o--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="SEM-CL image of nepheline"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">SEM-CL image of a nepheline phenocryst from a carbonatite volcanic ash deposit which contains early human footprints</div> <div class="imageCredit">Sarah Carmichael</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Sarah&nbsp;Carmichael</div> <div class="imageTitle">SEM-CL image of nepheline</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1625137/1625137_10456167_1594996599808_160328-3_rotated--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1625137/1625137_10456167_1594996599808_160328-3_rotated--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Quartz EBSD Pole Figure"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1625137/1625137_10456167_1594996599808_160328-3_rotated--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Quartz EBSD Pole Figure"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Sample from Toxaway Dome, NC showing a c-axis single girdle consistent with simple shear and top-to-the-NE motion.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Jamie Levine</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Jamie&nbsp;Levine</div> <div class="imageTitle">Quartz EBSD Pole Figure</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
