<AbstractNarration>1619948 (Mitsch). This is a grant in assistance for international travel for U.S. scientists and engineers, the preponderance of them being early career, to participate in the EcoSummit 2016 in Montpellier France on August 29-September 2, 2016. The goals are: 1. To support the participation of these scientists and engineers in two specific invitation-only special sessions: 2. To develop at least two special issues in international journal(s) related to the theme of EcoSummit 2016: Sustainability and engineering change; and 3. To attract young U.S. environmental scientists and engineers to an international dialogue on ecological engineering for landscape sustainability and climate variability. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More than half of the funded participants will be female and six of the funded participants will be from EPSCoR states. Participation by USA scientists and engineers in this event will provide a stimulus to their research programs on sustainability, ecological engineering, landscape management, and climate variability. Those from the USA who attended EcoSummit 2012 in Columbus US have related the incredible opportunity that these ecosummits provide and the international connections that they made for enhancing their research. U.S. scientific research in ecological engineering, watershed management, and mitigating and adapting to climate variability will be especially enhanced.</AbstractNarration>

EcoSummit 2016 provided a forum for more than 1300 delegates from 75  countries to focus on finding solutions for today?s massive  environmental problems including pollution in the Florida Everglades and  the Laurentian Great Lakes in the USA.

EcoSummit 2016 hosted11 plenary presentations by some of the world?s  premier ecologists and environmental scientists and over 750  presentations in 93 scientific sessions.  The projected funded attendance by 17 U.S. scientists (see phoros) participating in two iinternational special sessions which produced two special issues with 46 research papers were published in the journal Ecological Engineering in 2017-2018 by Elsevier. Many of those supported were young professionals.
