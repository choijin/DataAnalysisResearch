<AbstractNarration>The The Louis Stokes Alliances for Minority Participation (LSAMP) program assists universities and colleges in diversifying the STEM workforce through the development of highly competitive students from groups historically underrepresented in STEM disciplines: African-Americans, Alaska Natives, American Indians, Hispanic Americans, Native Hawaiians, and Native Pacific Islanders. The goal of the LSAMP Bridge to the Doctorate (BD) Activity is to increase the quantity and quality of STEM graduate students from underrepresented populations, with emphasis on Ph.D. matriculation and completion. BD programs implemented in the nation's institutions of higher education contribute to addressing one of the objectives in NSF's 2014-2018 Strategic Plan, namely to "integrate education and research to support development of a diverse STEM workforce with cutting-edge capabilities." Since national security and economic vitality of the United States require a highly trained domestic STEM workforce, institutions engaged in the most advanced levels of research and innovation must do their part to train tomorrow's leaders in STEM.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The University of Puerto Rico (Rio Piedras), lead institution for the Puerto Rico Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (PR-LSAMP), will administer its eleventh (11th) Bridge to the Doctorate (BD) Program during the 2016-2018 academic years.  Implementation of the UPR-LSAMP BD Activity develops a highly competitive STEM education and research enterprise required to advance Puerto Rico's economic development and meets the national need for diverse STEM professionals. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;UPR's BD program provides multidisciplinary training in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) disciplines at the Ph.D. level to enable a seamless transition from the STEM baccalaureate degree to STEM graduate studies. Twelve students who received STEM baccalaureate degrees from PR-LSAMP institutions or from mainland LSAMP institutions will be selected and supported as BD Fellows. The program will continue to coordinate its activities with other NSF-funded projects that are managed by the Resource Center for Science and Engineering (RCSE) and by pertinent UPR graduate programs. The activities implemented will increase the number of Puerto Rican STEM undergraduate students who apply and are admitted to STEM PhD programs, and increase the number of these students who obtain STEM doctoral degrees. The total number of BD Fellows supported by PR-LSAMP since its inception would increase to 118. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BD Fellows participate in a series of development activities that provides or facilitates the BD Program including: scientific seminars on interdisciplinary or frontier research topics; seminars in ethics of science; and workshops to develop scientific research skills as well as written and oral communication skills. Fellows travel to and present at national and international scientific meetings and complete summer research internships at national and international partner research centers of PR EPSCoR and the Institute of Tropical Ecology (ITES). In addition, UPR's BD program implements activities that develop mentoring and teambuilding skills. The Role Model Seminar series brings BD Fellows into contact with successful nationally and internationally recognized researchers thereby creating a mentoring environment that further equips the Fellows to fruitfully incorporate themselves into the greater research/industrial community.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Funding over the 2016-2018 academic years, this Program, housed at the University of Puerto Rico?s Central Administration Resource Center for Science &amp; Engineering, supported and mentored twelve former PR-LSAMP Undergraduate students that began graduate studies in August 2016.   Twelve students were selected among PR-LSAMP participants that were newly admitted to graduate programs at the University of Puerto Rico?s Rio Piedras (UPRRP) and Mayaguez (UPRM) campuses.  The distribution by field of study of the fellows was: 6 in Biology (5 UPRRP, 1 UPRM), 1 in Bio-Engineering (UPRM), 1 in Biological Oceanography (UPRM); 2 in Chemistry (UPRRP), 1 in Environmental Science (UPRRP) and 1 in Mathematics (UPRRP)  All of the selected fellows were Hispanic and 10 successfully completed the requirements of their respective graduate programs over the project?s intended funding period of two-years.  At the end of two years the fellows had GPAs over 3.47 (on a 4.00-point system) and the average GPA was 3.74.  The total number of credits approved at the end of the period ranged from 24 to 47 with an average of 34.   Besides being recipients of a $32K annual stipend and multiple benefits, BDP fellows participated in a series of program sponsored activities geared to better equip them to excel in their graduate studies and to foster in them a high valuation for multidisciplinary that should enrich their future careers as independent researchers.  Throughout the two-year duration of the Program, the fellows were engaged in a minimum of 22 different scientific research and professional skill development workshops; with topics ranging from Molecular Biology to Nanoscience and Nanotechnology; from strategies to be an effective mentor to strategies on how to apply to NSF Graduate Research Fellowship.  The personal trajectory of the researchers lecturing in this seminar series was incorporated in their talks, casting them as role models for our fellows. In addition, the fellows participated in a total of four field trips that showcased the need and benefits for a multidisciplinary research approach.  All of the fellows enjoyed program-sponsored travel to scientific and technical meetings, courses and training.  All fellows  presented their research  findings in the Puerto Rico Interdisciplinary Scientific Meeting held in Universidad del Turabo in April 2018, the largest scientific meeting in Puerto Rico.     Ten fellows were supported in semester and summer experiences in different scientific activities in national and international venues such as the: Woods Hole Marine Laboratory, Argonne National Laboratory, Columbia University, Organization for Tropical Studies in Costa Rica and Cornell University. The International venues examples as follows: Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptors 2017 Meeting, Chania, Greece; Field Research at the R&iacute;o Bravo Conservation and Management Area, Belize; Research on Landslides and Ecological Succession, Uxtabil, Guatemala; and the 55th Annual Meeting of the Association for Tropical Biology and Conservation in Malaysia  At the end of the project 10 of the initial 12 fellows remained in the pipeline with expectations for graduation ranging from 1 to 4 years.  The totality of these fellows has progressed to degree candidacy.   Finally, as the PR-LSAMP Bridge to the Doctorate Program projects itself into the future of Puerto Rican youth pursuing careers in STEM fields we proudly report that our fellows served as role models to approximately 1283 High School Students during presentations in 25 public schools. Furthermore, all of our fellows provided long term one-to-one mentorship for 12 undergraduate research students that will prospectively continue the work inspired by their research.
