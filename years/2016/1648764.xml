<AbstractNarration>TheÂ broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is the possibility to revolutionize the treatment of cancer through more sensitive and specific cancer biomarker detection. 1.66 million Americans were diagnosed with cancer in 2014 alone, of which 585,720 died.  The sum of all health care costs in 2011 for cancer in the US was $88.7 billion.  A low cost, less invasive, and more sensitive detector will allow earlier detection of cancer and thus lower the cost of treatment and increase survival rates.  Higher sensitivity cancer detection will lead to early detection, enable targeted treatment, and save money and lives while improving quality of life.  In addition, the knowledge learned from this grant can be applied to other sensors in which the nanowires are functionalized for detection of materials.  These sensors could include sensors to support the Internet of Things, pollution monitoring, and ensuring high water quality.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project will advance our knowledge of using nanowires as detectors. Nanowire sensors have a high surface area-to-volume ratio.  Thus their detection limit is dramatically lowered and their sensitivity is increased relative to non-nanostructured sensors.  This improvement is necessary for many biological assays. Others have made nanowire sensors and demonstrated high sensitivity.  However, the fabrication techniques they use to make their sensors are expensive and slow.  Thus, they are only able to get 1-10 nanowires per sensor and manufacturing throughput is low.  This project will use a high-throughput and low-cost process, and that results in millions of nanowires per sensor.  The nanowires will increase the surface area by over a thousand times thus allowing for more sensitive detection.   Instead of using horizontal wires like the competition, the proposed sensor uses arrays of vertically aligned nanowires.  The device design solves the typical challenges of contacting large arrays of nanowires and enables the measurement of both optical and electrical signals simultaneously.  The proposed project will measure a commercially relevant biomarker for lung cancer.  In addition, the investigators will detect two biomarkers on the same chip, thus demonstrating how the technology can be used to test multiple biomarkers on the same chip.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[Advanced Silicon Group is commercializing a biosensor made from vertically aligned silicon nanowires.  Our device design allows us to make use of the advantages of nanowire sensors without the challenges of manufacturing that the other device designs present.  In our sensor, light is irradiated onto a silicon nanowire array.  Electron-hole pairs are created inside the nanowires.  If the surface is electronically passivated, the carriers will be extracted out of the p-n junction below the nanowires and produce current.  If the surface is not passivated, the carriers will recombine and not produce current.  When proteins/DNA are present, the charge from the proteins passivates the nanowires.  Thus, by looking at the current under illumination, we can determine how many proteins have attached to the nanowire array.  This project demonstrated arrays of vertically aligned silicon nanowires could be used to detect biomarkers by looking at the change in the electro-optical properties of the nanowire arrays.  In particular the team built a biosensor to measure proteins in a solution.  The team showed that proteins bind to the silicon nanowires more effectively than to planar substrates and that the change in photocurrent is enhanced on nanowire devices compared to planar devices. By using a tag on the antibody and looking at the binding of this antibody to different surfaces using confocal microscopic images, the team was able to compare the binding efficiency of nanowires vs. planar surfaces.  In addition, the change in current for unoptimized nanowire sensors after being exposed to the protein if interest was compared to the change in current for planar samples after being exposed to the protein of interest.  Furthermore, the team showed that the nanowire density is an important knob in optimizing the performance of the biosensors.  With a lower density of nanowire arrays, the sensors had a lower limit of detection at least as low as 5ug/mL, which is sufficient for many applications. By optimizing the nanowire device, the detection limit is expected to be even lower.  These results demonstrate that the mechanism for our sensor works and that we can detect a biomarker using the electrical signal of our sensor.  In addition, this result shows that nanowires are indeed more sensitive than planar samples.  Thus, this phase 1 STTR lowered the technical risk of our biosensor.
