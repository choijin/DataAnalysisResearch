<AbstractNarration>There are no Point of Care sensing platforms that are available to monitor a patient's biological response to disease triggers such as airborne irritants and toxins by direct and rapid profiling of critical biomarkers. There are also no platforms for monitoring the recurrence of an infectious disease or cancer that may be present in biofluid samples. Such biomarker-based diagnostics could have numerous applications in precision medicine. These devices could lead to personalized treatment strategies for individual patients. This project will develop such a system that will also be useful for the diagnosis of cancers in early stages by identifying rare aberrant cells in biological samples taken during annual physical examinations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PIs will develop a microfluidic device for single cell analysis that incorporates an out-of-plane multimode optical fiber to generate three excitation and three detection points using only one source and one detector.  Light will be propagated through the fiber in a tunneling mode so that two excitation and detection spots can be generated at the end of the fiber. The efficiency of loading and substrate specificity will be evaluated, and peptide sequences modified to optimize loading efficiency.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The team of investigators from Kansas State University, led by Christopher T. Culbertson and Stefan H. Bossmann have designed a microfluidic device for single-cell analyses with integrated optical fiber bridges.  We have developed an integrated microfluidic device capable of rapidly analyzing individual cells.  This device incorporates 3 on-chip pneumatic pumps that are used to transport cells into a channel intersection where the cells are rapidly lysed using an electrical current and the lysate is electrophoretically injected into a separation channel where the analytes are separated via electrophoresis. The lysate components are detected using laser induced fluorescence (LIF) in an epi-illumination setup where the excitation light is focused into the channel through a microscope objective and the emitted light from the lysate is collected through the same lens.  The device also incorporates an optical fiber bridge that allows for the first time the monitoring of cell lysis, lysate injection, and the separation of the labeled lysate components using only a single excitation source and detector.  One end of the optical fiber bridge is placed above the channel and the microscope objective where the lysate is detected and the other end is placed at the lysis intersection. The excitation light that is used to detect the lysate is also captured by the fiber and piped to the lysis intersection.  As an intact cell enters the lysis intersection the light exiting the fiber excites the fluorophores in the cell.  The emitted light from the cell is then captured by the fiber optic and transferred back to the end above the separation channel where it is collected by the microscope objective and detected using the same detector used to detect the lysate.  This allows for the determination of absolute migration times for the lysate components and much more robust identification of the peaks based upon known migration times. Additionally if the excitation light is focused slightly differently it can be made to enter the fiber optic in such a way that the light tunnels through the fiber optic creating essentially a ring of excitation light coming out the other end rather than a typical Gaussian profile.  This actually allows the cell transiting the intersection to be detected twice so that now the cell velocity entering the lysis intersection can be measured.  This results in 3 signals per cell using only a single excitation source and detector - two signals for the intact cell and one for the lysates.  This helps to determine the efficiency of lysate injection for quality control analysis of the lysate data.  The velocity determinations can also be used to examine flow patterns in microfluidic channels and particle size distributions.  Our novel microfluidic technology can be paired with multiple nanobiosensors for protease and kinase profiling in cells, as well as the detection of cytokines and nitric oxide concentrations, which are important in cell signaling. The synergy of fiber-optic microfluidic technology and metabolic assays for single cells will enable the advanced detection of multiple conditions at the singular level, such as cancer, bacterial and viral infections, immune dysfunction, or Alzheimer?s disease. Finally, the rapid analysis of thousands of cells will enable unprecedented statistical insight in disease populations.
