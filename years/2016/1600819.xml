<AbstractNarration>This award provides funding to help defray the expenses of US participants in the "Annual Spring Institute on Noncommutative Geometry and Operator Algebras (NCGOA) 2016" that will be held from May 17-25, 2016, on the campus of the University of Bonn, Germany.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This event is the fourteenth installment of the Vanderbilt Noncommutative Geometry and Operator Algebra (NCGOA) spring conferences, a series that each year brings together a diverse group of roughly one hundred mathematicians whose primary research interests are in operator algebras and related topics. The main foci of the  2016 event, which will not be held in Nashville but will be integrated into a trimester program on von Neumann algebras at the Hausdorff Institute in Bonn, are deformation/rigidity theory, free probability theory, and subfactors. The conference program provides ample opportunity for graduate students, postdocs, and other young scientists to present their work.
