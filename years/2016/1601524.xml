<AbstractNarration>Coastal wetlands filter water, buffer the coastline from storms, provide important habitat and are globally important for the storage of carbon. Carbon storage in wetland soils can be for the long-term and influences whether wetlands will persist during sea level rise by increasing a change in sediment elevation. Climate change and local freshwater management are increasing the movement of saltwater into coastal freshwater wetlands, altering the conditions of the wetlands and causing shifts in the types of vegetation growing there. In many tropical and subtropical coastal wetlands, mangroves are replacing grass-dominated marshes, with uncertain effects on the capability of soils to store carbon. This is especially true of coastal wetlands, because of their sensitivity to sea level rise. The goals of this study are to identify changes in the storage of carbon in wetland soils and releases to the atmosphere of the gases carbon dioxide and methane that occur as coastal wetland change from marshes dominated by grasses to mangrove forests. The research findings will provide valuable information for the conservation and restoration of the Florida Everglades locally as well as coastal wetlands throughout the world. Furthermore, the findings will provide a broader understanding of plant and soil interactions and ecosystem function in a changing world. The project will provide hands on scientific experience identifying and growing wetland plants and restoring urban coastal wetlands for local high school students during "Marsh Mangress", an outreach activity at Florida International University. This activity will also provide undergraduate students with laboratory and field experience at a majority minority institution.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will utilize a vegetation gradient in 10,000 Islands National Wildlife Refuge in Naples, FL in which sea level rise and freshwater manipulation have driven vegetation change and mangrove encroachment, in order to understand how changing abiotic conditions and vegetation state change alter carbon storage through time. Changing carbon storage will be measured as current organic carbon stocks (above and belowground biomass, soil carbon content), inputs (root productivity, sediment surface accretion) and carbon losses (breakdown rates of organic carbon, gas flux measurements), past carbon sequestration rate (radiometric soil dating), and potential future rates of carbon loss (reciprocal transplant of organic matter to represent freshwater restoration or continuing saltwater intrusion). Specifically, the goals of this project are to: 1) Identify differences in carbon storage, accretion, and gas flux among wetlands dominated by brackish marsh, saltwater marsh, and mangrove-dominated vegetation communities. 2) Determine which abiotic and biotic mechanisms drive differences in soil carbon dynamics among wetland types. 3) Quantify the effect of time since mangrove establishment on soil carbon storage, accretion and gas flux by establishing a chronosequence of mangrove encroachment based on soil dating and historic aerial photography.</AbstractNarration>

In particular, coastal wetlands are among the most effective ecosystems at removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and storing it in plant biomass and soil organic carbon, where it can improve resilience in the face of sea-level rise. However, coastal wetlands are undergoing large changes as climate change and local water management influence saltwater intrusion, and vegetation communities shift, with uncertain impacts on ecosystem carbon storage. We addressed three main questions: 1) How do C storage, accretion, and gas flux vary among wetlands dominated by brackish marsh, saltwater marsh, mixed marsh/mangrove and mangrove-dominated vegetation communities?, 2) &nbsp;What abiotic and biotic mechanisms drive differences in soil C dynamics among wetland types?, 3) How does time since mangrove establishment affect soil C storage, accretion and gas flux?&nbsp;</p> <p>To quantify differences in carbon stocks and fluxes, we established 3 transects that included three distinct marsh types and 6 age classes of mangroves (<em>n </em>= 27 sites) along an inland to coastal transect. To quantify changes within mangrove dominated sites, we used historic aerial photography to create a temporal developmental gradient from sites transitioning to mangrove vegetation to sites that have been mangrove dominated for 77-88 years. In each ecosystem type, we quantified the major carbon stocks (above and belowground biomass and soil), input rates (root productivity, surface accretion and change in aboveground biomass) and loss rates (ecosystem-specific roots and litter and standard organic matter decomposition), and measured overall soil carbon accretion over 10-, 50- and, 100-year intervals with <sup>210</sup>Pb in a subset of sites.</p> <p>We found that vegetation shifts caused by saltwater intrusion have profound impacts on carbon stocks and fluxes in coastal wetlands and that carbon storage in mangrove forests changes through time with ecosystem development. Brackish and saltmarsh contained similar levels of carbon in biomass, but soil OC was 4x higher in brackish than saltmarsh soils, indicating a significant loss of soil carbon with saltwater intrusion. Because this ecosystem carbon loss takes place belowground, it is often overlooked, but plays an essential role in ecosystem function and resilience to sea level rise. However, we found that in areas where mangroves have become established, carbon stocks are rebuilt and greatly exceed the amount of carbon stored in marsh communities as they develop through time. After 10 years of mangrove establishment, wetlands stored 10x more carbon in biomass than marshes and after 20 years, mangrove communities stored 30x more biomass aboveground and 2x more belowground.
