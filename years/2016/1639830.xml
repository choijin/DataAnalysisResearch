<AbstractNarration>This award to Temple University provides partial support to the International, Mind, Brain, and Education Society (IMBES) conference, scheduled to be held in Toronto, Canada, in September, 2016. It is a unique opportunity for researchers in educational neuroscience to share the results of their cutting-edge work with educators and receive feedback on the translational opportunities for the research, and for educators to update their understanding of the cognitive and neural bases of learning and share best practices with regard to techniques, tools, and achievements. The award will support presentations related to the neural basis of STEM learning, including participation costs for researchers, educators, and students. The project is funded by the EHR Core Research program, which supports fundamental research that advances the research literature on STEM learning. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sessions at the conference will cover such topics as early childhood interventions, the effects of growing up in a digital world, insights into reading disorders, number sense and math achievement, combining research and practice approaches to teacher professional development, bilingualism and the underpinnings of STEM learning. The conference includes keynote speeches, symposia, workshops, general paper sessions, and poster sessions.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The International Mind, Brain and Education Society hosted its 5th Biennial Conference September 15-17, 2016 in Toronto, Ontario, Canada.  The conference was deemed a success in no small part due to the generous award provided by the NSF.  279 people registered for the conference (an increase of 22 percent from 2014).  16 countries were represented at the conference with people coming from as far away as South Africa and Israel.  Researchers and students from such diverse fields as neuroscience, education, developmental psychology, pediatrics, physics and genetics as well as educational consultants, teachers, resource teachers, policy makers, program managers and superintendents of education were in attendance.     As a result of NSF funding, five keynote speakers were invited to the conference.  In addition 17 symposia involving 45 speakers were offered over the course of two days.   NSF funding supported the travel, registration, and accommodation costs for the keynote speakers and symposium speakers.   This was a key component to the success of the conference as it allowed us to attract eminent researchers in the field of mind, brain and education.     NSF funding also covered the printing of 280 conference programs, a conference banner (that can be used at future conferences) and 50 posters that were sent out to Mind, Brain and Education programs world-wide in an effort to publicize the conference and attract registrants.      Plans are underway for the 6th Biennial International Mind, Brain and Education Conference in 2018 in Los Angeles, CA.
