<AbstractNarration>This grant funds students and early-career faculty to travel to the Foundations of Software Engineering Symposium (FSE 2016) in Seattle, Washington in November of 2016.  Participants will attend two events for junior researchers in the field of Software Engineering. The first is the Doctoral Symposium for PhD students.  The second event is the Mentorship Sessions program, which connects junior researchers (senior PhD students and pre-tenure faculty) with senior researchers who will serve as mentors. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The education, training and mentoring received by the participants helps build the next generation of US-based researchers and educators, also encourages the exchange of ideas and new research collaborations to advance the field of Software Engineering, which is important to the economy.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This grant funded two activities, the Doctoral Symposium and the Mentorship Sessions.  The Doctoral Symposium supported PhD students working in the area of software engineering. Participants presented and discussed their doctoral research with a panel of senior researchers in the software engineering community, in a constructive and friendly atmosphere. Specifically, the symposium:  Provided a setting whereby students received feedback on their doctoral research and guidance on future directions from the Doctoral Symposium Panel; Fostered the creation of a supportive community of scholars and a spirit of collaborative research; and Increased interaction between the student participants and other participants at the main conference.   The Mentorship Sessions connected young researchers (senior PhD students and pre-tenure faculty) working in software engineering with senior researchers (mentors) in their area. It provided a low-pressure atmosphere in which young researchers could meet and get advice from more senior members of the community. Participants discussed research directions, career goals, and generally got advice. Mentors met upcoming researchers in their areas and passed along their tried and true tips for success in software research. The outcomes were:  New connections and collaborations between junior and senior researchers, including bridging academia and industry, Increased feelings of community and belonging in the young researchers through positive interactions with established researchers, and A more cohesive software engineering research community.
