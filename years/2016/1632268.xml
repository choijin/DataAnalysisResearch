<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this project can lead to a revolution in the consumer electronics market&lt;br/&gt;(mobile handsets, tablets, game consoles and wearables), wherein high performance, low power, small footprint&lt;br/&gt;multisensing (not limited to inertial sensing) platforms with timing devices, are all directly microfabricated on a common&lt;br/&gt;ASIC substrate. Sensor fusion can produce unprecedented user experiences by using data collected from all sensors and&lt;br/&gt;processed using machine learning algorithms. This can further boost the sensor and timing markets that are expected to&lt;br/&gt;exceed $6 billion dollars by 2017. Moreover, the emergent Internet of Things (IoTs) and wearable markets are expected to&lt;br/&gt;reach $20 billion dollars by 2025, which can induce a rapid growth of such intelligent sensor fusion market. This can have&lt;br/&gt;a tremendous societal impact as wearable devices and IoT systems, interfaced with mobile platforms, can be used to&lt;br/&gt;monitor people?s health, safety and energy consumption. Making these solutions affordable will make it amenable to low&lt;br/&gt;income households not only in the US but also around the world. It will also enable researchers to attain new frontiers of&lt;br/&gt;knowledge such as in digital sensory systems. The long-term goals are to provide such intelligent sensor fusion solutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project seeks to demonstrate wafer-scale microfabrication of&lt;br/&gt;Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) inertial sensors directly on the application specific integrated circuit (ASIC)&lt;br/&gt;substrates, by using electroplated copper (e-Cu) as a structural material. MEMS inertial sensors, such as gyroscopes and&lt;br/&gt;accelerometers, are pervasively used in consumer electronics and automotive industries. Current trends are, however,&lt;br/&gt;requiring higher device performance with smaller footprints, wherein multi-degree-of-freedom sensors are integrated on&lt;br/&gt;the same package, to enable new capabilities and user experiences. These requirements can be met by monolithically&lt;br/&gt;fabricating inertial sensors on ASIC substrates, which is complex to achieve with silicon as a structural material. Using e-&lt;br/&gt;Cu, which is currently used for ASIC metal interconnects, as the structural material, can enable easier routing to&lt;br/&gt;implement optimized mechanical structures, smaller dimensions given the high density of copper, extremely low cost as&lt;br/&gt;no wafer bonding is required, smaller form factors, multiple sensors on a single die, and much smaller parasitics providing&lt;br/&gt;low noise and higher performance. Phase II tasks will be to wafer-scale fabricate an inertial measurement unit that is&lt;br/&gt;monolithically integrated with its ASIC with optimal performance parameters.</AbstractNarration>
