<AbstractNarration>This interdisciplinary research project will explore the factors associated with success in restoring forest ecosystems in river basins that have been degraded, including the reciprocal causality between people's attitudes and the dynamics of plant communities on land they are managing.  The project will provide new insights and information about plant community dynamics before and after restoration and the attitudes, knowledge sources, and perspectives of land managers regarding restoration.  The project will generate new knowledge about interactions between human and natural systems with respect to the influence of ecological variables on public and private land managers' perspectives as well as the influence of land managers' perspectives on the ecological variables.  Project findings will inform land managers about the best practices for restoration and will provide much-needed feedback to restoration scientists about the degree to which their findings are being used and whether anticipated improvements to plant communities are occurring.  Results will be disseminated through regional workshops and trade publications aimed at land managers as well as through scholarly presentations and publications directed toward the scientific community.  The project also will provide education and training opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Billions of dollars are spent each year to restore degraded river systems around the world.  Research on efforts to restore degraded riparian ecosystems have tended to focus on the interplay between engineering designs and the natural dynamics of water, vegetation, and other natural components of the ecosystem, but very little attention has been given to ascertaining how the knowledge, backgrounds, and motivations of people involved in restoration affect the ecological outcomes of such projects.  The investigators will undertake this project by expanding on a database they previously assembled based on detailed vegetation surveys and environmental parameters for more than 400 sites along streams in the Colorado River and Rio Grande basins in Arizona, California, Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico, and Utah.  They will seek answers to four sets of questions using these natural-system data and data about human attitudes and behavior gathered through the conduct of online surveys and in-person interviews with land managers for each of the sites:  (1) How does plant community structure change as a consequence of restoration?  (2) What aspects of a land manager's background best explain variability in attitudes toward nature and science?  (3) Do elements of the natural environment predict land manager attitudes about science or nature?  (4) Do the attitudes of land managers toward science and/or nature affect the success of restoration projects?  The impact of restoration activities will be measured with comparisons of vegetation over time within restoration sites as well as comparisons among restoration sites and non-restoration reference sites.  The variability in restoration outcomes will be explored using the human-system data, including information about knowledge sources, perspectives on science and nature, and background information, such as education level and level of authority.  Qualitative information from interviews will complement the quantitative data from the statistical analyses in order to ascertain which of many factors are important for describing overall patterns.  This project is supported by the NSF Dynamics of Coupled Natural and Human Systems (CNH) Program.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The overarching goal of this project was to determine how the natural environment influences and is influenced by human attitudes, backgrounds and decisions, with the applied goal of improving restoration outcomes. Many studies have explored the perceptions and backgrounds of land managers regarding restoration, however, never before had these data been directly related to the ecological outcomes of restoration. To do this, we collected quantitative and qualitative data from land managers associated with invasive tree restoration sites across the southwestern United States for which we had detailed vegetation and environmental data.&nbsp;The research had four dimensions:</p> <p><strong>Plant community dynamics before and after restoration (Natural Dimension):</strong>&nbsp;How does plant community structure change as a function of restoration?</p> <p>Using vegetation data compiled from 244 restoration sites and 172 reference sites across the southwestern U.S. (Figure 1), we examined the influence of environmental conditions as well as removal of non-native invasive shrubs in the <em>Tamarix</em> genus and other restoration methods on plant community structure. We found that all <em>Tamarix </em>removal methods resulted in less <em>Tamarix </em>cover, with active removal methods such as cutting and herbicide application reducing <em>Tamarix </em>more than passive removal through a biological control agent<sup>1</sup> (Figure 2a). Native species cover increased with <em>Tamarix </em>removal, permanent stream flow, lower grazing pressure, soil salinity, atmospheric temperatures and higher precipitation<sup>1,2</sup> (Figure 2b). Species diversity also increased, however, much of this diversity could be attributed to an increased number of secondary invasive species.<sup>3</sup> Importantly, removal of the invasive tree stimulated the establishment of native willow trees-- critical habitat for an endangered bird.<sup>4</sup></p> <p><strong>Aspects of land managers regarding restoration (Human Dimension):</strong>&nbsp;What aspects of a land managers' attitudes and background best explain management decisions?</p> <p>We did not find that management decisions corresponded to either backgrounds or attitudes.<sup>5</sup> Instead, manager decisions were strongly aligned with recommendations made by scientists, regardless of the manager's education level or perspective about science. Most managers used diverse information sources, monitored results, and considered broad project goals (Figure 3).<sup>6</sup></p> <p>We also demonstrated the utility of a novel statistical approach for the analysis of coupled human and natural systems data (CHANS).<sup>5</sup> With this tool, we found that managers could be classified as being either "federal multitaskers" or "educated specialists", while decisions were characterized by being "quick and active" or "thorough and careful".</p> <p><strong>The influence of ecological variables on land managers (Natural Dimension's effect on Human Dimension):</strong><em> </em>Do elements of the natural environment (e.g., the state or location of the natural system) predict land manager characteristics, decisions or attitudes toward science?</p> <p>We found that manager characteristics and management decisions were related to environmental conditions. Specifically, federal managers who collaborated less and used fewer types of monitoring methods were more frequently found in wetter areas with cooler maximum temperatures. A high priority of wildlife as a restoration goal was most likely in projects with higher temperatures. Areas with higher temperatures are concentrated in the lower ranges of our study area where there is critical nesting habitat for an endangered bird, the Southwestern Willow Flycatcher. It is likely that importance of habitat conservation for these managers influenced the high priority of wildlife goals. Attitudes toward science and relationship with nature were not significantly related to any environmental variables.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>The influence of land managers' characteristics on vegetation (Human Dimension's effect on Natural Dimension):</strong>&nbsp;Do the attitudes, backgrounds, and decisions of land managers affect the success of restoration projects?</p> <p>By incorporating manager characteristics into models of restoration success we explained more than 60% of the variability in restoration outcomes (Figure 4). This represented an average of a 47% increase in the variability explained by environmental variables alone. Our research showed that collaboration (e.g., with scientists) and using a wide range of information sources to inform a restoration project led to better outcomes.
