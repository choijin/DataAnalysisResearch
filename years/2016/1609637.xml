<AbstractNarration>One of the National Academy of Engineering's 21st Century Grand Challenges is "Advancing Personalized Learning" and this project helps to contribute to this knowledge base.  Active learning in the classroom has been proven to be an effective approach to improve student learning and engagement, as well as readiness for the STEM workforce.  An example of active learning, which will be part of this project, is the flipped classroom model where the sequence of content delivery and practice of problem solving is flipped. Students are initially introduced to the lecture content prior to and outside of class, and participate in collaborative activities under the facilitation of an instructor during the classroom. To add to the flipped classroom model and to further enhance student learning, this project introduces a freely-available adaptive platform to personalize the pre-class activities for every learner.  It is expected that this personalized pre-class experience will further enrich student collaboration and learning in the classroom.  This project involves both development of the platform and assessment of student learning to investigate the efficacy of the method. This body of work will advance our understanding on the impact of the combined flipped and adaptive approaches on cognitive and affective learning gains of students from diverse populations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many engineering problems result in mathematical models that do not have exact solutions or otherwise would take a long time to solve.  To solve such problems, many engineering students and also mathematics students, take a course called Numerical Methods in order to learn computational techniques to solve complex mathematical models.  The context of this project is a Numerical Methods course that will be redesigned as an active learning classroom incorporating adaptive (personalized) learning.  More specifically, this project will compare the effectiveness of three instructional approaches (a flipped class with adaptive learning, a flipped class without adaptive learning, and a blended class without adaptive learning) on students' conceptual gains, procedural knowledge gains, higher-order problem solving, and affective learning. Both qualitative and quantitative metrics will be used during this investigation.  Project deliverables include instructional materials and best practices for teaching Numerical Methods in a flipped setting on an adaptive platform. Dissemination avenues include the freely-available Knewton adaptive platform, an open education resource portal, and social media.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Studies analyzed for college courses taught in STEM fields show that active learning increases average grades by half-a-letter over traditional lectures.  Failure rates in classes with conventional lectures increase by 55% over rates with active learning.  Additionally, in a recent study, the gap in course passing rates between overrepresented and underrepresented students was shown to have lessened by 45%. One of the approaches to include active learning is by flipping the classroom, where one receives lecture content in one's own space (home) via video or other resources, while active learning exercises that require students to solve problems are done in the classroom.  However, one of the challenges of the flipped classroom is the adequate preparation of students before coming to the class.  To improve such preparation, activities were completed by students through lessons developed by the instructor on an adaptive platform.  These lessons provided an individualized student experience as the platform responded to the performance and activity of each student.  This exploratory project developed, revised, and refined adaptive lessons for pre-class learning and preparation for half of the topics of an undergraduate engineering course in Numerical Methods.  The adaptive lessons provided access through multiple resources such as video lectures, textbook content, and simulations while suggesting personalized paths based on assessment through several types of questions.The project also used, revised, and improved existing resources, including 1) audiovisual lectures, 2) problem-based exercises to foster higher-order learning, and 3) survey and focus group instruments to assess affective learning components associated with adaptive learning.  A comprehensive assessment plan was executed to measure both affective and performance outcomes associated with adaptive learning.   Although the overall improvement in the final examination performance was small when adaptive lessons were used in the flipped classroom, the improvement in the performance on the open-ended, free-response questions on the final exam for community college transfers, underrepresented minority (URM) students, and Pell grant recipients was of medium effect size.  The classroom environment was also generally rated higher for the adaptive-learning flipped classroom, with five of the seven classroom environment dimensions rated higher in the adaptive classroom.  The Individualization dimension, which measures individual or differential treatment and is a primary goal of adaptive instruction, was rated significantly higher with adaptive learning.  Focus groups conducted with female and URM students had more favorable and positive perspectives towards the adaptive software, compared to the majority groups in engineering.  The advantages of the adaptive platform uncovered during the focus groups included understanding the course content, increased accountability with the material, the guided approach of the adaptive platform, availability of all resources in one place, the ability to work at one's own pace, the capability to re-watch video lectures, and the opportunity to re-work questions as many times as needed or desired.  Under the premise that engaging students in active and collaborative work increases learning, this project developed best practices for teaching a typical flipped STEM course with adaptive learning. These practices are helping faculty considering this mode of teaching for other engineering courses as well. The assessment efforts included analysis specific to under-represented minorities and non-traditional students, including community college transfers.Dissemination avenues of project materials included the highly-popular open education resource portal http://MathForCollege.com, social media including blogs, and several faculty workshops in universities and regional engineering education conferences.
