<AbstractNarration>Non-technical Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;One of the central and unresolved issues in modern condensed matter physics is the evolution of phases in materials with strong interactions among constituent electrons. Quantum phase transitions (QPT), achieved at nearly zero temperature by doping charges or application of pressure, are of particular interest, since they involve many research themes yet to be thoroughly explored, such as the roles of disorder, and short-time and short-ranged dynamic magnetic fluctuations which may be viewed as a precursor phenomenon to the magnetic order.  Using a beam of radioactive muon particles generated at particle accelerator facilities and implanting muons into solids, Muon Spin Relaxation (MuSR) provides a novel method to measure magnetic properties of solids.  In studies of magnetic phase transitions, MuSR measurements can determine the volume fraction of the magnetically ordered regions independently from the size of the individual ordered magnetic moments within the ordered regions. Thanks to this feature, MuSR has a unique advantage over conventional magnetization or elastic neutron scattering studies which measure volume-integrated responses. In this project, PI Uemura performs MuSR studies on magnetic order in selected systems which exhibit Mott metal-insulator transitions.  Mott transition was originally proposed by Sir Nevil Mott of the UK who was awarded a Nobel Prize for his theoretical prediction.  Interplays among metal-insulator transition, magnetic order, and structural phase transitions, however, have not yet been fully clarified.  In addition, the present project also examines magnetic phase transitions of particular weakly magnetic metals near disappearance of magnetic order. These studies may lead to better understandings of subtle phase transition phenomena caused by strong interactions among constituent electrons.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;The planned MuSR studies focus on (A) RENiO3 [RE=Rare Earth], V2O3 and several other Mott transition systems where strong correlations drive localization and magnetic order of otherwise metallic charges; and (B) (Mn,Fe)Si and a few other itinerant-electron magnets (IEM) where competing interactions and spin fluctuations lead to variety of novel spin phenomena.  In Mott systems (A), the PI aims to disentangle the roles of spin, charge and lattice and to develop a comprehensive understanding of generic and system-specific features of Mott transitions controlled by band width, charge filling and/or electric current. The goals of IEM studies (B) are to elucidate magnetic volume evolution, to clarify the roles of disorder in prototypical IEM systems and to study novel topological phase transitions in MnGe due to magnetic monopoles and the 3-dimensional Skyrmion lattice. Inelastic neutron scattering studies of V2O3 and (La,Sr)VO3 will also be performed to search for dynamic spin-charge soft mode of the imminent Mott transition.  To date, most theoretical studies on QPT were limited to second order QPT, due to lack of experimental results demonstrating first-order QPT / phase separation. The PI's recent results showed clear evidence for first-order QPT in MnSi, RENiO3 and V2O3, and a recovery of second order QPT due presumably to disorder in (Mn,Fe)Si. Present MuSR studies combined with other methods will contribute to new views and conjectures for first-order QPT, which may have far-reaching implications for studies of other relevant systems such as high-Tc and heavy fermion superconductors.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In this project, the PI Uemura applied the muon spin relaxation (MuSR) method to study magnetic phase transitions and the thermal and quantum evolutions of magnetic order in emergent systems which exhibit novel quantum behavior.  This research covered the following subjects: (1) Mott transition systems, (2) itinerant electron magnets, (3) diluted ferromagnetic semiconductors (DMS) iso-structural to Fe-based superconductors, and (4) magnetism and superconductivity of unconventional superconductors.  These studies have been carried out using positive muon beam obtained at TRIUMF (Canada) and PSI (Switzerland), in collaboration with scientists and graduate students from the US, Canada, Switzerland, Japan and China.   In intellectual merit, these activities led to significant progress in understanding of quantum phase transitions, thanks to MuSR's unique features of (a) having high sensitivity to magnetic order even in dilute / random spin systems; (b) independently determining the volume fraction of magnetically ordered regions and the size of the ordered moments; and (c) high sensitivity to dynamic spin fluctuations in a wide range of time scales.  In the Theme (1), first-order quantum phase evolutions, associated with phase separation without dynamic critical behavior, have been revealed and elucidated in Mott transition systems V2O3 which exhibits a one-step evolution from antiferromagnetic insulator (AFI) to paramagnetic metal (PMM) states, as well as in Ba(Co,Ni)S2 [Fig. 1], (La,Sr)VO3 and Ni(S,Se)2 which exhibit a two-step evolution from AFI to intermediate antiferromagnetic metal (AFM) to PMM states.  In the Theme (2), unlike the similar first-order quantum evolution observed in a weak helical magnet MnSi tuned by pressure, restoration of second order dynamic critical behavior was observed in (Mn,Fe)Si with pressure tuning [Fig. 2].  This uncovered an important role of disorder in quantum phase transitions in itinerant-electron systems.  In a Skyrmion system MnGe, a clear dynamic critical behavior of Mn moments was observed at the boundary of the helical hedge-hog Skyrmion lattice phase and the field-induced ferromagnetic phase, adding a new information on the relationship between topology and criticality.  In the Theme (3), the present project confirmed ferromagnetic order with full volume fraction in several new hole-doped DMS systems and one new electron-doped DMS system synthesized by the PI's collaborators in Beijing and Zhejiang. The PI's lifework studies of unconventional superconductors have been continued as the Theme (4) in this project.  In Fe-based system BaFe2As2, the evolution from the parent antiferromagnetic (AF) state to superconducting (SC) state was elucidated by (Fe,Ni) substitutions, which revealed first order quantum phase transition with phase separation and reentrant phenomena at the AF-SC boundary [Fig. 3].  A new type of cuprate superconductor Ba2CuO4 was synthesized in Beijing IOP, and the PI's group performed MuSR studies of the superfluid density rho_s to show that the system shares properties of the overdoped cuprates.  Similar studies of the superfluid density of 2H NoSe2 and Td MoTe2 systems in ambient and applied hydrostatic pressure revealed a nearly linear correlation of  rho_s and the superconducting Tc, yet with the slope being about 20 times different from those for hole-doped cuprates.  Static magnetic order was unraveled in 2H MoTe2 and 2H MoSe2 as the first examples to show involvement of magnetism in transition metal di-chalcogenide systems [Fig. 4].  The PI also extended phenomenological discussions of unconventional SC systems based on Uemura plot, by pointing out that the onset temperatures of the photo-induced transient SC state and the vortex Nernst effect can be explained as the development of the local phase coherence among pre-formed bosonic pairs at temperatures well above the SC transition temperature Tc [Fig. 5].   For Broader Impact, the PI upgraded the Frontiers of Condensed Matter Physics (FCMP) lecture course at Columbia University which he initiated in 2011.  In this course, leading researchers give pedagogical and intuitive presentation(s) on their own research providing some take-home messages even for entry-level graduate students.  Partially supported by the present NSF grant, four FCMP lecture courses were organized during 2017 - 2019, enrolled by total ~ 110 Columbia students and also involving additional grad students from Rice, U Oregon and UC Berkeley in online simultaneous broadcast (simulcast).  In the Fall 2017 Semester, the PI visited Ecole Polytechnique (Paris) and organized an FCMP course for graduate students in Paris (Ecole Polytechnique, Orsay, Sorbonne) which was also simulcasted to Max Planck Institutes (Germany), Columbia, Rutgers, and PSI.  The PI also organized FCMP Workshops in 2017 in Tokyo / Tokai, and in 2018 at Frascati (Rome) [Fig. 6], each gathering about 70 leading scientists and 30-40 FCMP graduate students from over the world.  These FCMP activities pioneered global online education involving forefront researchers in the world.  The present project also supported human resource development of five PhD students and one undergrad student of Columbia and ~ 10 grad students from McMaster, U Tokyo, Zhejiang U and Beijing IOP who all participated in the international collaboration at TRIUMF as described above.
