<AbstractNarration>Non-technical: This NSF/FDA Scholar-in-Residence award by the Biomaterials program in the Division of Materials Research to the University of Arkansas is to develop a microdialysis sampling system to assess the localized chemistry associated with biofilm/polymer interfaces. Biofilms are complex chemical matrices produced by communities of bacteria. In a biofilm, free-floating bacteria begin to form a community of bacteria and start synthesizing specialized chemical matrices in support of this bacterial community. The bacteria in the biofilm are far more antibiotic-resistant than the free-floating ones, and the biofilm formation adds enormous costs to healthcare and various industries. There is considerable interest in the improvement of scientific methods for early biofilm detection and its eradication. Bacteria communicate with each other through the biofilm via a process called quorum sensing. In quorum sensing, chemicals unique to the bacterial species are released, and 'talk' to each others present in the surrounding medium. This project will use the microdialysis sampling approach to collect the quorum sensing chemicals from the bacterial/material interface. The broader impact of the project is in the early detection of the biofilm formation on medical devices, and possible development of treatments to control the biofilm formation. The proposed approaches also could allow the implementation of various treatments to see how these affect the bacterial community, chemical communication and the biofilm structure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical: The primary goal for this NSF/FDA Scholar-in-Residence award is to create a dual culture system with microdialysis sampling that incorporates medically-relevant bacteria (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis) and macrophages (RAW 267.4).  Microdialysis sampling provides a unique platform to quantify localized chemistry in situ at the bacterial colonization/material interface. Aim 1 of the project seeks to develop the microdialysis sampling/biofilm interface. In Aim 2, localized pH changes and quorum sensing signals will be quantified in real-time during the biofilm colonization process onto the dialysis polymeric membrane. Aim 3 seeks to develop a biofilm/macrophage co-culture system to address needed challenges in understanding initial host response to bacterial biofilms. Building on the strength of the investigator with macrophage biology and associated cytokine signaling measurements using microdialysis, Aim 3 will develop a system to determine system parameters and signaling output that affect the combination of macrophage cells and bacteria. The successful outcomes of this proposed work include: 1) A rapid and interchangeable method to assess how different prophylactic treatments affect biofilm formation and quorum sensing. 2) A method to assess the temporal chemical dynamics associated with biofilm formation thus allowing important basic science studies to affect various checkpoints in the biofilm process. 3) An easy-to-use, robust and laboratory transferrable basic science method for monitoring various aqueous chemical aspects of interfacial biofilm chemistry. 4) A novel co-culture system to begin to assess the dynamic role of the localized immunological response, particularly macrophages, toward fighting and/or eliminating the initial formation of a bacterial colony and thus associated biofilm and infection. 5) Potential for in vitro to in vivo translation.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ NSF/FDA SIR: A Microdialysis-Based Co-Culture System for Molecular Treatment and Assessment of Biofilms.        This grant served as a means to allow the principal investigator (Julie Stenken) and one of her graduate students to create a new biofilm model system and to directly interact with the US FDA on an important problem relevant to public health.  This problem that was addressed related to biofilms and their associated infections that can occur with implanted or indwelling devices.  A biofilm is caused by bacteria that create a protective environment for themselves.  These films can occur on medical devices and catheters and create many health care problems and occasionally death.  The economic burden for eradicating biofilms is substantial.       The process that is believed to initiate biofilm formation is called quorum sensing.  Bacteria emit different chemicals that essentially serve as "radar" to determine the level or amount of bacterial species in a region.  Eventually the bacteria form a biofilm.  There has been substantial interest in this quorum sensing process as it relates to biofilm formation.  The work performed with this grant used a technique called microdialysis sampling to allow for in situ collection of the chemicals (quorum sensing chemicals) associated with biofilm formation.  The microdialysis probe serves as a device that then allows for collection of soluble chemicals emitted from the bacteria.       There are many successful outcomes for this 1-year project.     Intellectual Merit:  Successful biofilm formation on microdialysis probes for gram-positive (Staphylococcus Aureus) and gram-negative bacteria (Pseudomonas Aeruginosa).        Successful quantitation of quorum-sensing molecules from biofilms forming onto the outside of microdialysis probes serving as the model system.       Microdialysis sampling has been created as an initial successful model for biofilm formation and chemical interaction.        Broader Impact:   The PI was able to work at the US FDA and observe various aspects of their mission.  This information can be imparted to her undergraduate and graduate students during various advising and mentoring sessions.       A graduate student was able to work at the US FDA and observe their mission, which provided significant professional development.  This is important as many students do not have such experiences and may not know such jobs in service to our country exist.        Significant preliminary data was obtained to continue this work under the potential auspices of other federal agencies including the National Institutes of Health and the U.S. Military.      Biofilms are a tremendous healthcare burden and as such a proposal to the NIH to continue aspects of this work to help eradicate biofilms has been submitted.         Wounds can become infected with biofilms and as such this work is highly relevant to our military preparedness.
