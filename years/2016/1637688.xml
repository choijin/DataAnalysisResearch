<AbstractNarration>The PIs will host a workshop for early and mid-career polar researchers with the goal of improving the communication skills of Arctic researchers so that they can effectively convey the goals and results of their research to rural and Alaska Native audiences. These residents are already keenly aware of the influence of western science over policy-making in the Arctic, yet often feel disconnected from the researchers working in their back yards. The Alaska Science Communication (ASC) training will help NSF-funded researchers working in Alaska to better convey their research to people living in Alaska and to better connect with Alaskan communities, thereby, strengthening relationships critical for future work.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This 3-day workshop will dovetail western science approaches with Native knowledge as integrated tools for understanding and communicating environmental change in the Arctic. The science communication training program will focus on providing scientists with practical skills for presentations, approaches for working with and within Alaska communities, and using storytelling skills for communicating science in local communities. The workshop will be led by an integrated team, including an Alaskan science communication expert, Alaska Native journalist, Arctic natural scientists and a cultural anthropologist. The workshops will include participation by Alaska residents and Alaska Natives. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop will be held in the Fall 2016 in conjunction with the Sitka Whale Fest, which is often attended by scientists. Travel funding for eight scientist participants is included, but up to twenty scientists will be accommodated.  The Sitka setting will benefit from the proximity of Mt. Edgecumbe High School, providing participants with hands-on experience and feedback for communicating science to students at the state-operated Sitka boarding school, which has historically provided secondary education to students from over 90 villages across Alaska. The budget includes funding for two student interns to work with NSF-funded researchers in the field. These students will be selected following the workshop via a selection process that includes the PI, workshop participants and Alaska Native elders.</AbstractNarration>

These residents are already keenly aware of the influence of western science over policy-making in the Arctic, yet often feel disconnected from the researchers working in their back yards. As evaluations report, this workshop helped Arctic scientists learn communication skills and styles that improve their ability to convey their Arctic research and engage in more effective understanding of local knowledge. The science communication training program focused on providing scientists with practical skills for presentations, approaches for working with and within Alaska communities, and using storytelling skills for communicating science in local communities. The workshop was led by an integrated team, including an Alaskan science communication expert, Alaska Native journalist, and a cultural anthropologist. The workshops had participation from Alaska residents and Alaska Natives.&nbsp; The workshop was held in the Fall of 2016 at the Sitka Sound Science Center in Sitka, which has a legacy of scientific training in Alaska and professional, nationally-recognized expertise in science communication. &nbsp;The Sitka workshop setting benefitted from the proximity of Mt. Edgecumbe High School, providing participants with hands-on experience with feedback for communicating science to students at the state-operated boarding school, which has historically provided secondary education to students from over 130 villages across Alaska.&nbsp; The workshop also prepared scientists to use rural community resources to hire a local student to work on their scientific project and funded employment for two residents/students during summer field seasons.</p> <p>The communication of polar research findings to general audiences is gaining importance as Arctic-related climate changes have global impacts. In addition, communication of polar research to people living in the Arctic and subarctic, where rapid climate change is underway, is vital to community resilience. As the changing climate in the Arctic and subarctic is causing large and immediate impacts upon human systems, economies and cultures, scientifically-based management responses will be necessary. Additionally, resilience will also rely heavily on traditional knowledge that has facilitated human communities for thousands of years in the North. Understanding research conducted in Alaska is vital to the residents of these communities who live on the leading edges of polar climate change. Many Arctic residents have contended that they provide knowledge to scientists and receive little in return because scientific findings are only rarely reported back to communities or are communicated in a non-inclusive manner. Scientists often lack the cultural sensitivity and communication skills necessary to share the work effectively. This project facilitated opportunities to learn from residents and their equally valid traditional knowledge. This workshop results included NSF&ndash;funded scientists gaining skills through practice and real life scenarios, that allow them to better able to convey the importance of their work in a way that is heard and understood by Alaskan community members, strengthening relationships critical for future work.</p> <p>The Sitka Sound Science Center&rsquo;s Alaska Science Communication workshop met its two primary goals:</p> <p><em>Goal 1.&nbsp; Improve science communication for scientists working in rural Alaskan communities.</em></p> <p>The three-day workshop provided science communication training to NSF-funded scientists working in Alaska.
