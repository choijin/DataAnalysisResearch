<AbstractNarration>Explosive volcanic eruptions are serious hazards in many places on Earth, in particular in those areas associated with subduction zones such as those along the northwest coast of the US, the southern coast of Alaska, along the western coasts of South and Central America, and the western Pacific portion of the "Ring of Fire".  The processes involved and mechanisms by which these eruptions take place are not well understood; and this workshop, a Chapman Conference, which is affiliated with the American Geophysical Union professional society of geoscientists, focuses on bringing together international experts and early career researchers to disseminate information, discuss challenges, and brainstorm possible creative new ways of improving our understanding of both subaerial and submarine volcanism, with an emphasis on explosive volcanic systems. The funds from this award will be spent to support the travel and participation of US early career scientists and augment funds from a variety of US and international sources, including those from Australia and from three international professional societies.  The workshop, a four-day highly interactive Chapman Conference, will be held at the University of Tasmania in Hobart, Tasmania and is being organized by an international committee that includes US, New Zealand, and Australian scientists, all leaders in the field of submarine or terrestrial volcanism.  Broader impacts of the workshop include disseminating scientific information and expertise and planning projects to help better understand submarine and terrestrial volcanism, the results of which can be used by volcano observatories and volcano monitoring systems situated near population centers to provide information for hazard planning.  Additional impacts include international collaboration and the production of a report and a monograph or themed scientific journal issue to disseminate the information presented and related to the workshop more broadly to the scientific community and public. Support of early career US researchers in the field of submarine volcanism will also help build US capacity in this area of science.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The AGU Chapman Conference on Submarine Volcanism was held in Hobart, Tasmania, Australia, during Jan 29 - February 3rd, 2017. 106 delegates from 13 countries attended the meeting and 25% of these were early-career researchers.  This NSF award helped support the travel expenses for US-based students, post-doctoral scholars, and early-career researchers to attend the meeting.  The purpose of this meeting was to bring together scientists who study terrestrial ancient marine volcanic deposits, modern-day submarine volcanic systems, and who use numerical and experimental approaches to enable cross-fertilization of recent results and ideas. A major goal was to outline important future directions for the next decade of submarine volcano research and exploration with the full range of existing and emerging technology to make them possible, and generate a set of recommendations that will steer the next decade of research.  The overarching objective of our community is to fuel, motivate, and enhance future exploration and discovery to significantly advance our understanding of submarine volcanism. Quantum leaps in our understanding of submarine volcanic processes have followed the detection and response to significant modern volcanic events.  Thus, to achieve this objective, a priority enabler is the international coordination of monitoring and response to future submarine eruptions in order to facilitate exploration and discovery.
