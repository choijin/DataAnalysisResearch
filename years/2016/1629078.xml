<AbstractNarration>NON-TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION: The intimate combination of inorganic nanoparticles and organic polymers within nanoscopic packages of controlled sizes and shapes includes many challenges with the processes for their production and many opportunities for unique materials properties.  Organic polymers are typically considered as plastics and they have physical and mechanical properties that allow them to serve common roles, such as elastic materials (clothing, tents, parachutes, etc.), containment vessels (cups, plastic bags, etc.), and high technology needs, such as optical materials (eye glasses, OLED devices, etc.), engineering materials (airplane parts, football helmets, etc.), among  many others.  Inorganic nanoparticles are typically rigid and often possess characteristics of magnetism, optical signaling or catalytic reactivity.  This project will develop computational methods to guide approaches to rapidly discover and manufacture hybrid inorganic-organic nanostructured objects (HIONs) possessing complexity of compositions, structures, properties and functions.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION: The primary hypothesis driving our project is that the contrasting interactions of polymers vs nanoparticles vs HIONs with each other and with surfaces and flow fields in porous media and other designed interfaces can be harnessed to develop methods for scalable production.  The assembly of organic polymers or inorganic particles or their co-assembly is usually conducted in either the solution state or in the bulk.  Although simulations have guided polymer and particle assembly processes, this research activity adds the complexity of assembly/disassembly in a flow field and in an adaptive resolution solvent(s) model, and will elucidate how interfaces impact assembly/disassembly. Experimentally, HION assembly/disassembly at solution-solid substrate interfaces in a flow system or at solvent-solvent interfaces represent new frontiers.  Only recently has incorporation of discrete nanoscale heterogeneity on surfaces been demonstrated to allow quantitative mechanistic prediction of particle retention on unfavorable surfaces, as well as mechanistic prediction of release in response to perturbations in solution ionic strength and fluid velocity.  Ultimately, the primary goal is to be able to conduct high throughput, tunable manufacturing of complex HIONs that exhibit compositions, structures, morphologies and properties for diverse technological applications.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The ability to deliver novel engineered nano- and micro-particles to aquatic and subsurface locales for contaminant remediation is hampered by inability of existing transport theory to account for interactions with grain surfaces in environmental granular media through which groundwater and exchanged surface water flows.  Beyond delivery of contaminant remediation agents, the need for improved transport theory applies to pathogens of concern, as well as microplastics and particle-associated toxins.  This project has constrained the attributes and prevalence of nanoscale surface heterogeneity on environmental surfaces, both in laboratory and in field settings, that explains experimental findings.  We have developed a quantitative theoretical construct that explains the always-observed discrepancies between experimentally-observed colloid transport distances and theory-based predictions under environmental conditions.  The theory uses simulated grain-scale colloid-surface interactions to predict colloid transport at larger scales, and is available to the public, practitioners, and scientists as a suite of software (Parti-Suite, available at https://wpjohnsongroup.utah.edu/trajectoryCodes.html).  As a Parti-Suite user base develops, the source codes will also be made public for collaborative development on platforms like Hydroshare or Github. In the course of the project one Ph.D. student and one M.S. student were successfully supported to completion of their degrees.  Two summer learning abroad classes were conducted with support from this project for application of this research to contaminated rivers in Ecuador.  The resulting data is now published or in press in six top-tier scientific journals, with one additional manuscript in review, and the culminating model suite will support improved prediction for remediation and protection of water resources.
