<AbstractNarration>This award provides funding for US participation in the conference "Dynamics and Differential Equations", to be held at the University of Minnesota-Twin Cities from June 22 to June 25, 2016.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference focuses on recent developments in Analysis, especially in the fields of partial differential equations, infinite dimensional dynamical systems, and ordinary differential equations.  A number of distinguished mathematicians have agreed to attend and speak at this conference. The award gives early career researchers, researchers who are members of underrepresented groups, researchers not funded by NSF a chance to attend and participate in this conference.  The organizing committee will strive to make this funding opportunity known to target groups through a number of different activities.  More information will be made available at:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;http://www.ima.umn.edu/2015-2016/SW6.22-25.16/?event_id=SW6.22-25.16</AbstractNarration>
