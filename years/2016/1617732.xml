<AbstractNarration>Over the past decade, the deceleration of Moore's Law and Dennard Scaling has required computing to make a dramatic shift towards the use of on-chip parallelism in order to achieve computer systems performance scaling at acceptable power budgets. Beyond that, systems have also dramatically increased their use of heterogeneous processing elements and specialized accelerators. Much of the complexity of this heterogeneous, accelerator-oriented parallelism is exposed without sufficient abstraction to programmers and compiler writers. As a result, achieving high performance often requires that programs include detailed, platform-specific tailoring, particularly regarding the staging of data as it moves between memory and compute elements, and from one compute element to another. This platform-specific tailoring limits the portability of such programs; when a new chip implementation is released, extensive software reworks are often required to reclaim that high performance. Overall, the result is that heterogeneous parallelism is reducing the performance portability of application software. The DeSCPar research attacks this problem and represents important research in improving programmability. Developed tools will be distributed as free software, including a DeSCPar simulator and design tools. In addition, the project includes a broad set of activities around improving the diversity of the computing workforce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The DeSCPar approach uses Decoupled Supply-Compute Parallelism to achieve portable performance on highly parallel highly-heterogeneous systems. Inspired by Decoupled Access-Execute approaches, DeSCPar likewise decouples value computations from the memory accesses and address computations that "feed" them. By using automated slicing techniques to split code into a data supply portion and a computation portion, high-performance memory optimizations can be achieved while retaining high-level application portability. In DeSCPar, value computation operations are targeted to run on a CompD which may be a hardware accelerator, a specifically-optimized CPU, or a general-purpose CPU. Likewise, memory supply code is aimed at a SuppD, which can be specifically optimized for its task. By employing varied combinations of SuppD and CompD units, richly heterogeneous systems can be built, and software can be automatically mapped onto them. This project: (i) proposes and prototypes automated compiler techniques (based on LLVM) for slicing and optimizing DeSCPar code; and (ii) proposes and evaluates hardware design optimizations based on the DeSCPar organizational structure.</AbstractNarration>
