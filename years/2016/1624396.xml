<AbstractNarration>A request is made by the University of Washington to fund additional and replacement instrumentation for the R/V Thompson, a 274? general purpose, global class research vessel, and R/V Barnes, a 66-foot coastal research vessel, both operated as part of the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System research fleet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These platforms provide facilities for conducting oceanographic research funded by the National Science Foundation and other federal agencies. The instrumentation they propose to acquire will provide operational flexibility to projects that are embarked upon both vessels and will increase their capacity to do useful science and data collection during transits between funded cruises. Thompson completed 275 days in 2015; 133 of these days (48%) were for NSF. On Barnes, 9 of the 50 days (18%) were for NSF. In 2016, Thompson is scheduled for 130 days and 49 (38%) are for NSF. The schedule is light for Thompson because she goes into the yard for a mid-life refit in June. Barnes is scheduled to sail 86 days in 2016, with 9 days (9%) funded by NSF. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Oceanographic Instrumentation requested in this proposal includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1) Turner  Fluorometer $9,278 &lt;br/&gt;2) Upgrade of computer racks $29,953 &lt;br/&gt;3) Fume Hoods $62,582 &lt;br/&gt;4) Computer network upgrade $67,993 &lt;br/&gt;5) Virtual machine server upgrades $37,954 &lt;br/&gt;6) C-Nav 3050 Receiver $10,914 &lt;br/&gt;7) -80 C Chest Freezer $7,776 &lt;br/&gt;8) WiFi distribution system upgrades $8,854 &lt;br/&gt;       $235,304 &lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts &lt;br/&gt;The principal impact of the present proposal is under Merit Review Criterion 2 of the Proposal Guidelines (NSF 13-589). It provides infrastructure support for scientists to use the vessel and its shared-use instrumentation in support of their NSF-funded oceanographic research projects (which individually undergo separate review by the relevant research program of NSF).  The acquisition,  maintenance and operation of shared-use instrumentation allows NSF-funded researchers from any US university or lab access to working, calibrated instruments for their research, reducing the cost of that research, and expanding the base of potential researchers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project served to replace and upgrade vital science systems and equipment installed and utilized onboard R.V. Thomas G. Thompson while it underwent its 18-month major mid-life refit overhaul.   Specifically, this project focused on upgrading critical computer infrastructure that directly supports scientific operations conducted by R/V Thompson.  These CI upgrades included  computer upgrades, computer rack replacement, network infrastructure upgrades including new switches and routers,  Wifi system upgrades and virtual machine upgrades.   Finally,  new server racks were procured and installed for use in a re-designed physical layout aboard the vessel in the computer lab and to upgrade outdated network equipment to allow for optimized traffic flow between the equipment in those racks and distribution throughout the vessel.   The Computer System Infrastructure upgrades have significantly increased the ability of the system to support today's scientific needs.  System issues are easier to troubleshoot with the new architecture that includes a network of switchs and routers that de-centralize the system rather than having all elements connected directly to the central hub as was previously the case.  New system fiberoptic cabling was installed in conjunction with this work.  The new distributed system also facilitates the connection of additional scientific systems / computers to the network without having to add new major cable runs onboard the ship.   They can now be short and much more direct without having to penetrate watertight and fumetight bulkheads and decks.   New computer racks provide much improved cooling to installed systems while also facilitating maintenance, repair and upgrade.  WiFi capability is signficantly improved making it much easier for scientific personnel to connect to the system wirelessly throughout the ship with a wider ranges of devices. New servers provide much needed increased capacity, capability and redundancy.     In addition, two of the existing fume hoods on the Thompson were replaced in the Main and Bio-Analytical laboratories onboard the ship. The new fume hoods for the laboratories provide much improved full functional capability for scientists working with chemicals in controlled environements.  The previous, originally installed fume hoods were worn out and couldn't perform at rated capacities after 25 years of service at sea.     Due to more cost than anticipated for the computer infrastructure upgrades as well as the procurement , preparation and installation of the new fume hoods - there were not sufficient funds to also procure the -80 deg F freezer as had been planned.  UW still has 2 operational -80 deg F freezers at this time.              Last Modified: 10/29/2018       Submitted by: Doug G Russell]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
