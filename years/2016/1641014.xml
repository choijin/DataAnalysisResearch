<AbstractNarration>This workshop will provide a forum for constructive dialogue between publishing professionals and members of various stakeholder communities with a shared interest in public dissemination of scholarly research in engineering and the information sciences, as represented by a variety of IEEE societies including, Signal Processing, Control Systems, Robotics and Automation, Information Theory, and Circuits and Systems. Participants will explore three interrelated and increasingly important questions concerning future approaches to deriving the maximum possible benefit from the products of engineering research:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. What are the essential products of scholarly engineering research, how will these be likely to change in the future?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2. What are economically sustainable approaches to providing public access to engineering research products?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3. As nontraditional types of research products (e.g. data and software) become a significant component of the curated engineering research record, how should quality assurance be organized and paid for?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of ensuring that future engineering research will be maximally reproducible underlies all these questions. Workshop presentations by publishing professionals will explore current and planned approaches to data and software curation in engineering and other disciplines. There will also be presentations by data professionals who currently provide platforms for such curation as well as those engaged in research on fundamental data science, data infrastructure, and cyber-infrastructure. Using new curation and publishing technologies to most effectively harvest value from curated research products will be explored in alignment with stated National Science Foundation objectives of developing new advances in data infrastructure and analytics, reproducibility, privacy and protection, and research in the human-data interface. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The topics to be covered by the workshop include,&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Data curation -ethical data management&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Software curation&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Versioning of archival literature&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Research reproducibility -including reproducibility metrics&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Peer review -data, software, versions - how to manage&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- The evolving relationship between scholarly publishers, researchers, and research libraries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The participants will include researchers, representatives of selected publishers, data curation professionals, engineering researchers, and public access representatives from the U.S. National Science Foundation and other U.S. Government research agencies. The preliminary date and venue of the workshop are November 5,6, 2016 in the Washington DC area.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Workshop convened stakeholders including researchers, funders, and notably, publishers  in the area of  science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). The overarching goal was a deep dive into new kinds of research products and how the costs of creation and curation of these products can be sustainably borne by funding agencies, publishers, libraries, and researcher communities.  A secondary goal has been to understand how new forms of curation can add value by leading to enhanced research reproducibility.  The Workshop record appears on a website, whose persistent link is http://ieee.org/researchreproducibility.  The complete report of workshop outcomes and open questions on the future of research curation is available for download from the site.  There is also a recent article by three of the organizers that discusses the prospects and challenges that were in focus at the Workshop (see "Reflections on the Future of Research Curation and Research Reproducibility [Point of View]," Proceedings of the IEEE, 105:5, DOI: 10.1109/JPROC.2018.2816618).    The Workshop began with an environmental scan that looked at new forms of curated research content--with a focus on software and data.  The discussion examined new tools for collaborative content creation and the challenges that are associated with finding, indexing, and licensing this content.  The costs of peer review and quality assurance for software and data were examined both in terms of the greatly increased work burdens that may face the already stressed research community and whether there might be some form of reviewer incentives that could be brought to bear.  The third major topic of the Workshop was the economics of curation and the cost of ensuring research reproducibility.  Much of the discussion focused on "open science" and how it can be supported.  It was noted that the major research universities of the world have invested in large repositories that house research artifacts produced by faculty and students. .  The potential of these repositories will only be realized when they are somehow linked and indexed.  How they will play with traditional scholarly publishing remains very much a work in progress.    A number of points of consensus about the future of research curation emerged.  Broadly, participants agreed that the publishing model should evolve from its current focus on the printed page and electronic images and toward a distributed digital model emphasizing a much broader variety of research objects, linked and indexed by greatly improved metadata. Further, new forms of recognition and reward for researchers going the extra mile to provide nontraditional objects such as software and data must be developed and implemented.   It was agreed that it is fundamental to acquire a clear understating of the major challenges related to this transition by implementing it first in small, enthusiastic communities.  This  First Workshop has inspired  modest scale experiments in which software and data related to published research articles can be archived and linked to the article.  (See, for example, https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8063416 where if you click the button "Code &amp; Datasets" in the left-hand menu, you arrive at https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8063416/algorithms#algorithms.)  Several developers at the Workshop discussed virtualization technologies like Vagrant and Docker that can provision software infrastructure that emulates the environment in which a piece of code was originally developed.  Such technologies will be crucial for the forms of enhanced curation that were the focus of the Workshop.    Part of the ongoing experiment is designing processes for artifact review, and this is being undertaken in a collaboration between the IEEE and the start-up company CodeOcean (https://codeocean.com/).  The experiment is for the moment focused on the IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems as our test case.  It is planned to assign IEEE ?reproducibility badges? whose design is inspired by the badges already deployed by the ACM.  The badges will rate the extent to which the work is (or could be) reproducible  and in some cases indicate that the work has been reproduced in some form. A recurring Workshop theme was the need to reform the way in which research productivity is measured in the tenure and promotion process.  One of the challenges in moving toward open science is the value that universities place on faculty publishing in what are regarded as high impact journals.  Badges are seen as an important component of the way research will be valued and assessed in the future. The cost of having a badging system is not modest, but if such badges are properly valued, the costs of the necessary artifact review (at least for universities) might be borne by the institutions in the same way that their current A.B.E.T. accreditation is paid for.  The workshop served to unite the various stakeholders in a commitment to challenge long-held publishing traditions and to deliver tangible outcomes going forward to make reproducibility-by-design the new paradigm.
