<AbstractNarration>1604279-Abaid&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The frequency of brainwaves is known to impact a wide range of cognitive abilities, such as concentration, mood, attention, and memory, but understanding how to noninvasively control these frequencies is currently not well understood. Rather than using invasive control methods such as electrical stimulation, this project aims to drive oscillations in the brain using existing sensory pathways in the auditory system. The technique used here, known as binaural beats, relies on listening to different tones in each ear and is a safe method of brain stimulation. This type of stimulation, in a feedback loop, will be explored in terms of its impact on working memory in people with and without mild cognitive impairment (MCI), a common precursor to Alzheimer's disease. The results of this project are expected to improve the quality of life for people with MCI by offering noninvasive diagnostic and therapeutic interventions based on binaural beats in future incarnations. This work will be shared with people who have MCI and their caregivers through a series of information sessions in multiple locations in southwest Virginia, thus educating the community such illnesses impact.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Working memory is the system in control of temporary retention and online organization of thoughts for successful goal-directed behavior. Remarkably, individuals exhibit a maximum load on the number of items that can be simultaneously retained. Since working memory relies upon neural communication, it is benefitted by increased phase synchronization within the cortex. People with MCI have decreased overall phase synchronization which can be correlated with a loss in working memory capacity. Therefore, a non-invasive stimulation technique to induce synchronization, called binaural beats, may constitute a diagnostic and therapeutic technology for MCI. Binaural beats utilize a phenomenon that occurs within the cortex when two di&amp;#64256;erent tones are presented separately to each ear. A third phantom binaural beat, whose frequency is equal to the di&amp;#64256;erence of the two presented tones, is produced within the auditory pathway and projected to the auditory cortex. The project seeks to answer the question of whether binaural beats can be used to identify and control working memory. These interactions will be explored using computational models and experimental tests. Hardware will be developed for implementing real-time control of brain signals using binaural beats. The brain signals will be recorded using electroencephalography (EEG), which noninvasively measures the voltage across the scalp using a series of electrodes.  The goal of this work is to identify EEG outputs which can reliably predict a subject?s ability to perform working memory tasks and to control the subject?s performance using closed loop control of the binaural beat stimulus, both in people who are neurologically healthy or who have MCI.</AbstractNarration>
