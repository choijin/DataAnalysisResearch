<AbstractNarration>This research project studies questions in algebraic number theory. The connection between number theory and automorphic forms, which are generalizations of periodic functions, is a very active area of investigation and has led to solutions of longstanding problems in number theory. Such work has applications to solving Diophantine equations -- algebraic equations with integer coefficients for which integer solutions are sought -- which play a role in a wide range of applications from encryption protocols to error correction.  Additionally, methods developed in the area of algebraic number theory can have other surprising applications to cryptography. This project aims to deepen knowledge in this important subject.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The questions that the project studies are related to classical problems in number theory, including the Leopoldt conjecture and higher dimensional analogs. The methods to be used relate to automorphy lifting theorems, which have played a crucial role in important developments such as the proof of Fermat's Last Theorem and the proof of Serre's conjecture. The project aims to augment these methods and to make them more flexible, which will lead to more applications in the field of solutions of polynomial equations and its relation to automorphic forms.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The PI in this project enhanced the techniques of automorphy lifting for Galois representations. This has been a central technique  for  progress in many key areas of algebraic number theory since Wiles, partly in collaboration with Taylor,  invented the method in his solution of Fermat's Last Theorem.     Joint work of Allen, Thorne and the PI address automorphy of elliptic curves over the Gaussian numbers, such a result following the well-known strategy of Frey-Hellegourach, has potentially  Diophantine applications. Joint work of Harris and Thorne and the PI has developed automorphy lifting techniques in the context of Lafforgue's work over function fields.     The work in the project adds to the collection of methods available to attack the Langlands program, a central paradigm in algebraic number theory, vis arguments using deformation theory and other aithmetic methods. The PI's earleir work on Serre's conjecture with J-P. Wintenberger used related methods to resolve a central conjecture in algebraic number theory. It has proved to be a difficult but important problem to extend the proof of Serre's conjecture to analogous conjectures in related situations. The techniques the PI has explored in the project build up to new results towards this, and also provide a setting for Leopoldt's conjecture and its broad generalisations.     Thus the work of this project provides new ideas and techniques in a very acive central area of number theory, the relation between extensions of the rationals, motives and automorphic forms.
