<AbstractNarration>This is funding to support participation by approximately 22 promising U.S. doctoral students along with distinguished faculty mentors in a doctoral colloquium (workshop) on information science research, which will be held in conjunction with the 2016 iConference to be hosted by Drexel University in Philadelphia, PA, on March 20-23.  Since 2005, the iConferences have provided a forum where information scholars, researchers and professionals from around the world gather to share insights on critical information issues in contemporary society. An openness to new ideas and research fields in information science is a primary characteristics of these events. Attendance has grown every year, a testament to participants' appreciation for the inspiring sense of community, high quality research presentations, and myriad opportunities for engagement. The iConferences are presented by the iSchools, a worldwide association of Information Schools dedicated to advancing the information field, and preparing students to meet the information challenges of the 21st Century. Open to broad participation, the iConferences have been successful in building a sense of community around the information field, bringing together people who otherwise might rarely interact with one another, and thereby helping to promote interdisciplinary research. This year's theme of "Partnership with Society" will examine the dynamic, evolving role of information science and the iSchool movement, and the benefits to society. More information may be found online at http://ischools.org/the-iconference/. The iConference doctoral colloquia traditionally bring together the best of the next generation of interdisciplinary researchers focused on the interplay of information and technology in a social context, allowing them to develop a network both among themselves and with senior researchers. Participation is encouraged from a broad range of relevant disciplines, thereby expanding attendees' perspectives on their topics of study and promoting advancement of the field. The organizers will proactively work to maximize diversity along such key dimensions as institution type, research topics, methodological approaches, disciplinary traditions, gender, ethnicity, and national or cultural backgrounds, so that the students' horizons are broadened at a critical stage in their professional development.  The event organizers are committed to drawing a diverse group of students. They expect a majority of the accepted students will be women, but at a minimum will ensure that at least 10 of the 22 students are women, and that furthermore no more than 4 students will be accepted from any single university.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Doctoral Colloquium will be tightly integrated into the conference experience, starting with an orientation event, highlighting specific content during the technical program, and culminating in a full day focused on peer-research critique and career development.  The primary objective of the Doctoral Colloquium is to help train the next generation of information science researchers. To this end, it will provide the student participants with an environment in which they can share and discuss their goals, methods and results at an early stage of their research. By participating in the doctoral colloquium, students will gain feedback on their work both from the mentors and from other students, which should allow them to enhance their research. Students will also develop a better understanding of the different research communities engaged in the study of information science, and learn how to position their work within the community. In addition, the colloquium will provide students with opportunities such as poster sessions) to make new professional connections beyond their own disciplines and institutions, and will also help them successfully launch their careers whether in industry or academia.</AbstractNarration>
