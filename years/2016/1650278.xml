<AbstractNarration>1650278&lt;br/&gt;Shipley&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nanotechnology holds the potential to enable and advance water treatment. The overall goal of this project is to synthesize nano titania and nano titania/molybdenum disulfide nanosheet embedded zeolites using environmentally friendly and faster synthesis methods to remove selected water pollutants for future development of water treatment technologies for small individual and/or central, publicly owned treatment systems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The development of nanocomposites creates the potential for new pollutant treatment technologies due to their unique physiochemical properties. Their large surface area along with their distinct chemical advantages, such as ion selectivity and increased kinetics, make nanoparticles ideal sorbents, since even weak sorption onto the surface can occur. In addition, MoS2 is known for its photocatalytic activity, but few studies have investigated the advantage of this material in combination with TiO2. There can be drawbacks to using nanoparticles, however, due to problematic results such as separation during treatment processes and passage through to finished water. The proposed work will address these issues by engineering zeolites embedded with nano titania and nano titania/molybdenum disulfide nanosheets with specific properties, it is hypothesized that this will lead to enhanced pollutant removal due to the combined attributes of TiO2 and MoS2 nanosystems as well as a reduction in cost and potential toxicity, and improved separation during treatment. The results will determine the adsorption capacities, and photocatalytic activity of select pollutants. Compared to traditional water treatment sorbents, it is expected that this research will yield a new efficient and cost effective sorbent. SEM/FIB will be used to characterize the interface between the zeolite and nanomaterials to understand the stability of the nanoparticles and nanosheets embedded in the zeolites, to determine the changes in the surface morphology after adsorption, and to help assess the loading efficiencies. In the proposed effort, the objectives are to: 1) synthesize and characterize nano-TiO2 and nano-TiO2/ MoS2 embedded zeolites; 2) assess their adsorption capacities and photocatalytic activity through batch studies. These materials have the potential to improve water quality through enhanced adsorption, selectivity, and kinetics; help with compliance of state and federal drinking water regulations; and reduce treatment costs. The safety and availability of water are a National Academy of Engineering Grand Challenge inextricably linked to global health, energy production, and economic development. These materials have the potential to improve water quality through enhanced adsorption, selectivity, photocatalytic activity and kinetics; help with compliance of state and federal drinking water regulations; and reduce treatment costs. Hence, the embedded zeolites proposed in this study have applications outside of municipal water treatment and could be used as treatment systems in developing countries, remote regions of the U.S., and industry. UTSA is a minority serving institution with a population of about 29,000 students of which roughly half are from a Hispanic background. The proposed work promotes research projects that use innovative materials to address water contamination issues while training the next generation of scientists and engineers. It also creates new research opportunities while encouraging the involvement of graduate students. New technologies are needed to continue to advance potable water treatment; testing nano embedded zeolites will allow for advancement towards applications with media suitable for column operation and for exploring the surface interactions and differences between nanomaterials and the nano composites. If these composite can be regenerated and reused then there are many possible environmental applications beyond potable water treatment such as treatment of oilfield or reverse osmosis brine.</AbstractNarration>
