<AbstractNarration>The current paradigm of exclusive spectrum allocation is creating artificial scarcity of spectrum resources that has a dramatic impact on network performance and user experience. Underutilized bands provide an opportunity for more efficient, shared spectrum access that has recently brought together policymakers, industry leaders and academic researchers to set an agenda for next-generation spectrum management. A critical enabler of such advances is deep understanding of spectrum use. This award will support research seeking to impact the scientific community, the policy domain and the public, by providing methods and informing system designs for efficient spectrum measurement and characterization, and informing the design of future mobile wireless networks and spectrum policy. Products from this research will be included in the PI's undergraduate and graduate courses, demonstrating the positive policy and societal impact of computer science and promoting the discipline to diverse groups of students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is to employ fundamental knowledge in signal processing and propagation, machine learning, and large-scale measurement to devise fast and robust algorithms and inform spectrum measurement infrastructure design. Of main research interest, will be the tight-knit mutual dependence between algorithms and infrastructures. The project will achieve this goal in two research tasks: (i) design and development of spectrum measurement algorithms for adaptive spectrum sensing, spectrum data management and spectrum characterization; and (ii) evaluation of spectrum measurement infrastructures that will illuminate the impact of spectrum sensor properties on spectrum characterization quality and will inform the design of mixed sensor cost/mobility measurement infrastructures. This research will bridge the gap between algorithm design and infrastructures. It will introduce the first holistic framework for spectrum measurement and characterization to facilitate next generation spectrum management. The design of adaptive, data-driven algorithms will facilitate rapid and efficient spectrum measurement and characterization. Exploration of the cost and mobility trade-offs in spectrum sensing infrastructure will inform efficient end-to-end infrastructure design that minimizes cost while maximizing the learning outcomes of spectrum sensing.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Wireless communications have become deeply-ingrained in our day-to-day lives, as they enable seamless information access, new modes of entertainment and socialization, and enhance our environment through the Internet of Things. All these services critically rely on radio frequency resources to establish the physical connections between wireless devices. Despite the tremendous application demand on wireless networks, the two most popular technologies, Wi-Fi and Cellular networks, jointly share only about 8% of the entire frequency range from 30MHz to 6GHz. While mobile bands are rapidly becoming oversaturated, there exists an abundance of spectrum in other under utilized frequencies, which can be employed in a shared fashion. This opportunity has brought together policymakers, industry and academia to set an agenda for next-generation spectrum management. A critical enabler of such advances is deep understanding of spectrum use, with fine granularity in time, frequency and space. <br /><br />Our goal in this project was to develop a suite of spectrum measurement algorithms for lightweight and unsupervised collection, management and characterization of radio frequency data to facilitate automated spectrum analytics. In addition, we also strove to understand the effects of sensor platforms on the performance of spectrum analytics, which is pivotal towards reducing the cost of sensing infrastructures while not compromising the quality of the insights they can gain. <br /><br />We made multiple contributions towards this goal. <br /><br />Given a spectrum scan, the first question that needs to be answered is are there any active transmitters and what is their behavior in time and frequency. We developed AirVIEW and TxMiner, which enable rapid and unsupervised transmitter detection in wideband spectrum scans. TxMiner identifies multiple transmitters in raw spectrum measurements, even when the transmitter characteristics are not known and the spectrum sensing resolution is low. Its applicability to real-world analytics was demonstrated on Microsoft's Spectrum Observatory. AirVIEW tackles transmitter detection in high-noise regimes and was also successfully applied on real-world traces from an urban area with densely-occupied spectrum.<br /><br />Spectrum scans are large and noisy, and thus, they create high overhead in collection, storage, exchange and analysis. To reduce these costs, we developed AirPRESS, which allows for 94% decrease of overhead, while retaining truthful spectrum analytics. <br /><br />While data collection and transmitter detection are the first steps towards spectrum cognizance, a fully-fleshed spectrum measurement platform needs to be able to answer further questions related to modulation, direction and mobility, to fingerprint detected transmitters. Our work has made significant progress in enabling practical modulation recognition from real-world and imperfect scans. We developed LinksIQ, which exploits local sequential patterns in raw spectrum data to classify a transmitter's modulation. Our method works even when a transmitter is scanned only partially and for a short duration of time. It also works if the transmitter is malicious. We demonstrate LinksIQ's applicability with $20 RTL-SDR sensors, which brings promise for a substantial reduction in sensor cost, as commonly-used sensor platforms today cost two or three orders of magnitude higher. We also tackle practical modulation recognition for emerging complex wireless communications, such as Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO), which are now ubiquitous in our Wi-Fi networks. We develop SYMMeTRy, which allows robust modulation detection with a single-antenna sensor, bringing down sensing cost while enhancing the practical applicability of MIMO modulation recognition. <br /><br />At the onset of the project, it was anecdotally clear that the capabilities of sensor platforms substantially impact the quality of the collected scans and, in turn, the insights we can glean from these scans. However, the relationship between sensor capabilities and analytics performance was not formally understood. Such understanding is important, as it underpins our ability to quantify the performance cost we need to pay in order to reduce the monetary cost for sensor deployment. Our work laid the foundation for the establishment of such relationships by building heterogeneous sensor platforms and analysing our algorithms performance across these platforms. This has helped us begin to develop necessary abstractions of data quality and inform a future research agenda on modeling the relationship between data quality and learning performance. <br /><br />The broader impacts from this project stem from the applicability of the research outcomes. Practical progress towards spectrum-sharing capabilities in 5G networks and beyond hinges on detailed radio spectrum insights, such as those enabled by our methods. The project also provided ample opportunities for student training at the intersection of digital signal processing, wireless networks and machine learning. It has resulted in award-winning research by students at all levels from undergraduate through MS and PhD. The project has designed interdisciplinary curriculum components that have been incorporated in the PI's existing undergraduate and graduate classes. Practical measurements of production dynamic spectrum networks has allowed students to experience first-hand the positive impact of computer science on society. Broader outreach through a radio podcast and public presentations have promoted the importance of deep spectrum cognizance to the practical progress of wireless network technologies.</p><br> <p>
