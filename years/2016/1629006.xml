<AbstractNarration>Non-technical Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;Flexible electronic devices have the potential to transform our society, such as in distributed power, solid-state lighting, personal electronics, and biomedical devices.  The objective of this program is to accelerate the development of conjugated polymers for flexible electronics.  The project will generate tools to predict fundamental properties of conjugated polymers, such as the stiffness of the chain backbones, their ability to form liquid crystals, and the likelihood that chains will entangle, all from the chemical structure.  As such, the combination of theory, simulation, and experiment will provide opportunities to refine design concepts in conjugated polymers and therefore create an accelerated materials design framework useful for both academic and industrial efforts.  Beyond flexible electronics, developing a theoretical description for semiflexible polymers will be transformative across many applications of biopolymers, engineering thermoplastics, and liquid crystals.  Furthermore, this program will create a pilot program aimed at improving the retention of students in STEM fields.  Penn State's unique structure will be leveraged, where a large central campus is closely linked to smaller commonwealth campuses, to explore the use of remote research activities as a recruiting and retention tool.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Abstract: &lt;br/&gt;This program encompasses the development of three computational tools.  Recent work by the PIs suggests a computationally inexpensive approach to predict the persistence length of conjugated polymers.  The work of this program will validate this approach, with experimental measurements on synthesized polymers using neutron scattering in the melt or light scattering in dilute solution.  Furthermore, the combination of simulations and experiments will generate values of the persistence length for various conjugated polymers that are of interest to the community.  The PIs will also leverage their development of a new approach combining MD simulations and SCFT to predict the nematic coupling parameter and the nematic-to-isotropic transition temperature.  Predictions of the phase behavior of various conjugated polymers that vary in stiffness will be compared with results from rheology, light microscopy and depolarized light scattering.  Finally, the work will test scaling relationships for the entanglement length versus packing length, to predict the entanglement length of any conjugated polymer from the molecular structure, and test these predictions with rheological measurements.  The combination of theory, simulation and experiment provides an opportunity to refine design concepts for conjugated polymers.  Preliminary studies suggest that stiff chains align near interfaces, potentially enhancing charge transport in devices such as thin-film transistors that rely on transport near dielectric interfaces.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This program developed computation tools and experimental measurements that are capable of accelerating the development of conjugated polymers for flexible electronics.  The suite of tools developed included methods for predicting the shape of long-chain molecules, their ability to form liquid crystals, the impact of liquid crystallinity of charge transport through these materials, the likelihood that chains will entangle, and the glass transition (embrittlement) temperature, all from the chemical structure.   The method to predict chain shape was validated using neutron scattering experiments at the National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST), in collaboration with Scientists in the Functional Polymers Group of NIST.  The computational approach developed for this purpose is computationally inexpensive yet accurate, at least for conjugated polymers examined so far.  Experimental and computational tools were also developed to predict the onset of liquid crystallinity in polymers.  Although the work focused on conjugated polymers, the findings and approaches developed are also applicable to any polymer.  Indeed, some of the latest work focused on developing a unified and comprehensive scaling theory of polymer entanglement that incorporated the effect of liquid crystallinity.  This effort was motivated by new experimental measurements done through this project that examined the effect of liquid crystallinity on entanglement for the first time.  Much of the work focused on connecting chain conformations, microstructure, and electrical properties. To this end, the team developed an analytical approach to describe how liquid crystallinity impacts charge transport.  Predictions match published experimental results on how charge transport depends on the molecular weight of polymer conductors.  An unexpected result was the development of a tool to predict the glass transition temperature from the chemical structure.  The team had focused on using rheology to measure the glass transition for the first time, and as a consequence, had unequivocal values for a variety of polymers.  This advancement in the experimental characterization of polymers led to the extraction of trends between the glass transition temperature and the chemical structure, leading to a general predictive correlation that has an error of about 12 degrees Celsius.  This is a simple example of how data-driven science can accelerate the development of new materials, as well as how the development of characterization tools and approaches can lead to new theoretical and predictive insights.  Thus, key to the outcomes of the project was the combination of theory, simulation, and experiment to provide opportunities for refining design concepts in conjugated polymers and to create an accelerated materials design framework.  Beyond flexible electronics, the outcomes of this project will be transformative across many applications of biopolymers, engineering thermoplastics, and liquid crystals by providing tools for semiflexible polymers.  Furthermore, this program created a pilot program aimed at improving the retention of students in STEM fields.  The project leveraged Penn State’s unique structure, of a large central campus closely linked to smaller commonwealth campuses, to explore the use of remote research activities as a recruiting and retention tool.
