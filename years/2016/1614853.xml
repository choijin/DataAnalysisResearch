<AbstractNarration>The Hubble Deep/Ultra Deep fields are iconic, and almost certainly the&lt;br/&gt;most studied space telescope observations. Upcoming observations from an enormous range of&lt;br/&gt;current and planned instruments, from the successor to Hubble, The James Webb Telescope, to&lt;br/&gt;the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST), to the WFIRST Satellite will also have the&lt;br/&gt;opportunity to reach galaxies and black holes at the same extreme magnitudes or deeper, but&lt;br/&gt;over unprecedentedly wide fields. This will open up the study of the highest redshift galaxies&lt;br/&gt;and quasars to the type of statistical studies that have made modern cosmology a precision&lt;br/&gt;science. This project aims to compute theoretical predictions to make contact with current&lt;br/&gt;and upcoming observations of the high-redshift universe using the Blue Waters supercomputer. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will extend the BlueTides simulation, with an unprecedented&lt;br/&gt;volume and resolution, to cover the evolution of the first billion years of cosmic history.&lt;br/&gt;The goal is to significantly increase the scientific impact of this calculation to the community.&lt;br/&gt;Importantly, the project will attempt to make contact&lt;br/&gt;with observations of quasars, which have not been discovered at redshift greater than 7 (while&lt;br/&gt;the simulation now has run to redshift equal 8). In addition the project will be using BlueTides as&lt;br/&gt;a path-finder for developing methods/calculations for future cosmological hydrodynamical simulations&lt;br/&gt;of galaxy formation with volumes and resolutions suitable for creating mocks for next generation&lt;br/&gt;surveys. The impact of the proposed work will extend way beyond BlueTides. Large hydrodynamical simulations&lt;br/&gt;will be more and more useful in all stages of major observational projects in astrophysics&lt;br/&gt;and cosmology. For example, a simulation that covers a significant fraction of the entire&lt;br/&gt;observable universe with BlueTides resolution and runs to the present day (an epoch which&lt;br/&gt;is fully dominated by the hydrodynamic computations) will be needed for LSST.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will establish a theoretical framework for understanding the role of galaxies&lt;br/&gt;in the evolution of the universe at high redshifts. Different communities&lt;br/&gt;of scientists are interested in the behavior history of quasars and galaxy assembly, including&lt;br/&gt;cosmologists, the galaxy evolution community and high energy astrophysicists, so the results&lt;br/&gt;would have a wide impact across many different scientific communities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additionally, the image and catalog generation, and&lt;br/&gt;database techniques developed by the project will&lt;br/&gt;strengthen the project already on-going synergistic activities with computer science, machine learning&lt;br/&gt;and statistics.  Furthermore, the project will have a strong education component by involving undergraduate&lt;br/&gt;and graduate students in this research.  Finally, the project propose to perform outreach using&lt;br/&gt;the visualization and interactive Gigapan software.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Cosmological simulations are our primary tool for understandingour Universe, from the creation and evolution of the cosmic webb to the formation of galaxies and their central black holes. Dynamic range makes this physically complex problem tractable only on the largest high-performance computational (HPC) national facilities.  In this project the team has led the development of cosmological codes optimized to Petascale NSF leadership High Performance Facilities such as Bluewaters and used these resources to understand how supermassive BHs and galaxies formed, from the smallest to the rarest and most luminous.  With close to one trillion particles we have carried out the BlueTides simulation on BlueWaters.    Detecting and understanding the first galaxies and black holes (BHs) one of the major current observational and theoretical challenges in galaxy formation.The first billion years of the cosmic history of our Universe is a pivotal time for cosmic structure formation.  The first galaxies and BHs set the stage:  the radiation from the first galaxies and black holes shapes the thermal evolution of the intergalactic medium,  ionizing the neutral plasma making the Universe transparent to UV radiation. The radiative and kinetic feedback exerted by starsand supernovae, as well as by Active Galactic Nuclei powered by the first BHs shapes the interstellar medium, influencing how the following generations of stars and BHs evolve in turn.  A complete simulation of the universe at these epochs, the first billion year of cosmic history) requires a small enough particle mass to model the tiny first galaxies that form  while also an enormous volume, to capture the rarest and brightest objects, the first quasars.
