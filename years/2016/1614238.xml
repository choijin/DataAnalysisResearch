<AbstractNarration>Currently the planet is facing an energy crisis that threatens the integrity of our atmosphere. This creates increasing pressure on the primary energy sector (fossil fuel combustion) to meet energy demand while significantly reducing harmful emissions. Recently, a novel idea that incorporates ceramic membranes into combustion processes, has emerged as an ideal solution that would transform the entire energy sector. This process uses advantageous material properties, including the ability to filtrate oxygen from the air at high temperatures, at existing operating conditions. The oxygen transport membrane provides a pure oxygen source to combust with fuel while acting as a reactor to capture harmful pollutant products. This idea transcends any current utilized practice that aims to contain carbon emissions at the expense of power output. This award supports research to develop simulations of oxygen transport membrane performance under harsh boundary conditions, when membrane structural integrity is potentially jeopardized. This research will be conducted in collaboration with Professor Takashi Tokumasu of Tohoku University in Sendai, Japan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In order to investigate oxygen transport membrane utilization for the combustion of natural gas and carbon capture, a simulation model, co-developed under the guidance of Professor Tokumasu, is used to investigate membrane performance under varying surrounding conditions (CO2 concentrations) and membrane composition. More recently, mixed ionic-electronic conducting (MIEC) combined with CO2 resistant and highly ionic conductive materials, known as dual-phase membranes, have become promising candidates for practical combustion reactors. Through the introduction of a stable material, oxygen transport membranes chances of degradation under harsh conditions are reduced, providing more chemical stability. Additionally, introducing highly ionic conductive materials doesn?t necessarily limit the performance of oxygen permeability, but must be investigated to identify key trends for incorporating membrane reactors in fossil fuel combustion processes. Membrane technology has the potential to reduce global emissions while meeting increasing energy demand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award under the East Asia and Pacific Summer Institutes program supports summer research by a U.S. graduate student and is jointly funded by NSF and the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS).</AbstractNarration>
