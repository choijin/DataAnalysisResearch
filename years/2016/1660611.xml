<AbstractNarration>Methane, by far the largest component of natural gas, is one of the most abundant fossil fuel resources, but it remains underutilized due to costs and dangers associated with transporting liquefied natural gas.  This problem could be resolved by converting methane into methanol, an environmentally friendly liquid fuel that has been identified as the most promising application for natural gas in the transportation sector.  The industrial-scale methane/methanol conversion in use today is energy intensive, however, requiring multiple steps at high temperatures and pressures to overcome the inherently low reactivity of methane.  For methanol fuel derived from natural gas to be cost-effective, a more efficient method is required.  With funding from the Chemical Catalysis Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Solomon of Stanford University is studying a class of materials called zeolites that perform this challenging chemistry.  Professor Solomon's research is revealing how these materials operate on the molecular level.  This insight is important for understanding how to design improved catalysts for methane/methanol conversion, as well as other economically significant reactions.  Professor Solomon's research is also coupled to outreach activities that serve K-12 students in the areas surrounding Stanford University.  This includes developing a shadowing program that brings high school students in to experience research laboratories at Stanford.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project builds on Professor Solomon's current spectroscopic and computational studies of Fe and Cu zeolites, including their geometric/electronic structures, reactivity in selective hydrocarbon oxidation, and their correlation to Fe and Cu enzymes. It also extends this effort to metallozeolites that perform selective catalytic reduction (SCR) of NOx pollutants. These studies are providing detailed insight into reaction mechanisms, defining structural contributions to active site formation, as well as general principles of reactivity. The resulting insight may lead to improved catalysts for a number of economically significant chemical transformations, including the conversion of natural gas to CH3OH fuel, and the abatement of NOx pollutants generated by diesel engines. This proposal involves significant international collaboration, and Professor Solomon is involved in a number of directions to enhance knowledge in physical inorganic chemistry and spectroscopy. Professor Solomon's group has also taken a leadership role in outreach to local K-12 schools, including developing a shadowing program that brings high school students in to experience research laboratories at Stanford.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The direct conversion of methane to methanol would help prevent flaring at oil refineries and extraction sites and would valorize natural gas, a cleaner carbon fuel than common petroleum. This would ease carbon emissions in the interim as carbon neutral technologies develop, create a viable method to store natural gas, and lay the foundation for atmospheric methane abatement. However, due to the strong C-H bond in methane, and the tendency for further oxidation of the methanol product, methane to methanol synthesis is currently carried out in a multiple step process under extremely harsh conditions, limiting viability. However, copper and iron containing zeolites can perform this reaction under relatively mild conditions using two active sites first identified by our group, a mono-?-oxo dicopper(II) (Cu<sub>2</sub>O) (Scheme 1A) species and an Fe(IV) oxo (&alpha;-O) (Scheme 1B). Using a range of spectroscopies and coupling our observations to quantum mechanical calculations, we have elucidated the active site structures in copper and iron zeolites as well as uncovered key entatic (i.e. zeolite lattice constraints) and topological effects to optimize the reactivity and recyclability of these catalysts.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In copper zeolites, we have identified a series of distinct Cu<sub>2</sub>O active sites across three different topologies. Two of these sites in the MOR topology have significantly different reactivity despite being very similar in the first sphere. Using steric probes to monitor the loss of active site signal via resonance Raman spectroscopy (rR), we found a difference in the second sphere of these sites: one is located in an open channel (MOR1) while one is buried in a pocket (MOR2). By modeling these sites using Density Functional Theory (DFT), we discovered that the constrained pocket stabilizes methane to lower the overall reactivity (Figure 1). The location of the active site in the zeolite is crucial for how well it converts methane to methanol. We also compared two Cu<sub>2</sub>O sites with very different structures in the CHA and MFI topologies. Using rR to elucidate their structures, we were able to determine where the two Cu<sub>2</sub>O sites bind in each lattice. Two major factors differentiated the sites: they have very different Cu-O-Cu bond angles and different ligation by the lattice (Figure 2). Using DFT calculations we determined that, although the Cu-O-Cu angle of the active site&nbsp;core had little effect on reactivity, the angle at which the lattice binds to the Cu<sub>2</sub>O core drastically tunes reactivity. From these two studies, we determined that both active site location as well as how the lattice binds to the active site core are essential variables in copper zeolite reactivity. These factors ultimately activate these sites to convert&nbsp;methane to methanol under desirable conditions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For iron zeolites, we were able to elucidate the structure of the &alpha;-O active site as well as its &alpha;-Fe precursor using Extended X-ray Absorption Fine Structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy as well as Nuclear Resonance Vibrational Spectroscopy (NRVS). This is the first example of NRVS being used in zeolites and elucidated the strongest Fe-O bond recorded. This unique bonding is key to the exceptional reactivity in iron zeolites that allows it to convert methane to methanol at room temperature. We also investigated the effects of topology on product control using M?ssbauer and rR.&nbsp;Importantly, iron zeolite topologies with large apertures, like *BEA, contain oxidized products upon reaction with methane due to cage escape of the methyl radical after H-atom abstraction (Figure 3 right). However, constrained zeolites as in the CHA topology provide a barrier preventing escape and resulting in rebound of the methyl radical (Figure 3 left). This simultaneously creates more methanol per active site as well as allows reformation of the &alpha;-Fe active site precursor, enabling recycling. Limited cycling in iron and copper zeolites has been an Achilles? Heel in the industrial viability of these materials, and our work has provided fundamental new insight into solving this problem (just appeared in&nbsp;Science (DOI: 10.1126/science.abd5803) with an accompanying&nbsp;Perspective).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through spectroscopic investigation of active site structure and second sphere effects, we have elucidated key factors that activate copper and iron zeolites as well as the role zeolite topology plays in making them catalytic. Our studies have revealed methods for better optimization and design of these materials so they can be used for multiple green energy technologies from flaring prevention to atmospheric methane abatement.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 07/23/2021<br>      Modified by: Edward&nbsp;I&nbsp;Solomon</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1660611/1660611_10501462_1626899434142_Picture1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1660611/1660611_10501462_1626899434142_Picture1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Scheme of Cu and Fe active sites"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1660611/1660611_10501462_1626899434142_Picture1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Scheme of Cu and Fe active sites"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Scheme 1.
