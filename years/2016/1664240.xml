<AbstractNarration>Quantum topology is a branch of mathematics that provides a testing ground for the structures needed in a quantum theory of gravity. This field has brought about unprecedented interaction between mathematics and theoretical physics. It has been extremely successful and well studied in 3-dimensions. However, since we live in 4-dimensions (including time), a full theory of quantum gravity requires an extension of these tools to 4-dimensions. An emerging mathematical philosophy known as "categorification" provides an avenue to uncover a hidden layer in mathematical structures, revealing a richer and more robust theory capable of describing more complex phenomenon.  This project will use the perspective of categorification to enhance one of the most successful theories in 3-dimensions to a full 4-dimensional theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This collaboration will harness the interplay between low-dimensional geometry, representation theory, and higher-dimensional gauge theory. Through this coordinated effort the PIs will make substantial progress on the problem of categorifying 3-manifold invariants. The PIs will capitalize on recent breakthroughs in theoretical physics and higher representation theory that have created new possibilities for significant progress on this problem.  Among the techniques to be employed include:  fivebrane compactifications to provide a universal description of various old and new homological invariants of 3-manifolds, the use of infinity categories for defining tensor products of higher representations of quantum groups, and the theory of Hopfological algebra for categorifications at roots of unity, as well as recent work on odd link homology theory and categorifications of Habiro's universal invariant.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Our collaboration harnessed the interplay between low-dimensional geometry, representation theory, and higher-dimensional gauge theory to advance the problem of categorifying 3-manifold invariants. Our team capitalized on recent breakthroughs in theoretical physics and higher representation theory that have created new possibilities for  progress on this problem.  This FRG funding fueled new collaborations between team members and outside experts andresulted in over 30 publications by the core PI's and numerous more from affiliated postdocs and graduate students.  Intellectual Merit  More specifically, the PI's made the following advances:  Developed new tools for harnessing the interplay between representation theory and the construction of 3-manifold invariants. This includes developing the theory of categorified tensor product representations, curved braiding complexes, and foam evaluation models that enhance our undertanding of topological invariants. Developed new connections between higher representation theory and Heegaard-Floer homology giving rise to new techniques and inspiring new connections. Advanced the development of smooth 4-manifold invariants utilizing ideas from string theory and associated mathematics.   Broader Impacts  Throughout the collaboration out team of PI's mentored numerous graduate students, post-docs, and junior faculty.  The FRG funded collaboration provided a unique training opportunity where these individuals could be mentored by mutliple PI's, exposing them to cutting edge science, and enhancing the mathematical workforce.  Team members included several women mathematicians as well as other unrepresented groups in STEM.    Our Collaboration ran an active joint seminar, bringing in international experts from around the world.  We also ran a  Summer School and Workshop at the University of Southern California, July 16th-22nd, 2018 andHidden Algebraic Structures in Topology at the California Institute of Technology, March 14 - 16, 2019.  During the 2019-2020 academic year we also initiated a new model of collaboration with the Idea Incubator series at Caltech.    The idea of the series was to invite experts from around the world to give informal extended lectures on an area of active current interest, in order to stimulate collaboration, and "incubate" new scientific ideas.  All of these events were well attended by graduate students, postdocs, and junior faculty, along with the PI's for this award.  These events provided numerous opportunities for professional development.  Several invents were co-organized by post-docs and junior scientists had the opportunity to speak in these venues.   Each event made a concerted effort to involve typically underrepresented groups in mathematics.         Last Modified: 09/11/2020       Submitted by: Aaron Lauda]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
