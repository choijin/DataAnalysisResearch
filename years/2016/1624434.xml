<AbstractNarration>This award will support the creation of a ten-year strategic master plan for the Cayo Santiago Field Station (CSFS), an off-campus facility for research and education of the University of Puerto Rico that has served the scientific community for over 75 years. CSFS provides a free-ranging population of rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) for research projects focused on behavior, cognition, demography, life history, physiology and genetics. A new building has been recently acquired and offers the ideal space to develop adequate biological field station facilities, including the development of a housing unit, laboratory area, meeting space, and computer lab that can support the research currently done at CSFS and expand the community outreach program. Funding will allow a group of researchers and professionals from relevant backgrounds to perform a site-visit and offer advice needed to determine the extent of renovations necessary. In summary this is the ideal time to gear our efforts in conjunction with other professionals toward the improvement of the field station. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will help direct efforts towards developing state-of-the-art infrastructure and laboratory settings for the improvement of the CSFS, which will enhance CSFS?s ability to forge ahead in its mission of providing an invaluable service to educational and research communities, including the advancement of underrepresented groups within science. As the only minority U.S. institution of higher education that hosts a primate center, the CSFS represents a unique place to increase diversity in science by supporting local Puerto Rican students and researchers. The proposed planning activity consists of the formation of an Advisory Committee that will help design a master plan following a two-day meeting at CSFS with three specific aims: i) to determine the potential for growth of research at CSFS and to establish the technological, communication, and facility renovations that would be necessary to accomplish such a goal, ii) to create a plan to develop an academic program for undergraduate teaching and training, and iii) to initiate the development of an outreach program for school students and the general public and to determine how best to integrate community outreach with on-going research and teaching.

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ We celebrated the National Science Foundation-funded workshop Development of a Longitudinal Strategic Plan for Research and Education at The Cayo Santiago Field Station, Puerto Rico in September 27th &ndash; 29th, 2016. The main objective of the workshop was to gather 25 national and international experts in biological field station administration, research, and public education to discuss the mission, assess current resources, and determine major needs of the Cayo Santiago Field Station (CSFS) in Humacao.   Following the workshop and using the advise of the workshop participants, we developed a CSFS 10-year Master Plan for research and education which is published in the Caribbean Primate Research Center's website.The master plan will serve as platform to develop a proposal under the NSF Improvements in Facilities, Communications, and Equipment at Biological Field Stations and Marine Laboratories (FSML) program to improve current resources available to students, researchers, and educatros.  Developing a master plan for CSFS would help setting up a unique framework for interdisciplinary studies on the relationship among social behavior, morphology, physiology, genetics, spontaneous occurrence of disease, demography, and life-history evolution. As the only minority U.S. institution of higher education hosting a primate center, the University of Puerto Rico and its CSFS represent a unique research and educational center with vast potential to increase diversity in science while supporting local Puerto Rican students and researchers.
