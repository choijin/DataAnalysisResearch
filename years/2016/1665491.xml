<AbstractNarration>Model theory is a branch of mathematical logic that studies mathematical structures at a very general level. Whereas algebra studies various operations (addition, multiplication etc.) on various sets by classifying them according to what rules, or axioms, they satisfy, model theory takes a broader perspective and looks at all possible operations at once and attempts to classify them according to their combinatorial complexity. Some tame classes of operations are singled out for which then general theorems can be proved. Those in turn will apply to specific situations in different areas of mathematics (algebra, geometry, number theory...). This project lies at the border between the abstract and the applied side. The investigator plans to study two rather broad notions of tameness and apply this study to certain algebraic structures. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More precisely, the aim of this project is the study of definable groups in NIP and NTP_2 structures and more specifically in valued fields, and PRC fields and the general development of NTP_2. Our guiding intuition is that in NTP_2, ideals should work as a common generalization of non-forking extensions in simple theories and measures in NIP. Also, there should be an analogue of distality in this setting. On the more applied side, we plan to develop tools for the study of non-definably amenable groups both in NIP and NTP_2; test questions being the classification of all groups definable in PRC fields and a decomposition theorem for non-abelian metastable groups.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    The PI, Pierre Simon, has completed research on a variety of topics in mathematical logic. The core of the work is in model theory, a branch of mathematics that studies combinatorial properties of infinite structures. One such property is NIP: it says that the structure does not exhibit certain randomness properties. NIP structures are usually of geometric origin. The NIP property is a fundamental tameness notion that appears with different names in many areas of mathematics, such as machine learning, combinatorics and analysis.    One of the main result of the PI's research has been the solution to a longstanding open problem: every NIP structure that is not purely algebraic in some sense contains an infinite linear order. This can be thought of as saying that structural tameness can only come from linear orders and shows how ubiquitous linear orders are. This result was then used to classify a certain class of homogeneous structures, that is structures which exhibit a large amount of symmetries. It was shown that the structures considered consisted essentially in linear and circular orders. In a similar vein, the PI obtained with a collaborator the classification of homogeneous multi-orders (structures with finitely many linear orders). Those results seemed out of reach with the pre-existing methods.  In another direction, the PI has worked with collaborators from Germany and Israel on compressible types in NIP structures. To understand this, consider the problem of communicating n bits of information about an element in a structure. In general, one cannot do anything more efficient than explicitly sending the n bits. In an NIP structure however, there is always a way to communicate that information in a fixed number of bits. In some cases, it is in fact enough to send a small part of the original data of fixed size. This is what is called a compressible type. Using some results from machine learning, the PI and his collaborators have shown that such types always exist and are in some sense dense. As a consequence, they solved an open problem on the uniformity of honest definitions for NIP formulas, generalizing previous results to a local setting.     The work done under this award has substantially increased our understanding of NIP structures and opened new directions of research which are likely to be pursued in the future by the PI and other researchers.
