<AbstractNarration>1638837 - Pepiot&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To limit the environmental impact of fossil fuel usage, especially in terms of greenhouse gas emissions, a rapid development and deployment of cleaner combustion technologies is urgently needed. Chemical-Looping Combustion (CLC) has been identified as a promising technology for combined power generation and carbon capture, a key concept in limiting, and eventually decreasing green-house gas emissions from a wide variety of fuels, including coal or biomass. Computational simulations are widely and successfully used in many combustion-related areas. Yet, research and development for CLC technologies is disproportionately empirical in nature, due to a critical lack of reliable models to describe the complex hydrodynamics and chemical processes occurring in CLC. The main activity undertaken in this project is the development of a novel computational framework tailored for CLC applications, which will provide unprecedented insight into the controlling physical and chemical phenomena occurring during combustion. This work will eventually enable the formulation of high-fidelity Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) models and software to assist industry with the design of efficient CLC reactors. The project will provide educational project opportunities combining advanced computational techniques and a clear societal impact. Such projects have the potential to attract a diverse undergraduate student population toward Computational Science and Engineering, an area in which women and other URM are woefully under-represented&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed EAGER project aims at establishing a novel Lagrange-Euler computational framework to investigate key processes in CLC at the meso- and lab-scale. Two reactors typically involved in a CLC system will be considered, namely, an air-reactor, where the oxygen carrier is regenerated through oxidation with an air stream, and a fuel reactor, where the actual combustion process takes place through oxidation of the fuel by the oxygen carrier. The specific objectives of this project are: (1) Demonstrating the potential of a Lagrange-Euler approach to simulate the specific gas-solid hydrodynamics relevant for CLC systems, including high-velocity risers and bubbling fluidized beds; (2) Within this framework, developing novel algorithms to capture the specific and complex interactions between metal oxides and surrounding gases in the high temperature environments relevant to CLC; and (3) Demonstrating the need to include detailed chemical kinetics and associated small-scale heat and mass transfer processes to adequately capture the specificities and performance of oxygen carriers in CLC systems. This will be accomplished by assessing the sensitivities of CLC to the level of details of the chemical description included in CFD. Preliminary simulations will consider simple gaseous fuel oxidation by common, well-characterized metal oxides. The unprecedented preliminary data and observations obtained through this work will allow to identify with confidence future research directions to significantly improve CFD tools for CLC design and optimization.</AbstractNarration>
