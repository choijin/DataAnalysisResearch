<AbstractNarration>The development of electronic devices that operate at lower power could have a huge impact on global energy consumption. One way to decrease the required power is to scale the components to the smallest possible extent, which can be achieved with materials that are a few atomic layers thick. One of the promising two-dimensional (2D) materials is graphene which has a single layer of carbon atoms. In this study, a device is proposed that relies on the movement of ions that are positively or negatively charged to control electron transport in graphene. A novel data storage memory device is proposed that utilizes the strong interaction between ions and graphene. This GOALI proposal addresses the practical challenge of developing low-power devices, and the fundamental study of engineering ion transport at the limits of scaling. The close interaction between the University of Notre Dame and Micron Technology Inc. will serve to guide the effort for the  demonstration of a novel low-voltage nonvolatile single transistor flash memory device. Micron Technology Inc. will be involved in mentoring and training the students and will host a student as a summer intern. The graduate and undergraduate students will gain interdisciplinary skills in materials science, chemistry and electrical engineering. The research effort supports an educational component involving case studies in the classroom teaching of graduate and undergraduate students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fundamental understanding of ion transport in two-dimensional (2D) ion conductors is being explored to enable new concepts for ion doping in 2D crystal transistors and memory. A novel low-voltage, nonvolatile, flash memory concept is proposed based on the electrostatic ion doping of graphene. This device motivates a new set of material requirements for devices and fundamental transport studies. The essential ion transport configuration proposed for the study is a pair of 2D crystal electrodes separated by a 2D solid electrolyte. Lithium ions will shuttle between the 2D crystals by applying an electric field. The transfer of Li+ from one side of the electrolyte to the other will be sensed by the change in electronic conduction in one of the graphene electrodes. To facilitate fast ion transport, the project will focus initially on crown ether phthalocyanine (Pc) molecules, which will be deposited with monolayer precision. Ion and electron transport will be explored in a graphene/crown ether Pc/graphene memory cell at the limits of scaling the thickness. The choice of materials will be driven by the memory application requirement to minimize read/write speed and maximize retention with sub-volt operation. Micron Technology will offer facilities for fabrication of 300nm wafers and characterization of nanoionic devices.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project explored new types of electronic memory aided by insights from our GOALI partner, Micron Technologies, a world-leader in memory technology. A molecular solid-state electrolyte was developed with a thickness as thin as a single molecule.  We demonstrated the formation of this electrolyte over atomically-thin semiconductors, so called two-dimensional (2D) crystals.. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of a monolayer electrolyte and the first demonstration of ionic transport across a monolayer electrolyte to induce conductivity change in a 2D semiconductor. The motivation for exploring these types of extremely thin materials is to understand miniaturization and speed limits of memory technology.   One particularly interesting finding of this study is that the electrolyte - a cobalt crown ether phthalocyanine molecule combined with Li ions - can be configured in one state or another.   That is, the molecule is bistable. The configuration can be reversibly controlled by an electric field and is nonvolatile.  We showed that when the electrolyte is capped with another type of electrically insulating two-dimensional crystal, hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN), the two states became more stable and were reversibly cycled more than1000 times and state retention was demonstrated for more than 6 hours .   This work provided first looks at ionic/semiconductor memory configured at atomically thin layer dimensions.  Beyond binary memory, the results also suggest the need for further exploration of this memory approach for analog weight storage in deep learning systems and neuromorphic computing.   Developing an electrolyte scaled to a single monolayer and operated as a polarizable ion conductor motivated the investigation of ferroelectric material which also exhibit a surface polarization charge on application of a bias.  For hafnium zirconate and lead zirconium titatanate capacitors, we developed a measurement protocol and model describing switching dynamics, finding agreement with existing physical models over five orders of magnitude in pulse duration and as a function of pulse amplitude.  The insight gained in this study provides guidance for further optimization of the speed and density limits of ionic memory.  The funding provided in this project partially supported the work and training of five PhD students and three NSF REU students in Electrical Engineering and Chemical Engineering.  Two of the PhD students are working for technology companies in the United States and the other three are set to graduate within the next few years and enter the workforce.  The project also supported the research program of an early investigator and spun-off additional projects and external funding.
