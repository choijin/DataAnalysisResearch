<AbstractNarration>Demand for skilled workers in STEM industries is continuing to grow rapidly across the United States. At the same time, postsecondary completion rates in fields such as computer science and engineering lag far behind demand. Academically, calculus is the critical barrier to entry to high-growth, high-wage STEM careers for the 59% of community college students who enter at remedial math levels, greatly diminishing the candidate pool for careers in STEM disciplines. In California, for example, only 4% of community college students advance to calculus in 4 years and therefore never have a chance to begin to train for the STEM careers that dominate the state's economic landscape. This barrier diminishes the candidate pool for STEM careers falling disproportionately on two groups: (1) minority students who are overrepresented in remedial programs; and (2) female students who are underrepresented in higher-level math courses. To broaden participation and expand the pipeline of available STEM talent, the STEM Core Initiative (SCI) implements a model that includes an accelerated and contextualized math course sequence with intensive supportive services designed to serve underrepresented students. The cohort-based program moves students from intermediate algebra to calculus-readiness in two semesters (as opposed to two or more years). A prototype of the SCI model has been implemented at four colleges over the last three years and has resulted in a 20-30 percent increase in math course success rates for participants compared to students enrolled in a traditional math course track. The partnership replicates and scales SCI successes through an enhanced STEM Core pathway model to be implemented at 13 California community colleges and one large and diverse Maryland community college campus, directly serving more than 625 students. Further, as a workforce development program, SCI offers paid internships with leading national and regional employers in computer science and engineering and exposes students to high-growth, high-wage STEM career opportunities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The one-year calculus-readiness and internship pathway for remedial students is a new approach in eleven of the partner colleges and utilizes a collective impact approach to align industry and workforce development partners. The partnership offers wrap around student support, accelerated and contextualized learning, and expanded high-quality work-based learning experiences including internships. Well-positioned employer partners (such as NASA and the federal energy labs) contribute to the development of a national strategy by assisting community colleges with course contextualization, providing career orientation, and hosting project-based internships. To advance research, SCI employs a comprehensive multiple methods plan to assess the effectiveness of the STEM Core intervention and identify and understand the effective practices that underpin successful implementation of the STEM Core at 14 community colleges in California and Maryland. The evaluation seeks to measure and understand the impacts of STEM Core on student learning, academic and industry engagement, academic momentum, math confidence, and commitment to STEM as well as an understanding of implementation and replication strategies that yield the greatest impact. National dissemination of the results showcase the successes of STEM Core and build capacity to replicate the model.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ California?s public colleges and universities are failing to graduate enough students with degrees in STEM subjects to meet growing employer demand.  Jobs requiring B.S. degrees in many STEM disciplines such as computer science and engineering are in high demand, and there remains a significant shortage in these fields across the U.S.  Calculus is a critical barrier for entry into high-growth, high-wage STEM careers for the majority of community college (CC) students who begin at remedial levels (59%) and rarely make it to calculus (4%).  This barrier diminishes the candidate pool for STEM careers falling disproportionately on two groups: (1) minority students who are overrepresented in remedial programs; and (2) female students who are underrepresented in higher-level math courses.  To meet the workforce demand in STEM-related fields and expand the pipeline, postsecondary institutions and workforce partners must:  (1) address the critical math barrier disproportionately impacting minority students; (2) engage industry partners to ensure educators understand their dynamic needs and integrate work-based learning into education and training programs; and (3) shift from a fragmented approach to a collaborative approach that results in more students successfully entering high-demand jobs and careers.  The STEM Core Initiative (SCI) addressed those challenges byproviding social and educational supportto students at the remedial level and, within two semesters, working to bring them to a level that they are able to enter calculus.  This was done through an integrated pathway model incorporating four best practices: (1) Accelerated and contextualized math course sequence extending from intermediate algebra through pre-calculus; (2) Cohort-based learning communities; (3) Intensive student support combined with an introduction to STEM career and educational opportunities; and (4) Linked internships and project-based work experience.   With NSF INCLUDES funding, the SCI team replicated and scaled pre-award SCI successes through an enhanced STEM Core pathway model that was implemented at 14 California CCs, one Colorado CC, and one large Maryland CC campus.  During the NSF INCLUDES award activity, the SCI Design and Development Launch Pilot (DDLP) has directly served 566 remedial students, the overwhelming majority of which are from groups that are underrepresented in STEM fields.  In the two years of the NSF INCLUDES SCI Program, 62% of our student participants became calculus readyin just one year.  That value can be compared to only 4% of all remedial California CC students (CCCCO Data Mart) becoming calculus ready while attending a community college.  Well-positioned employer partners, such as NASA Centers, National Laboratories, Silicon Valley Leadership Group, Lockheed Martin, and Northrup Grumman, contributed to the development of a national visionby assisting CCs with course contextualization, providing career orientations, and hosting project-based internships. 109of our STEM Core student participants were placed into paid internships over this grant's two-year life.  SCI partners developed tools to assist practitioners in expandingthe SCI DDLP to include California, Washington, Colorado, Maryland, and New Mexico community colleges.  The SCI DDLP began the grant period with 12 community college partners and has now expanded to 33 colleges and has been selected as one of the first five NSF INCLUDES Alliance projects receiving funding for an additional five years.
