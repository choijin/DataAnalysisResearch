<AbstractNarration>NON-TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION: Despite recent advances, women remain significantly underrepresented in physics.  This award seeks to address this issue by identifying best practices across the globe in recruiting and retaining female physicists.  To launch this effort, a U.S. delegation is attending the 6th International Union of Pure and Applied Physics International Conference on Women in Physics (ICWIP 2017) in the UK (July 2017). Strategies and insights shared during the ICWIP 2017 meeting are expected to be useful in the retention of women in physics and other physical science fields.  In addition, participation in this conference seeds international research and educational partnerships, which are also important in advancing the careers of women in science. The key benefits for U.S. scientists are maximized through the conference proceedings; effective dissemination plans; follow-up sessions at numerous U.S. venues; papers, talks, and networking by the delegates; and the development of an extensive website on gender bias. The U.S. delegation includes a few members from fields other than physics where women are scarce (e.g., engineering and computer science), thus laying the groundwork for those fields to benefit from the knowledge disseminated at this conference.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TECHNICAL DETAILS:  This series of international conferences on women in physics is proving to be an effective mechanism for sharing best practices internationally, empowering new approaches and actions in the U.S., nucleating networking in research, and increasing the numbers, advancement and retention of women in the field. Members of the U.S. Delegation learn about and take advantage of successful initiatives piloted in ~ 50-70 other countries. Moreover, by including non-physicists as a part of those attending the conference, this model is being used to catalyze the transfer of knowledge to other fields where similar strategies could improve women's participation. Finally, the body of knowledge shared during the conference is being published in proceedings which will be freely available online.</AbstractNarration>

The U.S. led a delegation of 20 physicists and astronomers to participate in various aspects of the conference either by traveling and attending the conference (13 individuals) or by assisting with pre- and post conference activities (7 additional individuals).     The purpose of ICWIP 2017 was three-fold: (i) to provide an opportunity to view and analyze the current status of and progress in promoting women in physics in each country and internationally; (ii) to provide an arena for women in physics to share their scientific accomplishments and create international scientific collaborations; and (iii) to build capacity in each participating country to design and implement changes that improve the participation and advancement of women in physics. The U.S. delegation to the conference provided critical outreach products for the conference as well as carried out post conference dissemination and outreach to promote women and girls in the U.S. physics enterprise.     The project provided funding for (i) travel support for participants of a diverse, 13-person delegation from the United States plus additional individuals involved in assessment of the project; (ii) support for the conference proceedings; (iii) support for the development of a website (web-based community forum) with examples of gender bias experienced by women physicists attending the ICWIP 2017 conference and successful or unsuccessful strategies they have used to address those issues (see https://genderbias.compadre.org); (iv) dissemination and follow up in the U.S.; and (v) assessment of the impact of the conference on U.S. participants and the U.S. physics enterprise.

For example, several presentations were held at the American Association of Physics Teachers and the American Physical Society national meetings immediately following ICWIP 2017 to discuss the conference and issues around increasing the number of women in physics.  Special diversity workshops on issues that impact women as described during ICWIP 2017 were held at AAPT national meetings and anyone registered for the meeting could attend.  An in-person reunion of U.S. delegates to all of the past ICWIPs was held during summer 2019 to discuss the impact of the conferences and also to provide feedback to improve the experiences for U.S. delegates who attend          Last Modified: 09/16/2020       Submitted by: Beth Cunningham]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
