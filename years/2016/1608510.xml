<AbstractNarration>This project aims to help physics instructors: (a) value student's intuitive thinking and (b) improve their instruction by building on those student intuitions.  The project is grounded in the premises that students bring stores of ideas about the physical world to the classroom, and taking into account these ideas, however informal, can improve their learning. This project will develop instructional materials in forces, waves and optics, and the particle nature of matter that utilize students' intuitive ideas. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Researchers have taken very different stances toward students' intuitive knowledge. The misconceptions theory of knowledge takes the stance that students' intuitive understandings are often inconsistent with the scientific consensus and thus are obstacles to learning unless addressed. From this perspective student knowledge is relatively rigid and mostly context-independent. Thus researchers search for common, incorrect patterns in student thinking, and instructors elicit, confront, and resolve misconceptions. Alternatively, according to the resources theory of knowledge: 1) students' intuitive understandings develop from their experiences of the physical world and 2) student knowledge is dynamic and context-dependent. Hence, researchers should attend to productive and potentially useful student intuitions on which instructors can build. While instructors and researchers need not ascribe to a single theory of knowledge, misconceptions research has had a more pronounced impact on physics education research and instruction than resources research. This project has the long-term goal of promoting instructor adoption of this second perspective, the resources theory of knowledge. Researchers will first document the common, prevalent resources that students marshal to reason about physics. Then they will develop instructional materials that embed a resources orientation toward student thinking and build on the resources they document. The PI team will also test the effectiveness of these instructional materials in improving students' conceptual understanding. The STEM education community is embracing resources-oriented instruction for reasons of equity and agency. Framing students' intuitive physics ideas as misconceptions disadvantages students from diverse cultural, linguistic, and socioeconomic communities. Conversely, framing student ideas as resources -- as "productive beginnings" of more sophisticated thinking -- has the potential to broaden participation in physics.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Much existing research on student ideas in physics focuses on what students misunderstand or find challenging about physics, and then tries to come up with ways to address student misunderstandings.  Our project instead focuses on ideas that students have that might serve as resources - or inputs - for learning physics, and then has come up with ways to build on these ideas.  These resources do not need to be correct, from a physics perspective; they can be incorrect ideas that make sense, or that can grow into something more sophisticated or more correct with support.   As part of this project, we have identified specific resources for understanding forces and waves on a spring.  For example, one resource students use for understanding waves on a string is that the propagation speed of the wave (i.e., how fast it moves down the spring) is related to how fast a single piece of the spring moves up and down.  Sometimes the way that students use this resource is correct, other times it's not, but in either case we see the idea itself as productive: students are (correctly) identifying that the way a wave propagates is by the up-and-down motion of individual parts of the spring.  Also as part of this project, we have found ways to ask questions that are more likely to invite students to share why they think something works the way it does.  Knowing how to ask questions like this can help physics instructors to plan lessons that help them understand students' ideas.  Additionally, we've developed worksheets for physics instructors to use that elicit and build on the resources we've identified.  This work matters because the way that instructors think about students' ideas - as resources to build on or misunderstandings to fix - affects how they respond to students in real time.  Because educational settings already subject minoritized students to deficit-oriented framings, curriculum and instruction that takes a deficit view of student thinking may disproportionately impact students from these groups (Warren, Ballenger, Ogonowski, Rosebery, &amp; Hudicourt-Barnes, 2001).  Our project has the potential to influence instructors to see their students' ideas as sensible and productive, which could in turn support students in feeling affirmed, seeing their ideas as an important part of their learning, and increasingly identifying with physics.
