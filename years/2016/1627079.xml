<AbstractNarration>This project studies the relationship between human rights law, human rights violations, and public opinion.  How do legal rules affect whether publics approve of human rights violations?  To what extent does public opinion depend on whether opposition movements and governments use non-violent or violent tactics?  The answers to these questions have important implications for our understanding of governance and the relationship between state and society. By studying these relationships, this project will have substantial intellectual, social, policy, and educational impacts. It will provide policy makers, practitioners, and the human rights community with a better understanding of the conditions under which human rights law can affect public opinion toward governments. The project results will aid the actors and institutions involved in the design, implementation, and advocacy for compliance with human rights law. The project will allow practitioners to better anticipate the impacts of violent crises and to determine the conditions under which legal institutions and legal rhetoric can be used more effectively to constrain governments and prevent additional violence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project addresses these questions through the use of survey experiments.  Although the fields of political science and law have developed important theories about the human rights abuses and their relationship to international law, these theories rely on untested assumptions about public opinion.  We know very little about how publics respond to human rights abuses.  In many situations, publics are opposed to such activities, but in certain contexts publics seem to favor these activities.  The survey experiments will consist of randomly administered hypothetical fact patterns.  We will conduct the surveys in several countries.  These experimental tools will allow us to systematically assess the underlying causal relationships and causal mechanisms.  We will identify the extent to which and the conditions under which violations of human rights law have causal effects on public opinion.  In addition, the project will identify how law has such effects by systematically testing against each other the main pathways through which legal principles may affect public opinion.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Our  results contribute  toward a fuller  understanding  of how  the  relationship  between  human  rights  law  and  public  opinion  is  conditioned  by  strategies  of  repression  and  dissent.    The  results  will  allow  us  to  better  understand  the  causal  relationships  between  the  legal  status  (both international and constitutional) of  government  and opposition group responses  to  dissent   and  the  extent  to  which publics  approve  of  both governments and opposition groups.    In  addition,  our  research  designs  allow  us  to  better  understand  the  mechanisms  by  which law and violence  affects  public  opinion  in  some  contexts  but  not  others.    Our  results  are  therefore  of  importance  to  several  academic  communities,  including  scholars  of  international  law,  constitutional  law,  public  opinion,  human  rights,  and  political  violence. Our initial results were published in 2019 in an article in the American Journal of Political Science.  In that paper, we asked: Under what conditions are individuals more likely to approve of human rights abuses by their governments? While various theoretical expectations have been offered about public approval of repression, many of them have not been directlytested. We analyzed the effects of differing opposition tactics, differing government tactics, and legal constraints on approvalof repression through a series of survey experiments in India, Israel, and Argentina.
