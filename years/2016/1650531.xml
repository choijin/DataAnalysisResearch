<AbstractNarration>Relying on a single data source for knowledge discovery often results in unsatisfactory performance because of the missing patterns involving other potential entities and their relationships.  This is particularly important in healthcare informatics areas such as pharmacovigilance.  Pharmacovigilance is an important healthcare issue due to the impact of the adverse drug reactions.  It complicates patients' medical conditions, increase hospital admissions, and contribute to more morbidity and event death.  In current pharmacovigilance research, most work only consider a single data source for discovering the associations between the two entities, namely drugs and adverse drug reactions.  This project develops a novel framework to integrate multiple data sources, including spontaneous report systems, electronic health records, pharmaceutical databases, scientific literature, and web data, for heterogeneous network mining.  Such a heterogeneous network consists of multiple entities, including drugs, adverse drug reactions, patients, diseases, and symptoms, and various types of relationships among such entities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project extends the capability of machine learning, data analytics, and pharmacovigilance by integrating multiple data sources for pharmacovigilance applications.  In particular, the inclusion of patient-centric data on the web creates insights that may not be obtained from traditional data sources mainly contributed by health professionals.  The outcomes of the project include techniques for heterogeneous path mining and structural topological pattern mining on four pharmacovigilance applications, namely adverse drug reaction detection, drug-drug interaction, prescribing cascade, and phenotypic information discovery.  Such techniques can also be extended for drug repositioning and off-label use identification.  The result of this research is beneficial to multiple disciplines including pharmacy, medicine, public health, and computing.  The integrated education plan includes incorporating the research findings into courses offered by the Master of Science program in Health Informatics.  The outreach plan involves organizing workshops, conferences, and seminars to disseminate the research outcomes.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In this project, we develop heterogeneous network mining for several healthcare applications, including drug safety signal detection, drug repositioning, and online healthcare community recommendation.  A heterogeneous network is defined as a graph G consisting of nodes (N) joined by links (L).  Each node ni belongs to one particular type and each link li belong to one particular association.  The nodes represent different types of health entities such as diseases, drugs, adverse drug reactions, and patients and the links represent different types of associations of the corresponding entities.  We extract the health entities and their associations from multiple sources including health consumer generated content, spontaneous reporting systems, pharmaceutical databases, scientific literature, and electronic health records.   We utilize several patterns including meta-paths and specific topologies (e.g. triads) to discover novel adverse drug reactions and drug-drug reactions embedded in the healthcare heterogeneous network.  The new techniques overcome the limitation of using traditional professional health data such as spontaneous reporting system, electronic health records, and scientific literature by incorporating health consumer generated content to extract the timely signal.   We developed a disease-based drug repositioning strategy by using phenotypic information as intermediary to discover novel drug-disease relationship.  Adverse drug reaction and disease are both behavioral and physiological changes in response to drug treatment.  If drugs treating a disease share the same adverse drug reaction, the adverse drug reaction may serve as a phenotypic biomarker for the disease.  By using path mining in the heterogeneous network, we are able to identify novel repositioning drugs that are supported by evidences extracted from scientific literature.  The new systematic drug repositioning techniques can accelerate the drug development and as a result new medication can be made available to the public with less amount of time and cost.  We have also extended the work to develop two approaches using the local similarity (ProfileNet) and the global similarity (HealthRank) in the heterogeneous information network to determine health consumer similarity for user recommendation in online health communities.  Such recommendation support health consumers to search for relevant information from existing threads and search for similar peers to exchange healthcare information.   We actively collaborate with pharmaceutical companies and medical institutions to transfer our technology and extend the work for further collaborations in early detection of health conditions, drug safety signal detection, and drug development.
