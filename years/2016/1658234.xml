<AbstractNarration>This research supported by this award addresses the question: How do differences in types of border-crossings and cross-border relationships affect business strategies and economic opportunities? Political borders between nation-states are often barriers for the movement of people, but they also create spaces of opportunity for various economic activities. People may strategically utilize borders to take advantage of factors such as different tax rates, labor costs, and employment prospects.  However, international borders do not all function in the same way. Some,  such as borders within the European Union, promote cross-border flow. Others, such as the U.S.-Mexico border, reinforce divisions. Emory University doctoral student Daniel K. Thompson, supervised by Dr. Peter D. Little, will address the question of the effects of this variaibility in a regional economy where global migration and finance circuits intersect with local cross-border flows.  Combining in-depth interviews with business statistics, the results from this project will inform social scientists and policymakers about the impacts of transnational investment in regions characterized by both poverty and transnational interconnectivity.  Through collaboration with students and researchers at Jigjiga University, the project will also help build research capacity at a new university.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will be conducted in Jigjiga, a key trading town in eastern Ethiopia near the Ethiopia-Somalia border that historically has provided a transit point for trade between Ethiopia's highlands and the coast of Somalia. In the past decade, Jigjiga has become a site for a new type of international business as hundreds of ethnic Somalis from the diaspora, especially from Europe and North America, have returned and started businesses in town. The researcher will compare business strategies, competition, and opportunity among three groups of business people: (1) town-based retailers; (2) merchants who specialize in cross-border commerce with Somalia and have longstanding cross-border relationships; and (3) returned diaspora investors, whose ties extend far beyond the region. Data will be collected through participant observation, informant mapping tasks, in-depth interviews with 90 business owners and managers from the three groups, and a social and business network survey to map out their local, regional, and transnational financial and social networks. These data will allow comparisons among the three groups to determine how they impact the regional economy and economic opportunities, and how extensive circuits of trade and finance are grounded in the borderlands city.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In 2010, the new president of Ethiopia?s Somali Regional State reached out to Ethiopian-origin ethnic Somalis who had fled abroad, asking this diaspora population to stop supporting rebellion against Ethiopia and to invest their money in building up the regional economy instead. Through one year (2017-2018) of observing market dynamics in the regional capital city, Jigjiga, and through interviews with diaspora investors, local businesspeople, and regional officials, this project documented the economic impacts of diaspora investment on the economy of this region where Ethiopia borders the self-declared Somaliland Republic. At this point, three outcomes of the project are worth noting.  First, the historical dimensions of the project suggest ways in which African governments? efforts to re-engage with disaffected populations of forced migrants can reshape post-conflict reconstruction. In the case of Ethiopia, the investment of ethnic Somalis was a radical about-face after years during which many Somalis who fled Ethiopia had supported rebellion in the region. The regional administration sought to attract investment in long-term investments to create buy-in and de-incentivize rebellion, providing tax breaks and free land to certain investors. The willingness of these forced migrants to invest in the Ethiopian system after decades of perceiving Ethiopia as the enemy is a surprising dynamic and suggests possibilities for transformation in a region plagued by decades of conflict.  Second, observation and interviews revealed how the regional government incentivized diaspora investment by imposing strict controls on trade, investment, and currency circulation in what had been a relatively open borderlands market. The impacts of diaspora return were therefore in part mediated through government economic regulation more generally. Government regulations created a bifurcation in the local market between large-scale formal trade and small-scale informal and "contraband" trade on which the majority of local businesspeople relied for their subsistence. This heightened inequality in the city of Jigjiga and created discontent with economic policies. However, it was not the case that local businesses were universally marginalized while diaspora investors benefitted. Those with connections to the government benefitted while those without such connections often found themselves in more precarious positions.  Third, the reliance of certain businesspeople on the government to protect their assets turned into a detriment as the regional government?s authority began to crumble due to major political changes in Ethiopia in 2017-2018. What this revealed is that in a situation of political instability, people who relied on investments in the local community ("social payments") and were perceived as benefitting the broader society rather than just the government were more secure in their investments. Investors in fact frequently favored social controls over the economy and over property recognition rather than government controls, since government regulation was perceived to be susceptible to be "bought off" by special interests with money. In general, the prevailing economic regime remains something akin to a "moral economy" in which social safety nets are provided through cultural and kinship-based patterns of redistribution rather than state controls.
