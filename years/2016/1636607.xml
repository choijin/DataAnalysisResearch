<AbstractNarration>Non-Technical Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two dimensional materials are composed of layers of atoms that are only a few atoms thick.  Recent advances in the fabrication of these materials have led to the development of new types of electronic devices.   For these extremely thin layers the quantum nature of the system dominates the properties in new and unusual ways.  In these materials spontaneous ordering, similar to ferromagnetism, can occur and the topology of the system can affect the properties.  However, these materials offer the advantage that electric fields can be used to modify the properties.  This leads to new possibilities for enhancing the functionality of quantum electronic devices. This project aims to develop a new, ultrasensitive capacitive technique to study these materials. The novel measurement toolkit, moreover, will aid other scientists in the field studying devices relevant to electronics and energy harvesting. Undergraduate and graduate students will be trained in experimental design, device fabrication, and cryogenic measurement, advancing a new generation of condensed matter physicists ready to take on challenging problems across materials and measurement science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical abstract:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will develop and provide a proof of principle for a capacitive measurement technique that directly senses electronic compressibility, layer polarization, and layer polarizability in atomic bilayers. The technique relies on the small difference in geometric capacitance between a bilayer and two proximal gates caused by interlayer motion of electrons, detected using a multiplexed high current gain cryogenic amplifier. The proposed research will enhance understanding of the physics of graphene bilayers by exhaustively cataloging integer and fractional quantum Hall effects and symmetry protected edge states, using a combination of thermodynamic and charge transport techniques. In Bernal-stacked graphene bilayers, the Principal Investigator will directly resolve valley- and orbital-order in the zero energy Landau level, with additional work to detect thermodynamic anomalies associated with the still poorly understood zero magnetic field correlated phase. Layer polarization and polarizability measurements effected by measuring diverse capacitance observables in a dual gated device will allow unambiguous observation of interlayer coherent states and disambiguation of the charge-valley-orbital symmetry breaking mechanisms. In large twist angle graphene bilayers, bulk and edge probes will be used to search for quantum spin Hall effects of both normal and fractionalized electronic degrees of freedom. In small angle bilayers, the measurements will reveal the basic parameters of physical and electronic structure, specifically the role of elastic strain reconstructions when the layers are nearly aligned. At high magnetic fields bulk and edge measurements will permit disentanglement of intertwined ferromagnetic, fractional, and fractal quantum Hall physics.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Van der Waals heterostructures are devices composed of alternating layers of atomically thin 2D materials.  These include graphene&mdash;a single atomic sheet of carbon&mdash;as well as semiconducting, superconducting, and insulating materials.  Assembled atomic-layer by atomic-layer, van der Waals heterostructures provide a platform to create new electronic and optical devices that cannot be realized in conventional materials systems, as well as a new venue for studying the fundamental physics of electrons in two dimensions.  Of particular interest are bilayer systems, in which electrons are confined to two atomic layers in contact with each other.  Applied electric fields from ?gate?  electrodes control both the total number of electrons in the bilayer as well as the tendency of electrons to polarize the two layers, providing electrical control over both the electron density (as in a conventional field effect transistor) as well as the ?layer-pseudospin?&mdash;a quantum mechanical variable analogous to the intrinsic spin of the electron.    A major challenge in this field has been to understand how charge redistribution occurs between layers in these devices under applied electrical bias.  Quantum mechanically, electrons will occupy the lowest energy states as governed by the electronic band structure of the material in question.  However, mutual interaction between electrons can favor a different distribution between layers, depending on the number of electrons and other external parameters such as the magnetic field or optical illumination. This problem is highly challenging theoretically, as it involves taking into account interaction between all electrons, which becomes intractable to calculate for realistic systems of many electrons.  At the same time, typical experimental probes, such as the electrical resistance, are uniquely insensitive the actual layer polarization.  Nevertheless, quantifying charge transfer is of both fundamental importance as a model for quantum magnetism as well as a fundamental ingredient for understanding electronic and optoelectronic devices that rely on interlayer excitation.    In this project, we sought to develop a technique to measure the charge imbalance in van der Waals bilayers by directly detecting small changes in capacitance within multilayer structures, and apply this technique to graphene bilayers.  This is highly challenging, as gate electrodes are located tens of nanometers from the bilayer, while the motion to be detected is only across the 3.3 Angstroms separating the two layers, putting stringent requirements on the design of the electronic device as well as the sensitivity of our detection scheme.  We successfully implemented a suite of technique that resulted in the first measurements of the layer polarization. At high magnetic fields, this allowed us to resolve a long-standing question of the quantum mechanical ground state&mdash;in essence, we directly answered the question of how quantum mechanical electrons organize themselves within this model system.    The results of our work have several direct implications.  In bilayer graphene, they establish the essential phase diagram at high magnetic fields. Our results imply, for example, that subtle quantum states recently observed in bilayer graphene are likely to host electronic excitations that can be exploited for quantum information processing. This hypothesis was previously based on speculation about the underlying layer- and spin-order, and was only resolved in the present work.  In addition, our work provides an experimental technique that is generally applicable to van der Waals heterostructures.  Among the targets for immediate application include photoexcited semiconducting van der Waals heterostructures, where incoming light is converted to electrical charge in the form of interlayer excitons, with potential use in light harvesting and optoelectronic switching applications.    One PhD student and two undergraduate students participated in this project, gaining valuable experience in nanofabrication, analog and digital electronics, cryogenic measurements, and theoretical modeling and data analysis.  The work resulted in one publication, currently in press at Nature Communications.          Last Modified: 09/27/2017       Submitted by: Andrea F Young]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
