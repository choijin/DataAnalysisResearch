<AbstractNarration>SES-1626123 &lt;br/&gt;Hollie Brehm &lt;br/&gt;Ohio State University &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SES-1626753 &lt;br/&gt;Christopher Uggen &lt;br/&gt;University of Minnesota &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the twentieth century, genocide killed more people than wars or homicide. Understanding who commits genocide and how to bring justice in its aftermath is therefore vitally important in the twenty-first century. Accordingly, this project will examine unique court data from the 1994 genocide in Rwanda to assess the characteristics of the hundreds of thousands of civilians who participated in the genocide, how courts in Rwanda sought to hold these individuals accountable, and how such legal responses to mass violence affected individuals and communities. Because many other instances of mass violence involve civilian participation, understanding the characteristics of people who commit mass violence holds the potential to inform interventions to stop or prevent violence. Courts and related justice mechanisms that hold perpetrators accountable are also implemented in countries worldwide, and understanding how these courts function and the effects they have on people and communities will likewise inform future justice efforts. The project results will therefore be widely disseminated to academic, governmental, and public audiences that include organizations forecasting and responding to mass violence, such as the UN Special Adviser on the Prevention of Genocide, as well as organizations that facilitate legal responses in the aftermath of violence, such as the International Center for Transitional Justice. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project asks three related questions to contribute to social scientific scholarship on mass violence and its aftermath: 1) Who participates in mass violence? 2) What influences legal responses to this participation? And 3) How do legal responses to mass violence affect individuals and societies? To do so, the investigators examine the case of Rwanda, where as many as one million people were killed in 1994. Rwandans who participated in the violence were later tried in gacaca courts, a community-based justice system that the Government of Rwanda created in the aftermath of the genocide. By analyzing 1.96 million gacaca court case files, this project will assess who participated in the violence, how the gacaca courts responded, and the influence of the gacaca courts on Rwandan citizens and communities today. This project makes three core scientific contributions: (1) Existing studies of genocide stress the normality of perpetrators, though few large-scale studies have empirically assessed the characteristics of those who take part in violent collective action. Gacaca court records constitute the largest dataset of perpetrators of violence to date, allowing for an analysis of the characteristics of the civilians who participated in the genocide. (2) The gacaca court system uniquely blended punitive and restorative justice to respond to civilian participants. Better understanding how these courts functioned is vital to scientific understanding of the law in action, transitional justice mechanisms, and community-based justice. This will include an analysis of the individual and community-level factors that influenced court processes and punishments, invoking questions that are central to scholars of inequality and socio-legal processes. (3) Third, understanding gacaca will inform literature on transitional justice mechanisms, ranging from their long-term influence on participants to their influence on the communities where court proceedings occurred.</AbstractNarration>

Such mass civilian participation in the violence resulted in upwards of one million deaths&mdash;along with widespread sexualized violence, torture, forced displacement, and property damage&mdash;in just over three months. In the aftermath, a state-implemented court system called the&nbsp;<em>gacaca&nbsp;</em>courts tried the hundreds of thousands of suspects in over 12,000 courts established across Rwanda. This research project has resulted in three major outcomes tied to better understanding the genocide and the subsequent&nbsp;<em>gacaca&nbsp;</em>court system.&nbsp;</p> <p>First, the project resulted in the creation of a database of all&nbsp;<em>gacaca&nbsp;</em>court trials. In total, there were 1.96 million trials, and the PI merged thousands of files to create a database with key information about each trial. This database is important in its own right, as it documents the trials of people accused of one of the worst episodes of mass violence of the 20<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;century. Such valuable information can also be used to study the trials, ranging from the factors that impacted their outcomes to how the trials affected communities across Rwanda. This project has begun to document these and other factors, and as other post-conflict societies are considering implementing similar systems, resulting findings are paramount. For instance, preliminary results indicate that certain individual factors (e.g., age, gender, occupation) and community-level factors (e.g., level of education, urbanicity) impacted the sentences defendants received in the&nbsp;<em>gacaca&nbsp;</em>courts.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Second, the project resulted in a database of all people who went through the&nbsp;<em>gacaca&nbsp;</em>court system. Defendants had multiple trials, though their information was not linked across trials. Prior to this project, it was consequently impossible to know how many people were tried in the&nbsp;<em>gacaca&nbsp;</em>courts, as well as how many were found guilty. By utilizing probabilistic matching,&nbsp;this project found that approximately 868,288 people were found guilty of participating in the genocide, with 196,178 people found guilty of violent offenses, 636,567 found guilty of property crimes, and 35,543 individuals found guilty of both property and violent crimes.
