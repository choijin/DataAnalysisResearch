<AbstractNarration>How would you measure the closeness of two signatures or two clay&lt;br/&gt;figurines?  This project explores the mathematics and computation of&lt;br/&gt;measuring similarity between curves or 3-dimensional objects --&lt;br/&gt;whether to compare GPS tracking data to road maps, or medical scans of internal organs to&lt;br/&gt;reference models of healthy organs. While some well understood comparison methods simply&lt;br/&gt;look at how close the objects are, this project aims to design more&lt;br/&gt;sophisticated measures that take into account the underlying structure&lt;br/&gt;(or topology) of the curves and surfaces.  The PI plans to collaborate&lt;br/&gt;with applications areas that use these measurement algorithms to&lt;br/&gt;develop measures that best fit the areas, in addition to continuing&lt;br/&gt;her work in a larger network of shape analysis and computational&lt;br/&gt;topology communities, including organizing workshops focused at&lt;br/&gt;mentoring junior women in these areas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project generalizes notions of similarity from curves to graphs, meshes, or&lt;br/&gt;3-manifolds.  The primary problems and techniques come from the&lt;br/&gt;emerging field of computational topology, which combines algorithms&lt;br/&gt;and computational geometry with mathematical foundations and tools&lt;br/&gt;from the area of topology.  In particular, the PI proposes to examine&lt;br/&gt;fundamental topological notions of similarity between curves and&lt;br/&gt;surfaces in some ambient space, based on computing optimal homotopies, homologies, or isotopies. Each&lt;br/&gt;possibility offers a different notion of what it means for two things&lt;br/&gt;to be equivalent in the ambient space, and each can be optimized based&lt;br/&gt;on the notions of area, "height," or "width." While several initial&lt;br/&gt;algorithmic results on these measures have been published, there are&lt;br/&gt;many open questions that remain. In addition, recent mathematical&lt;br/&gt;developments indicate many potentially tractable and feasible areas&lt;br/&gt;that are yet to be explored from the algorithmic perspective. Some of&lt;br/&gt;these measures are likely to be hard to compute, which is of interest&lt;br/&gt;to the theoretical community, and approximation or fixed parameter&lt;br/&gt;tractable algorithms may prove practical in applications areas. The&lt;br/&gt;project will also include collaborations in applications areas for&lt;br/&gt;these measures, in order to better evaluate their utility.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ An increasing amount of geometric data is being captured by a wide range of new technology, ranging from GIS trajectories to 3d scans of objects.  While such data is ubiquitous, it is also notoriously hard for computers to work with, as well as being prone to errors and noise.  This proposal funded the investigation of mathematical approaches formalize distance measures which enable analysis and comparison of such geometric data.  The PI drew primarily upon concepts from topology, an area of mathematics that studies underlying structure and patterns in shapes, in order to define new ways to analyze such data and study the limits of what is computable under these measures.  In addition to computability, the PI considered which definitions or algorithms were the most practical for different types of data, working with a collaborators in more applied domains where possible to test the practicality of the developed distance measures.  During the course of the project, the PI organized workshops and led collaborations to bring together interdisciplinary groups that could bring both practical insight and theoretical background to bear on the problems; she also gave talks at a variety of seminars and conferences, disseminating the work to a range of communities that utilize such approaches.  The proposed work resulted in core theoretical developments which were published in a range of venues spanning both mathematics and theoretical computer science, as well initiating several more applied and experimental investigations with collaborators from domains that utilize these measures for clustering and comparison.  In addition to the PI's work, the project funded one postdoctoral scholar, several graduate students, and an undergraduate researcher, all of whom published and were able to present their results or attend workshops related to their work.  As part of the project, the PI conducted research to support and improve the culture and climate in computer science and mathematics.  She also participated in several initiatives to broaden and strengthen diversity in the field, including giving a presentation at the Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in computing and serving as a SafeTOC organizer, working to prevent and combat harassment in the Theory of Computing community.
