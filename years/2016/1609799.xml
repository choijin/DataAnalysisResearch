<AbstractNarration>Nontechnical Description: A major challenge in the use of organic electronic materials in important applications like flat panel displays and solar cells is that these materials often lack good ordering of their molecules. Such molecular disorder often results in compromised performance of many organics-based devices. This project addresses the impact of disorder that arises from very fast motion of the molecules in thin films of organic materials. The research team uses a powerful microscope capable of observing and analyzing the rapid motion of single molecules. By carrying out these experiments on a range of important organic electronic materials, the project provides device engineers with information about how to choose appropriate molecules to minimize negative effects of molecular motion on device performance. The project supports training of graduate students in many aspects of organic electronics and scientific leadership within the infrastructure of the interdisciplinary Organic and Carbon Electronics Lab. This infrastructure includes a materials fabrication facility operated primarily by undergraduate students.  It also includes educational initiatives such as the development of instructional software for understanding the principles of organic materials. Finally, the project also supports crystal growth competitions for grade and middle school students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Description: In the past decade, dynamic disorder has come to the forefront of understanding of the fundamental limitations of performance in organic electronics materials.  Fluctuations in position and geometry - mediated by phonons and intramolecular vibrations - can modulate electronic transfer integrals that control charge transport in these materials. This project applies tunneling current fluctuation spectroscopy in a variable temperature scanning tunneling microscope to observe dynamic disorder processes in real time with single molecule spatial resolution. By tuning sample temperature, the time scale of molecular fluctuations is controlled and eventually frozen out at low temperatures. By simultaneously adding local tunneling spectroscopy measurements, orbital specific dynamic effects are isolated.  The project focuses on the newest classes of small molecule organic electronic materials such as side-arm functionalized pentacenes and anthradithiophenes. In addition, it uses laser illumination of organic single crystals to allow routine variable temperature scanning tunneling microscopy studies of these important materials class benchmarks.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   1. Intellectual Merit  Organic electronic materials are used in state of the art cell phone displays and are increasingly promising in solar cell applications.  A key aspect of these materials is their structural disorder which may take the form of static imperfections but can also arise from dynamic fluctuations of molecular arrangements.  It is probable that dynamic disorder is the final frontier in device optimization since it can be present even in highly pure, single-crystal materials.   1a.  MItigating Dynamic Disorder at Interfaces  This project has studied dynamic disorder effects in organic electronic materials for the first time using time-resolved Scanning Tunneling Microscopy.  We tested a key theoretical prediction that dynamic and static disorder in fullerene materials can be of comparable size.  Figure 1 shows our observations fullerene-C60 molecules in a single layer film.  We developed measurement and analysis protocols to compare the single molecule conductance fluctuations over time with the point-to-point fluctuations in conductance across the molecular layer (Figure 1b and 1c). Contrary to theoretical predictsion, we observed that dynamic disorder was smaller than static disorder in terms of the width of the distribution of conductance values measured.  This difference was traced to the constraints on molecular motion imposed by the interface on which the layer is supported.  Simply put, the constraints hinder molecular motion and mitigate dynamic disorder.  This is a generic strategy for the future of organic materials that need mitigation of dynamic disorder effects   1b.  Dynamic Disorder due to Domain Boundary Fluctuations  The project also identified an unexpected source of dynamic disorder in organic films:  The thermal fluctuation of domain boundaries.  Domain boundaries are defects in otherwise perfect films where slightly differently-oriented small crystals join together during growth.  Figure 3 shows an example of several parallel domain boundaries in single layers of a molecule commonly known as "C8-BTBT".  This molecule has shown some of the most impressive performance in thin film transistors and understanding how it behaves in films is important to assessing future applications.  The boundaries seen in Figure 3a-c appear "fuzzy", due to fast motion imaged with a Scanning Tunneling Microscope.  We quantified the boundary motion by measuring the boundary position over time and computing the mean-squared displacement or MSD.  Figure 3d shows how the MSD of a boundary grows with time: first a linear increase followed by a nearly constant value.  This is the result of uncorrelated diffusion of molecules that are strongly confined in the small region between the two domains.  Numerical modeling supports this interpretation and we believe our results implicate domain boundary fluctuations as an important contributor to dynamic disorder effects in organic materials.   1c.  Influence of Top Contacts in Two Dimensional Organic Transistors While developing our work on C8-BTBT domain boundaries, we identified film structures with large crystalline domains that are promising for organic transistors.  This observation was part of a former undergraduate student's work funded by the project (see below) and quickly expanded to include several undergraduate students and the lead graduate student, Sara Pazoki.  Indeed, the team found that C8-BTBT films gave rise to good transistor performance with carrier mobilities in many cases above 1 cm2/Vs (Figure 3a).  Our major interest was to create 2D transistors out of one or a few molecular layers.  This would facilitate control of film structure and also open the possibility of using our idea of interfacial constraints to mitigate dynamics disorder.  However, we found that the 2D transistors had unexpectedly degraded carrier mobilities compared to thicker devices.  Our team collaborated with several other research groups in the ORganic and Carbon Electronics Lab at NC State to trace this degradation to the effect of top contact deposition on film morphology.  As shown in Figure 3b, for a 2 layer film, the deposition of top contacts results in a significant enhancement of roughness that impacts carrier mobility.  For thicker films (Figure 3b right), this enhancement is less severe.  Our observations show that 2D organic transistors, can perform well but will have unique device engineering challenges.   2.Broader Impacts   2a.   Organic Molecular Crystal Foundry  This project funded the personnel and materials to initiate an undergraduate-run crystal growth facility (Figure 4) that we call the Organic Molecular Crystal Foundry.  In the first project year, a student developed and calibrated growth protocols for a number of organic crystals (anthracene, perylene).  In later years, the facility was used to support collaborations and new instrument development including two photo photoemission measurements of tetracene single crystals.   2b.  Undergraduate Research  This project funded numerous undergraduate researchers.  Of particular note was Paulina Pechnikova (Figure 5).  Her work to create high quality films of C8-BTBT for transistors was recognized in 2019 with the McCormick award for best undergraduate research in the NC State Physics department.   She was the first of a group of several undergraduates funded by this project who contributed to the study.
