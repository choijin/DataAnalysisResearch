<AbstractNarration>Collaborative Research: THE MCMURDO DRY VALLEYS:  A Landscape on the Threshold of Change is supported by the Antarctic Integrated System Science (AISS) program in the Antarctic Sciences Section of the Division of Polar Programs within the Geosciences Directorate of the National Sciences Foundation (NSF).  The funds will support the collection of state-of-the-art high resolution LIDAR (combining the terms light and radar) imagery of the Dry Valleys of Antarctica in the 2014/2015 Antarctic field season, with LIDAR data collection and processing being provided by the NSF-supported NCALM (National Center for Airborne Laser Mapping) facility. LIDAR images collected in 2014/2015 will be compared to images from 2001 in order to detect decadal change. Additional fieldwork will look at the distribution of buried massive ice, and the impacts that major changes like slumping are having on the biota. All field data will be used to improve models on energy balance, and hydrology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:  There have been dramatic changes over the past decade in the McMurdo Dry Valleys: glaciers are deflating by tens of meters, rivers are incising by more than three meters, and thermokarst slumps are appearing near several streams and lakes. These observations have all been made by researchers in the field, but none of the changes have been mapped on a valley-wide scale. This award will provide a new baseline map for the entire Dry Valley system, with high-resolution imagery provided for the valley floors, and lower resolution imagery available for the higher elevation areas that are undergoing less change.  The project will test the idea that sediment-covered ice is associated with the most dramatic changes, due to differential impacts of the increased solar radiation on sediment-covered compared to clean ice, and despite the current trend of slightly cooling air temperatures within the Dry Valleys. Information collected on the topography, coupled with the GPR determined buried ice distributions, will also be incorporated into improved energy and hydrological models. In addition to providing the new high-resolution digital elevation model (DEM), the project will ultimately result in identification of areas that are susceptible to sediment-enhanced melt-driven change, providing a powerful prediction tool for the impacts of climate change.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:  The new DEM will be immediately useful to a wide range of disciplines, and will provide a comprehensive new baseline against which future changes will be compared. The project will provide a tool for the whole community to use, and the investigators will work with the community to make them aware of the new assets via public presentations, and perhaps via a workshop. The map will have international interest, and will also serve as a tool for environmental managers to draw on as they consider conservation plans.  Several undergraduate and graduate students will participate in the project, and one of the co-PIs is a new investigator. The imagery collected is expected to be of interest to the general public in addition to scientific researchers, and venues for outreach such as museum exhibits and the internet will be explored. The proposed work is synergistic with 1) the co-located McMurdo LTER program, and 2) the NCALM facility that is also funded by the Geosciences Directorate.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The McMurdo Dry Valleys are the largest ice-free region of Antarctica.&nbsp; The landscape is dominated by open soils, mountian, piedmont, and terminal glaciers, streams, and ice-covered lakes.&nbsp; The region is underlain by continuous permafrost, though the active layer, the soils that thaw each austral summer, is generally less than 50 cm deep. With no rainfall, this landscape has a fairly low erosion rate, and is therefore considered to be relatively stable.&nbsp; However, recent discoveries of permafrost degradation features, places where soil has been removed and exposed subsurface ice, or thaw has caused the ground to slump, suggest that the landscape is changing rapidly and suddenly.&nbsp; One of the goals of this project was to document the current status of the Dry Valleys landscape with high-resolution techniques to facilitate past and future change detection (i.e., how has the landscape changed since it was last mapped with the same approaches, and how will it change in the future). To achieve this, our group worked with the National Center for Airborne Laser Mapping (NCALM), which specializes in high-resolution mapping from airplanes.&nbsp; The result of this effort was a new high-resolution digital elevation model of the Dry Valleys region, avaialble through the Polar Geospatial Center and opentopography.org. Another set of goals was focused on the drivers of and feedbacks from permafrost thawing - on the ground. This part of the multi-institution project focused on collecting data from Crescent Stream, which had a significant permafrost degradation episode in 2012.&nbsp; Stream channels in the Dry Valleys receive mostly glacial melt (very little snowmelt), flowing for 6-12 weeks per year.&nbsp; The channels are deeply incised into the landscape, and generally much wider than expected for the typical flows that they experience. In the 2012 episode, stream banks were undercut, and substantial erosion of the channel occurred, with both deepening of parts of the channel and deposition of new sediment in other parts.&nbsp; We made field measurements of channel sediment size in Crescent Stream to determine if the permafrost degradation changed the make up of the streambed sediment.&nbsp; Our measurements indicate that the streambed downstream of the locations of permafrost thaw had more finer material than undisturbed parts of the streambed.&nbsp; We conclude that the addition of stream bank sediment substantially changes these streambeds, which may have negative impacts on the algal mats that inhabit the streambed, either through burial or scour.&nbsp; We also measured and ground temperatures along the banks of Crescent Stream to determine whether there was a substantial difference in the ground temperature dynamics outside of the channel, compared to inside of the channel, respectively.&nbsp; These measurements indicate that overall, the stream edges (at the bottom of the slopes of the banks) are indeed warmer, down to 20 cm into the soil, than halfway up the bank, or outside of the stream bank.&nbsp; This data corroborates the observations of the streambank undercutting that we observed in Crescent Stream in January 2012. Our conclusions from this project are that the McMurdo Dry Valleys landscape is poised for potential permafrost thaw, that stream banks are the most likely locations where this will occur, and that when this happens, streams receive inputs of fine sediments that will take years to flush out of their system.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 12/27/2017<br>      Modified by: Michael&nbsp;N&nbsp;Gooseff</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1601000/1601000_10272876_1514353393714_DSCN0728--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1601000/1601000_10272876_1514353393714_DSCN0728--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Downcutting of Crescent Stream channel."><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1601000/1601000_10272876_1514353393714_DSCN0728--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Downcutting of Crescent Stream channel."></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Downcutting of Crescent Stream channel, Taylor Valley Antarctica.
