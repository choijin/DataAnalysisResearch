<AbstractNarration>Funding from the National Science Foundation will support the 47th annual Linguistic Symposium on Romance Languages (LSRL 47), to be held at the University of Delaware (April 20-23, 2017). This long-standing conference is the largest international meeting of linguistics focused on the Romance languages. It  has consistently been at the forefront of linguistic research, introducing innovative methods to the study of this particular language family, and enriching our broader understanding of language and linguistics based on studies of these languages. A primary goal of LSRL 47 is thus to bring together linguists working on all aspects of Romance languages, and to foster interaction and potential collaboration among researchers investigating different languages, and using a range of methodologies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The capacity for language is unique to humans, and shared by speakers of all languages.  Understanding this capacity in its various aspects is at the core of all linguistic research. As different types of technologies have been rapidly developing in experimental, computational and neuro-biological sciences, the field of linguistics has also been rapidly evolving to embrace these technologies.  Thus, from a field focused primarily on the study of individual languages, linguistics has grown over the past 10-15 years into a much farther-reaching, interdisciplinary field. In addition to more traditional, theoretical approaches to the grammar of specific languages, linguistic research now addresses issues including the mental representation and processing of language, its acquisition by first and second language learners, and by those following typical and atypical developmental paths. The study of Romance languages offers an ideal opportunity to contribute not only to our understanding of linguistic theory by investigating a group of related well-known, as well as lesser known, languages, but also to efforts to document lesser-known languages and dialects, and to the development and application of exciting, innovative, research methodologies.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Overview  The 47th Annual Linguistic Symposium on Romance Languages (LSRL) was hosted at the University of Delaware in Spring 2017.  As in previous years, the Conference included paper presentations (in 2-3 concurrent sessions, based on topic) and 5 /keynote speakers.  Additionally, there were two Special Sessions, a new format for LSRL (topics: Second Language Acquisition of Romance Languages and a Cross-Linguistic Investigation of Romance Clitics), and two poster sessions, a format that has only recently been added to LSRL meetings.   Intellectual Merit  LSRL is long-standing, and well-recognized international linguistics conference.  It has over the years been a positive model of the bi-directional nature of linguistics research, where, on the one hand, advances in linguistic theory provide insight into specific languages, and on the other hand, investigations of the properties of individual languages lead to advances in the theory.   The LSRL 47 meeting held at the University of Delaware additionally offered a number of innovative aspects to the conference tradition, in the hope and anticipation of broadening its perspectives and contributions to the field. Drawing on recent trends in the field of linguistics, in the host department (i.e., Linguistics and Cognitive Science), and at the University of Delaware in general, LSRL 47 adopted the theme of "bridges" &ndash; bridging research approaches and directions across languages, departments and disciplines. In addition, a Special Sessions format was included to permit concentration in particular areas of interest, and additional ways of encouraging more student participation were introduced.  The innovative efforts of LSRL 47 were all successful, and combined with the basic conference structure and content, resulted in a well-attended, and highly successful conference.  The diversity of paper and poster topics attest to the success in reaching across various lines of research, including both interdisciplinary methods and studies of lesser known varieties and aspects of Romance languages. By way of illustration, the keynote addresses presented research on a) DNA evidence in understanding African influences in American varieties of Spanish, b) computational approaches to Romance linguistics and cross-linguistic studies, c) prosody and gesture in the development of Romance languages, d) studies of infant development of sensitivity to rhythmic patterns in Romance vs. other languages, and e) sociolinguistic approach to Spanish in the US, and its implications.  There was considerable student participation in all aspects of the conference - from organization, to presentations, to interactions with established researchers in the general field of Romance linguistics, providing both formal and informal opportunities for professional development. Participating students found the following efforts to be particularly helpful and encouraging: student travel awards, best abstract awards, funded invitations to dinners with well-known scholars, and the student networking-event.  Broader Impacts  The goal of bringing a broader perspective to the field of Romance linguistics, beyond the single LSRL 47 conference, has already had a positive result. The theme of "bridges" developed to include interdisciplinary research, as well as research on less known Romance varieties is reflected in the themes of the subsequent conferences.  LSRL 48 (held in Toronto, 2018). Theme: Points of Convergence in Romance Linguistics  "[The theme] aims to capture the fact that all the major areas of linguistics (e.g. morphology, syntax, semantics, phonology, sociolinguistics, first and second language acquisition) will be represented through research on different Romance languages."  LSRL 49 (to be held in Athens, GA 2019). Theme: Expanding Horizons in Romance Linguistics  "[Seeks in particular] contributions that use linguistic corpora or large datasets to deepen our understanding of Romance phenomena in all linguistic subfields. &hellip; LSRL 49 will feature a special pre-conference workshop on the use of corpora and "big data" in Romance linguistics, emphasizing and illustrating ways that digital resources and large corpora of annotated linguistic data can illuminate questions of theoretical and descriptive interest."  By broadening the scope of LSRL, and including researchers in other areas and disciplines, the impact of this yearly Conference now reaches well beyond the usual areas of theoretical linguistics, which typically focus on major Romance languages. In particular, LSRL 47 has already contributed to the development and fostering of research in newer and more diverse areas and disciplines, including the investigation and documentation of lesser known and endangered varieties of Romance languages, and fields such as psycholinguistics, neurolinguistics and computational linguistics.  The publication of selected papers in the long-standing and well-respected Romance Languages and Linguistic Theory series published by John Benjamins will ensure the broad distribution and impact of the research presented at LSRL 47.
