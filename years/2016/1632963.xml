<AbstractNarration>The movement of water through soil (seepage) can cause dams and levees to fail, which may be expensive to repair, cause extensive damage to infrastructure, and possibly the loss of life.  Traditional methods to reduce seepage can be cost-prohibitive and create environmental concerns.  Preliminary work has shown the feasibility of using biofilm-forming bacteria to reduce seepage.  Biofilm-forming bacteria secrete a sticky material that connects the bacteria together, attaches the bacteria to solid surfaces, and blocks the flow of water through the soil.  However, the reduction in seepage only occurred close to the bacteria's nutrient source and seepage further from the source (more than five centimeters) was not significantly reduced.  Uniform reduction of seepage across a distance of at least one meter will be needed if using bacteria to form biofilms is to be a feasible method to reduce seepage and the likelihood of the types of failures listed above.  This project will determine whether a quorum sensing inhibitor (a chemical that prevents bacteria from forming a biofilm) can be used to control the location and timing of biofilm formation so that the biofilm develops uniformly across the length of a one-meter column of sand. If successful, further research would look at the application of this methodology to field applications. In addition, this grant will support a partnership between Lafayette College (LC) and one of the National Science Foundation's Engineering Research Centers (ERCs)--the new Center for Bio-mediated &amp; Bio-inspired Geotechnics (CBBG).  The research partnership between faculty at LC (the project PIs) and the CBBG will create an exchange of information that will allow the PIs to develop their research programs in cooperation with the CBBG, and will introduce a minimum of six undergraduate students to this new interdisciplinary field of research.  Because of high percentages of women students at LC, this grant is anticipated to broaden research participation with respect to this underrepresented group.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will develop methods to create a uniform growth of bacterial biofilm in sand by using quorum sensing inhibitors and the manipulation of flow rates and nutrients. Initially, Pseudomonas fluorescens, a known biofilm former, will be introduced to columns containing sterile sand.  The manipulation of the concentration and timing of water containing nutrients and a quorum sensing inhibitor, Furanone 56--a halogenated compound known to inhibit biofilm formation, will be used to create a uniform distribution of bacterial biofilm in these soils.  Once a protocol is established for the development of a uniform biofilm distribution under these conditions, columns will be constructed using non-sterile sand.  Similar manipulation of the nutrient and quorum sensing inhibitor will be used to investigate whether the approach developed can stimulate native biofilm-forming bacteria to create a uniform distribution of biofilm.  A final testing setup will confirm that native bacterial biofilm can be uniformly distributed along a one-meter soil column.  Through a partnership between LC and the CBBG, this grant will also support innovative research by an interdisciplinary team of faculty at a strictly undergraduate institution and provide robust mentoring and research experiences for undergraduate students.  The research partnership between faculty at LC and the CBBG will create an exchange of information that will allow the faculty at LC to develop their research in cooperation with the CBBG and will introduce a minimum of six undergraduate students to this newly developing interdisciplinary field of research.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Reducing Permeability In Sand Using Biofilm-Forming Bacteria project had two areas of focus: (1) the use of biofilms to reduce permeability in soil and (2) the development of inexpensive equipment and procedures that can be used to increase the strength of soil samples using biostimulated microbially-induced calcite precipitation (MICP).  Biofilms to Reduce Soil Permeability  The use of engineered methods to reduce permeability in soils has many applications including improving the safety of dams and levees. The use of biofilms to reduce the permeability of soil has the potential to be both cost effective and environmentally friendly. Previous work by others showed that biofilms could effectively reduce permeability in soils but only over distances of a few centimeters -- a length that is too small for engineering applications. This project demonstrated that it was possible to effectively reduce permeability in soils over distances of approximately 15 centimeters but the investigators were unable to extend that distance to one meter -- a distance that would have significant engineering applications.  This focus area of the project resulted in increased knowledge of methods to create and control the development of biofilms in soils. These results were shared at a national conference and in a peer-reviewed publication.  Development of Equipment and Protocols Related to Biostimulated MICP  [Note: This focus area of the project was an approved change of scope that allowed the researchers to continue involving and mentoring undergraduate student researchers during the COVID-19 pandemic.   MICP is a method that can be used to increase the strength of soils and use of the MICP method has potential to decrease building failures that may occur during earthquakes as well as other applications. Early work in MICP research involved the need to introduce bacteria to soil. Recent research has shown that it is possible to use MICP without introducing bacteria into the soil and instead by stimulating the indigenous bacteria that already exist in the soil -- biostimulated MICP.   This focus area of the project resulted in the development of equipment and testing protocols that can be used to inexpensively treat soils with biostimulated MICP. Using the results of this work, the researchers piloted a course-based research experience that can be used in-person or in virtual education environments to teach undergraduate students and others about MICP. The results of this focus area of the project have been shared at a national conference and a publication resulting from this work is currently under review.  Supporting Undergraduate Research and Collaborations Between Faculty at Primarily Undergraduate Institutions and NSF-Funded Engineering Research Centers  The research completed for this project was done at an institution that has no graduate students and that is classified by NSF as a primarily undergraduate institution (PUI). The principal investigators (PIs) for the project are faculty members with expertise in biology and civil engineering and whose primary responsibility at their institution is teaching. In this project, the PIs conducted research with their undergraduate students in collaboration with researchers at the Center for Bio-mediated and Bio-inspired Geotechnics (CBBG), an NSF-funded engineering research center (ERC).  Using a supplementary grant, the PIs also supported 18 faculty members from 11 PUI institutions so that they could attend a CBBG mid-year meeting and explore possible collaboration opportunities. As a result of that initiative, faculty members from four of the 11 PUI institutions developed proposals to conduct research in biogeotechnics in collaboration with CBBG researchers.  As a result of the collaboration with the CBBG, the PIs furthered their research programs and, in addition to the biofilm expertise they brought to the project, they developed expertise in MICP. Seventeen undergraduate students worked with the PIs on this project and, through the support of this grant, six of these students spent a summer conducting biogeotechnical research at the University of California, Davis, a CBBG institution. The students were engineering and biology majors and included 14 female students and three students of color. Of the 15 students that have graduated (two students are still undergraduates), six have now pursued graduate degrees.  In the final year of the project and when instruction at the PIs' institution was fully remote, the PIs used the MICP equipment and treatment protocols that were developed to support course-based research on MICP and involved in the project 59 undergraduate students who were enrolled either in an introduction to geotechnical engineering course or a microbiology course. This course-based research also included seven 8th grade students who worked under the direction of their science teacher -- a CBBG-funded teacher who worked with the PIs during summer 2020 in the development of the protocols.
