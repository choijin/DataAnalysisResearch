<AbstractNarration>This Rapid Response Research (RAPID) Grant project will explore the impact of normative and cultural-cognitive perturbations on water and sanitation utilities caused by sudden and large population influxes. Water and wastewater infrastructures are necessary for the continued functioning of urban environments. Large and sudden population influxes must be accommodated by this infrastructure in order to avoid secondary public health disasters for impacted populations. This research will create knowledge with implications for utilities that find themselves serving transient, sometimes large populations (particularly those which arise suddenly). This knowledge will enable more resilient planning, policy, and technical design that can accommodate potential disaster migration and other extreme population growth as required.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will identify and explore changes in the organizational structure and processes of utilities in response to the European refugee influx, which has triggered an unprecedented flow of refugees to various European nations. This situation provides a unique opportunity to capture perishable data on the institutional impacts that sudden, disaster-triggered population increases may have on established water and sanitation utilities. This work will yield new insights into how normative and cultural/cognitive forces can influence the shape and function of public utilities. Data on both human and technological aspects of these phenomena will be collected, to include interviews, observations and visual documentation, to include decision makers in the water and sanitation utilities in the German cities of Munich, Berlin, and Leipzig. Even under normal conditions, data on these phenomena can be difficult to obtain. As such, immediate and focused efforts are needed to collect the organizational data for this study, and to situate these data within a holistic socio-technical context.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In recent years, European nations have received millions of refugees and asylum seekers--and as can be expect, displaced persons require infrastructure services.  For example, without the water and sanitation infrastructure services of interest to this research, there is the potential for disease epidemics stemming from untreated wastewater and contaminated drinking water.    In response to this situation, we studied the impacts of this sudden, large, and unexpected population increase on water and sanitation infrastructure.  More generally, for the built environment, large-scale post-disaster population movement is a secondary disaster impact that challenges utilities' ability to provide infrastructure services (or, challenges utility resilience), even when the utilities were not physically damaged by the disaster event.   We interviewed with people professionally involved with providing housing and infrastructure to displaced persons in in Germany, Sweden, and Lebanon.  To explore the public's perception of the impacts of disaster displaced persons on utilities, we also issued a survey to a representative sample of the Germany public.  Finally, we surveyed US water and sanitation utilities to discover and document anticipated challenges of extreme population movement in the US context.   In selected results, we find that centralized housing for refugees and asylum seekers is likely to generate different water use patterns than those typically used in hydraulic design, and culture plays a role in how services are used in these facilities.  Also, post-disaster construction workforce challenges are likely.  In addition, we show how and why technical workers improvise to make pre-existing regulatory requirements and design standards work in an extreme situation they were not intended for.  Normative forces of perceived right and wrong--or, the urgent need to provide water and sanitation services to the displaced persons -- motivated technical and regulatory improvisations.   For the public, providing water and sanitation to the displaced population is perceived as an issue of human rights, and the majority of respondents expect services to be provided for multiple years, even if the displaced persons cannot pay.  Practical outcomes from this study include empirically grounded recommendations for public communications and recommendations for establishing technical regulations and design standards that can handle extreme population change.  Three female PhD students, one male PhD student,  and seven female undergraduate researchers participated on this grant. To date, this work has resulted in 6 manuscripts (with an additional 3 under review or in-revision, and 6 planned/in-preparation), 10 peer-reviewed conference proceedings, and 1 extended abstract.
