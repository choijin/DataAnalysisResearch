<AbstractNarration>This I-Corps project team's technology is a genomics analysis platform, Globus Genomics, that can: electronically move large genomic data sets, allow researchers to define custom analytical workflows using a graphical user interface, execute their workflows on genomic data sets at scale, and generate valuable research results which help advance the understanding of the genetic basis of complex diseases. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Genetic and genomic analysis is growing exponentially as part of the rapidly evolving frontier of precision medicine. Researchers and clinicians alike are turning to genomics to help guide diagnosis, drug discovery, and treatment in order to combat a variety of diseases in a much more targeted and effective manner. Time-to-diagnosis and time-to-treatment place a premium on removing end-to-end bottlenecks. Given the increasing scale (and costs) of analysis - performance optimization must also be combined with cost optimization. And, with a rapidly evolving state-of-the-art in terms of algorithms, applications and technologies, critical expertise must be assembled to deliver highly advanced, well integrated, and easy-to-use solutions. Current approaches have proven to be too rigid, slow, complex and costly. They require substantial investments of time, money and hard to find expertise, that goes well beyond the capabilities of many clinical organizations. This I-Corps team seeks to provide a flexible, scalable and optimized genomics analysis solution in order to meet these critical requirements for diagnostic labs in hospital settings, genetic testing service providers, translational medicine institutes and pharmaceutical R&amp;D groups. With this type of platform in place, health delivery organizations can provide more targeted, timely and effective treatment to their patients suffering from a broad range of heritable diseases and disorders. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the proposed project efforts include getting a much more in-depth understanding of the prioritized areas of needs and detailed customer requirements. This will be largely driven by breadth and depth of customer interviews along with an evolving formulation of the team's business model and product design. With this understanding, the team will embark on an iterative development effort to gain rapid customer feedback and work towards the definition of a minimum viable product. The team plans to work closely with both health care organizations and genetic testing companies in the discovery and initial deployment stages. The potential contribution of the proposed platform will include: much more rapid genomic analysis capabilities, improved time-to-diagnosis and time-to-treatment in a clinical setting, and an intuitive user experience to allow diagnosticians and clinical practitioners to focus on patient care instead of software complexities and localized computer hardware limitations.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Navipoint Genomics team participated in the National NSF I-Corps program.  The goals for the team included:  gaining a deeper understanding of genomic data analysis requirements for various segments of users in the clinical setting, identifying key pain points experienced by prospective customers, determining the potential for value delivery utilizing Navipoint technology, and gauging overall commercial potential.  The Navipoint team completed extensive customer discovery throughout the duration of the I-Corps program.  This included interviews with customer prospects, various complementary technology providers, thought leaders in the field of precision medicine, and other potential channel partners.   We arrived at several findings based on our discovery efforts and analysis.  There are several customer segments that can greatly benefit from quality improvements and acceleration of genomic data analysis.  Chief amongst those are genetic testing labs and molecular diagnostic labs.  Some of the most significant challenges for these groups include:  meeting growth in volume of analysis which is outpacing current state approaches, addressing turn-around-time metrics, improving the clinical efficacy of results, and ensuring continued innovation through timely design and validation of new genetic tests.  Some of the benefits in meeting these challenges include:  extending access to powerful analysis capabilities for groups that do not have adequate computational resources and analysis applications in place, improving time-to-results for genetic testing, improving quality of results, and providing a cost effective means to handle the rapidly growing volume of genomics analysis.  The ultimate goal is to better utilize genomics sequencing and analysis as a key enabler to fulfilling the promise of precision medicine and improving diagnosis, prevention and treatment of complex diseases and disorders.  Participation in the NSF I-Corps program enabled the Navipoint Genomics team to understand market needs and shape our product directions to help in addressing these broader goals.
