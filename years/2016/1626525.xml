<AbstractNarration>Cutting-edge research at Alabama State University (ASU) is focused on developing materials and structures that can aid in the regeneration of bone tissue, liver replacements, and dental tissue.  These materials are known as scaffolds.  The proposed 3-D bioprinter will enable researchers to build these scaffolds in a very precise manner.  The 3-D printer will be used to support research and educate students in K-12, undergraduate and graduate school, including students in underrepresented groups.  It will benefit scientists and students at ASU in Biomedical Engineering, Biology and Chemistry as well as other scientists across the state.  Faculty members, post-doctoral researchers and graduate students will utilize the printer in their research.  The printer will also be used by approximately 25 undergraduate students involved in current projects at ASU (e.g, the NSF Research Experiences for Undergraduates site (REU) and the Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (LSAMP)), as well as the ASU Science and Technology Honors Program, and in Senior Design projects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project proposes the acquisition of a multimaterial bioplotter to create a multiuser tissue scaffold fabrication facility affiliated with the Alabama State University, ASU, College of Science, Math and Technology and the Center for NanoBiotechnology.  The facility will support a number of multidisciplinary research and education activities involving investigators from Biomedical Engineering, Biology, Chemistry and Physics.  Cutting-edge research at ASU is focused on nano and microstructured, compositionally-graded, multiphase polymeric scaffolds for bone tissue, 3-D porous scaffolds for liver replacement, and dental tissue applications.  Progress in the understanding of fundamental aspects of the, processing, structure and function of these materials is contingent upon the ability to precisely fabricate 3-dimensional scaffolds that more closely mimic the extracellular matrix. This state-of-the-art bioplotter will be integral to research support and also to the education of students in K-12, undergraduate school, and graduate school, including students in underrepresented groups. The requested instrument will support a number of funded NSF projects, and is necessary to continue at ASU the work in the fundamental understanding of the fabrication, structure and function issues for a variety of 3-dimensional biomaterials.  At least 3 graduate and undergraduate courses in Biomedical Engineering and Biology will use the instrument.  Additionally, approximately 20 faculty, post-docs and graduate students will utilize the instrument.  Approximately 25 undergraduate students will utilize this instrument through funded research projects, the NSF Research Experiences for Undergraduates site, Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation, LSAMP, ASU Science and Technology Honors Program, and in Senior Design. The acquisition of this instrument will enhance demonstrations to be offered in K-12 outreach programs, including ASU STEM Academy.</AbstractNarration>
