<AbstractNarration>With Advanced LIGO's recent direct observation of gravitational waves, the current era of advanced gravitational wave interferometers is the most exciting period in the history of gravitational wave astrophysics. Efforts in detector characterization such as those undertaken in this project and multi-messenger astronomy will enhance LIGO science and its ties to the rest of the astronomical community while providing many opportunities for student engagement.  Researchers supported by this grant are involving students at various levels of education, from elementary class visits, to high school research internships, to the first physics PhD candidate on Embry-Riddle's Prescott campus.  Undergraduate research remains a particular focus at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, and multiple senior theses and other undergraduate projects will benefit from NSF financial support.  Embry-Riddle's LIGO group continues to increase its outreach efforts, taking advantage of opportunities in northern Arizona, including close proximity to the Navajo reservation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Identification of a gravitational wave transient consistent with the time and location of an electromagnetic (e.g. optical or radio) signal will provide a wealth of information about the source that would not be available through means of a single astrophysical messenger.  Core Collapse Supernovae are an exciting target for this multi-messenger astronomy approach.  The combination of a gravitational wave and optical observation from the same supernova would address a number of open questions in astrophysics, including the mechanism of the explosion itself as well as fundamental questions about neutrino interactions and the neutron star equation of state.  Another area of multi-messenger astronomy that LIGO has begun to investigate is the search for gravitational waves in coincidence with astrophysical sources of radio transients of duration on the scale of milliseconds. These could be emitted simultaneously with gravitational waves due to scenarios ranging from neutron star asteroseismology to cosmic string cusps.  Gravitational wave astronomy has the potential to shed light on several types of radio emission, possibly including fast radio bursts. The search for gravitational wave bursts is made more difficult by the presence of transient terrestrial background, resulting from a combination of environmental disturbances and behavior of the interferometers themselves.  Understanding these environmental disturbances and removing them from interferometric data is critical in conducting sensitive searches for gravitational waves.  This grant funds substantial effort in identifying and mitigating the non-astrophysical background in the interferometers and application of vetoes to eliminate them through participation in LIGO's detector characterization working group.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ With the observation of several gravitational waves in the last two years, humankind has gained the ability to "hear" the universe in an entirely new way.  Multi-messenger astronomy in LIGO is the attempt to combine hearing the universe with seeing it through some other means.  Core-collapse supernova are a particularly promising candidate as a means of hearing an entirely different type of astrophysical source than the compact binary coalescences that have been detected so far.  In addition to publishing the first targeted search for gravitational waves from core-collapse supernova, the LIGO-Virgo Supernova working group made substantial progress over the past year in incorporating developments in astrophysics and supernova theory in order to improve methods for supernova-coincident gravitational wave searches, with major contributions coming from Embry-Riddle LIGO team members.    Efforts in detector characterization can improve the sensitivity of LIGO searches by fixing problems that are interfering with the quality of the interferometric data or, when that isn?t possible, choosing not to analyze short periods of data when a glitch or other problem is known to be occurring.  This grant supported work in enhancing gravitational-wave search sensitivity within LIGO/Virgo?s burst data analysis working group by developing and applying a set of vetoes that eliminates the worst data while still using the vast majority of the data collected by Advanced LIGO.  This grant also supported work maintaining and developing software that allows us to visualize the outputs of hundreds of LIGO auxiliary sensors, letting scientists quickly see what?s going on with the interferometer and its surroundings.    Embry-Riddle remains strongly committed to providing meaningful research experiences for its students, and a large part of this grant was used to directly fund student research and research-related travel.  Students supported by this grant also engaged in outreach efforts including presentations at several high schools in the Navajo reservation north of Prescott        Last Modified: 11/21/2017       Submitted by: Brennan J Hughey]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
