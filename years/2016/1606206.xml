<AbstractNarration>PI Name: Nitin Baliga&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: 1606206&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Microscopic algae are a promising future platform for the sustainable production of biofuels.  These organisms use sunlight, atmospheric carbon dioxide, and nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorous dissolved in liquid medium to make lipids which can be processed into liquid transportation fuel.   Most algal biofuel processes require two stages.  In the first stage, the algae consume nutrients and grow.  In the second stage, the lipids used to make biofuel accumulate within the biomass, but only when all the nutrients are consumed so that the biomass does not grow any more.  In order to improve the economic viability of algae-based biofuels, it is necessary to develop strains of algae that can generate lipids for biofuel while producing more biomass that sustains the process. The goal of this project is re-program the gene networks in a model strain of algae named Chlamydomonas reinhardtii to enhance both biofuel and biomass production at the same time.  The research will attempt to make the systems biology platform more generic that it can be extended to other organisms.  The educational activities associated with the project will develop high school curricular materials for renewable green biotechnology topics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A critical challenge with algal biofuel production is that nutrient starvation is required to induce lipid accumulation.  The proposed research will develop a systems biology strategy to predictably manipulate regulatory and metabolic networks using the model photosynthetic green microalga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii in an effort to significantly enhance lipid accumulation without growth arrest.  A predictive Environment and Gene Regulatory Influence Network (EGRIN) model will be developed to rationally identify gene targets for systems level re-engineering. The EGRIN model will be built upon a compendium of transcriptomes from cultures of C. reinhardtii grown in a diverse set of nutritional and environmental conditions.  Accuracy of the EGRIN model will be improved by incorporating experimentally mapped open chromatin structure. Further, the EGRIN model will be integrated with a metabolic network model to identify gene targets for engineering.  Finally, model-guided genome engineering of algae using CRISPR/Cas9 technology will be used to enhance biomass or lipid production.  The proposed research will generate a fundamental, model-guided strategy for predictably manipulating regulatory and metabolic networks in algae through a generalized approach which can be customized to perform similar strain engineering objectives other organisms.</AbstractNarration>

The module, called <em>Bioengineering a Sustainable World</em> has been completed and is available to be taught in classrooms through our Systems Education Experiences (SEE) program (https://see.systemsbiology.net/modules/). Together, scientists, teachers, and students worked to create a four-lesson module that teaches students the importance of systems thinking and how the carbon cycle is impacted by human activities. In the curriculum, students are taught to explore green biotechnology case studies and challenged to engineer their own solutions to non-sustainable practices. The curriculum's four lessons; Carbon Footprints, Bioengineering and Sustainability, Gene Regulatory Networks and Effect on Environment, and Solutions in Sustainability are all centered around green biotechnology. Each lesson has been developed with alignment to the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) and accommodates the NGSS's three-dimensional learning framework. Compiled within each lesson is an explanation of the lesson's performance expectations. This was done using the EQuIP (Educators Evaluating the Quality of Instructional Products) rubric, which is used to evaluate how the lessons are designed. Students who are taught the curriculum can expect to learn how science and biotechnology can be applied to address the oncoming challenges of the 21st century. If implemented broadly, the <em>Bioengineering a Sustainable World</em> module should have an impact on increasing student understanding and scientific literacy, in the areas of systems thinking, sustainability, and biotechnology.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 05/29/2020<br>      Modified by: Nitin&nbsp;Baliga</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1606206/1606206_10424863_1590788581372_Support_File_1_2020_Final_Outcomes--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1606206/1606206_10424863_1590788581372_Support_File_1_2020_Final_Outcomes--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Nutrient starvation and resupplementation experiments"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1606206/1606206_10424863_1590788581372_Support_File_1_2020_Final_Outcomes--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Nutrient starvation and resupplementation experiments"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">A) Growth dynamics during 3 independent nutrient starvation experiments.
