<AbstractNarration>The goal of this project is to understand the role that function plays in traditional weaponry design. It will investigate the evolution of Ice Age stone tool weaponry, dated to13,500 to 12,500 years, used by hunter-gatherers in the colonization of North America. The weapons, stone point tips attached to spears and called "Clovis points" by archaeologists, were flintknapped into specimens with parallel to slightly convex sides, a concave base, and flake-removal scars' termed "flutes." These flutes occur on one or both faces and on average extend from the base to about a third of the way to the tip. These points are found across North America, having spread widely and rapidly at an unprecedented rate. During this expansion over space, across time, and in different environments the size and shape of Clovis points changed significantly. Archaeologists know that cultural drift contributed to this variation, but is it possible that this single source could alone generate so much variation so quickly? Or are multiple sources, for example cultural drift + functional changes, necessary to so rapidly give rise to such variety? If functional differences are found among different forms of Clovis points, it follows that Clovis people in different times and places may have chosen specific attributes to provide them with a selective functional advantage. The project will contribute to the overall understanding of how and why weapons evolve among small, mobile, isolated groups of humans; a fundamental anthropological question of broad archaeological and ethnographic relevance, as well as to many situations in the present day. Furthermore, since the peopling of the Americas was part of the broader late Pleistocene global dispersal of human out of Africa, this project will ultimately advance the understanding of the behavioral and technological adaptations that determined how our species came to so successfully colonize the planet. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigators will examine whether different sizes and shapes of Clovis points possess any functional advantages or disadvantages. Through a series of realistic hunting-related experiments in conjunction with a series of controlled engineering experiments, the researchers will determine the prey penetration-ability, aerodynamics, durability, fracture mechanics, and cutting-efficiency of replica Clovis points of varying forms.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The collaborative project <em>Understanding the role of function on Late Pleistocene forager weaponry design</em> assessed the role of function in the design of Clovis points using high internally-valid and high externally-valid sets of experiments that brings together the disciplines of archaeology and engineering. Clovis is the earliest well-defined archaeological complex in North America dating to ca. 13,350 to 12,500 calBP. It is well-known that Clovis points found in different regions of the continent differ in size and shape, however the degree to which selection for functional characteristics is the reason for those differences is unknown. Our experiments provide a rigorous test of the function hypothesis. We had exact Clovis replica ground stone points made and hafted and used them in ballistics experiments. The Clovis replicas used in the experiments were modeled from specimens found at the Simon cache in Idaho, the Anzick cache in Montana, the Rummells-Maske cache in Iowa, the Shoop site in Pennsylvania, the Vail site in Maine, and the Bull Brook site in Massachusetts. The Clovis replica sample represents the extremes of Clovis point form variation and encompasses considerable geographic variation. The first experiment verified the use of tip cross-sectional perimeter as a strong predictor of stone projectile penetration depth. This experiment resolved a long-standing issue concerning the use of tip cross section as a predictor of penetration depth. The second ballistics experiment compared penetration depths of the seven Clovis replica points. Our analyses demonstrated that for a constant input energy and the range of velocities observed, larger points from Clovis caches, including Simon, Rummells-Maske, and Anzick, exhibited shallower penetration depths, while the smaller points from the Shoop site penetrated much deeper. Overall, points from the east, including points from Shoop, Bull Brook, and Vail, have deeper penetration depths when compared with points from the west. This is a consequence of eastern Clovis points being on average smaller than western Clovis points. The results of our Bayesian statistical analysis demonstrated that the different Clovis point forms penetrated the same target with different effectiveness. Even after tip cross-sectional perimeter was accounted for, there were significant differences in penetration depths between two of the point types. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that Clovis people in different times and places may have chosen (intentionally or unintentionally) specific attributes, both tip cross-sectional perimeters and outline shape, to provide them with a selective functional advantage. Additional experiments are on-going and are investigating different Clovis point forms to assess differences in robustness (ability to withstand damage), cutting efficiency, and projectile target accuracy.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 09/26/2020<br>      Modified by: Briggs&nbsp;Buchanan</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
