<AbstractNarration>This research project focuses on stability and behavior of special classes of solutions of mathematical equations modeling a variety of physical phenomena including optical communication, shallow or stratified fluid flow, and inclined thin film flow.  Emphasis is placed on the stability of nonlinear waves exhibiting a spatially periodic structure, which form fundamental building blocks for more complicated solutions in many applications.  The stability of such structures (i.e. their ability to retain their form when disturbed) is of great practical importance, as waves that are not stable do not naturally manifest themselves in physical applications, except possibly for transient phenomena.  The aim of this project is to provide researchers a mathematically rigorous theory by which they may distinguish between mathematical solutions that are stable, and hence have a possibility of being manifested in reality, and those that are not.  This project will also include undergraduate and graduate students in research projects.  The methodologies and techniques developed through this work will be incorporated into seminars, reading courses, and special topics courses appropriate for students from a variety of scientific disciplines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project focuses on the existence, stability, and dynamics of special classes of traveling wave solutions in models arising naturally in mathematical physics and fluid mechanics.  The aim is to systematically develop a linear and nonlinear stability analysis of spatially periodic standing or traveling structures in both Hamiltonian dispersive partial differential equations, in which energy is conserved, as well as hyperbolic-parabolic systems of conservation and balance laws, where energy is partially dissipated due to, for example, viscous effects.  In the dispersive context, the research project will consider a variety of model equations with nonlocal descriptions of dispersion and will develop techniques and methodologies capable of treating not only low-frequency phenomena, which is in the realm of many classical theories, but also high-frequency behaviors of solutions, which are beyond the regime of validity of classical results.  In the dissipative context, the research project will develop a systematic investigation of roll-waves, which are commonly-observed hydrodynamic instabilities arising naturally in many applications, such as fluid flow in conduits.  Particular attention will be placed on understanding connections between the recently-developed viscous theories of such waves and more well-known inviscid theories.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ A fundamental strategy in the mathematical study of many real-world phenomena is to try to identify coherent structures that typify the long-time behavior of the system.  In many applications, including hydrodynamics, optical signal propagation, and plasma physics where such long-time behavior is dominated by structures which are spatially periodic.  However, the capability of periodic structures to carry modulation signals, i.e. to allow their own fundamental wave characteristics to slowly vary over time, makes their behavior under perturbations rich in multi-scale phenomena and essentially infinite dimensional.  The primary goal of this project was to develop methodologies and techniques to rigorously study and make predictions about such slowly modulated periodic structures.  This project met this goal by producing several knew methodologies for analyzing slow modulations of periodic waves in a variety of physical contexts, the predictions of which can then be tested against experiment.  Further, another goal of this project was to develop tools and methodologies to be able to study mathematical aspects of the dynamics of surface water waves without resorting to the full fluid dynamic equations.  In particular, there has recently been a surge in the development of smaller, approximate models for water waves which incorporate both low-frequency and high-frequency phenomena (note classical approximate models incorporate only low-frequency phenomena).  In this project, the PI and collaborators developed and applied several methodologies for studying these more complicated approximate models for water waves, for which classical techniques are known to fail.  The tools and techniques developed as a result of the funding of this project have been applied to numerous applications including the study of buoyancy driven fluid flow (think magma rising through deformable pipes of molten rock), the understanding of patterns forming (on the nanoscale) on a flat surface subjected to  a broad ion beam, the study of high-frequency and resonant water wave phenomena, the study of periodic optical frequency combs, and the study of periodic roll waves (a well observed hydrodynamic instability occurring when water flows down a rough inclined ramp).    The results and methodologies developed in this project have been incorporated to the training of graduate students and early career researchers.  They have also driven new interdisciplinary collaborations which the PI is confident will continue to lead to new and fruitful studies.
