<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this project include 1) the targeted problem (power system state estimator) is extremely critical in modern power grids or smart grids which may help prevent system-wide failures or blackouts if properly handled, 2) the certainty of commercialization of the proposed approach warranting significant NSF support because the provided solution is fast enough for real-time application and the new state estimator does not ask for additional inputs or requirements compared with existing solutions, 3) the research team is formed by technical as well as marketing personnel which ensures the success of the sales of the products, 4) the uniqueness of the proposed approach which provides competitive benefits to the market that cannot be met by alternate technologies and can attract further funding from non-SBIR sources and result in direct sales to power industry, 5) the proposed approach develops a unique formulation/solution of state estimation which very possibly leads to further innovations, 6) the new procedure of the proposed approach based on unique formulation and unique philosophy can promote teaching, training and learning in the area of state estimation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project contains intellectual merit that lies in 1) achieving a fast and robust solution to a 40-years' open problem of robustness in power system state estimation, which is a critical and challenging problem, 2) developing a unique formulation of state estimation which easily prevents robust problems suffered by the existing approaches to state estimation and which provides advanced knowledge and understanding in the area of state estimation, 3) a well-qualified team led by the PI who has research experience in state estimation for more than 15 years and has published actively and widely in state estimation and other related areas, 4) the high originality of the proposed solution which is developed based on a completely different philosophy than the existing ones, and is innovative even in the theory of statistics, 5) reflecting state-of-the-art in the area of power system state estimation ? presently a major research activity, and 6) easy integration of synchronized phasor measurements into the proposed state estimator.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project has developed a novel robust product - Non-Divergent State Estimator (NDSE) for daily power grid operations. This product has solved the problem of divergence and bad data contamination which is open for more than 50 years in power system state estimation. This new product is based on a revolutionary formulation of state estimation and its solution completely depends on the given set of measurements.  In March 2020, North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) published a survey about the reasons of the loss of Energy Management System (EMS) system, a system of computer-aided tools used by system operators to monitor, control, and optimize the performance of generation and/or transmission systems. The survey shows that 45% of loss of EMS is caused by the divergence of state estimator.  NDSE is an ideal offline supplement tool for power companies who are willing to improve the levels of robustness and data accuracy of daily operations.  The Unique Features of Non-Divergent State Estimator (NDSE):  1) Insensitive to Topology errors, Parameter errors, and Measurement errors.  2) Capable of accurately recovering the Ture values of bad data.  3) Leverage Point Does Not exist for NDSE.  4) 100% convergence once the system is solvable.  5) National and regional blackouts due to the weakness of today's state estimators will be avoided if NDSE is utilized as a backup tool.  6) The cutting-edge technology can be used in power transmission network state estimator, power distribution network state estimator, linear state estimator, as well as dynamic state estimator.  Non-Divergent State Estimator will largely improve the accuracy of Energy Management System (EMS) by providing more accurate solution thanks to its strong capability of bad data rejection and accurately recovering the true values of bad data. In addition, the accuracy of power system real-time market price calculation will be largely improved due to the accurate solution of NDSE.  This Project Outcomes Report for the General Public is displayed verbatim as submitted by the Principal Investigator (PI) for this award.
