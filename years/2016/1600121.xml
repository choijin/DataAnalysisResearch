<AbstractNarration>This award provides funding for the  "Midwest Several Complex Variables Conference,"  to be held at the University of Toledo  from May 13 to May 15, 2016.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference focuses on recent developments in Analysis, especially in the fields of several complex variables, Cauchy-Riemann geometry, d-bar theory, and other related topics.  A number of distinguished mathematicians have agreed to attend and speak at this conference. The award gives early career researchers, researchers who are members of underrepresented groups, researchers not funded by NSF a chance to attend and participate in this conference.  The organizing committee will strive to make this funding opportunity known to target groups through a number of different activities.
