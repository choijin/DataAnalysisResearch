<AbstractNarration>Murray State University (MSU) will implement an ADVANCE Institutional Transformation-Catalyst (IT-Catalyst) project to undertake institutional self-assessment activities.  MSU will conduct surveys of faculty and interviews, review existing institutional data and policies, conduct site-visits to ADVANCE institutions, invite speakers to campus to inform and educate the administration and faculty, and conduct mentoring circles to support junior STEM faculty.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MSU provides a unique opportunity to examine the recruitment, retention and promotion of women faculty in STEM disciplines at a regional comprehensive and primarily undergraduate public university in rural western Kentucky. MSU serves a region that has been historically underserved in STEM education and has been challenged to recruit and retain female faculty and students in STEM.  The Murray State University project will add to our understanding of the factors that impact women in a rural academic environment.  This project may serve as a model for other rural regional universities where women faculty are commonly underrepresented in STEM. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ADVANCE program is focused on developing systemic approaches to increase the participation, retention, and advancement of women in academic STEM careers.  The IT-Catalyst track funds projects to conduct institutional self-assessments as well as implement strategies that have been shown to be effective to address gendered issues for STEM faculty.</AbstractNarration>
