<AbstractNarration>Long-term, unattended operation of oceanographic instrumentation is dependent on the availability of power to operate the instruments. The PIs will investigate new wave power conversion technologies for use in operating oceanographic instrumentation at sea. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Current wave energy conversion technologies make wave power bulky and uneconomical for oceanographic and ocean science applications. The PIs request funding to investigate enhancements that may enable integration of wave power conversion hardware into small oceanographic buoys. The proposed effort represents a significant advance over current wave energy conversion approaches and is expected to be an important step towards making wave power utilization cost-effective for ocean sensing applications.</AbstractNarration>

The goal of this project is to develop PTO control strategies that have the potential to eliminate the need for wave prediction, and yet harvest maximum power from ocean waves.  Intellectual Merit  This project developed a control for small two-body heaving wave energy converters for ocean measurement applications. A two-body wave energy converter is designed such that the buoy heaves to harvest energy while the second (lower) body carries the science equipments. This control approach is a multi resonant control that attempts to maximize the harvested energy from the buoy (upper body). In this model, the actuator is attached to both bodies. The lower body however is required to have minimal heave motion. The proposed multi resonant control utilizes measurements of the buoy position. This approach is a feedback approach that does not require wave prediction. Rather the spectral decomposition of the buoy motion amplitude at different frequencies is estimated. A new method for handling the motion and actuation limitations, suitable for the multi resonant control, is proposed. Various numerical simulation results are presented.   One of the challenges in control design is the relative complexity of the model. This project developed a simple model control (SMC). The forces on the WEC are modeled as one total force, and hence there is no need to compute excitation or radiation forces. A control law was developed, within the context of optimal control theory, for a heaving wave energy converter (WEC) that can be applied to bot linear and nonlinear WEC systems. The proposed control assumes the availability of measurements of only the pressure distribution on the buoy surface, buoy position, and buoy velocity, at current time. No wave prediction is needed.  Several control methods were investigated in this project via numerical simulation. The simulation is conducted using a numerical simulator that is developed in thi sproject to simulate a hydraulic PTO, including all the constraints on the maximum attainable control force and maximum stroke.   The possibility of using neaby wave rider measurements to predict the wave surface elevation at the WEC location was investigated in this project using artificial neural networks.     Broader Impact  The proposed methods have the potential of enabling the use of wave power for oceanographic buoys. This project trained one PhD student on developing control algorithms for wave energy converters.       Last Modified: 12/14/2018       Submitted by: Ossama O Abdelkhalik]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
