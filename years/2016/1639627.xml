<AbstractNarration>The workshop on Uncertainty in Computation will be held at the Simons Institute for the Theory of Computing from October 4 to October 7, 2016. The workshop is part of a program on Logical Structures in Computation that will take place from August 14 to December 16, 2016. The underlying theme of the workshop is to explore the viewpoints of the fields of logic, analysis of algorithms, and computational complexity on uncertainty in computation. The broader significance and importance of the workshop is that it will enhance communication between the mathematical logic community and the community of algorithms researchers within computing science. The workshop will encourage students to attend, and the organizers will actively recruit scientists from a diversity of backgrounds.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[Report on the "Uncertainty in Computation" workshop Simons Institute for the Theory of Computing, Oct 4&ndash;7, 2016 Prakash Panangaden, Daniel Roy, Dan Suciu and Eli Upfal (Organizers)  Uncertainty pervades our every interaction with the physical world and with all our attempts to organize our data and understanding. Probability is the best tool we have for managing uncertainty. This workshop brought together researchers for whom probabilistic reasoning is an essential aspect of their research. This workshop addressed three major themes: (i) logic and probability, (ii) probabilistic databases and statistical relational models, and (iii) machine learning. The first theme is both foundational, as the quote from Laplace suggests, and practical. There is substantial interest in automated tools for verifying probabilistic systems using probabilistic modal logics. The second theme is about the management of uncertainty in relational data and probabilistic inference for queries expressed in first-order logic. The use of logic for representing and reasoning about probabilities has generated a lot interest and has led to new approaches for probabilistic inference. The third theme is represented by a vast community interested in extracting information from data. There is also burgeoning interest in programming languages for building probabilistic models which impinges on all three themes.  The workshop on Uncertainty In Computation brought together researchers working in the area of logic in computer science for whom probabilistic reasoning is central to their research.  The workshop was conceived by Prakash Panangaden, who enlisted Dan Suciu and Daniel Roy to co-organize and bring to bear their expertise in probabilistic databases and probabilistic programming, respectively. This was the first thematic workshop in the Fall 2016 Simons Institute program on Logical Structures in Computation. The subject matter of the workshop clearly overlapped with that of the Algorithms in Uncertainty program running simultaneously at the Simons Institute, and so Eli Upfal joined as a co-organizer, and helped plan the second half of the workshop, during which speakers from both programs gave talks. This workshop came at a time of rapid change: within computer science, traditional methods and systems designed to process information are increasingly required to cope with uncertainty. The sophistication of these probabilistic systems is also increasingly rapidly, leading to interest in programming languages and analyses to manage the complexity, especially associated with performing efficient probabilistic inference. The workshop was roughly organized with foundational topics on the first day, followed by a day around the topic of probabilistic databases, and another around the topic of probabilistic programming. The last two days saw a mix of talks on privacy, approximation algorithms and efficient inference algorithms. In summary, the workshop succeeded in generating invigorating dialogue on many topics in the broad area of probabilistic reasoning; this dialog occurred both through the formal talks and through informal interactions during breaks.  The workshop also made substantial strides towards the program goal of bridging the gap between logic/semantics and algorithms/complexity theory, notably by leveraging the presence of many broad-minded algorithms researchers in the companion program on Algorithms and Uncertainty, many of whom attended large portions of the workshop.
