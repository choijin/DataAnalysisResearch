<AbstractNarration>This project's goal is to reconstruct low latitude precipitation variability, from interannual to orbital time scales, to better understand hydrological responses to meso and large-scale atmosphere and ocean dynamics, external forcing, and feedbacks in the Yucatan Peninsula (YP). The mechanisms proposed for driving suborbital scale climate regimes in the region include ENSO, tropical cyclogenesis and shifts in precipitation associated with movements of the Inter Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), but available paleoclimate records are contradictory in terms of causal factors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project could potentially improve rainfall sensitivity estimates that would represent an empirical assessment independent of models. Current international climate model estimates of precipitation changes in the region by the end of this century vary over a significant range (-50% to +9% relative to today).  The project would also support an underrepresented minority early-career scientist and provide an early experience in research to several undergraduate students.  In addition, the research team will produce educational materials and exhibits for a general audience in Spanish and English language versions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research team will use speleothems from caves of the YP to reconstruct the character of hydrological variability in the region during the Holocene, the last glacial interval, marine isotope stage (MIS) 5, and MIS 7 to 9. In particular, the team will make quantitative reconstructions of precipitation changes based on delta-18Oxygen isotopes in stalagmites.  In combination with available lacustrine records from the YP, local speleothem records may provide a unique opportunity to quantitatively reconstruct the precipitation to evaporation balance in the region.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Quantitative high-resolution Holocene and Late Pleistocene precipitation records will: 1) provide quantitative estimates of past rainfall variability; 2) test the relationship between rainfall variability and shifts in mean ITCZ; 3) investigate the role of ENSO, tropical sea surface temperatures and cyclones in driving climate regimes in the YP; and 4) provide estimates of the sensitivity of tropical hydrology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The researchers will leverage an active collaboration with the Rio Secreto Reserve, a commercial enterprise that leads ~50,000 tourists through a large, partially submerged cave system on the east coast of the YP for education and outreach aims. The cave system of Rio Secreto represents an ideal cave system for reconstructing precipitation changes from stalagmites in the region extending approximately 300,000 years before the present.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Synchronous precipitation reduction in the American Tropics associated with Heinrich 2   We produced a new high-resolution stalagmite d18O record of Caribbean climate from the Yucatan Peninsula, Mexico, spanning the interval between 26.4 and 23.2 thousand years before present. Based on this 3000-year long d18O record, we produce a quantitative precipitation record for the last glacial, which few other studies have attempted.  The high resolution (annual to 40 yr-resolution) and dating accuracy of this stalagmite precipitation record allow us to examine the magnitude and character of Caribbean hydroclimate variability on interannual and multidecadal timescales during Dansgaard-Oeschger (D-O) events.  Three major findings and climate implications of this particular study are:  (i) evidence of Caribbean hydroclimate variability linked to ENSO and the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation during stadial 2;  (ii) evidence of synchronous and in-phase precipitation reduction across the American tropics, including the Caribbean and Amazon basin, during Heinrich event 2, in close agreement with state-of-the-art model simulation results of Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) slowdown;  (iii) quantitative evidence that supports that North Atlantic low latitude hydroclimate played a feedback role that responds to and drives AMOC variability during D-O events.      Testing the "tropical storm" hypothesis of Yucatan Peninsula climate variability during the Maya Terminal Classic Period  We produced another study that examines the "tropical storm" hypothesis proposed by Medina-Elizalde and Rohling (Science Magazine, 2012) that precipitation variability in the Yucatan Peninsula was associated with the frequency and intensity of Atlantic tropical storms during the Terminal Classic Period when the Maya civilization collapsed (AD. 750-950).     We evaluated the instrumental record, paleotempestology proxy records and paleoclimate proxy records of precipitation, in addition to Atlantic tropical storms and large-scale climate factors known to influence Atlantic tropical cyclogenesis, and found evidence in support of the "tropical storm" hypothesis. This hypothesis is alternative to the "ITCZ position" hypothesis proposed by Gerald Haug et al., (Science Magazine 2003) and helps explain precipitation regimes in locations beyond the known extent of ITCZ influence in the Yucatan Peninsula.   Important anthropological implications of this study are: (1) cultural expansion in the Puuc region during the Terminal Classic Period was favored by increased tropical storm activity, and (2) low tropical storm activity resulted in reduced regional precipitation and the depletion of freshwater reservoirs for domestic use (i.e. drinking and hygiene). This study concludes that future increases in the frequency and intensity of tropical storms could help mitigate groundwater reduction as drought becomes more prevalent in the Yucatan Peninsula due to global warming.   High-resolution speleothem record of precipitation from the Yucatan Peninsula spanning the Maya Preclassic Period  We produced a new 1434-year high-resolution U-Th dated stalagmite oxygen isotope record from the Yucatan Peninsula spanning the Preclassic and Early Classic Periods in Maya history (BCE 1037-CE 397). We also present the first characterization of the "amount effect" on the oxygen isotope composition of precipitation for the Yucatan Peninsula based on instrumental data.  The new stalagmite record provides the first quantitative precipitation estimates for this time interval of important cultural development in the region. The precipitation record reveals that during the Preclassic and Early Classic Periods the Yucatan Peninsula experienced: (i) twelve periods of anomalous precipitation reductions ranging between 28 and 55% below average conditions and with durations from 6 years to 31 years, and; (ii) a multi-century humid period with precipitation maxima of up to +65%.  We find that the Preclassic abandonment of major centers in the Mirador Basin was synchronous with two unprecedented multi-decadal events of severe precipitation reduction centered at CE 186 and 232. Finally, we provide evidence that centennial-scale precipitation variability in the Yucatan Peninsula during the Preclassic may be linked to shifts in rainfall fluxes from tropical cyclones. Long-term monitoring of drip water and groundwater stable isotopic variability in the Yucatan Peninsula: implications for recharge and speleothem rainfall reconstruction This research examines the variability of oxygen and hydrogen isotopic results from over 1200 groundwater, rainfall and drip water samples, collected at ~weekly time intervals, over three hydrological years at Rio Secreto Cave, in the Yucatan Peninsula, Mexico. We observed that drip annual isotopic variability reflects the isotopic variability of rainfall, with specific modulation and time lags, in support of paleo-rainfall reconstructions from stalagmites. We find evidence that suggests that conventional calculations of effective recharge underestimate the true recharge of this aquifer; thus with implications for the management of groundwater, the sole source of freshwater in the region.
