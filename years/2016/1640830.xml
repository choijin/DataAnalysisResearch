<AbstractNarration>The Cyberlearning and Future Learning Technologies Program funds efforts that will help envision the next generation of learning technologies and advance what we know about how people learn in technology-rich environments. Cyberlearning CAP projects build capacity for research and development in the field of Cyberlearning by improving technical infrastructure, human capital, and in other ways. The Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS) 2016 conference offers a rare professional opportunity for interdisciplinary students to converge and present cutting-edge research from the fields of artificial intelligence (AI), learning science, computer science, cognitive and learning sciences, psychology, and educational technology. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project supports travel for selected advanced graduate students to attend the doctoral consortium at the ITS 2016 conference in Croatia.  The conference has a special Young Research Track within the main conference for advanced graduate students. In this track a special session supports students to share their research with papers, posters, tutorials, workshops, and informal interactions with accomplished researchers. Students present their research ideas and receive feedback from researchers in the ITS community. An important goal of the doctoral consortium is to build the new generation of researchers in the forward-looking technical area of intelligent tutoring systems.</AbstractNarration>
