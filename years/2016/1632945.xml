<AbstractNarration>1632945&lt;br/&gt;Sanders, Kelly&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project proposes to develop the foundation for a potentially transformative and interdisciplinary approach to reduce the environmental and social impacts of the electric power sector through a dynamic market-based solution. There are two major research objectives: (1) understanding the fundamental drivers of variations in local power plant efficiency, and (2) developing a new approach to formulating a mathematical framework for power plant dispatching based on the spatio-temporal prioritization of local air quality conditions, water constraints, and anticipated levels of climate stress. Although modifying the "business as usual" dispatching protocol would likely result in higher direct costs to consumers, this project will analyze the benefits that could result in achieving air, water, and climate improvements and how this strategy compares in cost to other mitigation strategies. The proposed strategy is targeted to determine the best power plant fleet to meet demand reliably, while minimizing environmental and social consequences.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The societal impact of this research is potentially far-reaching, offering an innovative mathematical framework that may reduce the social and environmental costs of power generation without new power infrastructure investments. While many sustainability investments may disproportionally benefit populations that are able to pay a premium, the proposed framework offers a systems-scale intervention that strategically identifies regions that would benefit the most from reductions in local power generation. The geostatistical framework proposed can also be used more generally to inform the placement of new infrastructure investments and regions that could be targeted for new sustainability interventions based on greatest potential benefits.</AbstractNarration>
