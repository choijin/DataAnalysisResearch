<AbstractNarration>Atomic nuclei are composed of protons and neutrons and exhibit a variety of shapes. Some nuclei are spherical, while others have non-spherical shapes (similar to an onion, a zucchini, or a pear); the shape of the nucleus is unique for each isotope of each element.  Because we cannot take an ordinary photograph of the nucleus to investigate its shape and structure, other methods must be employed.  Through reactions at the University of Kentucky particle accelerator, neutrons are produced and then scattered from the nucleus.  In the process, the nucleus gains and subsequently releases energy that can be detected.  This information is used to deduce the shape of the nucleus and to gain an understanding of how the neutrons and protons in the nucleus contribute to its properties. Graduates of this research program receive hands-on experience with particle accelerator operation, nuclear science instrumentation, radiation detection, and data acquisition systems, and emerge as well-trained nuclear scientists who are capable of important contributions to our national needs.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broad-based research program at the University of Kentucky Accelerator Laboratory includes studies in several forefront areas: nuclear structure relevant to neutrinoless double-beta decay; nuclei undergoing shape transitions; deformed structures and shape coexistence; nuclear structure contributions in support of searches for fundamental symmetries.  In this research, the inelastic scattering of fast neutrons is used to examine low-energy collective nuclear excitations and to obtain information, e.g., level lifetimes and transition multipole mixing ratios for non-yrast states, which is inaccessible with other reactions.  Detailed investigations of stable nuclei complement advances in nuclear structure achieved by studying nuclei at extreme conditions of temperature and angular momentum or in regions far from stability.  Experimental innovations in the laboratory, e.g., the development of capabilities for measuring lifetimes in heavy nuclei, have played a key role in this research.  These advances, coupled with the unique capabilities of this laboratory for the production of high-quality, time-bunched monoenergetic neutrons, probe important questions and make meaningful contributions to our knowledge of nuclear structure.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The primary focus of the research program at the University of Kentucky Accelerator Laboratory (UKAL) is to characterize the structure of atomic nuclei. Because nuclei, composed of protons and neutrons, are about one hundred billion times smaller than objects visible to the human eye, we cannot take a photograph of a nucleus, so other methods must be employed to determine its features. Some nuclei are spherical, while others are oblate (like a Frisbee) or prolate (like a football) or exhibit more complex shapes.   The "microscope" we employ for the investigation of nuclear shapes is inelastic neutron scattering.  When a neutron collides with and scatters from a nucleus, some of its energy is transferred to the nucleus. The additional energy leaves the nucleus in an excited state (think of it like a small child given a sugary treat). The nucleus (just like the child) will not remain in an excited state, however, but will emit energy in the form of gamma rays to return to a lower-energy state. The energies of the gamma rays provide unique information about the identity and shape of the nucleus. This process is analogous to what occurs in neon signs. Electricity is used to provide energy to excite atoms; the atoms then emit visible light to return to a lower-energy state, the color of which is characteristic of the type of atom.  Inelastic neutron scattering techniques have been continuously refined over many years at UKAL to extract valuable information about the structure of nuclei.  One of these techniques, the Doppler-shift attenuation method, allows us to measure how long the excited states in nuclei exist, i.e., the nuclear half-lives of the states.  Just as the sound of a siren changes pitch as it moves toward or away from you (the frequency of the sound experiences a Doppler shift due to the speed of the moving vehicle), the gamma rays emitted from a nucleus in motion also experience a shift in energy.  The magnitude of these shifts can be related to the half-lives of the excited nuclear states from which the gamma rays are emitted, on the order of a quadrillionth of a second.  This unique capability at UKAL often provides information about the nucleus that others cannot obtain and permits us to learn about the shapes of nuclei in detail.   As noted above, nuclei may have various shapes; they can also exhibit shape transitions as the number of protons and neutrons change, and how these transitions occur is a point of current interest.  Some nuclei can even exhibit multiple shapes (known as "shape coexistence"). Our work using inelastic neutron scattering has lent insight into which nuclei present such phenomena and how such transitions and coexistence occur.  Additional projects that are particularly appropriate to the capabilities available at UKAL have been pursued, and collaborative research with colleagues from other institutions is emphasized.  The inelastic neutron scattering measurements at UKAL are frequently augmented by work at other laboratories, including radioactive decay spectroscopy at TRIUMF-ISAC at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver and photon scattering measurements at HI&gamma;S, the free-electron laser on the campus of Duke University operated by the Triangle Universities Nuclear Laboratory.  We have performed many experiments in this grant period; some of our scientific findings have already been published, and others will be presented in future publications.   Education at the undergraduate, graduate, and post-graduate levels is an integral component of all activities in our laboratory, and graduates are well-trained nuclear scientists capable of making important contributions in meeting our national needs.  Providing a supportive professional experience for students and postdoctoral scholars is an ongoing, vital element of our program, and these young scientists enthusiastically participate in experiments at other facilities, scientific conferences, and the activities of professional societies. Research at a small accelerator laboratory, such as UKAL, permits the daily mentoring of young colleagues.  For many years, the research facilities of our laboratory have been made available to students and faculty from non-doctoral-granting institutions, as well as scientists from other research universities, national laboratories, and nuclear-related industry.   Research performed in our laboratory has contributed directly to national interests, such as homeland security and the design of advanced nuclear reactors for generating electricity, and it will continue to do so.  These applications are well represented by the activities of government and industrial partners who utilize our research equipment.  In each case, the unique capabilities of our laboratory were important considerations in the selection of UKAL for collaborative work.
