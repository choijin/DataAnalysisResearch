<AbstractNarration>Flathead Valley Community College (FVCC) will implement "TeaM SCoRE Biotechnology: Teachers in Montana Strengthening the Continuity of Rural Education in Biotechnology" to increase the number of high school students who matriculate into FVCC's biotechnology program. Specific strategies are professional development workshops for high school teachers and hands-on biotechnology lab experiences for high school students, both done in collaboration with the PIs and FVCC students. Many of the high schools in the FVCC service area are rural and this project will contribute to educating the workforce in rural, northwestern Montana.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TeaM SCoRE Biotechnology will increase the awareness and the size of FVCC's biotechnology program by reaching out to high school students and teachers in rural northwestern Montana. It will also leverage the prior ATE at FVCC, "Strengthening Continuity of Rural Education in Biotechnology" (Award #1104075), and the work of the Community College Undergraduate Research Initiative (CCURI, Award #1524353 and #1118679). TeaM SCoRE will provide professional development workshops for high school teachers along with equipment and materials needed to implement biotechnology laboratory exercises, with the goal of preparing high school students for the FVCC biotechnology program. There is the potential to learn about effective practices in community college and high school collaborations, how those collaborations support student transitions and persistence in higher education, and what practices are most effective in engaging students in a rural environment. Project evaluation will focus on identifying the activities that best engage high school teachers, and how these projects improve the knowledge and skills of high school students. The dissemination plan will have a local focus, by working with local and regional media, and will take advantage of the regional and national ATE networks.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Over the past four years, the Flathead Valley Community College (FVCC) NSF-ATE Project TeaM SCoRE Biotechnology: Teachers in Montana Strengthening the Continuity of Rural Education (DUE award 1600954) has increased awareness and participation in biotechnology education in the Montana education community.  Through this project, secondary educators in Montana have participated in biotechnology "DNA Bootcamp" education workshops providing them with the knowledge, skills, and laboratory materials needed to implement biotechnology laboratory activities in high school and middle school classrooms.  During this period, the DNA workshops attracted 60 educators from 24 schools across Montana. The workshop participants added the biotechnology laboratory experiments to a wide range of high school science courses including biology, botany, forensic science, anatomy and physiology, and AP biology courses, impacting over 4000 students.  Further, due to the increased interest in biotechnology, four Montana high schools have partnered with FVCC to add dual-enrollment biotechnology courses to their curriculum.  In the 2019-20 academic year, 67 high school students completed the FVCC BIOB 105 Introduction to Biotechnology course.  Additional high schools are planning to offer the dual-enrollment BIOB 105 course, further strengthening the biotechnology education pipeline.  FVCC education students have also benefitted from this project by providing hands-on biotechnology lab demonstrations to local elementary and middle schools.  Since the start of this project, approximately 100 FVCC pre-service education majors have participated in developing and demonstrating lab activities for over 2000 students in 14 local schools.  Through the efforts of this project, the Montana education community served by FVCC has an increased awareness and expanded opportunities in biotechnology education providing access to careers in the growing biosciences industry.
