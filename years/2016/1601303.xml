<AbstractNarration>This project concerns questions at the intersection of algebra, geometry, and combinatorics.  The main areas to be explored are algebraic and symplectic geometry. Algebraic geometry is one of the oldest and most fundamental branches of mathematics. It has a wide range of applications from coding and data security to high energy physics and string theory. The principal objects of study are algebraic varieties, the sets of solutions of systems of algebraic equations in several variables; classical examples are ellipses, parabolas, and hyperbolas. Symplectic geometry is the modern framework of classical mechanics. It also plays an important role in modern quantum theories in physics. The main objects of study are symplectic manifolds, which are abstractions of the notion of phase space from physics. An important class of symplectic manifolds are algebraic varieties.  Through this connection, the research project explores interactions between algebraic geometry and symplectic geometry, with the goal of advancing understanding in both areas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A central theme of this project is to associate convex bodies, known as the Newton-Okounkov bodies, to algebraic varieties, encoding information about the geometry of the variety. It gives a general framework to extend the scope of convex geometry methods from toric varieties to general varieties. The project will explore applications of this area in symplectic geometry and other directions. Some fundamental topics to be addressed in the project are: (1) constructing Hamiltonian torus actions on general projective varieties; (2) a general approach to the "principle of independence of polarization" in geometric quantization for a large class of projective varieties; (3) establishing connections with tropical geometry and computational algebra; and (4) investigating the notion of entropy from the point of view of the theory of Newton-Okunkov bodies. Among the applications, the project is expected to contribute to mathematical physics and quantum mechanics, via geometric quantization. The project will also investigate connections with tropical geometry, a branch of algebraic geometry connected to convex optimization.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The problems in the project belonged to the areas of algebraic geometry, symplectic geometry and convex geometry.   Polynomials and their solution sets (called "algebraic varieties") play a major role in mathematics and all its areas of application such as physics, engineering and biology. A polynomial is given by its set of exponents and the corresponding coefficients. In the Newton polyhedra theory (whose origins go back to Sir Issac Newton) one observes that there is a connection between the geometry of the solution set of the polynomial and the convex polytope constructed from the set of exponents of the polynomial. This is a starting point for the so-called toric geometry, a well- known and extremely useful part of algebraic geometry. It has numerous applications ranging from high energy physics to computational algebra.   Symplectic geometry is the modern mathematical framework for classical mechanics (Newtonian mechanics) in physics. While in principle, laws of Newton can describe all classical phenomena in physics, for solving many physics problems one needs a more elaborate formulation. Symplectic geometry is the branch of geometry giving this mathematical formulation. Quantization theory is concerned with mathematical framework for quantum mechanics.     The main goal of the project was to vastly generalize the methods from toric geometry and provide far reaching applications in symplectic geometry. One of the main methods used was "deformations of algebraic varieties" which then naturally connects to computational algebra.   Main achievements of the project can be summarized as follows:  (1) Construction of "completely integrable systems" (or in physics terms, a complete system of conserved quantities) on algebraic varieties.   (2) An important result in geometric quantization, which is concerned with extending symplectic geometry to a mathematical framework for quantum mechanics.  (3)  A vast generalization of methods of computational algebra (called Grobner basis theory) from the usual polynomial ring. we initiated and founded basics of a new theory which we named ``Khovanskii basis theory’’.   (4) We proved a very general result on ``deformations" of arbitrary algebraic varieties which has far reaching application in construction of integrable systems/conserved quantities in symplectic geometry/classical mechanics.   The above were topic of several research papers published in relevant journals as well as three Ph.D. theses in mathematics. The outcomes of the project made significant advances in connecting two major branches of mathematics namely algebraic geometry and symplectic geometry and expected to have impact in quantum echanics, mirror symmetry on one hand and computational algebra on the other hand.
